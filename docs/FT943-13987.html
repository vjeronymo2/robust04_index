			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Confessions of a temporary sports writer: Jurek Martin, US Editor, has spent a month covering the World Cup. The task, he admits, has had a 'curiously restorative effect' Unless encased in a time capsule, you know that the World Cup of soccer stages its final tomorrow in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, near Los Angeles. You will also know who it is between (Italy and Brazil), how they got there and who their star players are. You will also have got the impression that the whole tournament, held for the first time in the US, has been quite a hit, on the field and off it. All this you will know, even if you do not care too much, because the World Cup has been inescapable for a month. As much as half the population of the world may watch the final on television, which is more than can be said for any other event, political, military or cultural, though the Apocalypse might get good ratings if properly previewed. What you cannot know, because it has never before been revealed other than to a select few, is its impact on one person. If all politics is local, all sports is personal, so here is a confession. I like sports. I watch quite a lot of them and play quite a few of them, with degrees of competence ranging from the sub-par (sadly not in the golfing sense) to the sub-human. But I know an oshi-dashi when I see one; I recognise when the in-field fly rule applies; and I have a well-thumbed collection of the very best sports writing from Lardner through Angell to Boswell. But soccer has never been kind to me, at least not since I was 10 and the second highest goalscorer on the RGS Worcester prep school team (whatever happened to Barry Dinsdale?). It has given me a broken nose and a metal pin which even now runs through the medial epicondyle of my left elbow, an impediment to the promising career of a slow bowler. For this and other metaphysical reasons I have not kicked a ball in anger or design for 30 years. Soccer had also begun to bore. The English game seemed brutal and the international game, as in the last World Cup, tactically sterile. The English stadiums were Victorian, the crowds ugly and the edge of partisanship, local and national, unpleasant. I found I did not care who won the FA Cup, the League Cup or the Nissan Chocolate Coloured Peanut Cup. I once saw Gazza in the flesh - he was played off the Highbury field in London in an under-21 international by someone called Cantona but compensated by head-butting another Frenchman - and could not understand what all the fuss was about. So my heart did not initially soar like a hawk when it was suggested by the power-that-be that because I was known to have sporting interests, and because the World Cup was coming my way, I might like to take it on. It did not exactly sink like a lead waistcoat, either, because a break from trade wars and 'gates' beyond number had its charms, but the mental jury was still out. For a start, if you are going to cover anything, from goldfish racing to the White House, homework is necessary, which is not easy to do in a country where soccer has not necessarily outdrawn goldfish racing since Pele retired. Of course, the game is played extensively, but not in places easily accessible without a guide to suburban schools and public parks and not at an instructive level, unless 'swarm soccer' (the term needs no explanation) by six-year-old girls is the wave of the future. Most countries are very insular about their sporting passions, none more so than the US, though Sports Illustrated, the bible, did devote a page and a picture to Brian Lara a few weeks back. Baseball has a 'World Series', but only teams from North America are eligible and only two years ago did a Canadian side actually win it (directly leading to the obliteration of the conservative government in Ottawa). There is no serious international competition for the US in American football and none in basketball, either. When the US hoops team lost to the Soviet Union in the 1972 Olympics, a hot war nearly ensued, only resolved in the Gorbachev era when the best US professionals were allowed to win gold medals by beating up teams from Senegal, or possibly the Ivory Coast. So, as seen from the western side of the Atlantic in the months preceding the Cup, the earnestness of the US organisational build-up was not much help. Apart from Diego Maradona, Lothar Matthaus and Roberto Baggio - all dutifully profiled - the players seemed indistinguishable, with the exception of the US team, which was profiled to death. In spite of this, the US did OK, making the second round and only losing by a goal to Brazil. But any sane person's appetite for profiles over the last month has been sated by those that accompanied the murder charges against OJ Simpson, the former gridiron great, all of which tended to prove that the qualities that make a fine football player do not necessarily relate, whatever the image-makers may try on, to real life. So what if Baggio is a Buddhist? There were, of course, engaging diversions. But the technical challenges of growing live grass in the enclosed Superdome in Pontiac, Michigan, can only have seriously fascinated ardent horticulturalists. Equally, there was an instant surge in the demand for computer and graphic designers able to depict how to trap, head and pass a ball, but that I knew already from dim memory. Occasional controversy bubbled out of the organisation. Journalists were asked to put down a Dollars 500 deposit for accreditation, which seemed un-American. Worse, we were asked to agree to security checks into our backgrounds, which seemed illegal. This requirement was only withdrawn in the face of the sort of US media opposition that could have resulted in no domestic coverage at all. Then, although the dreaded British fans were not coming, fear of Norwegians rendered crazy by reindeer meat past its sell-by date and of Koreans high on kimchee prompted the announcement that security fences would be placed around the perimeter of several venues, including RFK Stadium in Washington. Local opinion was outraged. Why not heads on stakes or a moat filled with piranhas, wrote Tony Kornheiser, the Washington Post's very funny columnist. Meanwhile, in the real world of the baseball diamond, Ripken was closing in on Gehrig's record for durability, Griffey was on a home-run pace to beat Maris, and there were rumours, finally confirmed, that the great Valenzuela would again be lured out of his Mexican fastness. No, life did not look promising for me, the World Cup or the power-that-be. Then it started. It began just a month ago in Soldier Field, Chicago, with Germany playing Bolivia, an unpromising match-up if ever there was one, but it was not half bad. Then it escalated - two, three, four games a day, a cornucopia. Games could be caught in the flesh, on the box, in English and Spanish (much better in Spanish, no language lessons necessary - the average length of commentator Andreas Cantor's shout of 'Goal]]]]]]]' was computed at 6.7 seconds). There was drama, there was bathos, high play and low play, upsets and routs, Maradona and the murder of a Colombian, red and yellow cards like confetti, orange crushes and cold beers, heat beyond all belief, happy fans and sad fans, painted fans and near naked fans but no violent ones, Arab princes in robes and Armanis and Dutchmen in horns presumably borrowed from elks or Norwegians. And there was no need to go to the office: the stadium - or the couch - was the office. It has, in fact, been enjoyable - so much so that it is pointless to ponder truly profound questions derived from the experience: such as whether professional soccer can take root in the US (maybe, but it will still take time); when Alan Rothenberg, the US organiser of the World Cup, runs for the senate from California as a Democrat (he probably will not have the time); or if a class action suit against adidas is possible for offences to fashion (goalkeeping jerseys are now universally disgusting. At least Jorge Campos, the Mexican macaw, designs his own). Some gentler observations are possible. One will be heretical to supporters of all the 24 qualifying teams and may even be antithetical to the whole ethos of all sports, but it was passed on by one veteran English soccer writer in a quiet passage of the Norway-Mexico game (ie, the first 85 minutes). To avoid being lynched on his return, his identity must be protected, but what he said was something like: 'It's wonderful England aren't playing. I don't have to write about the bloody players, I don't have to write about the bloody fans, I can sit back and enjoy the game and then I can write about what I actually saw.' (One of his colleagues, he said, was assigned to Ireland, the Anglo substitute.) He is right. Having only the most marginal of stakes in the outcome (how could anyone not root for an underdog, except possibly Greece, and then only because of the political banners sported by their supporters?) helps one appreciate the game. A Moroccan or Belgian is obliged to think that Mohammed Al Deayea of Saudi Arabia is the jammiest goalkeeper on earth, much as Brian Clough long ago dismissed Jan Tomaszewski of Poland. But the more-or-less neutral observer is free to conclude that no last line of defence leaps higher, faster and wider, or has better hands. Swedes must say that Romario's goal was not a patch on Kennet Anderssen's lovely one in their 1-1 draw, but the eunuch may see that only the Brazilian striker had the speed, balance and confidence to score in the way he did - and would do so again. Whole teams can be viewed either with dispassion or through the filter of presumed national characteristics, or a bit of both. There seems a joyful instinctiveness to close order Brazilian passing that is as rhythmic as a samba but is offset by an anarchic disregard for authority. There is a fierceness about the Bulgarian Stoichkov and the Romanian Hagi that reflects their Balkan heritage, but also a creativity and leadership that bespeak hope, unfortunately still rather confined to the football field. There was an ultimate sadness to the performances of Nigeria and Cameroon - so much talent, so little direction, that cannot entirely be divorced in the mind's eye from Africa's consuming problems. And if the Irish were just honest plodders, what else is new? But there have been moments of individual brilliance transcending the merely national or the analytical. Saeed Owairan's goal for Saudi Arabia against Belgium was story-book stuff for the ages, a few seconds of pure inspiration to be compared with anything wrought by Pele and Maradona at their most magical, or Bobby Thomson's immortal homer of 1953, or Desert Orchid's last great race. Like a birdie on the 18th hole after a round of rubbish, it was the sort of moment that keeps you wanting to play or watch again and again, even a third division match on a wet Wednesday in Preston. Honesty also requires a final confession: there is something about this sports writing which is a bit of a giggle. You can get away with free association, cliches and flights of fancy, all of which are ruthlessly - and usually correctly - excised from just about every other form of newspaper reporting (apart from restaurant reviews). You even dream about making Pseud's Corner in Private Eye, secure in the knowledge that you will never qualify any other way. Not, as the power-that-be should know, that it is anything other than a temporary addiction. Two forms of journalism probably constitute hell on earth - covering the White House full time and only writing about sports - but an intermittent binge on one or the other has a curiously restorative effect. So, if you want me after Pasadena, I'll be in Camden Yards in Baltimore watching Cal and the Orioles, or around the White House observing Bill and Hills fend off, or not, sliding tackles from mean Bob and the God squad's back four. For this alone, the World Cup deserves thanks. You know the rest, or will by tomorrow night.</p>

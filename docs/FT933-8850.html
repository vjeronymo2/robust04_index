			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Water bills 'hit poor hardest' POOR HOUSEHOLDS spend proportionately more on water and sewerage charges than the rich, and this would change little under the alternatives being considered for a new way of charging. This is a central conclusion of a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies for Ofwat, the water regulator, yesterday. At present Water charges are based on the rateable value of a property, a system which has to be replaced by the year 2000. This system is seen to have two principal weaknesses: single people living in large houses pay more for water than large families in small houses, and it provides no incentive for people to conserve water. The study looked at four alternative ways of charging: A licence fee under which all households pay the same. A licence fee would have to be set at around Pounds 152 a household to generate the present water industry revenues. But poorest households currently pay an average Pounds 127.49 for their water so they would lose out. By contrast the richest households pay just under Pounds 180 so they would be big gainers. Overall, 41 per cent of households would be better off. A charge based on the number of people in a household. Such a charge would have two elements, a Pounds 6 standing charge and Pounds 55.96 a person. Poorest households would pay nearly Pounds 127, almost exactly what they pay now, but the richest would pay about Pounds 144. The big gainers would be pensioners whose charges would fall from Pounds 146 to Pounds 105. A charge based on the type of property. Charges banded by house type showed poorest households paying nearly Pounds 140 and the richest Pounds 160, nearly Pounds 20 less than now. Pensioners would end up paying slightly more. A charge based on the volume of water consumed by each household. If meters were introduced to charge for water by volume, poor households, which include most pensioners, would gain slightly, so would the richest households because of the switch from their high rateable values. Middle-income houses, however, would end up paying more. The report does not say which system is preferable. But it points out that more households gain than lose on charges based on the number of people in the household. Mr Ian Byatt, the director-general of Ofwat, favours metering because Ofwat's studies have shown that people think water should be paid for by volume. He welcomed the report and said: 'It is interesting to see that a number of household types would gain from metering - including some on lower incomes. But I recognise that there would also be losers.' Each of the water companies in England and Wales can choose its own charging method. So far only one company, Anglian Water, has made a choice, in favour of metering.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections,  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    During a political forum held on 9 February promoted by the  Center for Latin American Studies, CELA, Ruben Blades,  presidential candidate for the Papa Egoro Movement, MPE, said  that the current government corruption in Panama fosters the  "imperial arrogance" of the international financial  institutions, IFI's, that for many years have disbursed  million-dollar loans that have only benefited their promoters.  He stressed that it is time to put an end to the dance of  millions received through international credits supposedly to  carry out social works, but which never reach the poor people.  He added that those who pay the foreign debt obtain juicy  profits in reward for their services. (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 10 Feb 94 p 3A)    At the same forum organized by CELA and sponsored by the EC,  MPE presidential candidate Ruben Blades said he favors revising  the Labor Code, privatizing public services, and the withdrawal  of U.S. troops from Panama. Blades criticized corruption in the  government and private sectors, and proposed the  decentralization of the state, the purging of public  administration, and independence of the Judicial Branch. On the  subject of the U.S. military presence, he said the 20 December  1989 Just Cause military operation was not a "liberation, but an  invasion." He added: "We have been clear. We believe in  (Panama's) total demilitarization. That means the withdrawal of  foreign troops from Panama." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA  in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 1)    Meanwhile, Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for  the  Civic Renewal Party, the Nationalist Republican Movement,  Molirena, and the National Renewal Movement, Morena, who was  also present at the forum rejected Blades' assertions, saying it  is "infamous" to say that the IFI's are paying commissions for  foreign debt negotiations. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 10  Feb 94 p 3A)    At the same forum, Carles said if elected he would resolve  transportation, crime, garbage collection, and housing problems  in the first 100 days of his administration. Carles described  the Just Cause military operation as a "liberation," and  announced that if elected president, on 9 May he will send three  delegates to Washington to seek a new relationship with the  United States. According to Carles, since Panama will remain  under "the Pentagon's umbrella," he will demand export quotas  for our agricultural and manufactured products in exchange for  the U.S. military presence beyond the year 2000. He also said  he will repress drug trafficking and money laundering, and that  he favors the privatization of public services. (Panama City LA  ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 1)    Presidential Candidate Carles traveled to Honduras on 14  February to visit industrial zones in that country. In a  communique, the coalition supporting Carles said that the  creation of industrial zones is being studied as a means to  reducing unemployment in Panama. (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 14 Feb p 2)    Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes Escoffery ruled  out the possibility of holding "a second round of elections"  after 8 May. He said the subject was discussed by the National  Commission for Revising the Electoral Code, but was not  approved. Christian Democratic Party Legislator Guillermo  Cochez has questioned Article 255 of the Electoral Code, which  according to him violates Article 172 of the Constitution, which  establishes that the president of the republic must be elected  "by a majority of votes," meaning that he must obtain 51 percent  of the votes. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 10  Feb p A-1)    On 16 February, the Electoral Tribunal will officially  announce its final decision on whether to reconsider the  acceptance of candidates for the Authentic Liberal Party who did  not present their documents in time to register for the upcoming  elections.

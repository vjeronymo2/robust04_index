			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Analysis" by Political Editor Fanny Wong] </F>   [Text] Much has been said from London and Beijing about  their good intentions of disclosing details of the 17 rounds of  secret negotiations over the future political structure of the  territory so that Hong Kong people can come to their own verdict  on who is right and who is wrong.    Britain delivered its version of the story on Thursday [24  February], although it was an abridged account. China followed  suit last night. Again, not surprisingly, it was a summarised  report.    If both governments were trying to be transparent on a  subject so vital to the future of Hong Kong people and win over  six million hearts and minds, their public relations exercises  have failed.    They claim they have no fear in sharing the details of the  highly secretive diplomatic exchanges. But what is presented is  no more than fragmented documentation of what has really  happened, with both sides concentrating on particulars that  serve their own interests.    Fresh in people's minds is the challenge by the Director of  the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  Lu Ping, for Governor Chris Patten to "disclose all the records  and documents". Certainly, from what was released last night,  Beijing has not been so generous.    And the timing was a public relations nightmare.    First hints that Beijing would publish its version of the  story came out after 5.30 pm [0930 GMT], indicating that the  17,000-character document would be out at 8 pm.    Not a word actually ran from the machine until 9.45 pm.    If China wants its case heard properly by the Hong Kong  community, it could have done better.    It now has to contend with a hasty appraisal, and a clever  offer by the British side last night to disclose even more of  its version by the week's end.</p>

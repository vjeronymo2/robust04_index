			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Commission drops case against Spalvins COURT proceedings against Mr John Spalvins and another former director of the Adsteam group have been dropped, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) said yesterday. The ASC instigated civil proceedings against Mr Spalvins, the former managing director of the ASC, and Mr Michael Kent, the former finance director, in relation to US share dealings. The ASC alleged that dealings authorised by the two men in the shares of Adelaide Steamship and David Jones, an Adsteam group affiliate, had resulted in a loss to David Jones. However, the commission said it had decided to drop the case following an agreement between the independent boards of the two companies that Adelaide Steamship will pay ADollars 3m (USDollars 2.3m) to David Jones. The commission said the agreement vindicated its decision to take legal action, and noted that there was no evidence that the two directors had benefited from the share deals. In a statement, Mr Spalvins said he was disappointed that the commission had thought it necessary to instigate proceedings, but pleased that the case had been dropped. Mr Spalvins was fired from the Adsteam group in 1990 after its bankers moved in to restructure the group's complex web of interlocking shareholdings and reschedule its debt. Mr Kent left the group last year. Southern Cross Airlines, the newly-formed operator, would buy the collapsed domestic carrier Compass Airlines through a scheme of arrangement or asset sale, said Mr Ian Ferrier, Compass's provisional liquidator, Reuters reports. He said that a binding agreement had been reached with Southern Cross, alleviating the need to obtain directions from Australia's Federal Court on the sale. 'The sale through a scheme of arrangement will achieve a greater return to creditors and members than a straight asset sale.'</p>

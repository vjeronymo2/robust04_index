			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND GENERIC DRUG-SWITCHING CASE REPORTED  </P> <P> Federal officials are investigating Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. for possible fraud  in connection with the approval of a generic version of the brand-name  anti-depressant drug Mellaril.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable officials said Thursday that both the Food and Drug  Administration and the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee are  looking into charges that Bolar fraudulently submitted the brand-name drug  instead of the generic version to a testing laboratory -- the second such  incident reported.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Error Reportedly Corrected  </P> <P> Federal officials said that the mistake was corrected at the time and that  Bolar's generic drug ultimately was tested and approved. The generic drug now  on the market, of the chemical thioridazine, is identical to Mellaril and is  safe and effective, they said.  </P> <P> "The stuff that's being marketed is the real thing," FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit  said.  </P> <P> Executives of Bolar, which is in Copiague, N. Y., could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> This is the second time this week that Bolar, one of the nation's largest  manufacturers of generic drugs, has become embroiled in the broadening federal  investigation of charges that some generics have been improperly tested and  marketed.  </P> <P> The FDA announced Monday that it will withdraw approval of Bolar's generic  equivalent of Dyazide, a leading blood pressure drug.  </P> <P> The investigation of Bolar's generic equivalent of Mellaril is based on a 1982  letter in which Pharmakinetics Laboratories Inc. of Baltimore told Bolar that  it believed Bolar had submitted Mellaril tablets instead of its own generic  equivalent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Determining Equivalency  </P> <P> It was Pharmakinetics' job to determine whether Bolar's generic was chemically  equivalent to Mellaril, which is manufactured by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp.  </P> <P> Pharmakinetics refused to comment specifically on its testing of Bolar's  generic drug. But it said in a statement:  </P> <P> "Seven years ago, in 1982, Pharmakinetics refused to conduct bio-equivalency  studies on tablets supplied to the company by a pharmaceutical manufacturer.  This refusal was based on the Pharmakinetics' personnel visual inspection of  four batches of test tablets, which caused then-company officials to question  the true identify of the product."  </P> <P> After it communicated its suspicions to the manufacturer, Pharmakinetics said,  the manufacturer supplied tablets that appeared to be "legitimate." Testing  proceeded, and the FDA ultimately approved the generic drug for marketing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Probe Uncovered Letter  </P> <P> Nesbit said that the FDA discovered Pharmakinetics' 1982 letter to Bolar as  part of its investigation of alleged fraud and bribery in the federal approval  process for low-cost generic drugs.  </P> <P> The other case of apparent drug-switching that has come to light in the current  investigation involved Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of Springfield, N. J. It has  voluntarily withdrawn its generic version of Dyazide after admitting that it  had substituted samples of the brand-name drug for its own in the approval  process.  </P></p>

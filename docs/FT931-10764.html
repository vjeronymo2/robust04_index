			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian incurs loss and sells Lees NORTHUMBRIAN Fine Foods, the biscuit and snacks maker, yesterday announced interim losses and said it had sold Lees of Scotland, the confectionery subsidiary which it bought in September 1991. Negotiations on the sale delayed publication of Northumbrian's results, due on Wednesday. The company's shares, which were suspended on the USM pending the announcement, resumed trading yesterday and fell 2p to 15p. For the half year to September 30 losses within Lees and price competition in the biscuit industry led to pre-tax losses at Northumbrian of Pounds 1.06m, compared with profits of Pounds 252,800 last time. Continuing activities went from profits of Pounds 252,800 to losses of Pounds 180,400, before exceptional costs of Pounds 215,000 on restructuring. Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 11.1m, because of the Lees contribution. Turnover on continuing activities increased 43 per cent to Pounds 6.99m. But margin pressure saw operating profits on continuing activities collapse from Pounds 353,600 to Pounds 37,600. Losses per share amounted to 2.96p (earnings 0.7p) and the interim dividend is being passed - 0.75p was paid previously but the final was omitted. Northumbrian paid Pounds 4.8m for Lees but the acquisition had performed poorly. The company admitted it paid too much for Lees, which made pre-tax losses of Pounds 262,200 in the six months to September 30. Lees was sold to the Claymore Group, a private company led by Mr Raymond Miquel, who chaired Arthur Bell before it was acquired by Guinness. Northumbrian will receive Pounds 1.15m in cash, payable between 1994 and 1998. The Lees brandnames will be retained by Northumbrian but Claymore has an option to acquire the brands for Pounds 1m. Most importantly for Northumbrian, Claymore will assume Lees's borrowings of nearly Pounds 3m. That will reduce Northumbrian's net debt to Pounds 4.4m, compared with Pounds 5.8m in March.</p>

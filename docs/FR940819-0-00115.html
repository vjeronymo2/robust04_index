			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;40.59(c), in the context of the discussion of the log book, the rule requires the notation of the ``quantified test result.'' The Department intends that this result be the numerical result displayed by the EBT. The term has the same meaning as the term ``result displayed on the EBT'' elsewhere in the rule (e.g., &sect;40.63(d)(1)(i)), and we are changing the term for the sake of consistency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification of Reference to NHTSA CPL in Definition of ``EBT'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Conforming Products List (CPL) for Evidential Breath Testing Devices (EBTs) includes both devices that meet September 1993 amendments to NHTSA's model specifications and devices that meet only the previous version of the model specifications. Only those devices on the CPL that meet the September 1993 model specifications may be used in the DOT alcohol testing program. Other devices on the CPL (those designated by an asterisk on the published CPL; see for instance 59 FR 18840 (April 20, 1994)) are not authorized for use in DOT-mandated alcohol testing programs. We are adding a reference to the September 1993 model specifications in the definition of ``EBT'' in &sect;40.3 to clarify this point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Split Sample Collection Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's procedures for collecting split samples for drug testing direct the collection site person to pour the urine from a collection container into one or two specimen bottles (depending on the collection method used). Some concern has been raised that this requirement would preclude the use of newer technologies that would subdivide a specimen into a primary and a split specimen without the necessity of a collection site person physically pouring the urine from one vessel into another. The Department does not intend its procedures to preclude the use of such methods or systems, as long as they result in primary and split samples that can be transmitted to laboratories and tested in ways that fully comply with Part 40 requirements. We have added language to this effect. The Department does not endorse drug testing products, and this change should not be construed as an endorsement of any particular product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In using whichever of the authorized methods of collecting split samples, the Department advises collectors that we believe the preferred practice is to have temperature strips attached to the collection container, which can reduce the time lag in checking the temperature and reduce the likelihood of errors or delays. The temperature should be read, of course, from the collection container itself, rather than from another bottle into which the split specimen may be poured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 40.25(f)(10)(ii)(C) of the Department's current regulation describes one of the alternative split specimen collection procedures. In this procedure, a single specimen bottle is used as the collection container. The collection site person pours 30 ml of the urine from this container into a second specimen bottle, which is then used as the primary specimen. The urine remaining in the collection container becomes the split specimen. When DHHS published its revised drug testing guidelines, however, DHHS provided that, in this situation, the collection site person would pour 15 ml of the urine into the second bottle, to be used as the split specimen, with 30 ml remaining in the collection container, to be used as the primary specimen. In other words, the DHHS procedure was the reverse of the one we issued in February. While there are advantages to the procedure in the current Part 40, we believe, on balance, that it is more important that the DHHS guidelines and Part 40 be consistent on this point. Consequently, we are changing our procedures to conform with those of DHHS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Change in Temperature Range <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

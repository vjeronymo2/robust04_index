			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Dirk </F> Hoeren; place and date not given: "Minister Kinkel: Somalia  Mission Was a Big Success"]    [Text] [Hoeren] Mr. Kinkel, the Bundeswehr Somalia mission  is coming to an end. Are you satisfied?    [Kinkel] A big compliment to our Bundeswehr: It did a great  job in the Beledweyne region, particularly in supplying the  population and providing other humanitarian aid.    Unfortunately, several things went wrong in the entire UN  mission in and around Mogadishu. In addition, the 4,900 Indian  troops for which we were to provide logistic support did not  turn up. But, in spite of this, our mission went ahead without  problems and was useful.    The United Nations had some problems enforcing the biggest  humanitarian action so far, with 32 nations participating, in  the way that was originally planned. But, one-sided criticism  of the United Nations does not help; what we need is  constructive assistance.    [Hoeren] How dangerous will the withdrawal of the Bundeswehr  be?    [Kinkel] Our troops have to march back through Mogadishu.  This does, of course, involve certain dangers. For our part,  we will do all we can to get our troops home safe and sound. I  expect the United Nations to guarantee a safe withdrawal.    [Hoeren] After Somalia, is there another mission waiting for  the Bundeswehr somewhere abroad?    [Kinkel] We quickly need the required change of the  constitution for Bundeswehr missions outside NATO territory.  Unfortunately, the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] is  still preventing this. I hope the constitutional court will  make a decision soon. After all, we may be faced with another  decision on Bundeswehr missions outside NATO territory.    [Hoeren] Some people say that Minister Kinkel is in favor of  blue helmet missions only because he wants Germany to get a vote  and a seat in the UN Security Council as quickly as possible....    [Kinkel] This is nonsense. There is no direct connection.  But, we must become fully capable of acting in foreign policy  matters.    We want to get into the Security Council because it makes  decisions that particularly concern us, as one of the most  populous and economically sound countries in Europe. So far, we  have had no opportunity to cooperate there, although we are the  third largest contributor to UN funds.</p>

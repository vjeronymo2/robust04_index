			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Yosemite National Park officials have decided that photographs hung in a park  gallery by artist Ken Marcus, a disciple of photographer Ansel Adams, had a  little too much nature in them. Eight of 10 photographs of nudes that Marcus, a  Playboy photographer, entered in a show at the park were removed from the  exhibit and replaced with his photographs of decaying park buildings.  "Remember, our visitors are mostly families," museum curator Dave Forgang said.  "We're a museum, yes, but we're right down the path from the Yosemite Visitors  Center." Marcus, 42, spent a month in the park's artists-in-residence program  and during his visit posed Hollywood models standing in the buff alongside  trees and in chilly mountain streams. Marcus said his photographs showed the  human form as part of nature. He called the censorship "ridiculous."  </P></p>

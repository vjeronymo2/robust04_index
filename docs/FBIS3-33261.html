The government has not reacted to these demands, which  according to the 3-80 Northern Front are requested as a  guarantee for personal security for the rearmed rebels.    Nevertheless, both sides will meet on Monday in Ciudad  Antigua, Nueva Segovia Department, to start negotiations that  will permit the guerrillas to demobilize.    The 3-80 Northern Front Command Council headed by Jose Angel  Talavera, known as Commander "Chacal," demands that once  demobilized the group be assigned the chief of police posts in  the municipalities of Quilali, El Jicaro, Murra, San Juan de Rio  Coco, Yali, Pantasmas, Ciudad Antigua, La Concordia, San Rafael  del Norte, El Cua, Mancotal, and Bocay.    The list of demands delivered to the government two days ago  contain other secondary demands, such as the demilitarization of  northern Nicaragua once the 3-80 Northern Front disarmament  process has moved ahead, leaving only 60 soldiers in the above  mentioned municipalities, except Murra. They also ask for the  creation of new settlements for development based in Quilali, a  disarmament schedule for the 3-80 Northern Front, and a special  fund for the area's economic reactivation and road rebuilding.    Included in the points are the creation of a commission  represented by the 3-80 Northern Front, the EPS [Sandinist  People's Army] General Staff, CIAV [International Commission of  Support and Verification]-OAS, and Cardinal Miguel Obando y  Bravo Verification, including Esteli Bishop Monsignor Juan  Abelardo Mata.    The 3-80 Northern Front, according to Commander "Esteban,"  who is second in command, dropped its previous political  demands, such as the dismissal of General Humberto Ortega and  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, because the 3-80 Northern  Front will restate these demands once they join the civilian  struggle.    Yesterday Gen. Humberto Ortega said that the EPS has not set  a hard and fast term for the 3-80 Northern Front to demobilize.  "We are not placing them up against the wall, but we hope the  talks do not take too long otherwise everything may turn sour,"  Ortega said. According to Ortega, the EPS will maintain the  truce and will allow the necessary conditions for the 3-80  Northern Front and the government to meet on Monday. The  meeting will be attended by Colonel Javier Carrion, second in  command in the EPS General Staff.    Ortega said that the Army is redeploying its troops to  wherever intermediate organizations (CIAV-OAS, Cardinal Miguel  Obando y Bravo Verification) suggest. The military leader agrees  with demilitarizing northern Nicaragua and said as peace is  achieved "there will be no need for the EPS to maintain its  troops in these areas. We are willing to maintain a minimum of  soldiers once the 3-80 Northern Front disarms. We will keep  enough troops to support the police in maintaining order,"  Ortega said.</p>

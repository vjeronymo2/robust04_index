			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON DANNEMEYER  </P> <P> Thank God for William Dannemeyer. Perhaps we still have a few members left in  Congress who aren't there to use drugs, line their pockets, womanize, hit the  bottle, and who otherwise don't give a damn about their country.  </P> <P> They only know how to spend our money and then scream for new taxes to bail  them out.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer has the down-to-earth morals and principles I thought were  completely gone from this Earth. He also has the guts to fight for them.  </P> <P> Keep it up Rep. Dannemeyer. We need a few dozen more just like you, then we  might return to a "Nation under God."  </P> <P> MRS. ROBERT BRETONNE  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

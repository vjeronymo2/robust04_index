The budget, which will be debated by Parliament early next  month, will also see a record jump in spending to improve  education and health care, where the percentage of the total  budget will rise from 16 to 29 per cent.    "This budget will allocate the greatest amount of money ever  to the provinces," said Deputy Commerce Minister Churin  Laksanawisit, a Democrat.    Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said the budget bill is  expected to go before Parliament on July 6 and is not expected  to be altered much.    The cabinet approved a balanced budget of Bt715 billion,  14.4  per cent more than the previous year, when spending was geared  to generate a small deficit.    The amount being allotted to the provinces in the 1995  budget  will be 58 per cent of the total, or Bt150.6 billion.    This is designed to be a serious and effective means of  promoting provincial development," Tharin said.    The amount aimed at solving water shortages is Bt37.2  billion; for increasing the income of farmers, Bt26.3 billion;  for industrial development in the provinces, Bt4 billion; and  for basic services in the provinces, Bt83.1 billion.

The education budget is Bt16 billion, while  public health is Bt60.67 billion.    The third largest item is for natural resources and  environmental development, accounting for eight per cent of the  total, compared to four per cent the previous year. The amount  is Bt19.9 billion, with the environment budget set at Bt6.7  billion.    The budget for solving traffic problems and rehabilitating  Bangkok will fall to two per cent from three per cent, or Bt9  billion.

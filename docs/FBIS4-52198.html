			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Disgraceful Resignation" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Shigeto Nagano Saturday  resigned as justice minister of Japan in face of strong  criticism at home and abroad, a news report from Tokyo said.    In an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper of Japan  May 3, he said the Pacific war started by Japanese imperialism  was not a war of aggression and that the Nanjing massacre was a  "hoax." His remarks whitewashing the blood-stained history of  aggression of Japanese imperialism and defending militarism  greatly startled and angered the Korean people, Asian countries  and the world public. The Japanese people and public circles  strongly demanded his resignation.    Upset by this, Nagano at a "press conference" Friday  "revoked" and "apologized" for what he had said and at last  could not help resigning.    Nagano is not the first to resign as cabinet minister after  letting out anachronistic militarist remarks.    The case is the same with former Education Minister Fujio  who  justified in 1986 the Japanese imperialists' invasion of Korea  and with former director general of the land administration  agency Okuno who said in 1988 that Japan had "no aggressive  design" during World War II. Nagano had to resign in ten days  after he was appointed justice minister in the Hata cabinet.    Through the shameful cases of those who resigned in face of  strong protest and criticism at home and abroad for their  attempt to revive the ghost of militarism, Japan must clearly  know that militarist revival will lead to its own grave.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> 4-A;  </P> <P> BUENA STRIKES FAST, STOPS WESTERN;  </P> <P> MAHER HITS HOME RUN IN FIRST INNING, PITCHES ONE-HITTER  </P> <P> Buena High School pitcher Kim Maher hit the fourth pitch of the game over the  center-field fence and made the run stand up to lead the Bulldogs to a 1-0  victory over Western in the Southern Section 4-A softball championship game  Friday at Mayfair Park in Lakewood.  </P> <P> Western (26-6), which upset top-seeded Hart and fourth-seeded Kennedy to make  the final, ran out of offense in the championship game, managing only one hit  off Maher (24-2).  </P> <P> Buena (28-2), on the other hand, had five hits off Western's freshman pitcher  Dawn Fowler (14-5), but the first hit was all the Bulldogs needed.  </P> <P> On a one-ball and two-strike count, Maher made solid contact, sending a long  fly ball over center fielder Tania Sieks' head.  </P> <P> "I thought it was going over the bleachers," Western Coach Debbie Harless said.  "I was in shock. That one pitch didn't drop. It was hanging up there and she  just poked it, but Fowler pitched great the rest of the way."  </P> <P> Fowler, 14, pitched a five-hitter with eight strikeouts and two walks.  </P> <P> Western played well defensively, particularly catcher Lisa Sciarrino, who  picked off a runner at first base in the first inning.  </P> <P> She also threw out a runner attempting to take third on an overthrow from  center field to second with one out and two runners on in the top of the  fourth.  </P> <P> In the fifth inning, Buena's Annette Bell reached on an error and advanced to  second on a wild pitch. Maher hit a high chopper over third. Misty Pinkerton  stretched overhead to snag the ball and prevent it from going into the  outfield, then caught Bell trying to advance to third in a rundown. Her sister,  shortstop Ivy Pinkerton, eventually tagged Bell out to retire the side.  </P> <P> "Defensively we played great," Harless said. "We just had a hard time hitting.  When you're not hitting, how do you win?"  </P> <P> No Western runners reached base through the first five innings. The Pioneers'  lone hit, Misty Pinkerton's bloop single to right-center, came in the sixth  with one out. Pinkerton advanced to second on Dena Petersen's sacrifice bunt,  bringing up leadoff hitter Sieks.  </P> <P> Sieks hit a sharp line drive back to Maher, who stabbed it for the final out of  the inning.  </P> <P> Western's final scoring opportunity came in the bottom of the seventh. Collene  Conahan reached on an error to start the inning. The next two batters grounded  out, with Conahan advancing to third.  </P> <P> But freshman Beth Queypo struck out, leaving Conahan on third to end the game.  </P> <P> Maher was not the best pitcher her players faced, Harless said. Nonetheless,  her dropping curve seemed to give the Western hitters trouble.  </P> <P> "She threw smart and hit the ball hard," Harless said.  </P> <P> The Pioneers were distracted earlier in the week when shortstop Ivy Pinkerton  temporarily quit the team because she wanted to attend Western's senior prom,  which was also Friday night.  </P> <P> But Harless said she was not going to blame the loss on the prom distraction.  </P> <P> "The girls were here to play. They played hard," she said. "I think they are  champions just for getting this far. We beat the number one-seeded team (Hart)  and Kennedy too.  </P></p>

Charles Lewis, convicted in April on cocaine  trafficking charges in the Virgin Islands, told federal investigators he  repeatedly used drugs with Barry at Lewis' hotel room, according to  Washington's WUSA-TV. Barry, who has vehemently denied ever using drugs, has  twice testified before a federal grand jury investigating the matter. He has  also repeatedly denied seeing any drugs or drug use in Lewis' hotel room. Barry  is vacationing at an undisclosed location.  </P></p>

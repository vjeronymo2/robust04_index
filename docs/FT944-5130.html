			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (4): Strains and pains of growth - Financial services are expanding rapidly On the surface, Thailand's financial markets seem to be developing at a similar cracking pace to the economy as a whole. Last month saw the official launch of a new bond market, while in its first two years of existence the Securities and Exchange Commission has tightened up considerably on regulation. It is now considering the introduction of a derivatives market. Thailand will certainly need such a rounded capital market to finance the development of its own infrastructure. It is also almost certainly desirable if the country is to continue to attract a reasonable share of overseas portfolio investment. In recent months foreign buyers have accounted for roughly a quarter of equity purchases on the stock market. Yet it would be asking too much for the development to proceed smoothly. Though market regulation has improved, practice does not always quite match up to theory, at least where corporate disclosure is concerned. The much trumpeted new bond market is unlikely to conduct a lot of business in the short term, because there is as yet no representative government benchmark bond. Uncertainty over the tax treatment of bond trades is also holding business back. The first day of trading saw turnover of only Baht 6.9m. Mr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, SEC deputy secretary-general, points to a number of achievements since his organisation was set up. 'We have brought the issues to the public in quite clear terms,' he says. Brokers seem to agree. 'It's not a revolution, but they are chipping away,' says Mr Graham Catterwell of Crosby Research. Bringing even a semblance of order to what was basically a market dominated by a few large players able to ramp particular issues is no mean feat for the SEC. It has meant taking on some powerful vested interests, but the SEC can claim two successes: It brought a series of prosecutions of people charged with artificial share-price manipulation. Though the court cases failed in the first instance to secure conviction, Mr Prasarn argues that the SEC's demonstration that it was serious has had a deterrent effect. 'There were bubble stocks, which rose despite unfavourable fundamentals. That's quite diminished,' he says. The SEC has tightened up on the rules concerning new issues. The old pattern was for large slices of a new issue to be made available cheaply to executives of the company concerned, the lead underwriters and other parties closely involved. Now at least 30 per cent of a new issue must be placed with retail investors and only 10 per cent may be set aside for preferential allocation. The SEC also requires new issuers to employ independent financial advisers who advise on the issue price and are jointly responsible with the company for the information in the prospectus. These measures have enhanced the integrity of the market, but brokers say more remains to be done. A particular bone of contention is the haphazard way in which company results are announced. Though the rules in this regard are quite clearly defined, in practice the process by which information is disseminated through the stock exchange to investors looks flawed. Normally only a headline earnings figure is revealed and it may be days or weeks before a fuller version becomes available. During that time, however, some investors will have been able to obtain details of the financial statement, and thereby put themselves in a privileged position vis-a-vis those who have not. The Stock Exchange of Thailand itself denies there is a problem. 'We have specific rules already about what companies have to disclose periodically,' says Mr Seri Chintanaseri, its president. The exchange has several ways of disseminating the information, including its daily bulletin while company announcements are also available in its library for inspection, he adds. As in other countries it is hard for the SEC to clamp down on insider dealing which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Evidence is hard to come by, but the SEC is trying to combat this by requiring potential insiders - individuals closely associated with a comany - fully to disclose their transactions. It also wants companies to make public statements when the movement in their share prices becomes excessive. Regulating Thailand's financial markets is made harder by the sheer pace of change. The SEC is keen to introduce a derivatives market, for example, because it will provide institutional investors with a means of hedging their positions and make the market as a whole more efficient. But a pre-requisite for the development of equity futures is an end to the ban on short-selling of shares. This in turn will weaken the SEC's ability to combat artificial manipulation of share prices. On the other hand, if the SEC delays too long, derivative markets for Thai financial products will simply develop offshore where they cannot be regulated. Already the cowboy image of the financial markets has receded as greater institutional presence adds to depth and liquidity. According to Mr Chaipat Sahasakul of the stock exchange, 70 per cent of the shares in issue are held by institutions, though small retail investors account for a similar percentage of the average daily turnover of Dollars 375m. The retail share is declining and the exchange has already noticed a reduction in price volatility. Foreign investors have made their presence felt, though there is still very little evidence that they are directly concerned with matters of corporate governance. Thai institutional involvement is growing as well, though mutual funds make up only between 5 and 10 per cent of equity market transactions. Brokers say they expect life insurance companies to start playing a larger role. The government's plan to set up a pensions scheme next year may also reduce the domination of the market by retail players. When that happens the regulators will be able to settle down to a more normal life. Meanwhile they are having to come of age at breakneck speed.</p>

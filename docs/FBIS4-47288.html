Yednak, Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy; UDC  666.762.2:[669.184.244.66:669.184.225.4]    [Abstract] Experiments were performed to determine the  factors affecting the service life of dinas linings in oxygen-  process steelmaking vessels. Laboratory specimens were formed  from 100% Ovruch quartzite on a laboratory hydraulic press  under 50 N/sq mm of pressure and fired at 1360, 1380, and  1420C for 6 h to effect different degrees of quartz  degeneration. Two different compositions, No. 1 and No. 2, were  formulated, depending on the additives used in the refractory  mass. For both compositions, density decreased while apparent  porosity and compressive strength increased as the firing  temperature increased. The greatest proportion of residual  quartz was found in the refractory compositions fired at  1360C, and dinas No. 1 had more residual quartz than dinas  No. 2. Therefore, dinas specimens fired at this temperature were  used throughout the rest of the study. Thermal resistance was  determined by measuring the thermal expansion coefficient,  thermal conductivity, bending strength, and shear modulus of the  dinas at temperatures ranging from 20 to 1300C. These data  showed that the thermal resistance of the specimens sharply  increased as the average temperature increased, especially at  temperatures above 600C. Moreover, dinas No. 1 had greater  thermal resistance than dinas No 2. The slag resistance of the  dinas specimens was then tested by drilling a hole through the  center of the cube-shaped test specimens, heating them in a  Kryptol furnace to a temperature of 1670C, and allowing  melted slag of typical composition to drip through the hole. The  same test was performed on specimens of DM industrial dinas and  MKV-72 mullite-fused alumina. The specimens were then  cross-sectioned and the area of slag impregnation measured.  Dinas No. 1 specimens had the greatest slag resistance;  25% of  their area was penetrated by the slag. Dinas No. 2 specimens had  30% of their area penetrated by slag, and the other  refractory  specimens were completely impregnated. Petrographic analysis of  specimen cross- sections revealed the presence of a distinct  three-zone structure consisting of a least-changed zone, a  transitional zone, and a reaction zone. The experimental data  were used by the Krasnogorov refractories plant to manufacture a  test batch of standard-size dinas lining materials, which were  tried out in the 0.3-t laboratory steelmaking vessel at the  Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy. Blowing time was 10-12 min.,  and the average post- blowing melt temperature ranged from 1600  to 1720C, averaging 1660C. In comparison with the DM  dinas and MKV-72 linings, dinas No. 1 proved to have the  greatest overall resistance to the erosive effects of the  blowing process in every respect and in nearly every section of  the vessel, except for the cylindrical part and the throat,  where the MKV-72 was better. The dinas lining also eroded more  uniformly than the other linings. The lining wear pattern was  typical for that of oxygen process steelmaking vessels.  Depending on process temperatures and times, the maximum wear  rate of dinas linings should be comparable to that of basic  refractory linings. It is anticipated that considerable  economies in raw materials and improvements in steel quality  will be realized by converting to acid refractory linings such  as dinas in oxygen- process steelmaking.

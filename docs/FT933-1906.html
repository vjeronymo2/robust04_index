			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Survey suggests country is split PRESIDENT Yeltsin's attempt to break the deadlock in Russia by suspending parliament threatens to split public opinion down the middle, to judge by the results of a recent nationwide survey. A public policy survey of Russians conducted in mid-summer showed that 52 per cent favoured presidential rule by decree - but 48 per cent were opposed. Furthermore, 48 per cent of Russians said they believed parliament should have the right to veto presidential decisions. The survey, based on interviews with 1,975 respondents in urban and rural areas from late June to late July, was conducted by the Russian Centre for Public Opinion Research. It showed Russians effectively split into four groups, none of them in the majority: 32 per cent supported rule by presidential decree without a veto by parliament; 28 per cent advocated legislative rule by parliament without presidential decrees; 20 per cent in effect favoured gridlock - a combination of presidential decrees and a parliamentary veto - and 20 per cent opposed both presidential decrees and parliamentary rule. Mr Yeltsin's call for an early parliamentary election is endorsed by 65 per cent of Russians. In addition, 44 per cent believe there should be an early presidential election. Here again, opinion splits four ways, for one-third of Russians would like elections soon for both president and parliament, and 28 per cent are against any election. A total of 84 per cent of Russians said they thought the Constitutional Court should resolve disputes between the president and parliament. Two-fifths would prefer Mr Yeltsin to be replaced by an old-style communist regime. Professor Richard Rose of Stathclyde University is directing a 15-nation study on east European public opinion.</p>

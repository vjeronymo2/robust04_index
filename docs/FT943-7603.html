			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: London After a glut of economic data last week, statistics are thin on the ground over the next few days and the gilt market is likely to be prey to international influences. For Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), the key question is why the gilt market failed to respond more positively last week, in the face of better-than-expected public sector borrowing requirement and inflation figures. One factor which may be responsible, according to Mr Richardson, is the fear that the the yield spread against German bunds is unattractive. Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks that Germany is likely to be the main influence on the gilts market. 'There is quite a lot of bund supply due over the next few weeks' she says. Ms Peters also expects investors to watch the US, where she thinks second-quarter gross domestic product figures will show an upward revision, to an annualised rate of 4.4 per cent. In Britain, the two main numbers are today's second quarter gross domestic product figures, which are expected to confirm the earlier estimate of 0.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth and Friday's monthly trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which will be scrutinised carefully for indications of manufacturers' pricing plans.</p>

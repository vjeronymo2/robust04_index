A BNS correspondent has seen videotapes of the interrogation  of the Russian soldier, Vasily Lugovoy, by Azerbaijani Interior  Minister Vagif Novruzov.    Lugovoy at interrogations in the Azerbaijani capital Baku on  Jan. 15 said he had met three female snipers near the  Juhhar-Bahmal village in the conflict region on Dec. 28 and 29.    The three woman soldiers had claimed they were from the  Baltics. Lugovoy says the women had talked with what he called a  Baltic accent and were either Lithuanians or Estonians.    Lugovoy, a former Soviet military, served as mercenary in a  pioneer unit of the Armenian troops. He said he had also  previously met both male and female wage soldiers from Estonia  and Lithuania. He said the Armenians valued highly the skills of  "mercenaries from the Baltics" and paid them in U.S. dollars.  Lugovoy said Russian soldiers earned 35,000 rubles a day in the  Karabakh fighting in late 1993.    The Russian soldier also said in the interrogation he had  been told that "two Baltic mercenaries" were granted the rank of  senior lieutenant of the Armenian Armed Forces and that they had  received a personal gun as gift from Armenia.    Lugovoy, born in 1960, formerly served in the Soviet troops  in Germany.    A BNS correspondent earlier has met with an artillery  officer  fighting on the Armenian side in Nagorno-Karabakh, who said he  came from Estonia. The man, however, was not ethnic Estonian.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO ASSIST IN SAVING CREEK BED  </P> <P> Residents hoping to preserve Santiago Creek's bed as a strip of parkland moved  a step closer to their goal this week when the City Council agreed to help  research ways to buy the land.  </P> <P> In response to public protest, the council rejected a developer's proposal  earlier this month to turn 37 acres of open space into a planned community and  shopping center.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Santiago Creek Greenway Committee, a coalition of  environmentalists and residents, have gained the council's support for an  alternate plan to turn the site of the former Santiago Golf Course into a  public park.  </P> <P> Howard DeCruyenaere told the council that millions of dollars are available to  "encourage stewardship and maintenance of streams by the community."  </P> <P> But, he added, municipal participation is needed to apply for grants through  the Parkland Preservation Bond Act, the Urban Stream Restoration Project of the  California Department of Water Resources and other sources.  </P> <P> Council members agreed to provide staff support and "petty cash" to hire a  consultant, on condition that Lynn Burnett, an official of the Burnett Ehline  Development Co. and part owner of the property, be included in all discussions.  </P> <P> The committee is scheduled to report its findings in 90 days.  </P> <P> While Burnett has not announced plans for the property, he has said he will  consider selling it to the residents and the city.

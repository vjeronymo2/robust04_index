			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Rubbing each other up the right way / A look at the evolving relationship between the Treasury and the Bank of England It has taken nearly five months. But yesterday Britain was able to see its new economic double act of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, in action together for the first time. The half percentage point cut in bank base rates to 5.5 per cent, their lowest level since 1972, was a surprise. Nearly 10 months had elapsed since the last base rate cut from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. The City had been pencilling in a cut on or shortly after next Tuesday's Budget to offset, perhaps only in part, the higher taxes still expected that day. The Treasury's gloss on the rate cut was significant. It marked a further step towards giving the Bank a greater share in monetary policymaking, a process that began after the debacle of sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16 last year. At the same time, it reaffirmed the impression fostered in recent weeks by Mr Clarke that independence for the Bank is not high on his agenda. In his statement announcing the cut, Mr Clarke made clear that the first official interest rate change since he moved into Number 11 Downing Street at the end of May was his decision. As has become customary since Black (or White) Wednesday, the change in borrowing costs was justified in the light of a range of monetary indicators. By saying that he had weighed these factors and taken 'full account of the measures' that he would announce in the Budget, the chancellor also gave a strong indication that there would be no further Budget Day rate cut to follow yesterday's reduction. But he also made clear that yesterday's move followed consultation with Mr George, and in that sense it is to be regarded as a joint decision of Bank governor and chancellor. Moreover, the timing of the decision had been left to the governor. Mr Clarke added that 'from now on the precise timing of interest rate changes will be a matter for the Bank to decide'. The contrast with the last base rate cut on January 26 could not have been greater. That cut, determined as yesterday through the announcement of a minimum lending rate by the Bank, clashed with an important auction of government gilt-edged stocks and was widely interpreted as a politically inspired move by a badly rattled prime minister. It prompted Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, to urge in his bitter resignation speech in June that the timing of future interest rate changes 'should never be used to offset some unfavourable political event'. Mr Lamont's words bore fruit yesterday. An important consideration for Mr Clarke and the Bank was to divorce the rate cut from day-to-day politics. An announcement amid the ballyhoo of Budget day next week would have undermined the government's insistence that its monetary policy must be consistent with keeping inflation, as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments, inside its 1 to 4 per cent target. What we cannot judge is who influenced whom: whether, for example, there was a complete meeting of minds between Mr Clarke and the governor on half a percentage point or whether the chancellor pushed for more and 'steady' Eddie, with his known loathing of inflation, resisted such a move. It was also difficult yesterday to pinpoint when the basic decision to cut rates was taken. Neither the Bank nor Treasury would elaborate on the history of the move although the Treasury announcement, which referred to last Thursday's news of a drop in average earnings growth to 3 per cent, suggested that chancellor and Bank governor decided late last week. However, the circumstances of the rate cut point to a high degree of trust between the chancellor and the governor. Mr George is clearly in the Budget 'loop' and knows more about the chancellor's plans for taxation than government ministers other than the prime minister and those in the Treasury. This is consistent with what we know about the relationship that has developed between the two men since Mr Clarke took over the Treasury at the end of May and Mr George moved up from deputy to governor of the Bank at the beginning of July. The chancellor has been generous in his praise of Mr George and the appreciation is reciprocated. Although Mr Clarke is garrulous and Mr George famously tight-lipped, the two men are more similar than they might appear. Both are roughly the same age (Mr George is 55, Mr Clarke 53). Both were educated at Cambridge University. Both have risen from humble backgrounds on the strength of their ability and drive. But the decision to involve the Bank more closely in interest rate policy has deeper roots than the good relationship between two successful men. It builds on the decision after sterling's exit from the ERM to set an official inflation target and make the Bank of England responsible for monitoring progress towards achieving this in its quarterly inflation report. Mr George, when named governor in January, was given a specific mandate 'to support the government in its determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'. Mr Clarke has gradually extended the bank's leash. The inflation report published at the beginning of this month was the first to be issued by the Bank without having to be submitted to advance scrutiny by the Treasury. So why did the Bank choose yesterday to cut rates? Mr George's explanation, to a BBC radio reporter yesterday, was that he 'couldn't see any particular reason why we should wait until after the Budget', given what he knew from of the chancellor's Budget plans and from recent statistics. It could all be a skilful move by the politically agile Mr Clarke to defuse anxieties ahead of his Budget. The Bank clearly regards yesterday's rate cut as part of a rebalancing of policy and not an easing. That suggests that the chancellor will announce a further fiscal tightening next week on top of the extra taxes totalling Pounds 6.7bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn for 1995-96 announced in Mr Lamont's last Budget in March. Although the Bank and Treasury insist that there is no 'ready reckoner' to measure a trade-off between changes in interest rates and fiscal policy, it would be logical to deduce from yesterday's modest rate cut that any tax increases to be announced next week will not be great. The forecasts of City pundits yesterday pointed towards net tax increases of Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn. However, Mr Clarke could still spring a nasty surprise. There are signs that the Bank believes the economy is growing more strongly than the 1.9 per cent annual rate disclosed in official figures last week. Its interest rate move yesterday has to be seen in the context of lags in the effect of monetary policy which mean that the Bank was acting with a view to conditions in the economy two years away rather than in the near future. In other respects, yesterday was a good day for the Bank to act. There were no statistical releases to cause market operators to suppose that specific indicators in future might trigger further rate changes. And Mr Clarke, by giving the Mr George a little more elbow room, may have taken some heat out of a longer-term policy issue - whether to give independence to the Bank. The bandwagon for having an independent but democratically accountable Bank of England is gathering pace. A top level panel of academics, City luminaries, former central bankers and erstwhile finance ministry officials from Britain and abroad last week proposed that the Bank should be free to set monetary policy independent of the Treasury. The influential House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee is expected to come up with the same message before Christmas. It is not a message that the parliamentarian Mr Clarke is particularly keen to heed. The more he gives the Bank greater operational responsibility now, the less he may have to cede real power later.</p>

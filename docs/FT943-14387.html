			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Austria poll set for October 9 The Austrian government has called general elections for October 9 and European elections will be held early next year, after Austria's January 1995 admission to the European Union, interior ministry officials said yesterday. Austria's coalition government, led by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democrats (SPOe) with their junior partner, the conservative People's Party (OeVP), was successful in securing a Yes vote in the referendum on EU membership in June, but the SPOe had fared badly in regional elections in March. Austria's far right Freedom Party (FPOe), led by Jorg Haider and one of the parties opposing EU membership, retained suport at regional elections, and Mr Haider has claimed that those who voted No in the referendum will support him in October. The Social Democratic party has ruled alone or in coalition since the early 1970s, and analysts argue that the SPOe coalition is likely to hold on after the election.</p>

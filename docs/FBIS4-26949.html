			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 27 (XINHUA) -- All 13 bonded zones or  free trade zones in the coastal areas are in operation,  attracting an increasing influx of foreign investment and  fast-growing export processing and transit trade, according to a  national forum on national bonded areas.    The latest report from the customs authorities shows that  China's bonded zones have played a vital role over the past few  years in the development of export processing, overseas trade  and services, such as packaging, transport, storage and  exhibition.    It also shows that up to the end of March this year, of the  5,813 firms approved to enter the zones, 3,404 are  foreign-funded ones, accounting for 59 percent of the total,  with an overall investment of 8.8 billion U.S. dollars including  3.4 billion of foreign investment.    Total exports and imports in the 13 zones have reached 1.74  billion U.S. dollars, including 100 million U.S. dollars in  transit trade; goods processed in the zones were worth 200  million U.S. dollars, including one billion U.S. dollar worth of  goods in bonded warehouses.    Starting in 1991, China has built tax-free zones in 13  coastal cities, covering a total of 17.62 sq km.    According to the forum, great achievements have been made  since the founding of bonded zones, but much remains to be done  to abide by international practices.    Customs authorities and relevant governmental departments  urged the streamlining of management institutions according to  the international rule of free trade and simplifying of customs  formalities.    The forum said that all goods can pass through the zones  freely except for those banned by the state. The storage of  commodities such as pesticides, fertilizer and refined oil is  encouraged.    It said that the internal tax levy system will also be  readjusted and foreign currency is allowed to circulate in the  bonded zones.</p>

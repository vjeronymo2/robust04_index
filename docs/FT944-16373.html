			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japanese takeover brings new stresses - Mitsubishi Bank will take advantage of its current monopoly The implications of yesterday's takeover of Nippon Trust Bank by Mitsubishi Bank go far beyond the narrow question of the viability of one small trust bank; it will produce new stresses in Japan's fragile and overcrowded banking sector. In rescuing the ailing bank, Mitsubishi, already one of Japan's strongest financial institutions, but limited by law in its scope, becomes the first to be permitted to conduct the full range of trust banking operations. Although Mitsubishi has paid a high price for its entrance into this lucrative market, its competitors are concerned that the move gives it an unfair competitive advantage, and are likely to step up pressure on the regulators to open up the financial markets further. For years, the labyrinth of regulations in Japan's financial sector firmly restricted the activities of the participants. City banks, large commercial lenders such as Mitsubishi, were allowed to conduct the mainstream business of wholesale and retail borrowing and lending. Trust banks ran trust banking operations such as pension fund management; long-term credit banks engaged in investment finance; and brokers were restricted to underwriting and trading securities. But in the past decade, under pressure at home and abroad to deregulate, the ministry of finance has pursued a gradual policy of removing the partition walls. All banks are now permitted to run limited broking businesses, brokers can operate banking-style deposit accounts, and last year the ministry allowed city banks to establish trust bank subsidiaries. So far these measures have been cautious in scope. Banks may conduct only limited securities business, and the trust banks' deregulation does not allow city banks to conduct the most profitable aspect of their business, pension fund management and loan trusts. These restrictions were designed to protect the existing companies' core business. But yesterday's move by Mitsubishi, sanctioned by the finance ministry, drives a coach and horses through the rules, enabling the bank to conduct the full range of trust business, and giving it a substantial advantage both over rival city banks and the existing trust banks. Mitsubishi has paid a substantial price for what amounts to a trust banking licence. The Y200bn (Dollars 1.98bn) injection of capital is well above the target company's market capitalisation of Y107bn. The return is just 50 per cent of the future profits. Those profits are unlikely to amount to much in the next few years. Declared non-performing loans at the bank are around Y130bn, but the true value of bad assets including restructured loans is closer to Y500bn (28 per cent of the total loan book), and substantial provisioning is therefore likely to weaken profitability further. Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said Mitsubishi is calculating that the longer term benefits of a trust bank operation will outweigh the considerable cost of the takeover. 'In the short-term, it is an expensive purchase, with little prospect of any early significant return from Nippon Trust itself. But Mitsubishi is counting on its being well-positioned to compete in the fund management market, especially in the pensions area . . . .' The stock market appeared to share that view. Mitsubishi's shares rose by nearly 3 per cent as investors anticipated the longer-term advantages. But the key to the bank's success may depend on how long it has the field to itself. City banks and trust banks were both yesterday reported to be upset at the decision to approve the takeover. Trust banks had lobbied hard to prevent the big commercial banks from encroaching on their territory and the ministry's decision represents a significant blow to their market position. The deal is likely to place further strains on the relationship between the city bank and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, a sister bank in the giant Mitsubishi keiretsu, one of Japan's largest corporate groupings. Some analysts expected the finance ministry, under pressure from other banks, to hasten a wider deregulation of the banking sector. But officials were adamant that the decision was a special response to a particular crisis at Nippon Trust. They pointed to parallels with the takeover of Cosmo Securities, a medium-sized broker last year by Daiwa Bank. No other banks have subsequently been permitted to operate the full range of broking activities, and the ministry has no plans to allow them. But it will be the chronic fragility of the entire banking sector that will ultimately decide the pace of further liberalisation. Although Nippon Trust was clearly the weakest of the trust banks it was by no means alone in having a huge portfolio of bad debts. The likely solution lies in further consolidation of the industry. That will, in time, eliminate the demarcations of the financial markets faster than the ministry plans. For the moment, though, Mitsubishi is set to exploit its monopoly privilege.</p>

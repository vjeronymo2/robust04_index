			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe launches Spanish contract THE LATEST round in the battle for futures business between London and other continental European financial centres gets under way today as Liffe launches a Spanish bond futures contract. Liffe claimed yesterday that its new contract, based on 10-year Spanish government bonds, would not take business away from Meff, the Spanish financial futures and options exchange, but would attract new business from international investors. 'There is a much bigger market there than is being realised by Meff's contract,' said Mr Roger Barton, head of business development. However, Meff has claimed that Liffe's contract will split liquidity between the two markets, and has cut its fees in an attempt to lift its share of bond futures trading. The futures contract is likely to be attractive to traders given the high volatility in the market, which at 7 per cent has been the highest of any leading bond market over the past year in terms of 50-day price movements. Spanish bonds are expected to outperform in local currency terms once German interest rates fall. The competition for Spanish bond futures business comes as Liffe has established a 50 per cent to 60 per cent share of trading in Italian bond futures and a 60 per cent to 70 per cent share of German contracts. Its share of medium-term German bond (or Bobl) futures is far smaller.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / PM deals blow to Post Office sale The prime minister has ordered Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to redraft plans for privatisation of the Post Office. The move is another setback for politicians and industrialists who want to see the organisation sold. Whitehall officials say Mr John Major has rejected an early draft of a green paper by the Department of Trade and Industry on the privatisation of Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the parcels arm. The draft, which was due to be published in the next few weeks, is understood to have leaned heavily in favour of Mr Heseltine's plans to privatise 51 per cent of the Post Office, leaving the remainder of the stock in government hands. But, according to one Whitehall official, Mr Major has told Mr Heseltine that the document does not give sufficient weight to the option of leaving the Post Office completely in the public domain - an option backed by many Tory backbenchers. A Whitehall official said yesterday: 'The hope is that that the green paper would have something in it other than the privatisation option. A green paper is a broad-ranging document and needs to look at absolutely everything.' The setback to Mr Heseltine's plans comes amid growing uncertainty among Tory MPs about whether the Post Office should be sold. A number of Conservative MPs believe the organisation has a crucial social function and that its privatisation would be highly unpopular with the public. But rightwing MPs - who are backed on this issue by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor - are urging the government to press ahead with privatisation. Government business managers have warned ministers that as a result of these differences it may be difficult to guarantee the passage of a privatisation bill through the next session of parliament. Mr Major's decision to block the green paper is the latest blow to Mr Heseltine's plans for the Post Office. Originally, Mr Heseltine had wanted to privatise the entire Royal Mail and Parcelforce but was urged to accept only a partial sell-off. Mr Heseltine has since made a range of concessions to backbench MPs, including a commitment to universal tariffs and the exemption of stamps from value added tax.</p>

He told TANJUG Wednesday prior to leaving for Zagreb that  people wished normalization of relations with all Yugoslavia's  neighbors, especially with Croatia because the situation there  was most complex. Knezevic stressed that Croatia behaved  differently on the international scene as opposed to bilateral  contacts.    The Yugoslav office in Zagreb was opened on the basis of an  agreement the foreign ministers of F.R.Y. and Croatia signed on  January 19 this year in Geneva. The office of Croatia in  Belgrade was to be opened soon.    Speaking about the first round of talks between the Republic  of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) and Croatia in Zagreb on Tuesday,  Knezevic said that normalization between Knin and Zagreb would  surely contribute also to normalization of relations between  Belgrade and Zagreb.    "It is very important that the talks are to be continued,"  assessed Knezevic and emphasized that "normalization and  political solutions of problems between the R.S.K. and Croatia  would be one of the decisive factors for pacifying the situation  in the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia."    The problem of the R.S.K. was one of the pressing issues in  settling of the Yugoslav crisis. The R.S.K. was proclaimed in  1991 in parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia with  predominantly Serb population in response to Croatia's forcible  secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and reducing the  status of the Serb people from a constituent people to one of a  national minority in the new state.    The subsequent armed clashes between the R.S.K. Serbs and  the  Zagreb authorities, which do not recognize the R.S.K., resulted  in a decision to declare the R.S.K. a U.N.-Protected Area (UNPA)  in the spring of 1992 until a political settlement was reached.</p>

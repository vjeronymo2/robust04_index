			<p>BFN     [Text] The Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] has proved through its  recent summit in Tunis its maturity at all levels of  responsibility. This is what the Foreign Affairs Minister  Mohamed Salah Dembri said in an exclusive statement to EL MASSA  newspaper following the sixth summit of the AMU states.    Mr. Dembri said that political will has been mostly  premature, noting that realism meant that world transformations  should be taken into account and that these transformations will  not allow for any individual adventure from now on. He added  that it was imperative that we organize ourselves as an integral  entity and hold dialogue with the others in order to become a  partner either in the North- South direction, or within the  framework of the Mediterranean states, or within Arab unity, or  in the South-South direction.    The minister for foreign affairs spoke about the  Algerian-Syrian call for the holding of a meeting of Arab  Mediterranean states. He said that the call aimed at stressing  the need for starting consultations between these countries so  that we could agree at least on what to be said in the  Mediterranean forum.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ustin Gritsenko: "Black Sea Fleet Talks: Leonid </F> Kravchuk Retreats But Does Not Give Up"]    [Text] It has become possible in the course of the ongoing  "Black Sea Fleet division" talks to produce a draft agreement  under which Russian ships would after all be deployed in  Sevastopol. Kiev, according to Russian Ambassador to Ukraine  Leonid Smolyakov, agrees to this in principle. But Leonid  Kravchuk, forced to make concessions that do not add luster to  his image as a "patriot," put forward a new slogan in the course  of his Zhitomir tour. In his words, "instead of nuclear  missiles Ukraine intends to have high- precision arms."    The latest round of Black Sea Fleet talks discussed the  division of not only the bases but also the shore-based  infrastructure. By the start of the discussions that moved from  Sevastopol to Kiev, the experts did a certain amount of work:  according to Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the  Russian Navy, the parameters in accordance with which the  division of ships will take place "have been basically  determined" already by both the experts and the economists.  Members of the delegations were briefed on the results of this  work. Some, of course, had more ideas "up their sleeve,"  hearing which Adm. Gromov thinks "different points of view on  separate questions cannot be ruled out." Agreement on  Sevastopol, though, was on the whole sewn up. In the program of  further talks is the division of the remaining naval bases along  the Crimean coast.    Considering perhaps that the talks on the Black Sea Fleet  would hardly be over by 26 June (election date), Kravchuk  avoided serious statements about dividing the fleet. But on the  other hand, he told the officers and cadets of the Zhitomir Air  Defense Radio Electronics Higher Military School about new  prospects of boosting the republic's military might. He pointed  out that in Ukraine (as also "both in Russia, and in the United  States") "scientific exploration" is under way to develop some  sort of "high-precision weapon with assigned parameters."  Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk] did not go into details, hinting  vaguely that this weapon "is capable of engaging installations  that carry danger, and of protecting from weapons of mass  destruction, nuclear weapons included." It is this secret  weapon that Ukraine intends to add to its arsenal "instead of  the nuclear missiles that are being destroyed." Interestingly,  Kravchuk divulged this "military secret" attesting to the  president's tireless care about the army and the  military-industrial complex precisely in the home stretch of the  election race and precisely before the grateful audience of a  military school. In the course of the Zhitomir tour, however,  he also found what to say to the workers of a woodworking  combine (prospects of the sector's growth), and to those who  work in agriculture (also prospects, but those concerning  agriculture). Should Kravchuk continue to concentrate on similar  problems (avoiding the less than advantageous subject of the  Black Sea Fleet) there may appear a chance for Russia and  Ukraine finally to agree about the fleet.</p>

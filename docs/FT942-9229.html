			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: De La Rue/Portals Even before the recent run-up in Portals' shares, De La Rue stood little chance of winning the paper maker on the cheap. Portals enjoys a strong market position in bank note paper, backed up by anti-fraud technology. With a good record of cash generation, an ungeared balance sheet and dividend cover of two times, there is no question of financial distress. While efforts at diversification have been at times puzzling, Portals' management has made a decent fist of steering the group through recession. The question is whether De La Rue's industrial logic is compelling enough to justify the full price Portals' shareholders would rightly demand. Integrating printing and papermaking would give De La Rue access to Portals' technology and a list of customers broader than its own. That could open opportunities for selling machinery or other services. But such vertical integration carries risks. If De La Rue took all of Portals' paper production it would lose the flexibility to pick and choose its suppliers. If Portals was still selling to all-comers, customers might resent it being swallowed up. If De La Rue makes a full bid, these arguments will doubtless get a full airing. If the logic is so persuasive, though, De La Rue will have to explain why it overlooked the synergies until now. The group has been looking for acquisitions and holding net cash since its rights issue in 1991. This time last year Portals was trading at little more than half yesterday's closing price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Press Center of the Ministry of </F> Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine under  the "Here and There" rubric: "An Ecological Program for  Polissya"]    [Text] A difficult ecological situation has developed in  Polissya as a result of large-scale drainage projects (on an  area of more than 2.5 million hectares). It was complicated  further by the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station.  In total, about 5.9 million hectares of land have been polluted,  of which 3 million hectares are farmland.    A zone of adverse ecological influence extending along a  radius of two to three kilometers is immediately formed around  the drained territories. This zone exceeds the drained area by  factors of four or five. On 0.25 million hectares of sandy soil,  the yields of potatoes fell by 18 percent; of flax, by 22  percent; and of winter rye, by 27 percent.    The level of subsurface water in summer came down by almost  one meter. One-half of the small rivers are tied to land  reclamation systems, which has brought about the internal  redistribution of their runoff; at times, water becomes unfit  for use.    The number of typical marshland plant species declined by  more than one-half. The area of cranberry bogs fell from 93,000  to 23,000 hectares. The environment for the reproduction of wild  fauna was disrupted; the area of hunting grounds was reduced.  The fish catch dropped by a factor of almost five. Forests are  drying up over a considerable area.    For this reason, taking into consideration these unfavorable  changes in the environment of the region, the Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine has  prepared and submitted for coordination the draft decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers "On Developing and Implementing a Program  of Priority Measures for the Abatement of the Unfavorable Effect  of Land Reclamation by Drainage and Radioactive Contamination on  the Ecological Condition of Polissya."    Within the framework of this program, it is envisaged to  suspend the draining of marshes and forests in the territory of  Polissya and to switch to the technical retrofitting of drainage  systems with a view to improving their effectiveness.

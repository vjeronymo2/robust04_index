			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The State Is Obligated To Settle Up </F> with the Village"]    [Text] The volume of industrial production in 1993  decreased in comparison with the previous year by 14.5 percent.  This includes the 16.9 percent decrease in December. In the  sectors geared toward the consumer market, the reduction in the  output of industrial products amounted to 7.4 percent.    At defense complex enterprises which are implementing  conversion, the decline in production in comparison with 1992  was 40 percent.    The non-payment crisis led in December to the total or  partial shutdown of 58 of the oblast's industrial enterprises.    There is a complicated situation in the agroindustrial  complex. An increase in the production of individual types of  agricultural products was provided in the past year solely  through private subsidiary plots, while, in the public sector,  the decline is continuing to increase. Cattle raising is being  curtailed. Enhancement of the land's fertility has been stopped.  The extent of deterioration of the machine and tractor fleet  amounts to 80 percent.    The program for the revitalization of the Russian  countryside  is not being carried out. New housing starts in the village have  been cut back and there has been curtailment of the construction  of cattle-raising accomodations and cultural and consumer  facilities.</p>

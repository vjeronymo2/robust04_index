			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Smith takes leadership campaign to regions MR JOHN SMITH will begin to take his Labour leadership bid around the country next week as almost all observers now concede that, barring unforeseen mishaps, he is assured of victory in July over Mr Bryan Gould. Mr Robin Cook, his campaign manager, yesterday ducked the charge of premature triumphalism as he released details of regional visits and speaking engagements. Yet when questioned on the state of the campaign, Mr Cook expressed easy confidence that his candidate would win comfortably in all three sections of the electoral college. He said that Mr Smith could expect at least 88 per cent of the trade-union vote, which represents 40 per cent of the college. He could also expect up to 180 of the 269 parliamentary votes - 30 per cent of the college - and soundings in the constituencies suggested that support was 'very healthy'. In Mr Gould's camp, there are clear indications that attention is firmly focused on the much closer deputy leadership race, which Mr Gould is also contesting. Suggestions that Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, is making ground among the unions are provoking highly varied interpretations of voters' intentions. While supporters of the favourite in the deputy race, Mrs Margaret Beckett, insist that all scenarios favour her chances, others claim resistance is mounting among unions and constituencies to the so-called 'dream ticket' of Smith and Beckett. A Gould supporter said that if Mr Gould was knocked out in the first round, Mr Prescott would defeat Mrs Beckett in the run-off. However, if Mr Gould came first or second his appeal as an imaginative, southern England MP would ensure victory over either of his rivals in the run-off. Mr Prescott's team said Mr Gould's candidature for the leadership would undermine his ability to gather sufficient votes for deputy as few would wish to vote for him for both posts. A debate over Labour's controversial Clause Four - which commits the party to a policy of nationalisation - would be a distraction that would divert the party from addressing the causes of its election defeat, Mr David Blunkett, Mr Gould's campaign manager, said.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week Stachyurus praecox The flowers of this remarkable Japanese shrub look like little bead curtains hanging from the bare branches in stiff, three inch long, light yellow trails. These upside down spikes (strictly racemes for the little flowers have very short stalks) are formed in the autumn and remain fully exposed all the winter until the flowers actually open some time in February or March, yet they rarely get damaged and the bush itself is perfectly hardy. It has large, broadly lance-shaped leaves which are pleasant without being remarkable. It likes peat but does not seem to object to some lime in the soil</p>

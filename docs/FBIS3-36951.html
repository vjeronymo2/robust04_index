			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Georgian parliament has appealed to the Russian  Federal Assembly over the latest outbreak of the Georgian-Abkhaz  conflict.    It has emerged that some Russian parliamentarians link the  normalization of Georgian-Russian interstate relations to the  settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Owing to this,  they, together with Abkhaz separatists, went as far as demanding  that President Boris Yeltsin's offical visit to Tbilisi should  have been canceled. The historic visit did go ahead and a  package of interstate agreements was signed, which answers the  (?vital strategic) interests of our peoples.    As if to avenge the frustration of their plans, Abkhaz  separatists, actively supported by North Caucasian militants and  other mercenaries from the Russian Federation, launched a new  punitive action against the Georgian population still remaining  in Gali rayon, in effect, completing the ethnic cleansing and  genocide of the Georgians in Abkhazia.    All this is happening at a time when, according to the  Geneva  accords, a stage-by-stage return of the refugees and displaced  persons to Abkhazia was due to start on 10 February, while on 8  February, a Georgian delegation, as part of a joint group of  experts, began talks in Moscow on Abkhazia's future status.    We call on you, says the appeal, to go deep in understanding  the essence of the tragedy unfolding in Georgia, to assess in  time the threat posed by aggressive separatism not only to our  country but also to all multi-ethnic states, to take necessary  measures, so that the Russian Federation can perform the  function of guarantor and mediator in the peaceful settlement of  the conflict, to ensure the inviolability of the state border  between Russia and Georgia and prevent armed formations from  crossing it from Russian territory into Georgia.    We also call on you to start an interparliamentary dialogue,  since our supreme legislative bodies have the responsibility for  choosing the right political course aimed at saving our peoples  from the horrors of fratricidal war, destruction and chaos.</p>

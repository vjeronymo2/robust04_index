			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 4-A;  </P> <P> DANA HILLS SETS SAIL FOR SOUTH COAST FINAL  </P> <P> The championship dreams of Mission Viejo and Dana Hills high schools were  blowing in the wind Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Of the 26 shots attempted by both teams in the girls' 4-A semifinal soccer  match, only three were taken into the breeze whipping in from the west on Dana  Hills' field.  </P> <P> But one of those shots, by forward Amy Kroeger 30 minutes into the second half,  was the difference as Dana Hills (22-3-3) held on to defeat Mission Viejo, 2-1,  and advance to the 4-A championship match against sixth-ranked El Toro (20-3-3)  at 6 p.m. Friday at Gahr High School in Cerritos. The teams were co-champions  of the South Coast League.  </P> <P> El Toro defeated South Torrance, 2-1, in the other semifinal Tuesday.  </P> <P> It will be Dana Hills' first trip to the girls' soccer final.  </P> <P> "We went out and worked hard and won the balls we had to," Dana Hills Coach Ken  Ezratty said. "But the wind was definitely a factor."  </P> <P> Especially on the volley that Dana Hills midfielder Jenny Koenig launched with  her left foot into the east goal 33:22 into the first half.  </P> <P> Koenig took a pass from Jonelle Tortamasi on the sideline, spun and drilled a  hanging drive from 35 yards. The wind helped it hook into the upper left corner  of the net past Mission Viejo goalkeeper Tamar de Fries.  </P> <P> Janet Rollins helped Dana Hills get its insurance goal. Promoted from junior  varsity because she can throw further than any other Dolphin, Rollins tossed a  strike in front of the net from the corner, and Kroeger thumped it in with a  rolling header for a 2-0 lead.  </P></p>

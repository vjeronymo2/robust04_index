			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk and Jerzy Pilczynski: </F> "Continuation and New Elements; Budget Debate in Sejm"; two  tables with data on state budget revenue and expenditures for  1992-94 not included]    [Text] On Saturday [5 March], the Sejm will vote on  the Budget Law, on principles of monetary policies, and on a  resolution on increasing state revenues. Sejm Deputy Wieslawa  Ziolkowska presented the results of work that went on for more  than two months concerning the government's budget draft, on  behalf of the Economic Policies, Budget, and Finance Commission.  She recommended that the budget draft be adopted, even though  she was also quite critical of it. According to the government,  budget expenditures are supposed to be 696.1 trillion zlotys [Z]  and budget revenue Z613 trillion, whereas the budget deficit  should not exceed Z83 trillion.    The commission implemented only minor revisions to the  draft.  <H5>  Critical Report </H5>   All proposals for increasing budget revenues and  expenditures  were rejected. Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska stressed that, in the  commission's view, the budget proposed by the government allows  neither for improving the efficiency of reforming and  restructuring the economy, nor for a slowdown of regression  trends regarding meeting basic social needs.    Ziolkowska reported on the commission's doubts regarding too  optimistic assumptions contained in the draft concerning  economic growth, a fall in inflation rates, export increases,  and a too cautious evaluation of budget revenues. She also  stressed the commission's critical remarks regarding excessive  figures resulting from an assessment of sums of money devoted to  the reimbursement of income taxes (Z24 trillion), and also an  insufficient figure indicating revenue from the lump-sum tax  [podatek zryczaltowany]--just Z7 trillion. The commission was  also critical of the way of financing the domestic debt, which  had been suggested by the government. Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska  devoted much of her speech to social expenditures. These are  planned to be Z46.5 trillion, which, among other things, will  make it impossible to pay about 400,000 social assistance  benefits--that figure is higher than last year, when there was  not enough money for 250,000 of those entitled. Real [after  accounting for inflation] expenditures on social assistance will  drop by 4 percent.  <H5>  Little Room for Maneuver </H5>   The way the report was presented, which included  Ziolkowska's  subjective views, aroused critical remarks during the  subsequent debate. [Acting Finance] Minister Henryk Chmielak  also engaged himself in polemics regarding some of Ziolkowska's  arguments. He admitted that the government budget draft cannot  satisfy everyone, but he also stressed that the government's  room for maneuver was restricted very much by factors like high  unemployment levels, high costs of servicing the domestic and  external debts, and disadvantageous demographic changes. These  prevented the government from changing expenditure levels in  many fields. But an increase in the sources of budget revenue  is becoming a new trend. This should make it possible to achieve  a 5-percent increase in those sources, or perhaps even higher  than that. At that point, one will be able to think about  increasing the expenditures.   <H5>    Argument With Polish National Bank [NBP] </H5>   Sejm Deputy Waldemar Michna of the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL], while presenting a report on the work of the commission  regarding the principles of monetary policies in 1994, stressed  two significant changes: increasing the money supply from Z155  trillion to Z169 trillion, and the possibility of the NBP's  financing the budget deficit in the amount of Z35 trillion  (instead of the Z30 trillion the NBP wanted to see.) NBP  Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz did not rule out the  possibility of increasing the money supply, but only by Z2  trillion at most. Michna also made an appeal to the Sejm  deputies not to change the level of financing the budget deficit  by the NBP because that could lead to decreasing the banks'  profits and a resultant decrease of the state budget revenue.    Apart from the draft of the Budget Law and the principles of  monetary policies, Sejm deputies also debated a draft resolution  coming from Sejm deputies that would oblige the government to  seek additional possibilities of increasing the budget revenue  that cannot be pinpointed right now, and to present them to the  Sejm in midyear.    Sejm Deputies Mieczyslaw Czerniawski of the Democratic Left  Alliance and PSL's Franciszek Stefaniuk, who spoke on behalf of  their respective Sejm deputies clubs, declared their support for  the budget. Both presented the difficult situation that is a  legacy from the previous governments--that situation made it  impossible to implement radical changes in the process of  planning budget revenue and expenditures. They also stressed  such positive aspects of the budget as the fact that its goal is  acceleration of economic growth, a fall in inflation, a more  just distribution of the burden of the impact of economic  transformations, efforts to bring public finances to their  health, an increase of financial means devoted to promoting  exports, the introduction of investment-related breaks, and so  forth.    Sejm Deputy Hanna Suchocka of the Democratic Union [UD]  accused the governing coalition of refusing to fulfill the  promises they had made during the election campaign, and also of  being inconsistent in continuing the reforms. She also  criticized the government for what is only a marginal  implementation of the "Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises."  She announced that the UD Sejm Deputies Club will not support  the budget.    The same kind of declaration was made by Ryszard Bugaj of  the  Union of Labor. He listed five reasons: dubious macroeconomic  assumptions, insufficient budget revenues (by about Z30  trillion), a too restrictive monetary policy, lack of  rationalization with regard to budget expenditures, and a  mistaken concept of privatization.    At the end of Thursday's debate on the budget, Ownership  Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek also engaged in  polemics with critics of privatization. He said companies are  impatient and tired "of waiting for more seals of approval,  which are supposed to give them the right to undertake the risk  of an economic game." He added that the Finance Ministry has  already prepared a draft concerning the introduction of a  so-called transaction fee, but one cannot assume that taxing  income derived from the stock market will save the budget. The  introduction of the fee must be preceded by a thorough analysis  and linked to an increase in the supply of shares, and it must  also take capital market development into account.</p>

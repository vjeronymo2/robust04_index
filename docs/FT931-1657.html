			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland's equity rally pauses for breath - Events in Russia have had a sobering influence Political upheaval in Russia has proved to be the first really sobering influence on the Finnish stock market for six months, temporarily ending a boom which has seen share prices soar by nearly 90 per cent in local currency terms. Shares fell on both Monday and Tuesday, to leave the Helsinki stock exchange's general index at 984.4 last night, after its climb from a low of 541 on September 7 1992 to a 1993 peak of 1,017.5 on March 5. Events across the border, clearly, will have a significant short-term impact on the market's development; but this nervousness aside, many observers believe that the rally has further to go, even although they expect the pace to slacken. They point out that at its current level, the index is still only half way back to the point it reached in April 1989, when it touched 2,009.5. The upward trend, which has seen the index rise by 20 per cent so far this year, has been driven by two factors. One is the heavy presence of foreign buyers in the market. The 40 per cent depreciation of the markka in the last 18 months, following two devaluations, has made Finnish stock cheap for many foreigners. In addition, the country has just relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership, so that international equity portfolios have been undergoing a process of readjustment. The second factor is the drop in interest rates, which has made it less attractive to hold money in the bank, and increased domestic interest in equities. New tax rules, introduced at the start of this year, have also favoured equities, if only because they are now treated more equitably with other forms of investment. Nevertheless, the strength of the stock market rally does seem surprising given the state of the economy, which is characterised by record unemployment, a soaring budget deficit and high foreign debt. These problems recently led the US rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, to lower its rating on Finnish debt from AA+ to AA-. However, analysts stress that many of the stocks being bought are in major export companies which are benefiting substantially from the lower markka. A typical example is Nokia, the telecommunications and consumer electronics group, whose shares have risen 30 per cent this year. Pulp and paper groups are also major devaluation beneficiaries, and this sector has extended its strong performance in the closing months of 1992 with a 25 per cent rise so far this year. Analysts say that current levels discount a substantial increase in profits this year and next. Some of the buying has a more speculative flavour to it. Banking shares, for example, have climbed more than 30 per cent so far this year, even though the sector faces huges credit losses this year and next, and the shadow of state ownership hangs over it. Buyers could run out of steam: apart from developments in Russia, rights offers are beginning to be loaded on to the market, and these could soon dry up liquidity if the issues are not marketed internationally. Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the leading commercial bank, is first in line with a FM930m issue, but there are plenty of other companies in the wings, looking for the opportunity to repair their tattered balance sheets. Nevertheless, the general mood remains positive. The recent results season brought no unpleasant surprises, even if most of the major Finnish companies only succeeded in cutting losses, rather than returning to the black, and further improvements are expected this year and next. The Helsinki-based Opstock Securities, for example, predicts that Finnish listed companies' net losses will halve this year to FM8.5bn (Dollars 1.4bn), while combined profits of FM4.3bn will be earned in 1994. Anticipating continued healthy turnover levels, it expects one share in every three to change hands this year. Mr Simo-Pekka Helander, Opstock's managing-director, believes that the upward trend could span the next three years, as the economy finally emerges from recession. While not discounting short-term downside corrections, he predicts growth of 20-25 per cent a year in Finnish share prices over this period.</p>

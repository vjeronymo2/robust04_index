The source said these reports are groundless.    The source added that Jordan is primarily interested in the  perpetuation of security and stability in fraternal Yemen and is  eager to seek an appropriate negotiated solution to the Yemeni  crisis within the framework of dialogue and understanding among  the Yemeni leaders.    The source emphasized that the Jordanian Arab Army will not  hesitate to come to the brothers assistance if needed; that it  is an army for all Arabs, and that it works only for Arabs  interests. The source said: The issue at hand is that the  Yemeni leaders have asked the Jordanian Arab Army's general  command to offer its expertise and advice within the framework  of a comprehensive plan to reorganize the Yemeni Army's units.  Thus, during Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir's  visit to Yemen last Monday, Staff Major General 'Id Kamil  al-Rawdan, assistant chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for  Operations and Training, accompanied al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir  to study the Yemeni plan in this respect.</p>

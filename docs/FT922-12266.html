			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (2): Rich pickings are found abroad  -There are a record number of export winners and more applications than for many years BRITAIN may be in the depths of a recession, but some companies at least are finding that this need not harm their growth. If the numbers of applicants for and winners of the Queen's Awards for export are anything to go by, more British companies than ever are finding there are rich pickings to be had in the export market, even if demand is disappointing back home. A record 127 export awards have been given, one more than the previous highest total in 1990 and, after a slightly disappointing response in the last few years, 1,181 applications were received this year - the most since 1979. To qualify for an award, according to the rules, an applicant has to demonstrate a 'substantial and sustained increase in export earnings to a level which is outstanding for the products or services concerned and for the size of (its) operations'. Generally, the increase has to have been sustained over a three-year period, so it is noteworthy that 15 of this year's winners have been established within the last five years. However, many of the award-winners have a history dating back to the last century, including such well-known names as J Barbour &amp; Sons, the garment manufacturers; Fortnum &amp; Mason, the fine food purveyors; and the security company Chubb. Twenty-three awards went to companies that have won export awards before. For Tiphook, a London-based company which supplies containers, road trailers and rail wagons to the shipping, distribution and transportation industries, it was the fourth export award in eight years. Other multiple winners include Huntleigh, which previously won in 1982 and 1987. This Luton healthcare company exports to 50 countries including Japan, India and Russia - an impressive achievement in the medical field where regulations can be rigid and vary across different borders. Euromoney, the magazine publishing, advertising and conference company, also wins the award for the third time. Three-quarters of its total income now comes from 144 countries all over the world. There is other evidence of companies continuing to build on their success. A number of previous recipients of technology awards have turned their technological prowess into export success. For example, British Gas, whose 'intelligent pig' - a sophisticated inspection vehicle which passes through pipelines under the force of the gas or liquid in the pipe - gained a technology and export award in 1988, has won a second export award for more than trebling overseas earnings from its pipeline inspection services. Another repeat winner, Portsmouth-based City Technology, which manufactures gas sensors for a range of applications in the safety, energy-saving and emission control areas, has won two previous technology awards in 1982 and 1985, as well as an export award in 1988. GPT Payphone Systems of Liverpool, which makes intelligent payphones, phonecards and cashless calling systems, won a technology award last year and has gained an export award this year for exporting to more than 60 telephone administrations in 48 countries. No Queen's Awards list would be complete without a representative from ICI, and this year ICI Katalco of Cleveland is a repeat winner. The company, which supplies the Puraspec range of purification processes to remove impurities from gases and hydrocarbon liquids, picked up a technology award last year and has followed it up with an export award. A final multiple winner is Oxford Magnet Technology, based in Witney, Oxfordshire. The company, now jointly-owned by Oxford Instruments Group and Siemens, develops and manufactures whole-body superconducting magnet systems for magnetic resonance imaging scanners.  It won awards for technology and export in 1985 and a further technology award last year. While several of the UK's largest companies - including British Steel, British Gas, British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, ICI and Thorn - are represented in the list, there is a refreshing variety. Exports range from MBA degrees and natural history documentaries to ships in bottles and bicycle mudguards. Among the export winners, 68 per cent employ fewer than 200 people, while five companies have fewer than 15 employees. The smallest company on the list is Associated Timber Services with a staff of nine. Established six months before the hurricane which sent trees crashing down across the southern Britain in October 1987, this Suffolk-based firm of timber merchants now exports timber and other wood products all over Europe. Export sales have increased more than fivefold in the last three years. Invisibles performed particularly well to take 16 per cent of the awards. The insurance sector, which received its first award only two years ago, this year had three representatives: Clerical Medical International Insurance of the Isle of Man - a subsidiary of Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance and the first ever Manx winner; Newman Martin and Buchan, brokers specialising in the energy industry and marine market; and SBJ Regis Low, a Lloyd's broker specialising in oil rigs and hulls. The management consultancy sector is represented by Godel Escher Bach, established in 1987 and specialising in strategic planning techniques for senior executives in multinational companies. Its Executive Information Systems software has been described as 'user promiscuous' and was designed for 'the most computer illiterate board director'. The company's exports to Europe, south-east Asia and the US have more than trebled in the past three years. More Fisher Brown, a small partnership established as recently as 1988, becomes only the second firm of solicitors to win an export award. With clients in 58 countries, it deals exclusively in legal services to the international marine and insurance industry. Another first is achieved by R. G. C. Jenkins, as the first patent and trademark agents to pick up an award. The academic world is also well-represented. The London Business School is recognised for more than doubling its fee income in the last three years from overseas students and managers on its MBA and non-degree courses. UMIST, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology also receives the bulk of its foreign earnings from overseas students' fees, but also from research services and technology transfer overseas carried out through its subsidiary, UMIST Ventures. The University of Cambridge's Local Examinations Syndicate is rewarded for its success in marketing its English as a foreign language examinations worldwide. One company involved in training is International Aerospace, which trains military and civilian pilots and flight engineers, and now receives more than 80 per cent of its income from overseas. Other sectors which are strongly represented are aerospace; the garment industry; printing; high technology; foodstuffs; and computers and software. The importance of overseas investment in the UK is again evident, and the proportion of companies with overseas parents seems to have increased slightly this year. Seven are owned by US companies; four by Japanese; two German; with one Canadian, one Australian and one French. The best-known of these are car manufacturers Nissan and Peugeot Talbot, while Kemble, the leading piano manufacturer, is now a joint venture with the Yamaha Corporation. Companies come from the length and breadth of the UK, with 11 from Scotland, four from Wales and three from Northern Ireland, and, for the first time, one from the Isle of Man. All have defied the recession, and once the recovery is under way, should be in a strong position to make the most of growing domestic demand.</p>

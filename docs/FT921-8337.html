			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Garcia is chosen as party chief PERU'S former president, Mr Alan Garca, has been elected head of the country's biggest political party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (Apra), only weeks after being cleared of charges of illegal personal enrichment while in office. Mr Garca, who led an Apra administration from 1985-90, was elected secretary general by popular acclaim during the party's annual congress at the weekend in the northern city of Trujillo. The delegates' choice put an end to the ambitions of Mr Luis Alva Castro, Mr Garca's chief rival, within the party. He has been secretary general for the past three years. By threatening not to accept the offered position unless his conditions were met, Mr Garca succeeded in placing his own candidates in key party positions. Senator Mercedes Cabanillas becomes his second-in-command and Mr Abel Salinas, senator and former economy minister, the secretary for planning. In December a supreme court judge decided there was insufficient evidence to proceed with charges that Mr Garca illegally enriched himself during his 12 years in public life, particularly during his presidency. Mr Garca vehemently denied the charges. But there was concern in some Apra circles that Mr Garca's choice of Mr Agustin Mantilla, former interior minister, for the position of 'organisation secretary' would lead to the militarisation of the Apra party. Apra remains the largest party.</p>

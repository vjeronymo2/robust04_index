			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Singular leader was last great founding Zionist: Obituary: Menachem Begin IT TOOK Menachem Begin more than three decades to become prime minister of Israel. After finally achieving office in May 1977, in a watershed defeat of the hitherto all-powerful Labour movement by his Likud party, he belied a belligerent past by negotiating peace with Egypt, an historic and enduring breakthrough for the Jewish state. For that he won the Nobel peace prize, along with President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, whose visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 was an emotional highpoint for Israelis that is still spoken of with awe today. But in the summer of 1982 Begin took an altogether more bloody turn when he approved an all-out invasion of Lebanon by the Israeli defence forces. It was a disastrously misconceived adventure, meant to destroy the Palestine Liberation Organisation and impose Israel's political will on its fragmented northern neighbour. Achieving neither of these aims, it led instead to thousands of dead, including more than 600 Israelis, a deep split in Israeli society and the shame of the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the Beirut refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila by Israel's Christian militia allies. Fourteen months after the invasion, in August 1983, Menachem Begin, by now a shadow of the man who had transformed the Israeli political scene, became a virtual recluse, broken by the traumatic events of the previous year, growing ill-health and the death of his wife Aliza. Begin, a Pole, was born into a fiercely Zionist family in Brest-Litovsk, then in Tsarist Russia and now on the western border of present-day Belarus, on August 16, 1913. He grew up an aggressive defender of Jewish rights against anti-semitism in inter-war Poland and an advocate of a Jewish homeland and state in Palestine. When the rise of Nazism first threatened, then engulfed, eastern Europe, Begin was already a prominent leader of the Betar organisation, the youth wing of the Revisionist Zionist movement. The Revisionists were inspired and led by Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky, whose mantle Begin was to assume after his death in 1940. Until Begin's electoral victory in the 1970s, the Revisionists represented a minority among Zionists. Their militarist posture, partly modelled on Mussolini's Italian fascist movement, was scorned by the far more numerous socialist Zionists, led by Jabotinsky's great rival, David Ben Gurion. Released by the Russians in 1941, after three months in an Arctic labour camp, Begin arrived in British mandatory Palestine in 1942. Behind him he had left his mother, father and brother, who were all killed by the Nazis . Within a short time he became commander of Irgun Zva'i Leumi, an underground guerrilla group dedicated to forcing the British out. Unlike the mainstream Zionists, Irgun and its fellow Revisionist group, the Stern Gang, rejected any proposal to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states and adopted uncompromising violence in their fight against the British. Irgun was responsible for actions such as the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946 in which 91 people, including 28 Britons, died. Two years later, a month before the British finally pulled out, Begin's men were involved in the massacre of 200 Arab men, women and children in the village of Deir Yassin, an event which helped prompt the exodus of Palestinian Arabs from what became Israel. After the state was established, Begin became a noisy but somehwat marginal opposition leader. But Begin and his Herut ('freedom') party took care to court the poor Sephardic, or Oriental, Jewish immigrants pouring into Israel from North Africa and the Middle East. These were to become a majority of the population, but their concerns were fatally neglected by the aloof Ashkenazi, or European, Labour leaders. Although Begin was himself Ashkenazi, his intransigent nationalism and no-holds-barred criticism of the government, combined with his unfailing personal courtesy towards the new Israelis gradually won their loyalty. This paid off dramatically in the 1977 elections when Herut, now allied in the Likud bloc with other right-wing parties such as the Liberals, defeated a Labour party still reeling from the trauma of near-defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The peace with Egypt that followed, after the Camp David negotiations hosted by US President Jimmy Carter, surprised many who had not credited Begin with possessing such statesmanship. The accords were opposed by many within the Likud - notably Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the present prime minister - and required the backing of Labour to pass the Knesset. By giving up the Sinai, the core of the agreement, Begin proved that Israel could budge on the territory it captured in the 1967 Six Day War. But his commitment to 'Eretz Israel,' the biblical Land of Israel, prevented him yielding more than a commitment to limited Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ezer Weizman, then Begin's defence minister closely involved in negotiating the accords, later a Labour member of parliament, believes Begin deliberately backtracked on the limited commitments he did make on the West Bank and Gaza because they contained a threat to 'Eretz Israel.' He encouraged the further settlement of thousands of Jewish settlers in the Arab territories, and the stalemate led ultimately to the eruption of the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in the West Bank and Gaza in 1987. For all his anti-communist rhetoric, Begin had little interest in business or economics. His government failed to overturn the deeply embedded socialist structure of the Israeli economy. Instead, a dose of deregulation and free-spending led to hyper-inflation and huge debts in the mid-1980s. After his retirement, Menachem Begin rarely ventured out of his Jerusalem apartment. As the memory of Lebanon receded, his stature in the eyes of the Israeli public grew once more, undoubtedly enhanced by comparison with those who succeeded him. The hankering for such a singular leader, regarded as perhaps the last of the great founding Zionists, is reflected in the growing popularity for his son Binyamin, a rising Likud MP.</p>

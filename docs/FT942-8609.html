			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Maple Leaf Foods hit by higher costs Higher costs and unusually cold weather have been partly blamed for first-quarter earnings at Maple Leaf Foods, Canada's biggest food processor, down by 21 per cent. Maple Leaf, which is 56 per cent-owned by the UK's Hillsdown Holdings, also ascribed the setback to strong competitive pressures in some of its businesses, notably bakeries and flour milling. Net earnings dipped to CDollars 8m (USDollars 5.8m), or 10 cents a share, from CDollars 10.2m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Sales climbed to CDollars 659.9m from CDollars 632.4m. The bottom line was also hit by a fall in interest income, to CDollars 870,000 from CDollars 2.9m, resulting from lower interest rates and smaller cash balances. Mr Brent Ballantyne, chief executive, predicted improved earnings for the rest of the year. Businesses which posted improved first-quarter profits included fresh pork and animal feed.</p>

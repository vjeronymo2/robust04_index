			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Rush Into Financial Liberalization"] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We take this opportunity to  express a view in the interest of the country. That is, in  accordance with the GATT accord Thailand can no longer keep its  financial sector closed. However, we must be very careful not  to rush to liberalize our financial sector, especially as result  of the insistence of a superpower, because this could amount to  liquidating our own financial institutions.    It is not difficult to see that the Newly Industrialized  Countries [NIC's] --Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and  Singapore -- and countries rapidly advancing toward the NIC  status, and this include Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, are  priority targets of economic superpowers who want to establish  commercial banks and other forms of financial institutions in  order to rake off profits. They accomplish this by virtue of  their greater experiences in that sector.    Believe it or not, if the 17-19 January visit of U.S.  Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen succeeds in the immediate  liberalization of the Thai financial sector, Thai commercial  banks and financial institutions could collapse or have their  growth throttled. The superpowers' capital and global  experience are that great.    We suggest the delay of our financial liberalization for as  long as possible. The GATT accord is not be enforceable until  1995. In particular, we must not succumb to U.S. demands. The  United States itself stated at the signing of the agreement with  the EEC that its own financial liberalization would not occur  until eight months later. Even as the date for the enforcement  of the GATT accord nears, the superpowers will try their best to  protect their interests. [passage omitted]</p>

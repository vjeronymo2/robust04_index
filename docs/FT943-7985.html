			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Group of investors takes control of Randgold board A group of international investors led by SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, yesterday effectively gained management control of Randgold &amp; Exploration, in spite of vigorous opposition from the existing directors. Warburg's sister company, Mercury Asset Management, holds about 25 per cent of Randgold, once one of South Africa's premier mining finance houses but now among the most troubled of the country's gold producers. Three weeks ago Warburg launched the management takeover bid in conjunction with Fraser Alexander and Rand, a local mining company. The Warburg-Fraser consortium proposed that the board be expanded in order to change the overall strategy of the company. It also proposed that Rand-gold should issue cash and shares to acquire First Westgold, a company controlled by Fraser Alexander and which operates the West Rand Consolidated Mine, for R68.95m (Dollars 19m). First Westgold's management team would join Randgold to help turn it round. Randgold's chief executive, Mr John Turner, accused the consortium of under-valuing Randgold and over-valuing First Westgold but at an extraordinary meeting yesterday shareholders elected 11 new directors to the Randgold board by a three-to-one margin and approved the First Westgold purchase. In doing so shareholders signalled the demise of Randgold in its present form. Randgold was formerly the mining arm of the Barlow Rand conglomerate before the latter 'unbundled' its operations in 1992. Since then, Randgold has produced consistently weak results from its four marginal mines, all of which are highly sensitive to movements in the gold price. The management takeover bid, which is very unusual in the normally staid South African corporate world, was brought about by widespread shareholder frustration with the company's continuing poor performance. In April Randgold admitted that its ERPM mine, which launched a R550m rights issue last year, would not meet the forecasts in its prospectus. Then in June the group announced that it would cease underground operations at its Durban Roodepoort Deep mine with a loss of nearly 6,000 jobs.</p>

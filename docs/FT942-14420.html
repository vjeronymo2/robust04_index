			<p>940420 FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps boost Union Carbide Union Carbide, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported a 52 per cent increase in first-quarter net income, which it attributed mainly to cost reduction and improved results from joint ventures. The company made Dollars 61m before accounting changes, or 37 cents a share, compared with Dollars 40m, or 28 cents a share, in the same period last year. The figures for 1994 included non-recurring items which cut earnings per share by 5 cents. Sales totalled Dollars 1.13bn, compared to Dollars 1.19bn a year ago. The company said improved volumes were largely offset by slight margin declines in commodity products compared to the first and fourth quarter of last year.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NEW INTERVIEW TOOLS HELP CRIME VICTIMS, WITNESSES RECALL MORE  </P> <P> At first, the woman couldn't remember if the suspicious-looking man she saw  near the murder scene wore any jewelry.  </P> <P> But a few minutes later, as she concentrated on her recollection of him turning  his head to the side, she remembered a gold earring.  </P> <P> That memory helped solve the case, said psychologist Ronald Fisher, who  interviewed her at the request of police. The payoff came from an experimental  technique called the cognitive interview, aimed at getting crime victims and  witnesses to remember more than under standard police questioning.  </P> <P> The technique is one of several contributions psychology researchers hope will  help solve crimes and convict criminals.  </P> <P> Much of this work has been done only in laboratories. But the cognitive  interview recently showed promise in a real-world test with detectives at the  Metro-Dade Police Department in Miami.  </P> <P> It "proved to be real fruitful," said Police Sgt. Jim Wander. "The guys who  took part in it are appreciative of the results, and I think they're probably  better detectives overall as a result of it."  </P> <P> Results were reported in the October issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology  by Fisher and Michael Amador of Florida International University and R. Edward  Geiselman of UCLA.  </P> <P> By analyzing interviews with robbery victims and witnesses, they found that  seven detectives trained in the technique elicited 47% more information than  before training, and 63% more than did nine untrained detectives.  </P> <P> The technique involves asking fewer questions than in a standard interview,  putting more burden on the witness to actively generate information rather than  simply respond to queries, Fisher said.  </P> <P> Among its strategies is discerning the witness' job or hobby interests, which  might indicate details he is more likely to recall. A clothing designer might  be able to describe in detail what a suspect was wearing, for example.  </P> <P> The witness is also asked to recall his emotions and thoughts at the time of  the crime, because studies suggest that will help recollection. That can be  tricky in the case of a victim who was frightened by the crime, Fisher said.  </P> <P> The interviewer also asks the witness what happened, not so much to get  information as to determine the witness' vantage point in seeing the crime and  the "mental pictures" he has of it. The meat of the interview lies in asking  the witness to recall the event, one mental picture at a time, and probe each  picture for detail as it unfolds.  </P> <P> For example, if a suspect initially approached the witness and then walked  away, the witness should be asked about the suspect's face only while recalling  the approach. Questions about the back of the suspect's jacket should wait  until the witness has moved on to recalling the departure.  </P> <P> The technique has "a lot of promise," said Gary Wells, chairman of the  psychology department at Iowa State University and the author of a handbook on  eyewitness identification for police.  </P> <P> But he and Elizabeth Loftus of the University of Washington have some  reservations. For example, the interview combines several techniques, and it is  not clear which produces the results. Finding that out might help researchers  determine when to use the interview and when not to, Wells said.  </P> <P> Loftus also questioned whether the extra details recalled during the cognitive  interview are important. "Some of them are important, some of them are not,"  Fisher said. "I go for all the information I can get."  </P> <P> Wells said more tests of the technique are needed.  </P> <P> Another line of memory research deals with the risk that a victim or witness  will falsely identify an innocent person. Several hundred people a year may be  falsely convicted of felonies in the United States through erroneous  identification, said Ken Deffenbacher, a psychology professor at the University  of Nebraska at Omaha.  </P> <P> Laboratory experiments have shown two strategies useful in reducing the risk of  false identifications in police lineups, Wells said. Lineups include a person  suspected by police and several people who generally resemble him.  </P> <P> In one strategy Wells studied, the witness is shown a "blank" lineup which,  unknown to him, does not contain any suspects. If he fingers somebody, he is  discarded as unreliable.  </P> <P> In the other strategy, the witness is shown one person at a time and asked if  it is the right person. In the laboratory, this technique reduced the incidence  of false identifications by 20% to nearly 40%, Wells said.  </P> <P> But Lt. Ron Lewis of the robbery-homicide division of the Los Angeles Police  Department said he considers the "blank" lineup unnecessary because a regular  lineup can already expose an erroneous witness if the witness fails to choose  the suspect. He also said the district attorney generally will not file a  complaint against a person identified by only one witness; corroborating  evidence or multiple witness identifications are generally needed.  </P> <P> On another aspect of eyewitness reliability, studies show that people do more  poorly in identifying people of a different race than of their own, said  psychologist John Brigham of Florida State University. His recent analysis of  14 studies involving blacks and whites found the problem affected each race  about equally. "A lot of people had assumed that whites would do worse with  blacks than blacks would do with whites," Brigham said.  </P> <P> The reason for the problem is not clear. The observer's degree of racial  prejudice does not seem to make a consistent difference, and evidence  suggesting that the cause is lack of exposure to people of a different race is  "pretty weak," he said. Perhaps scientists need a better measure of exposure,  including types of exposure, to demonstrate such a relationship, he said.  </P> <P> Brigham suggested that in appropriate cases, jurors be told of the hazards of  cross-racial identification. He also recommended that lineups be arranged by an  officer who is the same race as the suspect and may be better able to choose  people who resemble the suspect, providing a fairer test of the identification.  Police departments do not appear to do that generally now, he said.  </P> <P> Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the National Assn. of Chiefs of Police,  said he doubts that such a practice would be widely used because of the  logistics of having enough officers of the proper race available.  </P> <P> Wells said that when he describes his lineup techniques and the cognitive  interview while giving workshops to police, "they are quite impressed with the  kinds of findings that we're coming up with.  </P> <P> "I really think this is one of the areas of applied psychology that is making a  real contribution and a real difference."  </P></p>

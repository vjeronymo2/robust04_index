			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Rome plans to accelerate state sell-offs: Amato government's signals help bolster lira and shares THE ITALIAN government plans to accelerate its ambitious privatisation programme and push sales into public services and parts of the energy sector. The new proposals, amplifying plans presented last November, imply that the four parties in Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's coalition government have reached some agreement on remaining in office beyond crucial referendums on April 18. However, in view of the unpredictable political climate in Rome and the ambitious timetable, the plans may still be vulnerable to change or delay. The privatisation announcement, and a modified scheme for private pension funds also unveiled by ministers, helped restore confidence in the lira and shares. The currency has firmed to L972 against the D-Mark, while shares made further modest gains yesterday after steep climbs on Thursday. The revised privatisation proposals, to be put to parliament next week, are an amplification of previous policy rather than a totally new strategy. The biggest change is the commitment to sell most of the Eni energy and chemicals group. Previously the government had focused on the flotation of some subsidiaries, while the future of the parent company remained unclear. Other innovations include a pledge to sell Enel, the electricity generating authority, possibly next year, and to reduce the state's role in the fragmented telecommunications sector. Last week a cabinet committee called for the creation of a single telecoms utility by 1994-1995. The government has now confirmed earlier hints that simplifying the telecoms structure will be the prelude to cutting the state's stake. The draft timetable is extremely ambitious, with many deals scheduled before year-end. However, ministers recognised possible delays by talking in terms of when companies would be 'ready for the market,' rather than sold. Apart from sending a political signal to the electorate and the financial markets that Mr Amato is still in control, the decision to speed sell-offs may also have been influenced by international competition. The new government in France and Chancellor Kohl's coalition in Germany are expected to produce substantial privatisation packages soon. International investors are expected to play a big part in the sell-offs, as liquidity on the Milan stock market is limited. Foreign multinationals may be the only buyers for some of the smaller or more specialised assets. A single bank will be appointed to mastermind each privatisation, although other banks will conduct valuations and additional advisory work. However, the sale of public-sector monopolies such as telecommunications or electricity still needs considerable preparation. Tariffs will have to be liberalised and the government intends to create a number of watchdog 'authorities' to supervise pricing and services. Later, privatisation may even be extended into such areas as the postal service, which is to be transformed into a joint stock company.</p>

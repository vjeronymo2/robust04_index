			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Toyota engine plant starts up TOYOTA of Japan, the world's third-largest vehicle maker, yesterday started production at its Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, north Wales - the first of a wave of Japanese automotive plants set to be commissioned in Europe by the end of the year, Kevin Done writes. Toyota is building up to a production rate of 200,000 engines a year at Deeside - its first wholly-owned production plant in Europe - by the second half of the 1990s. Output in the first phase is set to reach 100,000 a year by 1995. Output of 25,000 1.6-litre petrol engines is planned at Deeside next year for supply to the company's Pounds 700m car-assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby, which starts production in December. A 2-litre petrol engine is expected to be added in the second phase. The engine plant is starting with simple assembly operations but will machine important engine components during the next two years, including the block, cylinder head, crankshaft, camshafts and con-rods. Eventually all the main engine components will come from European suppliers with the exception of the aluminium cylinder heads, which Toyota plans to continue to import from Japan. The plant will have 45 European suppliers with about half from the UK. Of Pounds 131m investment presently committed at Deeside, about 56 per cent has been sourced from Japan. Of the remainder Pounds 17.2m of equipment and installation spending and Pounds 41m of construction work has come from European suppliers. The Deeside workforce of 74 is set to rise to 200 in 1995 and 300 at full capacity.</p>

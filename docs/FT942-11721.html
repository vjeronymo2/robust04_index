			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury prices recede in thin trading US Treasury bonds receded in thin trading yesterday as dealers adjusted their positions ahead of Friday's important data on labour-market conditions last month. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/8 at 86 7/8 , with the yield rising to 7.34 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/8 easier at 99 11/32 , to yield 5.837 per cent. Early on, prices drifted lower as the market followed through on the previous session's selling and on weakness in bonds overseas. The negative tone was worsened when traders misconstrued comments made by Mr Wayne Angell, a former Federal Reserve governor who was recently named chief economist at Bear Stearns, the New York securities house. He said that if the Federal Reserve intended to lift interest rates again before its May 17 policy-making session, it would likely have done so yesterday. It was later made clear that Mr Angell thought the likelihood of a move yesterday was remote. But speculation over an immediate tightening had only a brief impact on prices. The long end of the maturity range soon climbed off its session lows, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. A fresh decline in the dollar against the yen and D-Mark had little impact on the market, and neither did the day's economic news. The Commerce Department said that the leading indicators, designed to predict future economic strength, rose 0.7 per cent in March, against a consensus forecast of 0.6 per cent. Instead, most retail accounts were sitting on the sidelines, while dealers were unwinding speculative positions set up earlier in anticipation of April employment data due out at the end of the week. The result was a modest slump across the board. European government bond markets closed lower, with the UK and Spain experiencing the sharpest declines yesterday. UK government bonds were depressed by the combination of unfavourable M0 data, political jitters ahead of the local elections and lack of investor interest, dealers said. The narrow money-supply measure M0 was reported growing at an annual rate of 6.2 per cent in April, above the expected figure of 5.8 per cent. Dealers said that the figure implied that consumer spending remains robust, and therefore reduced the prospect of a near-term cut in the base rate. Meanwhile, dealers complained at the poor investor interest in the gilts market. 'Investors just remain sidelined in these conditions,' said one gilts salesman. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 105.30, touching a high of 105.31 early in the day and settling at 104.28 - but shortly after settling, the contract dropped down to a low of 104.18 in the late afternoon. Spanish government bond prices were hit early in the day, mainly on continuing twists and developments in the country's long-running political scandals. The Meff futures contract dropped sharply from its opening level of 97.10 and fell to a low of 96.35, settling at 96.50. German bunds ended lower after a fairly volatile session, with little immediate news to focus on apart from the prospect of another interest rate cut at today's repo, traders said. After fairly generous cuts at the last two weekly repo operations, the repo rate stands at 5.47 per cent, and dealers said they expect to see a further lowering of the rate by between three and seven basis points today. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 95.20 - which was also the high of the day - fell back, then recovered and finally dropped down again to a low of 94.88 by late afternoon.</p>

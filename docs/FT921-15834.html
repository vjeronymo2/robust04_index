			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Rationalisation costs hit Aberdeen Trust ABERDEEN TRUST, the financial services group which secured a Stock Exchange listing last year, suffered a fall of more than 55 per cent in pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 1991 because of exceptional items related to rationalisation. While operating profit was down by 6 per cent at Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 2.75m), exceptional items totalling Pounds 1.36m cut pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 2.75m). During the year Aberdeen Trust disposed of the insurance broking, life and pensions and membership activities of the Country Gentlemen's Association, acquired in 1989. This entailed redundancy provisions and costs relating to vacant properties. There was also a net extraordinary loss of Pounds 76,000 (loss of Pounds 417,000) comprising net profits of Pounds 224,000 from the sale of the CGA, and Pounds 300,000 flotation costs. Aberdeen's turnover fell from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 10.8m, largely reflecting the change in its activities with the sale of CGA. During the year it acquired investment management responsibilities from Argosy Asset Management which added Pounds 125m to funds under management. It also bought Saltire Insurance Investments, an investment trust specialising in insurance. This brought a 47 per cent stake in Cheval Asset Management which manages fixed interest funds for Lloyd's syndicates. After the year end it bought the remaining 53 per cent of Cheval, adding Pounds 300m to funds under management. Aberdeen Trust now derives about 70 per cent of its turnover from fund management and the rest from providing accountancy services to CGA members. Mr Martin Gilbert, chief executive, said that the quality of the company's profits had improved with more from recurring management fees and less from dealing. The company said that 1992 should be clear of exceptional costs, but warned that the outlook was uncertain because of political and economic worries. A final dividend of 1.5p is proposed for an unchanged 2.5p total out of earnings per share of 3.06p (4.43p).</p>

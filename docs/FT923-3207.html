			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Lira devalued 7% in EMS: Bundesbank interest rates to be cut today UK to maintain sterling-DM parity ITALY and Germany last night moved to end the crisis in the European Monetary System by agreeing an effective 7 per cent devaluation of the lira to be followed by cuts in the Bundesbank's leading interest rates today. Monetary officials said the surprise move, agreed by telephone over the weekend, could be followed by interest rate cuts in other countries such as France and the Netherlands. Analysts suggested it also could ease speculative pressure against sterling. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, last night welcomed the realignment and in particular the Bundesbank's intention to cut its interest rates. In a statement, he made clear Britain would not alter the parity of sterling against the D-Mark and that it would take 'whatever action was necessary' to maintain the central rate at DM2.95. The chancellor said last night's moves demonstrated the 'benefits of continuing close co-operation among Community countries'. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, urged Mr Lamont to cut UK interest rates and take measures to boost employment and investment to restore economic growth. Announcing the EMS changes in Brussels, the EC monetary committee said all currencies would be revalued by 3.5 per cent, except the lira which would be devalued by 3.5 per cent. The moves were initiated after massive intervention by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy on Friday failed to lift the currency off its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bundesbank spent well over the DM2.5bn that it published for intervention last week. The intervention, obligatory under the rules of the ERM, had the effect of increasing Germany's monetary reserves and so threatening to add to its already rapid money supply growth. The German interest rate cuts will be decided at an unprecedented meeting of the Bundesbank's ruling council at 9am Central European Time today. A Bundesbank official said last night both the discount and Lombard rates, currently 8.75 and 9.75 per cent respectively, would be cut. EC officials said the Bundesbank appeared to have agreed to cut its interest rates in expectation that the Bonn government and both sides of industry would take more effective measures to curb inflationary pressures in Germany. It also seems to have become more worried about the slowdown in the German economy than was the case only a week ago at the EC finance ministers' meeting in Bath. Prof Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, last night put a brave face on events, saying he believed the decision effectively to devalue by 7 per cent would not be inflationary. The main component in Italy's inflation was internal costs, he said, and the government was seeking to tackle these. Italy's inflation has been falling and in August was running at 5.3 per cent on an annual basis. Prof Amato said he welcomed the co-operation of the Germans and the agreement worked out in consultation with other EC members. 'If we had devalued earlier, it would have been merely an own goal,' he said. The impact of the realignment was immediately felt this morning in the Pacific markets where trading was described as frantic. In Tokyo the dollar opened sharply higher against the D-Mark. It was trading close to DM1.50 after closing at DM1.4508 in New York on Friday. Sterling was trading above DM2.82, against its previous London close of DM2.79. Against the dollar it had fallen to below Dollars 1.89 after Friday's New York close of Dollars 1.921. The Bundesbank's agreement to cut its official rates will amount to a substantial concession by the central bank, in effect giving in to pressure from the other member states in the EMS. Until now, the Bundesbank has been adamant that its high interest rate policy is essential to curb monetary expansion and hold down inflation within Germany. By agreeing to make cuts, it is admitting the important role the high rates have played in the recent European currency market turmoil. Only last week Mr Otmar Issing, a leading Bundesbank board member, insisted that the bank's interest rate policy would not be swayed by broader economic considerations, but only by its paramount task to curb inflation and maintain the D-Mark's stability. Nonetheless, pressure on the Bundesbank has been growing rapidly both within Germany, and outside it, to recognise the international reality causing the stresses in the currency markets. The German decision may fuel hopes of rate cuts in the US and Japan. The EMS changes were welcomed by the US where Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, said they were a 'positive development for world markets'. In London, several City economists said the Bundesbank's pledge could lead to a rise of sterling and other European currencies today, and that, in the short term, the pressure had been taken off the UK to raise rates. Mr John Shepperd, senior economist at Warburgs, said the chief part of the equation was still missing - namely the size of the German rates cut. But he added: 'The most important thing is that the Bundesbank has cracked. It has bowed to international pressure, abandoning domestic issues. Its approach to policy has changed. In the future it is likely to have a much more accommodating stance. There will be much more confidence that the current parities will be much more durable and sustainable. What was going to blow the ERM apart was the Bundesbank's intransigence.' Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the Bundesbank move was 'very welcome'. He hoped the cuts in German borrowing rates would be followed by UK interest rate cuts 'at an early stage'. The lira has been under pressure since the Danish referendum on Maastricht, but this intensified over the past two weeks as a result of two factors: uncertainties about the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht and market fears that the Italian government would not take sufficiently tough measures to tackle the country's budget deficit rising beyond 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product. On August 8 the lira for the first time breached its L765.40 floor in the EMS against the D-Mark. Since then it has been close to or near the floor. According to Prof Amato, the German government last week initiated secret contacts with the treasury and the Bank of Italy on a realignment of currencies in the EMS. The Italian government lobbied hard for the Bundesbank to realign in conjunction with a lowering of its own interest rates. Italian officials indicated that a significant element influencing German attitudes was the increasing number of calls likely to be made on the Bundesbank to buy lire under its EMS obligations to support weaker currencies. Already this month the Bundesbank had been obliged to drain liquidity from the domestic market to back its lira support operations. Last Friday and the previous Friday the Bundesbank bought lire worth a total of more than DM1.7bn. On the Italian side, the authorities had few weapons left to confront another week of speculation against the lira in the run-up to the French referendum. Unofficial estimates of convertible foreign currency reserves are believed to be little more than L10,000bn against L26,000bn at the end of July. The discount rate was raised by 1.75 points to 15 per cent on September 3 and overnight money rates on Friday rose to 28 per cent. Last night there was no indication the Italian authorities would be able to lower the discount rate. This suggested they would watch market reactions which are still thought likely to be nervous about the lira.

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Wise counsel courtesy of the credit industry: Ian Hamilton Fazey on a scheme to help debtors back into the black AN EXPERIMENTAL debt counselling service has found hundreds of people in and around Leeds with multiple debts totalling about Pounds 15,000 each. The money is usually owed to a mixture of eight or so finance houses, retail chains and credit card companies. The figure has shocked credit card and reference agencies, the main backers which have put up Pounds 300,000 for the experiment. They believe it indicates a similar problem throughout Britain. They were expecting an average of about Pounds 10,000. The worst case so far has been Pounds 35,000, owed by an executive who had lost his job. The Consumer Credit Counselling Service was set up in March by sponsors including Barclaycard, Registry Trust, Leeds Permanent Building Society, Time Retail - part of the Kingfisher group - Yorkshire Bank, Girobank and two credit reference agencies - Equifax and CCN, a Great Universal Stores subsidiary. It has seen more than 700 people so far, nearly all of them local. About two-thirds needed advice on how to manage their finances better and help in negotiating with their creditors. The rest needed more formal support. The service has agreed manageable payment schedules - running over an average of about four years - with them and their creditors. Debtors pay a set sum each month, which the service then disburses pro rata to creditors. In return, unsecured lenders - such as hire purchase, retail store or credit card companies - freeze interest, while reducing the debtors' credit ratings to zero to prevent further borrowing. They pay the service - a non-profit making organisation - 15 per cent of the payments they receive to help with running costs. Profligacy and fecklessness have rarely been the cause of debts mounting, Mrs Jan Smith, one of eight counsellors, said. The vast majority got into trouble simply because their income fell. Recession is largely to blame, through couples losing one or both of their jobs, bonuses being missed, or overtime earnings wiped out. Problems were often then compounded by the borrowing of more money to pay off the most pressing creditors. Barclaycard is the biggest sponsor of the experiment, having put in Pounds 100,000. Mr Nick Cobban, who is monitoring the experiment for the Barclays group, said: 'We were all shocked at the level of individual multiple debt. 'But it is not in our interest to have people lose the roof over their heads or end up in prison for not paying their community charge or council tax. That way we get nothing back.' Mr Malcolm Hurlston, the chairman of Registry Trust, which keeps records of all court judgments for debt in Britain, said: 'There is clearly a great need for this sort of safety net. We now want to extend the experiment to at least six other cities and eventually establish a national network of about 20 counselling centres.' The Leeds counsellors went to the US as part of their training to see a similar service at work in Houston. They have no special qualifications other than skills demonstrated in previous work. Their previous occupations include policewoman, fireman, building society lending officer, local radio employee and financial services worker. There are still teething problems. Secured lenders such as building societies are benefiting from the service and referring people in debt to it, but have not agreed to pay 15 per cent of what they recover to help support the centre. Mr Cobban said talks were under way, possibly to agree a flat yearly fee for each person counselled successfully.</p>

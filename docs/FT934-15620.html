			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: High spirits in Nuremberg - Opera The first new production of the Royal Opera's 1993-94 season is the company's first new Meistersinger for 24 years. Its plentiful high spirits are distilled from a combination of bright primary colours, strong involvement in leading roles, innumerable pinpoint comic cameos, and a multitude of cheeky ingenuities of design and festive amusements in the final scene. Of all the myriad ways of tackling Wagner's overflowing, inexhaustible masterpiece, this one is undoubtedly timely and aptly calculated. After decades of looking to Germany for its Wagner modes and manners, Britain's 'international' opera company now chooses for itself a youthful British production team (Graham Vick, producer, Richard Hudson, designer). The conductor is Bernard Haitink, a Dutchman long cherished as one of the glories of British musical life. Apart from the Swedish Walther, the cast is entirely anglophone, and full of expectation-arousing newcomers to their roles. By all these collaborators the overall 'accent' of the performance has been devised with conviction and decisive purpose. The design style is a brilliant theatrical recreation of Breugel, in all his earthy red-bloodedness, and Bosch, in all his fantastic inventiveness. Hudson's scene-settings (expertly lit by Wolfgang Gobbel) are no simple tableaux-vivants but a marriage of 16th-century and late 20th-century artistic vision. The tricks enacted with scale and perspective - sometimes broadly jokey, as in the start to Act 2, sometimes wildly surreal, as in the riot, with figures dangled madly from apertures in the roof - are at once postmodern and authentically 'period'. Costume colours in the finale likewise: cod-pieces flying, this is a Breugel public jollification filtered through the production team's 1990s theatrical intelligence. In many ways Covent Garden showed us one of the most broadly enjoyable of Meistersinger stagings. No doubt it is pure critical curmudgeonliness to have spent Friday evening as I did, simultaneously celebrating and regretting the production stance. At certain points this regret was easily explained: after so much naughty knockabout the gloriously hushed close to Act 2 goes almost unrecorded - except by the intrusive squeaks of the mobile set-partitions as they return to home base. Generally, though, it took the form of a growing awareness that the breadth, depth and, above all, quiet centre of the music were awakening precious few echoes in the events on stage. So much personalised detail among the Mastersingers] So many pratfalls for David and his workmates] So little evening shade and reflective calm in the Act 2 streets of Nuremberg - and only one parched-looking linden tree] Repeatedly I found myself longing for a Meistersinger less determinedly upbeat. Darker shadows are there for the searching-out; and while the notion of Meistersinger-as-Nazi-triumph - as recently explored in a controversial Frankfurt production - might be inappropriately downbeat for a Covent Garden audience, the opera affords a more complex experience than here suggested. Two additional possible causes for these mixed feelings suggest themselves. The first is that Haitink, at his best a Wagnerian of incomparably muscular, direct grip, seemed for the first two acts to be exercising that grip excessively hard. The sound was often oddly abrasive, unblended, with 'interesting' stray ends of brass and choral timbre allowed to protrude, and solo voices sometimes covered. The beautifully thoughtful moulding of the Act 3 gave a taste of the settled-in Haitink Meistersinger soon (no doubt) to be achieved. The second concerns the new Sachs, John Tomlinson, a serious, forceful, deeply committed artist already much prized as a Wagnerian on the Continent and here receiving his belated 'big chance' at Covent Garden. The voice is a mighty instrument - and goodness, how mightily he uses it] On this evidence his bass lacks nothing in Sachs stamina and range but (to my mind) almost everything in Sachs Innigkeit, meditative melancholy, gentleness of statement, and all the other Sachs qualities dependent on legato line steadily sustained. Leaping about like a neurotic leprechaun, Mr Tomlinson certainly captures the shoemaker's restless energy; in voice and person this Sachs is all of a piece. The rest of the cast promote more traditionally Wagnerian vocal values, though peak form eluded most of them on Friday. Gosta Winbergh's Walther, handsomely solid and well-balanced of tenor timbre from beginning to end, needs to produce more personality, more conversational vitality; Deon van der Walt's David, so full of bounce, needs to find more charm and sweetness in his Act 1 recitation; Nancy Gustafson, an Eva of picture-book good looks and apt vocal warmth, needs to make far more of her words. Two Covent Garden 'old hands' at this opera - Gwynne Howell (Pogner), Anne Howells (Magdalene)  -gave great pleasure. And so does Thomas Allen's first Beckmesser, easily the greatest of the evening. It is perhaps a problem - but more for others on stage than the audience - that much of the finest singing should be delivered by this particular character; but there is more to the performance than excellently clean, stylish, colourful vocalisation. In a brilliant feat of character observation, with dead-fish hands a-flutter, spectacles a-fidget, glances madly snatched, with point and purpose in its tiniest eyelid-flicker, Beckmesser's warped intelligence and swiftness of perception are newly imagined. And, as a result, the whole opera is newly enlivened and enriched. Royal Opera, Covent Garden: in repertory until November 13; sponsored by Cable &amp; Wireless and Friends of Covent Garden</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- A jump in U.S. economic  growth in the last three months of 1993 was mainly due to a  steady recovery in U.S. competitiveness in the world market, a  Bank of Japan [BOJ] source said late Tuesday [1 March].    The source made the remarks shortly after the U.S. Commerce  Department announced that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.5  percent in annualized terms in the October-December quarter.    "Expansion in exports contributed chiefly to the  improvements," the source said.    Touching on the yen-dollar rate, the BOJ source said, "Forex  players will now shift their attention to economic conditions of  both countries -- away from Japan's domestic political  uncertainty -- with mounting expectations that a gap in their  economic fundamentals will not shrink further for a while."</p>

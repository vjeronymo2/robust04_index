Grachev told his U.S. counterpart during a telephone  conversation on Monday that "the position of the Muslim side  regarding the NATO demands and the presence of the Russian force  in Sarajevo is not clear for Russia" and warned that any  provocations against the Russian peace-keepers would result in  "a sharp aggravation of the situation and will disrupt mutual  efforts."    The presence of U.S. peace-keepers in Muslim areas "would  strengthen the situation in general and we could have ensured a  close interaction between our servicemen," Grachev said.    However, Perry rejected the invitation.</p>

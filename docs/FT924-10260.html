			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses end mixed after volatile week BOURSES closed mixed after a volatile week, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM, with the exception of Elsevier, closed the week sharply lower as Daf fell further and fears began to mount of more bad corporate news. The CBS Tendency index lost 1.1 to 101.8, down 2.4 per cent on the week. Elsevier rallied as revised terms were announced for its merger with Reed whereby the UK publisher will reduce its stake in the Dutch group from 11.5 per cent to 5.8 per cent. The revision has been necessary following the devaluation of sterling following its exit from the ERM. Elsevier's shares rose to a day's high of Fl 115.70 before slipping back on profit-taking to close up Fl 2 at Fl 112. A foreign institution was believed to have been behind the sale of a large parcel of Daf shares and the price slipped below Fl 10, closing down Fl 1.30 at Fl 9.30, a fall of some 13 per cent on the week. Investors were nervous about Akzo's interim figures, due next week, following Thursday's poor third-quarter results from DSM, which was unchanged at Fl 77.20. Akzo lost Fl 1.70 on the day to Fl 125.30. FRANKFURT took a breather after a week beset by bad economic and corporate news. The DAX index closed down 1.32 at 1,492.32, a 2.3 per cent fall on the week. Turnover fell to DM3.1bn from DM4.8bn. There was little fresh corporate news to excite interest and there was further selling of some of the week's biggest losers. Porsche shed DM6 to DM455, a 3 per cent fall since Monday. After a few, disappointing days, banks went against the trend: Deutsche Bank rose DM1.20 to DM653.70, Dresdner Bank put on DM2.40 to DM356.00 while Commerzbank managed a rise of 70 pfg to DM240.70. RWE, which gave an optimistic forecast about current year earnings, dropped DM2 to DM395.70. PARIS rebounded slightly after Thursday's loss, as the CAC-40 index ended 11.53 higher at 1,742.40, down 1.4 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr2.6bn, bloated by month-end arbitrage. The market will be closed on Monday. Axa added a further FFr27 or 3.3 per cent to FFr839 following its respectable interim results. There were also hopes that lower interest rates might help to enhance the bond portfolio held by its US subsidiary, Equitable Life. Generale des Eaux fell another FFr50 to FFr1,876 on reports that a leading domestic broker had taken the stock off its recommended list after its interim results. MILAN ended higher in lively trading on hopes of a further cut in interest rates and short-covering ahead of the weekend. The Comit index rose 10.52 to 439.03, 5.2 per cent higher on the week, and turnover was estimated at a high L300bn after L190bn on Thursday. Fiat rose L195 or 5 per cent to L4,495 and Mediobanca was up L800 or 7 per cent to L12,120. Generali gained L550 to L28,950 and Montedison rose L36 to L1,240. STOCKHOLM lost ground in a shortened session ahead of a holiday weekend. The Affarsvarlden index slipped 7.1 to 706.9, a 2 per cent fall on the week. Turnover declined to SKr338m from Thursday's SKr484m. The announcement on Thursday that Svenska Kredit had filed for bankruptcy pulled the banking and financial sector lower, even though the insurer's main shareholders, Trygg-Hansa SPP Holding and Skandia, were unchanged on the day at SKr31 and SKr78.50 respectively. SKF B shares fell another SKr5 to SKr65 after its disappointing interim figures earlier in the week. BRUSSELS closed mixed in trading dominated by Petrofina and Kredietbank. The Bel-20 index inched 2.61 higher to 1,139.96, little changed on the week. Petrofina closed at the day's high, up BFr300 or 3.9 per cent at BFr8,080 ahead of news of planned safety investments demanded by the Norwegian government for the Ekofisk oil field. Kredietbank, which on Thursday announced a 15 per cent increase in first-half profit, climbed BFr90 to BFr5,630. ZURICH rose on short-covering ahead of the weekend. The SMI index gained 6.1 to 1,911.1, a fall of 0.5 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 30                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1024.89   1025.08   1025.79   1026.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1086.60   1088.54   1088.36   1088.43  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes         13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1026.73   1028.74   1029.69   1028.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1089.79   1091.29   1092.04   1090.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 29    Oct 28    Oct 27    Oct 26    Oct 23  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1025.26   1028.09   1038.79   1038.16   1034.38 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1086.76   1091.64   1100.79   1104.46   1108.83  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1030.76; 200 - 1093.16 Low/day: 100 - 1024.45 200 - 1086.60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Barry Parker] </F>   JERUSALEM, March 1 (AFP) - Israel released about 500  Palestinians on Tuesday [1 March] in a bid to calm the fury  ignited by the Hebron massacre, but Palestinians warned that  much more will be needed before Middle East peace talks resume.    Military officials said there would be further releases  Wednesday and a total of up to 500 by the end of the week.    However former Palestinian spokesman Hanan 'Ashrawi  dismissed  the gesture as window-dressing when more than 10,000  Palestinians are in Israeli jails.    "We are not looking for appearance we are looking for  serious  substance," she said.    None of those released killed or wounded Israelis, none  belonged to groups opposed to peace such as Hamas and none had  committed crimes since the September 13 autonomy deal.    "These releases are just a drop in the ocean without any  political significance," said 27-year-old Nasir 'Azzah who was  bussed back home to Ramallah on the occupied West Bank just 11  days before he completed a 21-month sentence.    "I'm not as happy as saddened and angered by the massacre in  Hebron. Releasing 1,000 prisoners is not enough," said Ihsan  'Awdah, 25, who returned home to Bethlehem six months before the  end of five years inside.    The carnage at the Tomb of the Patriarchs on Friday sparked  widespread rioting which has left another 17 Arabs dead and  hundreds wounded and Palestinian leaders ordered no celebrations  for the releases.    It has also led the PLO, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon to snub  US  President Bill Clinton's call for snap talks to turn tragedy  into a peace catalyst.    Sufyan 'Abu-Zaydah, a senior Gaza Strip official with  Arafat's Fatah movement, said: "It's too small a number. There  are at least 4,000 prisoners in jail on ridiculous charges.    "Israel could free them immediately to calm the Palestinian  population."    According to international human rights groups Israel  detains  about 500 Palestinians a week during normal times.    Abu-Zaydah said the release of large numbers of inmates was  "the only way to appease the population of the occupied  territories".    But violence in the territories and Arab areas of Israel  subsided with more than half of the two million Palestinians  still under curfew. Troops shot six Palestinians in Gaza City  on Tuesday compared with dozens in preceding days.    Israel nonetheless reinforced patrols in the territories and  along the borders, fearing attacks. Army chief of staff Ehud  Baraq said the army was bracing for a wave of revenge attacks.    Pro-Israeli militia forces killed four Islamic guerrillas in  southern Lebanon.    The prison release -- a few days ahead of the annual  liberation of a few hundred Palestinians to mark the end of the  fasting month of Ramadan -- was part of a package of measures  announced Sunday.    They included a crackdown on hardline settlers who supported  the mosque killer Barukh Goldstein, but the PLO rejected them as  inadequate.    Police Minister Moshe Shahal vowed that four Jewish  extremist  ringleaders who backed the massacre, would be hunted down and  detained without trial.    He said the killing of 30 Moslems according to the army and  52 according to Palestinian doctors, had crossed a "red line".    Leaders of the anti-Arab Kach and Kahana Hay groups, with  which the killer had close links, went underground as the  government ordered their arrest. Only one was caught in a  police swoop.    Shahal said "a few dozen" members of the movements would be  disarmed and their movements restricted. Kach membership was  below 100 and Kahana Hay even smaller, he said.    The government also announced multi-million shekel (one  dollar is worth three shekels) compensation to relatives of the  dead and wounded.    It was the third release since the September agreement. Some  617 were allowed out on October 26 and on January 7, another 101  Palestinians walked free, most just a few days before the end of  their time.    The last 200 of 415 Palestinian fundamentalists deported on  December 17, 1992, were also brought back a year later.</p>

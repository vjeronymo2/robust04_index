			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad al-Nashashibi, Palestinian </F> Authority "finance minister," by Pascal Lacorie in Jerusalem;  date not given: "Palestinian Autonomy: `Agreement With Israel  Utterly Unbalanced'" -- first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES  introduction]    [Text] Muhammad al-Nashashibi is the Palestinian  Authority's new finance "minister." Based in Jericho, this  68-year-old banker is preparing to draft his first budget.    [Lacorie] How much time do you require to collect taxes for  the first time?    [Al-Nashashibi] Everything should be operational within a  month at the most. However, we have a huge task ahead of us.  For instance, I need to find Palestinians to replace the 351  Israelis who took care of fiscal and financial matters as part  of the military administration.    We also need to recover all computer files pertaining to  taxes and custom duties currently scattered among various  Israeli ministries.    [Lacorie] Did you receive the $42-million (240 million  French francs) in emergency aid which the international  community pledged to grant earlier this month?    [Al-Nashashibi] No, we have not received anything so far.  This is not what matters right now, though. We must first set  to work, and the money will follow.    [Lacorie] Has Yasir 'Arafat postponed his arrival in the  autonomous territories to protest the fact that this aid package  has still not materialized?    [Al-Nashashibi] President 'Arafat stated that he could not  come in a bankruptcy context, but there are other reasons as  well. In any case, the other members of the Palestinian  Authority will come to Jericho in two weeks; I hope the  president will do the same.    [Lacorie] What do you think of the economic component of the  agreement entered into with Israel?    [Al-Nashashibi] This agreement, which was put together in  Paris, is utterly unbalanced, and we shall try to renegotiate it  as soon as possible, as all it does is protect Israeli  interests. We had to agree to applying the same custom duties  as Israel does, for the sole purpose of sparing Israeli firms  any inconvenience. Another example: We shall be able to sell  oil fuels at a price only 15 percent lower than that in Israel,  even though we could have purchased oil products at a much  better price from Arab countries and passed the saving on to our  population.    Obviously, should we fail to make significant amendments to  the agreement, the Palestinian population will be very  disappointed and frustrated.</p>

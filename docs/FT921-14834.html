			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Gold was in retreat on the London bullion market after last week's rally. However, prices were underpinned by support around Dollars 350 to Dollars 353 a troy ounce, and the market is still expected to challenge resistance around Dollars 358 to Dollars 360 later this week. Dealers said the surprisingly high level of physical gold demand generated by bargain hunting in the first half of last week was not evident yesterday as the dollar maintained its firmer tone, making gold less attractive in other currencies. On the LME three-month lead closed below the equivalent of Dollars 535 a tonne, considered by many traders a crucial chart point signalling a fall to Dollars 500. There is no encouragement for bulls from fundamentals, with offtake in both original unit and replacements battery sectors remaining flat. London cocoa prices drifted lower. 'The market has been consolidating, with possibly a bit of origin selling coming in at the higher levels putting a lid on prices,' said one dealer, adding support was plotted around Pounds 720 a tonne for March and Pounds 740 for May. The market is looking ahead to European fourth quarter 1991 grind figures due out this week and watching Ivorian arrivals, which are expected to begin tapering off. Compiled from Reuters</p>

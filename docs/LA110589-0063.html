			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREKKING IN NEPAL  </P> <P> Frank Riley's article on trekking in Nepal ("Colorful Nepal Is Still a Favorite  Spot for Treks," Oct. 22) is preceded by a small heading: "Adventure Travel."  From our experience, his descriptions should be classified as "Adventure Travel  For People With Money to Burn."  </P> <P> It is completely unnecessary to book Nepal treks from home because trekking  companies are plentiful throughout Katmandu and Pokhara, and the rates are  roughly half those quoted in the article.  </P> <P> It does take a day for the trekking company to obtain trekking permits and  food, but most travelers would probably appreciate a day to recover from the  long flight before setting out on a trek.  </P> <P> Trips to Chitwan National Park are also very inexpensive ($45 per person for a  three-day trip, including bus transportation) for people willing to put up with  rustic accommodations and no electricity. For us, this price included food,  accommodations, an elephant ride, a jungle walk, bird watching and a canoe  ride, as well as the biggest adventure of all: a nine-hour ride on the roof of  a bus with 50 other people and a goat, to return to Katmandu.  </P> <P> For some people, this may be a bit too much of an adventure!  </P> <P> TARA and PETER COOPER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

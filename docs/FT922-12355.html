			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Fimbra acts after Renton arrest WAVERLEY Fund Manage-ment, the private-client arm of unit trust managers Waverley Asset Management, has been suspended by Fimbra, the financial advisers' regulatory body, Norma Cohen writes. Mr Kenneth Renton, a Waverley director, was charged on Thursday with obtaining Pounds 1.55m by deception. He was remanded until Monday. Mr Renton, who resigned as a director of Edinburgh-based Waverley Asset Management on February 6, was also a director of Wentworth Investment Services. On Wednesday Wentworth was suspended by Fimbra in connection with the alleged disappearance of Pounds 4.5m from four investors. It is not clear exactly how much investors' money is said to be missing from either of the two concerns. Although Mr Renton was a director of Waverley, a holding company for several investment businesses, he was said by it yesterday to have had responsibility for only the private-client business. Waverley has been winding down its private-client business for some time and had about Pounds 1m under management, according to an official there. It is believed that all of those funds are missing. Meanwhile Waverley's other businesses, which include the management of quoted unit trusts, are under review by Imro and Lautro, self-regulating bodies to which Waverley belongs. The company said yesterday that it had not received notification of any official investigation, although 'discussions with Imro have naturally taken place following the arrest of Mr Renton'. There is no suggestion that other directors of Waverley knew of Mr Renton's alleged activities or that other businesses have been affected. Regulators are due to meet the directors on Tuesday.</p>

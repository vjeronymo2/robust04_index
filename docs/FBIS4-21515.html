			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "River Transfers May Satisfy Water </F> Needs"]    [Text] Drinking water will be delivered by pipeline and  river from Wales to London and from Nottinghamshire to Essex  under a National Rivers Authority (NRA) plan published yesterday.    The authority calculates that to move water between river  systems by pipeline would be cheaper than reservoirs. Thames  Water has already put it's plan for a new reservoir in south  Oxfordshire on hold.    The NRA stressed yesterday that neither pipelines nor  reservoirs were yet needed because water conservation would  create savings to satisfy demand well into the next century.  However, since schemes like transfers from Wales to London  would take 2 years to complete consideration should begin now.    Reservoirs have been constructed that turned out not to be  needed, most notably the Kielder in Northumberland. The NRA has  therefore worked on a cautious approach which suggests that in  some circumstances no new strategic schemes will be needed. If  metering were introduced and leakage from old mains cut  substantially, future demand could be met from existing sources.    If demand rises above this level, pipelines are cheaper than  reservoirs. It would cost 57 million pounds less to build a  pipeline from the Severn to the Thames than to build a reservoir  in south Oxfordshire.    Anglian, Thames and East Midlands areas may require new  schemes. The East Midlands shortages are expected to be met by  tapping-rising groundwater around Birmingham. In East Anglia a  reservoir could be built or water transferred via pipelines and  rivers from the Trent south-east to Essex, and in London water  diverted from the rivers Wye and Severn.    Lilli Matson, Council for the Protection of Rural England  campaigns officer, welcomed the emphasis on saving resources.  She said control of Ieakage from pipelines would be important.  Thames loses 23 percent of water through leakage, compared with  10 percent for some German undertakings.</p>

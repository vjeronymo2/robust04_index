			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Thailand acts to tighten rules on share offerings Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday announced new rules governing initial public offerings of stock, in an attempt to broaden share ownership and end corrupt deals involving underpriced shares in newly-listed companies. The new regulations, which come into effect on Friday, require companies making IPOs to offer at least 30 per cent of the new stock to small investors; in the event of oversubscription, these shares must be allocated randomly by computer. Underwriters are allowed to allocate a further 60 per cent of the offer to their clients and other buyers, provided that the method of distribution has been disclosed in the prospectus. The SEC said owners and managers of the company cannot receive allocations from this tranche, but ordinary employees can. The company itself can allocate the remaining 10 per cent of the stock on offer, but again the owners and managers are excluded. Foreign stockbrokers generally welcomed the new SEC regulations. 'If they can enforce it, it will be really quite useful,' said one Bangkok-based broker. Until now, there have been no rules in Thailand about the distribution of shares from IPOs. It has been common practice for company executives to enrich themselves and buy favours from politicians and civil servants by allocating shares at low prices. 'They would price it at a huge discount, only sell a very small part of the company and then make sure it all went to themselves and their friends,' the broker said. After an IPO of a Thai company, a few shareholders would often control the market in the shares and force the price up before selling their holdings at a large profit. 'There have been a great deal of complaints that small investors can't get their hands on IPOs,' Mr Rapee Sucharitakul, SEC spokesman, said yesterday. 'The real objective (of the new rules) is to have a fairer distribution of shares,' he added. The two-year-old Thai SEC suffered a setback last month when a court acquitted Mr Song Watcharasriroj - known as Sia ('tycoon') Song - and 11 others of acting in concert to ramp the share price of Bangkok Bank of Commerce, but it is continuing its efforts to improve regulation of the lively Thai stock exchange. The SEC said yesterday that it was drawing up rules similar to those governing the banking sector to ensure that securities companies had sufficient net capital to do business safely. Sahaviriya Steel Industry is likely to be the first IPO to be affected, AP-DJ adds from Bangkok. The company, a subsidiary of the Sahaviriya group, is due to issue shares around July 18. To meet the definition of 'small-scale' under the rules, investors cannot buy more than Bt500,000 worth of an IPO with a total value of Bt1bn. For issues worth up to Bt2bn, the limit is Bt1m and for issues larger than Bt2bn, the limit is Bt2m, the SEC said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 16 SAPA -- A caller claiming to be  Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA] Commander Karl Zimbiri  on Wednesday afternoon claimed repsonsibility for an attack in  south-east Johannesburg that left two Alberton traffic officers  critically wounded and a woman injured. Police said earlier the  three were shot by the occupants of a bakkie [pick-up truck] the  officers stopped near Alberton on Wednesday morning.    Police spokesman Lt Deon Peens said in a statement Mr H R J  Killian, 35, was wounded and the main artery in one of his legs  was severed, while Mr H van der Westhuizen, 44, was shot in the  head. They were admitted to hospital. A woman, whose name has  not been released, was wounded in the buttocks while she was  sitting in a taxi near the scene of the shooting.    Commander "Zimbiri" used a pre-arranged code in his call but  there was no other way SAPA could independently verify the  authenticity of the call.    He said the Alberton attack killed three officers --  "whites,  naturally." There was no immediate explanation for the  discrepency between his account of the attack and the police  version.    The caller added the attack formed part of a "farewell  programme" for APLA Commander Sabelo Phama who died in a motor  accident in Tanzania last week.    "Zimbiri" claimed the death had been no accident and that  Phama had been assassinated in a plot jointly planned by South  Africa's National Intelligence Services and the USA's CIA.    APLA is the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress of  Azania.</p>

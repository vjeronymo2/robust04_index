			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THIS GUY WALKED RIGHT INTO HORNETS' NEST  </P> <P> A man was arrested at Charlotte Coliseum Sunday after he walked into the home  team's locker room before the Hornets' game against Cleveland and tried to  dress in Charlotte guard Rickey Green's uniform.  </P> <P> Charlotte forward Kelly Tripucka, who at first thought the intruder was a  reporter, said: "After about five minutes, he moved over to Rickey's locker and  he started getting undressed. I was laughing at him.  </P> <P> "I said, 'What's this guy doing?' Nobody knows him and he's got his pants off.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to make sure he didn't have a gun. When he had his pants off, I  could see he was unarmed.  </P> <P> "He was determined to get dressed and get ready for the game," Tripucka said  after the Hornets lost to the Cavaliers, 110-91. "The sad thing is, we probably  could have used him."  </P> <P> No Respect Dept.: West Virginia, ranked No. 15 in the latest Associated Press  basketball poll, has the nation's longest winning streak at 16 games.  </P> <P> But after starting the season 1-2, the Mountaineers weren't ranked in the top  20 until last week, when they earned the No. 18 spot.  </P> <P> Being overlooked in the polls is nothing new for West Virginia.  </P> <P> "We were ranked quicker this year than we were in 1982," Coach Gale Catlett  said. "In 1982, we had a 16-game winning streak and went 17-1 and didn't get  ranked until Feb. 4. We got in there this time a week ahead of time."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What was memorable about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's first All-Star game  appearance in 1970? (Answer to follow.)  </P> <P> HBO is staging a press conference in the Time-Life Building in New York today  at which an overflow crowd of about 500 is expected, about 200 more than  invited.  </P> <P> HBO is promoting its Thursday night showing of "Sports Illustrated: The Making  of the Swimsuit Issue," and among those present at the press conference will be  Christie Brinkley, Elle Macpherson, Cheryl Tiegs, and this year's cover girl,  Kathy Ireland.  </P> <P> Said HBO publicist Tony Fox: "Usually we're lucky if we get close to 50%  response for a press conference, but for this one it's been unbelievable. It  seems everyone wants to go."  </P> <P> Wonder why.  </P> <P> Generosity Dept.: Burt Grossman, defensive end from the University of  Pittsburgh and a likely first-round National Football League draft choice, said  he will donate $100,000 to Pitt's scholarship fund and $5,000 to his high  school, Archbishop Carroll High in Bala Cynwyd, a suburb of Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to show my appreciation for the great opportunity that has been  afforded me in high school and college," Grossman said.  </P> <P> Grossman said the gifts aren't contingent on his being a No. 1 selection in the  April draft.  </P> <P> Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried said: "What makes this even more special is that Burt  Grossman made this commitment without knowing what is going to happen in the  draft.  </P> <P> "It is a great example for athletes everywhere who may have the opportunity to  give something back to their schools."  </P> <P> 26 Years Ago Today: On Feb. 7, 1963, Wilt Chamberlain of the San Francisco  Warriors scored 56 points in a 134-129 loss to the Cincinnati Royals.  </P> <P> 23 Years Ago Today: On Feb. 7, 1966, Chamberlain scored 65 points to lead the  Warriors to a 132-125 victory over the Lakers.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Abdul-Jabbar, a rookie with the Milwaukee Bucks, fouled out  after playing 18 minutes and scoring 10 points. The other center on his team,  Willis Reed, also fouled out.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Bob Knight, asked by Dick Vitale during an ESPN interview if he had ever done  anything he regretted: "Yeah. Back in 1968, we (Army) played Notre Dame in the  NIT, and at halftime I could have done a better job of coaching."  </P></p>

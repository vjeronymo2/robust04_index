			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer Virtue would seem to have found its reward since Marks and Spencer announced its full-year figures in May. Having been criticised through the recession for static sales, Marks' Outstanding Value campaign delivered growth last year. The knockers then lighted on the company's annual pay award, despite assurances that productivity gains would offset the costs. This they duly did with staff numbers falling by 4 per cent during the last six months despite the new store opening programme. While it is true that the wage award only cut in half way through the current period, the cost base is still under control. The shares have justifiably done well. Fears now centre on Marks' food business since live ammunition is being fired in the supermarket price war. Clearly M&amp;S cannot defy gravity. Yet it has a small, if profitable, niche which does not overlap strongly with the majority of the grocers' business. It makes little sense for the supermarkets to attack it, and if they did Marks' lower cost base and focus would prove good defences. Besides, entering the market would not be easy as much of the specialist food manufacturing capacity is already tied up by M&amp;S. Cost control, further benefits from high spending on information technology and the sales drive should keep earnings bubbling. M&amp;S is well positioned to benefit from the much-touted virtuous circle of lower costs, lower margins and rising volumes. Even if the company's cautious view of 1994 proves correct, dividend growth prospects justify a premium rating. And since the shares are still towards the lower end of their historical rating range, sceptics have a tough case to make.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEFIANT, HOSTILE NORTH TESTIFIES POINDEXTER DIRECTED CONTRA EFFORT  </P> <P> Oliver L. North, a reluctant and testy leadoff witness at John M. Poindexter's  trial, testified today that he was operating at the direction of Poindexter and  other Reagan Administration superiors when he guided a covert operation arming  the Nicaraguan Contras.  </P> <P> North testified that he was told "in so many words" he was responsible for the  Contras and kept Poindexter, then-President Ronald Reagan's national security  adviser, fully informed of his work to help the anti-Sandinista rebels after  Congress ordered U.S. military aid shut off.  </P> <P> Compelled to testify by Iran-Contra prosecutors, North was labeled a "hostile  witness" by the judge in Poindexter's trial and admitted nothing without a  struggle during his day on the stand.  </P> <P> Under questioning by prosecutor Dan Webb, he reluctantly admitted that he  supervised the arms-supply operation put together by retired Air Force Maj.  Gen. Richard V. Secord.  </P> <P> "At no time, as you were running your operation, you never tried to conceal or  hide what you were doing from either Admiral Poindexter or Robert McFarlane?"  Webb asked, the second reference being to Poindexter's predecessor.  </P> <P> "I did not," North said.  </P> <P> "Were you ever trying to direct that operation on your own, independent of your  superiors?" Webb asked.  </P> <P> "Never," North replied.  </P> <P> "Didn't you keep them apprised of all of your Contra-related activities?" Webb  asked.  </P> <P> "Yes," North said.  </P> <P> Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who succeeded McFarlane in late 1985,  is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts  of making false statements. The charges concern accusations that he tried to  cover up North's military assistance and fund-raising for the Contras as well  as White House knowledge of a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.  </P> <P> North testified that Poindexter, while he was McFarlane's deputy, was among  those who told him to work to provide assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras as  Congress was shutting off direct U.S. military aid.  </P> <P> Poindexter "told you you were becoming the person who would replace the CIA" as  the source of military support for the Contras? he was asked.  </P> <P> "I don't want to put those words in his mouth," North said, but "in that  general time frame he was one of the persons."  </P> <P> "You were told, were you not, that you were supposed to go fund and arm the  Contras?" Webb asked.  </P> <P> "In so many words, yes," North said. But he disputed Webb's suggestion that he  set up an "enterprise" with Secord and others to buy and ship arms to the  Contras.  </P> <P> "It began as something small, it evolved over time," North said.  </P> <P> Webb asked North if he could recall the late CIA Director William J. Casey  telling him "the ball is in your hands" after Congress shut off funds for the  rebels.  </P> <P> "In words to that effect," North replied.  </P></p>

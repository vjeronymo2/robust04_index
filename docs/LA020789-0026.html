			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIRT CHEAP?;  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO EXPLORES TOXIC-SITE CLEANUP AT A FRACTION OF STATE ESTIMATE  </P> <P> Frustrated with the state's failure to clean up an Escondido toxic waste dump  designated one of California's most hazardous, city leaders are exploring doing  the job themselves. If they proceed, the city would become one of the first  local communities to preempt the slow-moving state cleanup program.  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis said the council will consider the issue at  its Wednesday meeting after hearing David Merk, a San Diego County  hazardous-materials specialist, outline the problem and explore the means to  clean up the site at a fraction of the cost estimated by the state.  </P> <P> State estimates for removal of contaminated materials from the Chatham Brothers  Barrel Yard range from $1.8 million to $2 million. Merk said the job can be  done for less than $200,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Soil or Barrels Removed  </P> <P> In 1982, the state declared the site in rural southwestern Escondido one of  California's 20 most hazardous, and budgeted more than $2.2 million for tests  and studies during the following seven years, without removing any of the  contaminated soil or barrels of waste from the site.  </P> <P> The 7-acre property near Gamble Lane and Bernardo Avenue was operated as an  industrial waste dump from 1941 until 1980. Studies have indicated that high  concentrations of PCBs, lead and other cancer-causing materials are present in  the soil. About 200 barrels containing industrial wastes remain on the  property, and it is suspected that other tanks and barrels lie beneath the  surface.  </P> <P> Karen Baker, state project manager for the Chatham site, estimated that another  $427,000 worth of studies are needed before cleanup can begin. But Merk  contends that the cleanup can be conducted with on-site testing to determine  the extent of the contamination.  </P> <P> He presented several estimates to officials of the state Department of Health  Services, indicating that  </P> <P> about 400 cubic yards of soil can be removed to a toxic waste dump for $118,000  to $175,000 -- about a 10th of the cost the state has estimated to incinerate  the toxic waste.  </P> <P> Bob Borzelleri, chief of external affairs for the state Toxic Substances  Control Division, cautioned that the Chatham site is "a very complicated  problem" that could be made more dangerous by a hasty cleanup.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Naive Viewpoint'  </P> <P> "If we move too fast, we run the risk of making significant mistakes," he said.  "I know the residents down there think we have been dragging our feet, but that  is a very naive viewpoint."  </P> <P> Borzelleri said he knows of no other community that has undertaken a toxic  waste cleanup.  </P> <P> DeDominicis has placed the Chatham issue on the council's Wednesday night  agenda, proposing that the city advance $200,000 for the cleanup, then attempt  to recover the funds from the state "for its failure to act."  </P> <P> State officials have been conducting cleanup work on about 70 toxic sites  around the state with funds raised from a $100-million bond issue approved in  1984. Those funds have dwindled to a few hundred thousand dollars, and efforts  are under way to obtain another $100 million.  </P> <P> Mike Arnold, Escondido's legislative representative in Sacramento, said that,  of the initial $100-million fund, 67% has been spent on administration.  </P> <P> Escondido has been considering placing a building moratorium on property near  the dump site because of possible claims against the city if the contamination  has spread.  </P> <P> Recommendation Delayed  </P> <P> Bob Leiter, city planning director, said his staff has delayed any  recommendation to the council on the moratorium until the state does further  studies to determine what areas might be contaminated.  </P> <P> By mid-1988, the toxics control division had spent more than $1 million on  studies and containment measures at Chatham, fencing the area and containing  surface drainage from the site.  </P> <P> At a meeting of a citizens advisory committee last month, state officials  unveiled another million-dollar budget containing further investigative work  but no toxic waste removal.  </P> <P> Jack Kearns, who heads the state's Long Beach toxic control office, said that  Merk "raised a very good question" in challenging the state's waste-removal  methods and use of the much more costly incineration method of disposal, "but  we don't have the answer yet."  </P> <P> Kearns contended that the federal Environmental Protection Agency standards  require incineration of certain toxics, including PCBs and other volatile  materials, but added that the rules may have been relaxed.  </P> <P> EPA spokesman Terry Wilson said he knows of no federal laws to prohibit  disposal of hazardous wastes in approved disposal sites.  </P> <P> "If so, we have a whole new ballgame," because initial Chatham cleanup costs  could be reduced from $2 million to $200,000, Kearns said.  </P> <P> Because of the high cost of incinerating the waste, state officials have taken  the position that toxics on the Chatham site, secured behind a fence, pose no  danger to nearby residents and that available funds are better spent in  determining if there is contamination in the air or the underground water  table.  </P> <P> Merk contends that removal of the contaminated soil and deteriorating barrels  on the site would ensure that the air and ground water around the site are not  further contaminated.  </P></p>

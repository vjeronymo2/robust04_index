			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / NY Post files for protection THE New York Post yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection and failed to publish amid a newsroom mutiny over plans to sack about 270 people by the paper's latest potential publisher, Mr Abraham Hirschfeld. According to a spokesman for Mr Peter Kalikow, the Post's current owner, yesterday's Chapter 11 joint filing was part of Mr Hirschfeld's acquisition agreement. The bankruptcy petition would freeze the Post's debts and help the paper continue operating. Property investor Mr Hirschfeld was quoted as saying that he was more interested in the Post's Manhattan building than the paper itself.</p>

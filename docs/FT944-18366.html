			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Observer: Excess slop If Ms Pasternak gets upset at the reviews of her work, she should spare a thought for poor old Dan Moldea. Moldea has just spent a small fortune taking the New York Times all the way to to the US Supreme Court because the paper's reviewer had rubbished his book, Interference: how organized crime influences professional football. The review, written by Times sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi, concluded that there was 'too much sloppy journalism to trust the bulk of this book's 512 pages'. The Supreme Court agreed and has thrown out Moldea's Dollars 10m lawsuit on the grounds that the NYT review was 'a supportable interpretation of the author's work'. Sloppy journalism as a defence against libel? That's a new one.</p>

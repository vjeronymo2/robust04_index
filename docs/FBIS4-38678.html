			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Yadukha report: "Conference of Centrists To Be Held </F> in Crimea"]    [Text] Preparations are under way in Sevastopol for a  conference of centrist political forces of Russia, Ukraine, and  Belorussia [Belarus] with Kazakhstan and Moldavia [Moldova]  showing interest in it. According to Yuriy Komov, one of the  conference organizers and spokesman for the Crimean Party of  Social Guarantees, the conference is supposed to raise the  question of a new union within the CIS framework.    Taking part in the preparations on behalf on Ukraine is the  Interregional Kuchma-Grinev Bloc of Reforms, and the Civil  Congress of Ukraine. Representing Russia are the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord and the Russian Movement for Democratic  Reforms. Also invited were Social Democrats and Populists.  "The threat of a conflict in Crimea may bring to naught  centrists' unification efforts," Yuriy Komov stated. "Our plan  is to get all the documents signed at the Livadia Palace on the  50th anniversary of the Yalta Conference."</p>

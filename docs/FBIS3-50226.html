			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal  Kovac hopes to give a boost to flagging Slovak-Polish trade on  his forthcoming three-day visit to Poland. Although Poland is  in the top ten of Slovakia's trading partners, the country's  share in total Slovak turnover last year was only 2.5 percent.  The figure has plummeted since 1990, but experts believe the  level will be maintained next year. Therefore, on his visit  from January 25-27, Kovac will be accompanied by a trade  delegation consisting of Chairman of the Slovak Trade and  Industry Chamber Petr Mihok and representatives of companies  which have most contact with Polish companies.    Slovak Economics Ministry figures show that Slovak-Polish  trade was worth 11.7 billion Czechoslovak crowns [Sk] in 1991,  about $390 million, but over the next two years sank to Sk7.7  billion, $255 million, then Sk7.1 billion, $235 million.  Slovakia throughout this has retained a surplus -- the year  before last Sk856 million around, $28.5 million, and in ten  months of last year over a billion crowns, $33 million.    Among the biggest commodities are Polish coal and Slovak  consumer goods and machinery.    We want to revitalize trade with Poland, which has the  biggest market of all the countries in the Central European Free  Trade Area (CEFTA) but which we have the smallest trade turnover  with of all CEFTA countries, Peter Kovac, director of the  transition economy department of the economics ministry, told  CTK today. Peter Kovac, who will also be a member of President  Kovac's trade delegation to Poland, said he did not anticipate  the signing of any trade agreements but did expect new contacts  to be established. Tariff barriers, one of the greatest  obstacles to mutual trade, will be done away with within the  framework of CEFTA in the next few years. However, trade is  also impeded by under-funding and, in Peter Kovac's view,  inadequate contacts and a mutual underestimation of the  partner's products. Kovac nevertheless considers Poland a  promising country, especially as it is the first post-communist  country to achieve an increase in gross domestic product in  spite of high inflation and other economic woes.</p>

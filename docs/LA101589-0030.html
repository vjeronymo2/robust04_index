			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROTHERLY HELP  </P> <P> In Patrick Goldstein's Oct. 8 article, actor Beau Bridges is quoted as saying  that years ago he was afraid his younger brother Jeff "was a pansy," so he took  him out to the park and taught him to throw a curve ball.  </P> <P> Bridges' comment prompts the following open letter:  </P> <P> Beau, my nephew wanted to go see you and Jeff in your new movie, "The Fabulous  Baker Boys." You'll be proud of the fact that I told him:  </P> <P> "No way -- you get out there and play some baseball or I'll think you're a  pansy."  </P> <P> Thanks, Beau. You've saved your brother from a fate worse than death, and now  my nephew is saved too!  </P> <P> By the way, do all of the young people in your performing-arts group have to  prove they're straight to work with you?  </P> <P> Or do you just call them "pansy" or "dyke" if they're not?  </P> <P> Do you send them out to toss a few balls around if you're suspicious?  </P> <P> Patrick Goldstein should not have included your remark in his story and The  Times should not have printed it.  </P> <P> I don't think they did you a favor, and it shows an editorial lack of  sensitivity.  </P> <P> FRANC CAGGIANO  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / More US interest rate cuts urged FURTHER reductions in US interest rates are needed to ensure recovery from recession, the joint economic committee of Congress (JEC) said yesterday in its annual economic report. The Democrat-led committee said reductions in long-term interest rates were important if investment spending was to be revived. Long bond yields are currently just under 8 per cent, or about double the level of rates on three-month deposits. The report urges the Treasury to reduce the 'extraordinarily large gap' between short- and long-term interest rates by selling fewer long-term bonds in quarterly refinancing operations. This would 'reduce the supply of long-term Treasury debt, and lead to a significant increase in bond prices that would lower long-term interest rates'. Small steps in this direction in February's refinancing had been insufficient to convince financial markets that the Treasury was serious about reducing the gap between short- and long-term rates, the report adds. It predicts a sluggish economic recovery later this year, with fears about job security continuing to restrain consumer spending. The report also warns that the US economy is 'badly off track', and says meagre increases in productivity and an overhang of problems from the 1980s  -such as heavily indebted individuals and companies - point to weak growth in the 1990s. Government at all levels needed to invest in 'infrastructure, education and training, and research and development, which have been neglected over the past decade'. To achieve this, while also reducing the budget deficit, the committee advocates the scrapping of budget rules that currently prevent a sizeable shift in spending from military to domestic programmes. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, half as fast as previously estimated, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The weak growth followed increases in GDP of 1.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent at an annual rate in the second and third quarters of last year. The decline in estimated growth in the fourth quarter mainly reflected downward revisions to net exports and business inventories. For 1991 as a whole, GDP fell 0.7 per cent, the first decline since 1982, when the economy contracted by 2.2 per cent.</p>

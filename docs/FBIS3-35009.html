In its appeal to Washington, Israel is asking that  the U.S. Administration guarantee that the understandings  reached with Syria, which ended Operation Accountability, are  upheld. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports:    [Begin Raz recording] Last night, Israel signaled -- which  may be an understatement -- the gravity with which it regards  the katyusha shelling early Wednesday [16 February]. In  addition to the sharply worded announcement, which I will read  out in a minute, Israel called on the United States to guarantee  what it called the understandings that led to the conclusion of  Operation Accountability and attempted to convey through  Washington the gravity with which it regards the violation of  the understandings. The Israeli request was sent to the highest  echelons in Washington through several channels.    According to what is known, the katyusha was fired by a  Palestinian organization called 13 Black September, but Israel  says the shelling could not have been carried out without an  understanding with Hizballah, thereby pointing an accusing  finger at other elements. Operation Accountability ended in  response to a U.S. effort to bring about a cease-fire. U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher intervened personally with  Israel and Syria to achieve the agreement. Israel's  interpretation, therefore, is that the understandings were  achieved with Syria, which is responsible for maintaining them.    The Jerusalem statement says: The highest security elements  take a grave view of the katyusha shelling at Israeli soil,  which violates the understandings that led to the conclusion of  Operation Accountability.    That is the signal and that is the Israeli position in the  wake of the katyusha fired before dawn on Wednesday. [end  recording]    Israeli delegates also relayed a similar protest to the  Syrian and Lebanese representatives to the Washington peace  talks. Our Washington correspondent Arye Golan reports:    [Begin Golan recording] Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, head  of the Israeli delegation, reminded his Syrian counterpart,  Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, that although Syria is not directly  responsible for the incident, it was a party to the August 1993  agreement between Israel and Lebanon, signed under U.S. auspices  following Warren Christopher's mediation. Uri Lubrani, head of  the delegation to the talks with Lebanon, demanded from his  counterpart, Suhayl Shammas, that Lebanon restrain Hizballah in  order to prevent a deterioration in the situation along the  northern border.    Professor Rabinovich explained to the head of the Syrian  delegation the importance of public diplomacy. He said that we  know that in its Hebrew-language broadcasts, Damascus Radio uses  the term normal peace relations, but that is not enough because  these broadcasts do not have many listeners in Israel. On the  other hand, he criticized Damascus' refusal to permit Knesset  Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah to pay a condolence visit to  Syria following the death of President al-Asad's son. Had he  been permitted entry, Amb. Rabinovich said, it would have been a  true gesture, but the Syrians did not use the opportunity to  show their good intentions.    Al-'Allaf complained about Israeli charges that Syria is  making do with a powerless and relatively unimportant pensioner  like himself as its representative at the talks. The day,  therefore, passed in an exchange of recriminations. [end  recording]</p>

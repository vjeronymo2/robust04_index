			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Diafoil did not respond to the Department's questionnaire. Therefore, we are using best information available for the purposes of this review. As best information for Diafoil, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin to be 14.00 percent, the highest margin calculated in the original investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Toray, we calculated the United States price based on purchase price as all U.S. sales were made to unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Tariff Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Toray, we calculated purchase price based on f.o.b. Japanese port or delivered U.S. customer prices. We made deductions, where appropriate, for price adjustments (rebates). We also made deductions, where appropriate, for the costs of foreign inland freight, containerization, warehousing, credit expense, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. inland freight in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Teijin, we calculated purchase price based on f.o.b. Japanese port or delivered U.S. customer prices. We made deductions, where appropriate, for price adjustments (rebates). We also made deductions, where appropriate, for the costs of foreign inland freight and insurance, bank charges, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight, warehousing, commissions, credit insurance, indirect selling expenses (U.S. and non-U.S.), inventory carrying charges, other expense, U.S. duty, harbor and U.S. Customs user fees, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. inland freight and insurance in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for both Toray and Teijin, we made adjustments for the value added tax applied in the home market. On October 7, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition to U. S. price (USP) under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise at the same point the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 at 12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision. The Department will add to USP the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments will deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate the foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

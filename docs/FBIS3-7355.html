			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the  Central Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of  Korea [LSWYK] in a statement today denounced the dangerous  military moves of the Kim Yong-sam group which resorts to a  fascist rule and frantic war racket while advertising "civilian  government."    The statement branded them as reckless acts to put the youth  and students and other people of South Korea on the altar of war  and plunge the whole nation into a nuclear scourge.    The statement said:    Despite strong protest and denunciation from people at home  and abroad, the South Korean authorities are introducing Patriot  missiles from the United States and [are] going to resume the  Team Spirit joint military exercises with their U.S. master and  inciting a dangerous war fever after issuing a "special alert  order" to the puppet Army.    Frequent sparks kindle a flame.    The bellicose elements of South Korea must refrain from a  rash act, clearly knowing that confrontation and war will  precipitate their own destruction.    We have the might of singlehearted unity with which to smash  any aggressor forces at one blow.    The entire youth and students in the Northern half of the  country will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's  confrontation row and war provocation moves.    The Korean people are fully prepared to answer a war with a  war.</p>

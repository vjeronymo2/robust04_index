			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Leading Article: No quick fix in Haiti Even though Mr Jimmy Carter succeeded in reaching a deal with Haiti's military junta to avert an invasion, the Clinton administration is making a mistake if it is hoping for a brief engagement with this troublesome and unhappy nation. US armed forces will not be deployed for an attack, but American finance and support for the country - as part of a broad international effort - will be needed over the long term if Haiti is not to slide back to dictatorship or anarchy. The US decision to intervene makes a long-term commitment to Haiti its moral responsibility; without such a commitment, Haiti will all too soon re-emerge as a thorn in Washington's side. Some will argue that US intervention in Haiti is in itself a mistake, and Mr Clinton can certainly be criticised for the confused and contradictory way he has handled the issue in the past two years. He came close to boxing himself into a corner from which the unpopular option of invasion seemed the only exit. Yet that does not mean that the threat of an assault was wrong in principle. Restoring democracy and human rights within Haiti are laudable objectives. The fact that the US cannot act everywhere should not prevent it from acting to restore democracy when that is within its power. The more appropriate question is whether US intervention is likely to achieve its objectives in a nation that, in 190 years of independence, has known only a few months of rule by freely-elected government. Clearly, ousting Haiti's current crop of military leaders will, of itself, not resolve the problem. If the armed forces and the police are not purged and professionalised, it will be only a matter of time before the next military coup. This is a proper subject for international advice and support. However, Haiti's needs will not end there. The entire state - a bloated and inefficient civil service, a corrupt judiciary, barely functioning public enterprises - needs an overhaul. The country's dilapidated infrastructure needs renewing and enlarging. Most urgently, the poorest country in the western hemisphere needs humanitarian aid. In this task, the international financial institutions have a critical role to play: donor countries should move quickly to provide support so that Haiti's arrears to these institutions do not prevent them from providing finance. It is, of course, on the Haitian people that the establishment of democracy will ultimately depend - and on President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the priest deposed by the military in 1991 after seven months in office. While unquestionably the rightful head of state, he has not convinced everybody of his democratic credentials. He has been criticised for not eradicating human rights abuses while president, and for statements in which he apparently incited supporters to violence - though it is true that during his brief tenure in office, he was under pressure from enemies for whom democracy and the rule of law had no meaning. Having invoked democracy to return to Port-au-Prince, Mr Aristide must live by its rules when he arrives there. His statement that he will stand down when his five-year term ends next year, as the constitution demands, is thus welcome. Yet fulfilling the high expectations of his supporters will not be easy. If democracy in Haiti is to have a chance, a long-term international commitment to the country is essential.</p>

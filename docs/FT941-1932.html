			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum cuts loss to Pounds 23.4m Clyde Petroleum, the lossmaking oil and gas exploration company, yesterday warned that a return to profitability was uncertain as long as the oil price remained at historically low levels. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said that in a climate of weak oil prices, a return to profit and to the dividend list depended on two main factors: the speed at which Clyde could build up production and the level of exploration write-offs. This latter factor, which writes off unsuccessful exploration as incurred, was 'unpredictable,' said Mr Gourlay. The group was seeking to reduce the exposure to such factors by reining in exploration. Expenditure on new pros-pects was Pounds 18m last year, against Pounds 30m previously. Clyde was further reducing exploration investment to Pounds 10m this year. The group spent Pounds 93.6m on development, against Pounds 17.46m last time. Some Pounds 36m was budgeted for development this year. Clyde reported lower net losses of Pounds 23.4m for the year to December 31, against a Pounds 39.8m deficit last time. Sales were 2 per cent lower at Pounds 81.6m. The company enjoyed a series of one-off gains which helped to reduce losses. These included an Pounds 8.3m fall in exploration costs to Pounds 34m, a tax clawback of Pounds 5m, and lower provisions of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 11m) on the carrying value of assets. The company also benefited from the hedging of 80 per cent of its production at an Dollars 18 oil price. Some 24 per cent of this year's output was hedged at Dollars 17, Mr Gourlay said. Clyde expected to increase production by 60 per cent this year, largely because of the inclusion for a full year of output from the North Sea Gryphon field. Last year Clyde staged a Pounds 34m rights issue to develop this field. 'At the moment we are disappointed that benefit comes in juxtaposition with a historically low oil price,' Mr Gourlay said. Analysts greeted the results with a certain degree of resignation. Borrowings of Pounds 188.7m, representing 110 per cent of shareholders' funds, remained higher than expected. The group was also not showing a great deal of success in the exploration carried out to date, even though it has been attempting to reduce the risk through farming out interests. As in previous years, there was no dividend. Losses per share were halved to 6.2p. Proven and probable reserves fell by 8 per cent to 164.4m barrels of oil equivalent.</p>

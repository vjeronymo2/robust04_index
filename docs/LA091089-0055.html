			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONDON IS TICKET TO AWARD-WINNING THEATRICAL EVENTS  </P> <P> If theater is your hunger, London is your horn of plenty.  </P> <P> No city on Earth approaches its vitality, variety or number of offerings. More  than 40 major venues show first-rate dramatic comedy and musical productions  daily. There are almost 50 smaller fringe and pub theaters, many featuring  celebrated performers keeping their craft honed.  </P> <P> The thespians range from Rex Harrison, Alec Guinness and Maggie Smith to  striving young beginners.  </P> <P> The theaters run a gamut from the fascinating Royal Haymarket, founded in 1720,  to the National Theater and Royal Shakespeare Company in their newer homes.  </P> <P> The Haymarket hosts its own ghost, the NT and the RSC are technically state of  the art. London's Savoy was the first theater in the world to be lighted by  electricity, in 1881.  </P> <P> Most of the creations of Shaw, Wilde, Gilbert and Sullivan, Coward and other  vintage standards of the English-speaking stage made their debuts in London  playhouses. To visit any of these mellow auditoriums is to commune with theater  history.  </P> <P> At houses such as the Criterion, Her Majesty's and Drury Lane, yesteryear's  graces glow in the architecture and ambience of plaster scrolls, red plush,  escutcheons on royal boxes and woodwork of rich patina.  </P> <P> The intervals between acts mean amiable interludes at etched-glass bars. In  all, a theater experience in London is a thoroughly civilized outing, rooted in  a deep English tradition and affection for the stage and its people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Piccadilly Circus  </P> <P> No leading theater is far from West End hotels. In the Piccadilly Circus  environs alone are seven major houses. Six others are only a short walk away.  The Royal Shakespeare, in the "City" neighborhood, and the National Theater  across the Thames, are usually just a few minutes away by bus, Tube or taxi.  </P> <P> Most London theaters will accept phone reservations as long as 24 hours ahead,  with tickets about $25 tops. The client must then appear an hour before the  performance to pick up the tickets.  </P> <P> At Leicester Square is a special ticket booth at which one may buy  reduced-price, same-day tickets for many of the shows -- from noon for  matinees, 2 p.m. for evenings. Word of these bargains has spread, thus the  queue is long.  </P> <P> Booking in advance is recommended for RSC and NT plays, as most of their  offerings are heavily subscribed. A few same-day tickets are made available  before 10 a.m. at both RSC and NT box offices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stratford-on-Avon  </P> <P> With scant doubt, the Royal Shakespeare and the National are the world's most  respected theater companies. The RSC was founded in Stratford-on-Avon more than  100 years ago, and its showcase at Shakespeare's birthplace is still a mainstay  of the town.  </P> <P> Millions of people have thrilled to its productions, and noted actors such as  Olivier, Gielgud, Finney and Burton refined their art on its stages at  Stratford and London's Old Vic.  </P> <P> The RSC's London home is a fine new theater in The Barbican, a massive  apartment and cultural center in the East End. Some of its international  successes in recent years (in addition to a continuing repertory of  Shakespeare) have been "Educating Rita," "Nicholas Nickleby" and "Les  Miserables."  </P> <P> The National Theater parallels the RSC's popularity with more emphasis on  venerable works other than The Bard, plus modern classics and experimental  plays.  </P> <P> The NT operates three theaters at its South Bank complex: the large, open-space  Olivier, the traditional-proscenium Lyttelton and the smaller, adaptable  Cottesloe. Its stagings run from "Guys and Dolls" and Chekhov, Shaw and O'Casey  to Coward, Ayckbourn and contemporary American dramatists such as Neil Simon  and Sam Shepard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Shows Popular  </P> <P> Some of the most popular shows on the London boards are U.S. musicals such as  "42nd Street," "Kiss Me Kate" and "South Pacific."  </P> <P> Among the city's best theater bargains are its ubiquitous pub and fringe  offerings. Typical of these is the Kings Head in the Islington area. The shabby  Edwardian saloon is a favorite hangout for colorful folks and is host to one of  London's oldest and most active fringe theaters.  </P> <P> Frequently, you see star actors from the RSC and NT in lunchtime or evening  efforts by new playwrights. Prices are reasonable for tickets, pub grub and  drinks.  </P> <P> For the most dedicated aficionados, London now boasts a Theater Museum in  Covent Garden. It is a remarkably rich harvest of theater memorabilia from  Shakespeare to Harold Pinter, displaying costumes, manuscripts, posters,  playbills, props and other items spanning the prolific centuries of the British  stage.  </P></p>

The researchers synthesized oligomer  salts of m-carboranedicarbonic acid and the following bivalent  metals: Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ba, and Pb. According to x-ray  analysis, all of the m-carboranedicarbonic acid salts except for  the Ba slats were crystalline substances. Most dissolved readily  in water, as well as in alcohol and acetone in the presence of  water. The infrared [IR] spectra of all of the salts produced  were analogous to one another and contained absorption bands  characteristic for a BH-carborane grouping (2,620/cm) and  COO[.sup]-[/]-salt (1,590-1,650 and 1,270-1,300/cm) bond.  According to the elemental analysis performed, every link of the  salt, except in the case of the Pb salt, contained one or two  molecules of crystallization water that can be removed by vacuum  heating at temperatures above 100C. The water may also be  easily replaced by materials such as acetone, diethyl ether, and  diethylamine. The Ba salt proved to be unstable in an aqueous  solution because of its reaction with the CO[.sup]2[/] in  air. The IR spectra of the Ca salt after treatment with  diethylamine also contained absorption bands in the  2,959-2,980/cm range (characteristic of CH[.sup]2[/] and  CH[.sup]3[/] groups). When heated in a vacuum to 220C,  all of the salts studied decomposed and released varying amounts  of hydrogen depending on the individual metal involved. Upon  thermal decomposition, the Cu salt released the most hydrogen,  and the Mn and Mg salts released the least. X-ray phase analysis  established that heating the Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd salts to  220-380C for 2-4 hours resulted in the formation of pure  metals. Pure metals were also formed when the Cu, Pb, and Cd  salts were added to polyiminoimides or phenol-formaldehyde  resins in the amount of 30 weight percent. The size of the metal  particles thus produced ranged from 50 to 300 angstroms  depending on treatment temperature. The researchers expressed  the hope that the m-carboranedicarbonic acid salts studied can  eventually be used to dope various polymers with unoxidized  metals in a finely dispersed state so as to produce  metal-containing polymers with interesting electrical, magnetic,  and other properties.

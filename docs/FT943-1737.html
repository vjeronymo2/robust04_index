			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan's brokers lower forecasts Sluggish trading volume on the Tokyo stock market has led to Japan's 'big four' brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and 10 second-tier brokers revising downwards their interim earnings forecasts for the six months to September. The move could herald another round of cost-cutting at the houses. At the start of the current business year in April, the brokerage houses had hoped to see a recovery in corporate earnings support share prices and trading volumes. A rush of buying of Japanese shares by overseas investors during the January-March quarter of this year helped to fuel such expectations. However, domestic institutions have remained pessimistic over a sharp corporate earnings recovery, while flotations of former state-owned companies have triggered fears of over-supply and depressed investor confidence. Although many brokers had hoped that average daily turnover would total around Y400bn (Dollars 4.04bn) for the first half, the actual figure has been Y350bn. Although the brokerages have been reducing trading expenses and administrative costs, many have yet to restructure their fixed costs. 'Until now their cost-cutting hasn't really been long-term rationalisation. They'll be forced to cut more into the fixed area,' said Ms Elizabeth Daniels, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. Nomura Securities lowered its interim pre-tax profits forecast to Y23bn, down 9 per cent from the previous year and a 42.5 per cent decline from its initial estimate. The company blamed lower stock brokerage income and revenue linked to convertible and warrant bonds. Operating revenue for the interim period is forecast to be Y190bn, down 5.9 per cent from a year earlier, and after-tax profits are expected to decline 10 per cent to Y9bn. For the full year to March, the company has revised down pre-tax profits to Y70bn - still 38.3 per cent higher than that achieved in the previous 12 months - on a 2.8 per cent rise in operating revenue to Y410bn and an 8.8 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Y27bn. Daiwa Securities said interim pre-tax profits would plunge 80 per cent from a year earlier to Y7bn instead of the previously predicted Y25bn. Operating revenue for the first six months is expected to fall 21.6 per cent to Y124bn and after-tax profits to decline 82.8 per cent to Y3bn. For the full year, Daiwa predicts pre-tax profits to fall 23 per cent to Y40bn on an 8 per cent decline in operating revenue to Y273bn. Nikko Securities expects to break even at pre-tax and after-tax levels in the first half. Operating revenue is expected to fall 16 per cent to Y115bn. For the year to March, the company expects a 14.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y30bn on a 6.9 per cent decline in operating revenue to Y279.4bn. Yamaichi Securities, which expected to post a pre-tax profit of Y10bn, now expects pre-tax losses of Y9bn on a 17.3 per cent fall in operating revenue to Y100bn. For the year, the company forecasts a 26.9 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y13bn on a 3.4 per cent fall in operating revenue to Y228bn. Meanwhile, all 10 second-tier brokers said they expected to post pre-tax losses for the six months to September.</p>

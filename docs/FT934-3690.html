			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo threatens to scale down tariff offer The danger of shrinkage in the Uruguay Round of global trade reform was raised in Geneva yesterday as Japanese negotiators warned they might modify their tariff-cutting offers. Their move came as a US-European Union market access deal took shape in Brussels. Japanese negotiators are threatening to pull back from conditional commitments to cut to zero all tariffs on non-ferrous metal imports, following signals that the EU is calling for special treatment on aluminium. Similarly, EU demands that tariffs on wood and paper products be phased out over a 10-year period, rather than five years as previously discussed, have triggered threats of back-tracking. Japan is refusing to discuss opening up its market for leather products unless the EU tables a 'satisfactory' offer to cut tariffs on electronic products and semiconductors. South-east Asian governments are also seeking better access to Europe's electronics market before offering to open any further their financial services markets. It was unclear last night how far the latest bilateral US-EU deal on cutting electronics tariffs had gone. The EU is understood to have offered to cut to zero tariffs on certain semiconductor equipment, but cuts for semiconductors as a whole may leave average tariffs of about 3 per cent. Large parts of the electronics sector - in particular the consumer electronics area of keen interest to Japanese exporters - may remain largely unaffected. In the non-ferrous area, considerable momentum towards a global compromise was reached at the recent Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle. Japan and other Asian importers agreed to a US-Canadian proposal to cut tariffs across the sector to between zero and 3 per cent. The proposal was finely balanced, matching US concessions in zinc with Japanese tariff cuts in copper. The deal was conditional on the EU making similar concessions in its own aluminium sector. However, fierce French defence of the interests of Pechiney's new aluminium smelter in Dunkirk has tied EU negotiators' hands. The present tariff-cutting offer leaves average duties on aluminium pellets at 6 per cent, and average duties on finished aluminium products at 7.5 per cent. Only duties on semi-processed aluminium products are currently on the table, with modest cuts from 10.5 per cent to 7 per cent on offer. Canada and Australia seek gains for their non-ferrous metal exporters as part of the balance for cutting tariffs in their own sensitive areas.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bianca Stancanelli in collaboration with Alberto </F> Selvaggi: "Pinuccio Richelieu: The Moderate Tatarella"]    [Text] Deputy prime minister as well as cabinet  member, he is the shrewd pioneer of the AN [National Alliance]  concept.    His friends describe him as a Fox whose partner is the Cat,  Gianfranco Fini. Even his enemy Giorgio Pisano, a certified  fascist, acknowledges his diabolical shrewdness. "In the MSI  [Italian Social Movement] thay called him the Levantine. He is a  Richelieu." They say his specialty is convincing someone to do  his bidding while giving the poor soul the impression that he  made the decision on his own. Who knows whether that is how he  became part of the government team?    The fact remains that Giuseppe ("Pinuccio") Tatarella--59  years of age; a native of Cerignola, Apulia; married, no  children; a professional politician who presents himself as a  lawyer; and an MSI soft-liner who founded the National  Alliance--is today the number two in the Berlusconi cabinet. He  is the deputy prime minister and minister of posts and  telecommunications, a ministry that used to have little prestige  but that now--in the cabinet of the King of TV--has been  upgraded to the status of supplementary heart of the government.  It is now one of the most sensitive and strategically decisive  ministries and is charged with redesigning the new map of the  airwaves and rewriting the Mammi Law.    He is the first postfascist to serve in the cabinet in the  50  years since the fall of Benito Mussolini. "Tatarella a fascist?"  Pisano protests indignantly. "But he has never been one!" Too  shrewd to forswear fascism, Pinuccio the Fox employs verbal  acrobatics to avoid the trap. "If we do not end the war of words  and judge the Right and the Left on the basis of results, we  will not solve any problem."    A low profile is his favorite weapon. Unkempt in appearance,  with his clothes perpetually stained because he has the bad  habit of spilling coffee and pasta on himself, this Richelieu of  Cerignola is a tresette [Italian card game] addict, a masterful  player at party congresses, a tireless dealmaker in the halls of  parliament, and invincible when it comes to conquering the  compartments of power--both within the party and outside it.  Rumor has it that Giorgio Almirante advised his heir apparent  Fini: "Be careful never to go against Tatarella." The young man  took his advice. Today, in the AN constellation, the rising  stars--from Maurizio Gasparri to Ignazio La Russa--all come from  the Tatarella stable. Moreover, Apulia is the region best  represented on the AN cabinet team, with two ministers out of a  total of five: Tatarella, and Adriana Poli Bortone of Lecce.    There, in the heel of Italy's boot, the Tatarellas are  multiplying. Whereas Pinuccio, the oldest of four sons of an  honest shoemaker, is the undisputed head of the party, his  youngest brother Salvatore--the mayor of Cerignola--is headed  for a seat in the European Parliament. Still another brother,  Matteo, is editor of the QUOTIDIANO DI FOGGIA. Along with  politics and tresette, the print media is another of the  passions of the new posts and telecommunications minister. A  newspaper addict, he reads the papers, clips articles, and keeps  them in a monumental file. Sometimes he himself has written  them. In his biography for NAVICELLA--the who's who of the  members of parliament--he not only wrote that he had been editor  of the weekly PUGLIA D'OGGI but added that for a period it had  been a daily and recited the names of a number of published  articles, notable among which was "Quando Moro non era Moro"  ("When Moro Wasn't Moro"). In the early 1990's he founded  REPUBBLICA PRESIDENZIALE, a monthly in which he argued the case  for an AN. Accordingly, in May of 1993, well before Fini was won  over to the cause, Tantarella was proclaiming: "The National  Alliance must be the alternative for all Italians who believe  the sirens of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and of the  Left, both old and new, are out of date and should not be  heeded."    Moderatism has always been his obsession--and his  fortune--ever since the schism of the moderates within the  National Democratic Party at the end of the decade of the 1970's  opened the road to parliament for him. Until that time Tatarella  had operated on the local scene, as councilman in a number of  municipalities from Bari to Polignano and as a member of the  regional council. The strong man of the Apulia MSI was Ernesto  De Marzio, group leader in the Chamber of Deputies, and  Tatarella was his private secretary. But when De Marzio embarked  on the National Democratic Party adventure--to the great delight  of the DC--Tatarella declined to follow him, because, among  other things, the schism was opposed by a monument of the Apulia  MSI, Araldo di Crollalanza, who during the 20 years of the  fascism had been minister of public works and a peace advocate  within Mussolinian fascism and subsequently served as senator of  the Republic. In 1979 De Marzio suffered political defeat, and  Tatarella entered the Chamber of Deputies.    Fifteen years later, Tatarella is deputy prime minister. He  is the object of much attention in Bari, at the Yacht Club that  he frequents together with his wife Angela, a cultured and  refined university instructor of legal philosophy. He is  received with full honors at Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime  minister]. He is cruelly satirized in CUORE and demolished by  Chantal Dubois, the dean of parliamentary fashion. At  Tatarella's debut as deputy prime minister, Dubois destroyed him  with the comment: "Tatarella believes he is presentable with  black shoe polish on his hair." In his native Cerignola, his  brother Salvatore snickers: "Pinuccio doesn't act like a cabinet  minister. You look at him and you say, Mamma mia!'" But you can  bet that having taken power, Pinuccio the Fox will change his  coat of fur.  <H5>  Biographic Note </H5>   Giuseppe Tatarella. Born in Cerignola, Apulia, on 17  September 1935. Married, no children. Degree in jurisprudence.  Member of parliament since 1979. Journalist.</p>

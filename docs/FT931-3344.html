			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Campbell's path eased in Canada CANADA'S ruling Progressive Conservative Party, seeking to reinvigorate itself before the general election later this year, is shedding almost an entire generation of political veterans. Since Mr Brian Mulroney announced his intention on February 24 to step down as party leader a string of senior cabinet ministers have declined to enter the race to succeed him. Ms Kim Campbell, the 46-year old defence minister, now faces virtually no serious challengers. Ms Campbell would be Canada's first female prime minister. A successor will be elected at a party convention on June 13, and is expected to call an election in either September of October. The rash of departures is partly a recognition by the old guard that the party needs a fresh set of faces at the top if it is to overcome voters' deep hostility in the latter part of Mr Mulroney's eight years in office. It also reflects the commanding lead built up in the early stages of the succession race by Ms Campbell. The latest Mulroney veterans to pull out of contention for the leadership are Mr Perrin Beatty, the communications minister; Mrs Barbara McDougall, the external affairs minister; and Mr Bernard Valcourt, the employment and immigration minister.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The good, the bad and the insanitary FOURTEEN resort and rural beaches failed to meet the environmental and safety standards laid down in new seaside awards announced yesterday by the Tidy Britain Group, a national agency for anti-litter issues. A total of 43 resort beaches were up to standard and received an award, and 14 received a premier award for good water quality. Six resort beaches - Thorpe Bay, Sutton on Sea, Hill Head, Littlehampton, Exmouth and Goodrington South Sands - failed. On Littlehampton, the judges spoke of 'the large quantity of sewage-related debris present on the beach'. The resort beach premier winners included: Bridlington North; Mablethorpe; Skegness; Sheerness Beach Street: Crinnis; Weymouth; and Woolacombe. Fifty rural beaches passed, 22 receiving premier awards, and eight failed.</p>

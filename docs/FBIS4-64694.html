			<p>BFN     [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev stopped over in  Ankara for contacts on his way to his country from Brussels. He  was received at Ankara Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin and other officials. Aliyev was taken from the  airport to the Cankaya Mansion by helicopter where he was  received by President Suleyman Demirel.    Demirel and Aliyev first met alone. Then they continued with  their meeting over dinner. Present at the dinner were Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller, Chief of the General Staff General Dogan  Gures, State Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Murat  Karayalcin, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, Azerbaijani First  Deputy Prime Minister (Fuat Kuliyev), Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov, and (Vefa Kuluzade), presidential under secretary for  foreign policy.    According to a statement issued by the Presidential Press  Center, the two presidents held a comprehensive exchange of  views on all aspects of the bilateral relations and on regional  problems. Demirel stressed the importance Turkey attaches to the  protection of Azerbaijan's independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity. He pointed out that the Armenian attacks  on Azerbaijan are gaining the character of damaging to regional  stability. He added that the attacks must be stopped, and the  Armenian occupation of Azeri land and the suffering of the  people must end as soon as possible. Demirel stated that Turkey  will continue to support Azerbaijan's justified demands in the  efforts to resolve the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict within the  framework of the CSCE-Minsk process.    Demirel stressed that Turkey will continue to support the  friendly and brotherly Azerbaijani people with all its means in  order to end their suffering and to support their process of  restructuring as a modern democratic state.    The presidents pointed out that such visits are very  beneficial in that the consultations between the two brotherly  countries are held at the highest level.    Before he left Ankara for Azerbaijan, President Aliyev held  a  news conference at Esenboga Airport. He said that faced with  Armenian occupation, Azerbaijan needs Turkey's support and help  more than ever before.    He pointed out that during his talks with President Demirel,  they discussed the measures that must be taken to accelerate the  implementation of the bilateral agreements signed in the past.  Aliyev went on to say that the friendship between the two  countries is of great importance for the future and that they  aim at further developing their relations.    Aliyev recalled that he signed the Partnership for Peace  program in Brussels. In this way, he said, we can take more  effective measures to save Azerbaijan from Armenian occupation.    Aliyev and his delegation were seen off by Foreign Minister  Cetin.    Meanwhile, replying to questions by an Azerbaijani  television  correspondent at the Cankaya Mansion, Prime Minister Ciller  stated that Turkey and Azerbaijan are very close. She pointed  out that a stability program is being implemented in Turkey,  adding: This will open the paths before us, and we will begin  to see the results slowly in the coming days. We will share the  fruits of this program together with our Azerbaijani brothers.    Replying to another question, Ciller said that the Armenian  attacks are unlawful. We strongly condemn them, she said,  adding that Turkey is always on the side of Azerbaijan, and  always helping it.

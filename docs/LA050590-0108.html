			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FEDERATED, ALLIED STORES LOSE $2 BILLION  </P> <P> Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores divisions posted  losses of more than $2.1 billion in their fourth fiscal quarters, largely  because of a writedown stemming from their bankruptcy reorganization.  </P> <P> But the companies, which own nearly 260 U.S. department stores such as  Bloomingdale's, Rich's and Lazarus, also reported that they posted operating  profits for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended Feb. 3.  </P> <P> "I believe we have turned the corner on stabilizing the business and that we  are well into a period of operational recovery," Allen Questrom, chairman of  the two divisions, said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> Separately, troubled Toronto-based Campeau said it had proposed a business plan  to its bondholders that includes the sale of real estate assets and a temporary  halt in its interest payments.  </P> <P> Campeau said it would ask holders of $184 million in bonds to waive any  defaults and defer interest payments through Dec. 31, 1991. In return, the  company would sell assets from its real estate holdings to reduce its debt.  Campeau's real estate consists primarily of shopping malls, office complexes  and businesses in the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> Federated and Allied, together the nation's second-largest department store  organization, have no stores in Southern California. They sought federal  bankruptcy court protection from creditors on Jan. 15, citing the burden of  $7.7 billion in debt. Much of the debt was incurred when Campeau acquired  Federated in 1988 and Allied in 1986.  </P> <P> Federated lost $1.34 billion in the fourth quarter on sales of $1.59 billion,  contrasted with a profit of $27.6 million and sales of $1.49 billion a year  earlier.  </P> <P> The results were affected by a $1.15-billion writedown of goodwill -- the  amount over Federated's book value that Campeau paid to acquire the company --  an accounting move to reflect the deterioration of Federated's financial  situation.  </P> <P> The company had operating income of $48.6 million, down from $175.9 million.  </P> <P> Allied lost $836.8 million on sales of $892.2 million in the quarter,  contrasted with a profit of $37.6 million on sales of $869.8 million.  </P> <P> Allied's earnings were reduced by, among other things, non-operating charges of  $660.3 million for its equity in Federated. Its operating income was $25.2  million in the quarter, down from $86.2 million a year earlier.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Igor Giorgadze, chairman of the State </F> Security Service of the Republic of Georgia, by Viktor Logachev;  place and date not given: "Georgia's Path to the West Lies Via  Russia"]    [Text]    [Logachev] You are by virtue of your official position one  of  the best-informed people of Georgia. How do you evaluate the  situation in the republic?    [Giorgadze] Complex and ambivalent. We have negotiated the  stage of civil war and conflicts in the zone of Tskhinvali and  Abkhazia. I would like to hope that they will not resume. The  joint statement of Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze and the  agreement signed in the wake of this by the Council of Heads of  State of the CIS instill hope that a settlement will be achieved  by the political, peaceful path.    The economy of Georgia is falling apart, transport is  paralyzed, and the financial and credit system is in a state of  collapse. The vast majority of the population is eking out a  semi-starvation, beggarly existence. Parliamentary and  government decisions proceed from the fact that it is only  possible to emerge from this state by developing cooperation and  integration within the framework of the CIS. There is opposition  to this viewpoint, of course, and the opponents' main argument  is that the republic could be deprived of sovereignty on this  path. But the country's present economic state would, in my  view, deprive it, rather, of sovereignty and integrity.    Our opposition desires an orientation toward the West, which  is not a sinful desire in itself, but under the present  circumstances Georgia's path to the West lies via Russia.    [Logachev] The most serious political question for Georgia  is  the conflict in Abkhazia. Could it grow into even more serious  forms?    [Giorgadze] I would like to hope that the joint efforts of  the CIS countries, primarily the active mediating role of  Russia, will help in the very near future--I stress this--to  exhaust this conflict completely and return the refugees to  Abkhazia. If the peacekeeping force of the CIS, and if we are to  call things by their name, primarily Russia, joins in these  processes and if this force does not passively observe the  course of events but actively becomes a part of the process as  an interested mediator, the problem will be resolved. Russia has  already signaled such a position.    [Logachev] Nonetheless, in what form might the Abkhazia  problem be resolved, for all that?    [Giorgadze] Undoubtedly as a compromise. A federal  arrangement of Georgia would seem the most practicable. Those  who believe that this would damage the statehood of the Georgian  Republic are, in my opinion, wrong. We could perfectly well  negotiate with both the Abkhaz and Ossetian sides specific  mutually acceptable forms of statehood. I would not want to  anticipate events, but any form of state arrangement that  satisfies the population of Georgia and Abkhazia is at this time  acceptable in principle. And the details could, after the guns  have died down, be specified at the negotiating table.    [Logachev] Does Tbilisi understand that unless the Abkhaz  problem is resolved in the very near future, Georgia, as a  Christian state, runs the risk of a clash with its Muslim  Caucasus neighbors?    [Giorgadze] I have been working in the system of the  security  authorities for 26 years now and have in this time been involved  in such an area, atypical of us, as the study of public opinion.  The head of the Georgian state recently instructed us to  ascertain the extent to which the population of Georgia supports  the steps being taken by the leadership of the republic.  According to our figures, approximately 80  percent--practically the entire population of Georgia--advocate  a peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz conflict, realizing  that its prolongation will mean the failure of the statehood of  the republic.    [Logachev] How do you view the possible participation of a  UN  peacekeeping force in a solution of the Abkhaz conflict?    [Giorgadze] I value the status and authority of the United  Nations highly. But, like any representative of the special  services, I am accustomed to relying on facts and their  analysis. Let us take a realistic look at the results of the  activity of UN peacekeeping forces. They are ineffective, as a  rule. On the other hand, Georgia is a participant in the CIS,  and a UN peacekeeping contingent would hardly solve the question  better than the Commonwealth's peacekeeping force is doing.    [Logachev] You have mentioned Georgia's desire to cooperate  with the West. How do you see relations with the European Union  and NATO?    [Giorgadze] Following the signing of the framework agreement  with Russia, the leaders of our states declared that the  strategic interests of Russia and Georgia coincide.  Consequently, we cannot belong to different blocs and  organizations. For me this is rudimentary.    [Logachev] Many people in Russia are arguing about  participation in the Partnership for Peace program. What is your  thinking on this score?    [Giorgadze] My first impression is that not everything has  been fully thought through here. Why and to what end is it  necessary to participate in cooperation with a prospect of  association within the framework of NATO? I have a guarded  attitude toward this idea, although many countries have latched  onto it readily.    [Logachev] Much has been said in the Russian press about  Georgia's drift toward the United States. There have been  references to American advisers here....    [Giorgadze] If there are, indeed, advisers, this is not a  sign of some tilt. We have found ourselves in a difficult  situation, and if the United States has extended the hand of  assistance to us, this absolutely does not preclude more serious  contacts with Russia. This also applies to cooperation along  special service lines, incidentally. For some reason or other  the press has made very one-sided mentions of the presence in  Georgia of CIA advisers, but has remained silent about our  traditional relations and contacts with Russia.    Georgia needs considerable assistance, in questions of  personnel training included. A number of agreements with Russia  along Ministry of Defense lines and between us and Russia's  Federal Counterintelligence Service are currently being made  ready for signing.</p>

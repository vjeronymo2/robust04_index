			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hungary pledges help for troubled commercial banks HUNGARY vowed yesterday to recapitalise its troubled financial sector after the disclosure in the Financial Times that loan losses at Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank, the two largest commercial banks, had wiped out their capital. AV RT, the state holding company, said it would be ready to put proposals on new capital for the banks it owns before the government's economic cabinet in two or three weeks. A World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission is then due in June to discuss a broader programme to restructure Hungary's problem debtors as well as to recapitalise problem banks, said Mr Teleki, chairman of the AV RT. Mr Teleki conceded yesterday new capital was necessary but would not comment on a recommendation by the World Bank for an infusion of Ft100bn (Dollars 1.1bn) to bring the capital adequacy of the whole banking sector up to 4 per cent of assets on international accounting. However, an AV RT official said that the World Bank was considering a package worth upwards of Dollars 400m in structural adjustment and enterprise restructuring loans to help put Hungary's financial system in order. Mr Teleki's comments came in an angry response to yesterday's publication of data from a confidential World Bank document which revealed that Hungary's top commercial banks were 'technically insolvent'. Mr Teleki accepted that Hungarian banks did not meet international norms for capital strength. But added: 'That is not the aim. While they are still not privatised there is no point in them meeting international standards.' Hitel Bank yesterday responded to the revelation of its technical insolvency by stressing it remained liquid and stated that it had positive capital under Hungary's, more flattering, accounting principles. Citibank Overseas Investment is to lift its stake in Citibank Budapest to 100 per cent by acquiring a 20 per cent stake from the National Bank of Hungary, Reuter reports from Budapest. The Budapest-based bank earned pre-tax profits of Ft2bn in 1992.</p>

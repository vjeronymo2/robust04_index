			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Upgrades boost for BTR INTERNATIONAL con-glomerate BTR moved sharply forward to rate as the day's best performing FT-SE 100 stock after several brokers upgraded profit expectations following visits to the company. The shares jumped 18 1/2 to 517 1/2 p, in brisk trade of 10m after BZW and James Capel increased current year profits estimates by Pounds 20m to Pounds 1.02bn and by Pounds 15m to Pounds 985m respectively. Mr Mark Cusack at BZW said of his new forecast, 'efficiency improvements are coming through and the Hawker Siddeley acquisition is performing ahead of expectations,' while James Capel reiterated its positive view on 'very early news of signs of a recovery in the US and Australia'. Further upgradings are expected over the next few days. Hong Kong shocks The fall of 5 per cent in the Hong Kong stock market, as relations between the British administration and the Chinese government deteriorated, prompted heavy falls in UK stocks with interests there, notably HSBC, Standard Chartered and Cable &amp; Wireless. The most active was HSBC where turnover totalled 12m. Shares in the banking group tumbled to 493p before picking up to end a net 16 off at 502p. HSBC shares have been one of the UK market's best performers since the merger with Midland Bank was effected earlier this year. Standard Chartered fell 8 to 543p, albeit in much quieter trading, which saw fewer than 1m shares change hands, with the stock sustained by expectations that the company will be elevated to the Footsie-100 status for the new year. Telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless, which derives well over half of its income from its stake in Hong Kong Telecom, dropped to 654p before stabilising to close 6 off at 659p. Turnover was an unremarkable 1.7m shares. Asda query Predictions of an end to Asda's bull run proved correct and the shares fell back in another day's heavy trading after several brokers turned seller of the stock. Market attention is now firmly focused on the group's results on December 18 with talk of a fund-raising excercise doing the rounds. Asda is said to be in need of a cash injection to boost its capital expenditure programme which badly lags its rivals. Up to Pounds 100m might need to be raised, given Asda's debt position. However, a rights issue is not thought to be a favoured route coming so quickly after last year's and straining shareholder loyalty. Suggestions in the market say a bond issue might be preferable. Asda shares retreated 5 1/2 to 52 1/2 p in turnover of 37m, once again the top traded stock of the day. Calor move A couple of exceptionally heavy individual trades in Calor Group shares led dealers to suspect that SHV, the privately-owned Dutch investment group, had moved back into the market to increase its stake to just below 50 per cent. SHV currently has 47.26 per cent of Calor and is allowed to increase its holding by 2 per cent in the year to next November. SHV's last increase was announced on November 10. Calor shares held at 224p on turnover of 2.9m. The oil majors showed signs of struggling as crude oil prices continued to lose ground, dropping around 40 cents a barrel. BP, helped by a positive response to the presentation to Scottish institutions, moved up 3 1/2 to 237p. News of the exploration success off the coast of Burma drove Premier Consolidated up 1 1/4 to 17 3/4 p on heavy turnover of 9.8m shares. The placing by Warburg Securities of 9.92m Sedgwick shares at a discount of only 2p to the ruling market price saw Sedgwick close only a penny easier at 144p. There was little fallout from the demise of Rosehaugh, the market preferring instead to focus on results from the UK's second biggest property group, MEPC. Although the figures were in line with expectations, the dire conditions in the commercial property market meant continuing worries over the safety of next year's dividend. Net asset values fell from 608p to 465p and while most analysts are forecasting between 410p and 420p for next year, at least one leading broker was on 385p and predicting a big dividend cut. In the meantime, MEPC's hefty discount to the market and high yield meant it recovered from its initial fall and closed at 337p, off 2. The launch in the US of Reuters' News2000 system, which enhances Reuters' news and financial services, was greeted with enthusiasm by the stock market where Reuters shares jumped 18 to a record 1354p. The utilities sectors suffered badly during the early part of the session as institutions continued to switch from the waters and electricity stocks into the cyclicals. The sectors were additionally unsettled by the Ofwat report on water standards and delivery costs plus slight disappointment with results from Norweb, the first of the electricity companies to report interim figures. Both sectors rallied strongly, however, closing well above the day's lowest levels. Fears for the current year dividend hit Trafalgar House as it reported a Pounds 30.3m loss and slashed last year's dividend from 18.4p to 6p. The shares fell 6 to 89p. Among transport stocks, sellers of Tiphook following last week's strong performance caused the shares to give up 4 to 275p, in light trading. The company said yesterday that it had replaced County NatWest and Warburg as joint brokers with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The expected disposal at APV duly arrived when the company announced the sale of its ventilation and warm-air hand-dryer business Vent-Axia Group to Smiths Industries for Pounds 55.8m. Analysts said the move was positive for both groups and the shares of the former gained 4 1/2 to 107 1/2 p, while the latter jumped 9 to 335p. Trading in Rolls-Royce was boosted by a buy recommendation from County NatWest and turnover rose to 7.8m as the shares firmed a penny to 101p. The broker said: 'Rolls-Royce offers investors an outstanding opportunity for long term capital growth.' Euro Disney continued to crumble as its two principal bears, Goldman Sachs and Paribas, succeeded in producing even gloomier forecasts. Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas increased his projected loss for the French theme park by 5 times to over FFr1bn for the year ended September 1993. Goldman is on FFr750m. The shares fell 43 to 725p. Confident expectations ahead of Granada's results today helped the shares add 6 to 309p. Analysts forecasts of around Pounds 115m are thought likely to prove around Pounds 7-8m short. Queens Moat continued to attract attention with 11m shares traded, 3m of which comprised a bed and breakfast (tax-related) deal. The good two-way business left the shares steady at 45 1/2 p, talk of a deal with other hotel groups refusing to die away. A stock overhang - said to be around 1.5m shares - continued to hold back Kwik Save. The shares fell 3 1/2 to 727 1/2 p. There was general disappointment in the market with interim profits from Racal Electronics. The latter's shares, which hit an all-time high last week, dropped 17, or 11 per cent, to 157p, after the figures were released. Specialists said that although the results were at the very top end of market estimates, some of the super optimists were slightly disappointed and that a very substantial bull position in the stock had been unwound yesterday. Full-year estimates were being reined in from around the Pounds 55m-mark to the Pounds 52m level. ACT, the computer group, slipped 2 to 141p, following the placing of a block of 6.5m shares at 137p late on Monday. The placing was executed in a matter of minutes by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker. ACT is using the cash to help fund its purchase of NMW Computers and repay the latter's bank debt.

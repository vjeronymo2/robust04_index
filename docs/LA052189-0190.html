			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKLIN POEM IN BLANK VERSE  </P> <P> It's all been a joke, right? All these weeks as you've been publishing this  pedestrian prose in your poet's corner, you've been laughing and nudging each  other, knowing none of it could pass Emily Dickinson's definition of poetry.  </P> <P> And now the denouement -- "Homage to John Cage" -- the epitome of non-poetry!  At least Gerald Locklin has a sense of humor.  </P> <P> BEA SPEARS  </P> <P> SANTA MARIA  </P> <P> Homage to John Cage  </P> <P> by Gerald Locklin  </P> <P> Editor's Note: Gerald Locklin's poem is reprinted above as it appeared in the  April 30, 1989, Book Review. John Cage is the composer of, among other works,  4'33," which consists of a pianist sitting at his instrument in silence for  four minutes and 33 seconds.  </P></p>

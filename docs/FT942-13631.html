			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / The system takes the blame, not the whites - Despatches / Patti Waldmeir asks an ANC youth leader to explain the extraordinary inter-racial goodwill in South Africa So, I ask, getting straight to the point, why don't you hate whites? I am from Detroit, and have experienced more racial hatred in five minutes in my home town than in five years in South Africa. Every white visitor to South Africa notices it: the extraordinary inter-racial goodwill which has defied the logic of 350 years of racist oppression. Semoka Sedibe, African National Congress youth leader in the black township of Katlehong near Johannesburg, smiles indulgently at my crude question, and assures me: 'There is no way I can hate whites. To hate whites would be unfair.' How strange to invoke the notion of justice in this context, after decades in which institutionalised injustice has been almost the sole preserve of whites. But Semoka has foresworn the easy options of rancour and revenge; his goal - and that of his political masters in the ANC - is reconciliation. 'The conflict in our country is not a particular race fighting against another but it's a particular system which wants to create divisions and tensions. Our problem has not been whites per se, our problem has been the system which has privileged whites or has co-opted them to be the culprits of apartheid. 'If we blame all whites, what about the blacks who have been involved in the massacres of our people? There are black people who have in fact done worse things than whites.' Cynics would say that Semoka is doing no more than parrot the ANC's long-held policy of non-racialism, its colour-blind blueprint for the future South Africa. But cynics would miss the point, which is that Semoka clearly believes what he says: it is there in the body language, in the earnestness of his gaze, manifestations of the extraordinary generosity of spirit which I have experienced from black South Africans, again and again, in township after township, throughout the past five years. 'We are saying that because apartheid has destroyed, let us forget the past and begin to build anew. To minimise conflict and misunderstanding we need to come together . . . hence emphasis was made on the government of national unity.' In that government, to be elected within days and scheduled to rule until 1999, white ministers from the National Party, the party of apartheid, will share power with the ANC (and others, if they gain at least 5 per cent of the national vote). The agreement to share power with whites was the crucial compromise which finally persuaded the National Party to end apartheid, and Semoka wholeheartedly supports it. As chairperson of the ANC youth league in Katlehong (the title 'chairman' is taboo, even for males), he is scarcely likely to deviate from the party line, which is that power sharing is necessary to build national unity. 'Decisions will have to be reached by consensus and the National Party must be part of that consensus,' he says. But consensus is a word whose definition varies according to context; and in the context of a large ANC electoral majority, it is likely to mean little. Semoka is already preparing for that day: the National Party will have ministers in the new government, he says; 'But they must do what the government of national unity (ie Nelson Mandela) wants them to do.' Indeed, Semoka suggests that the National Party is being included in the government to allow it to make up for the wrongs committed under apartheid: 'They must assist us in solving all these problems. We will say: you have damaged this, repair it, because you are the ones.' Semoka expects no quick fix for the problems of the past: indeed, in spite of all the warnings from sage political commentators about the impossibly high expectations of black South Africans, my experience in the townships suggests otherwise. For months I have been asking township activists what they expect from a new government. Again and again, the response is touchingly modest: one wants dirt roads re-graded, another wants latrines to replace bucket toilets; no one mentioned a house in a white suburb or the boss's Mercedes (the stuff of white scare stories). Once again, the ANC's message - that it offers a better life to blacks, but that transformation cannot take place overnight - seems to have penetrated well into the grassroots. So, I ask Semoka, how long will you wait for the 'better life'? 'The question will be the availability of resources,' he says soberly, 'because one may say, I think within a year they (houses, electricity, etc) must be there, but if there are no adequate resources it's a problem.' In any case, he points out: 'Peace is the primary thing: if there can be a creation of permanent peace as a first point, and second the question of jobs, then we will be able to address these other issues.' But Semoka is not sitting back and waiting for economic manna to descend from ANC-heaven: as I enter Katlehong, women are clearing the median strip of rubbish and planting flowers. This is an ANC youth league initiative: R1m has been raised from local businesses for a township clean-up campaign. And Semoka makes clear that the local community is not going to have its development priorities set by Pretoria, even when the ANC is in charge there. The Katlehong community will determine its own priorities - and the ANC government must listen. With any luck, the strength of community organisations such as the ANC youth league in Katlehong will provide a powerful antidote to abuse of power by central government, and help to guarantee that South Africa's future is democratic. For local organisations such as these can take the real credit for ending apartheid - far more than Umkhonto we Sizwe (spear of the nation), the ANC's inept military wing, or international strategies such as sanctions. By mobilising people around their daily concerns - poor housing, lack of services, violence - local civic and community groups succeeded in making the country's black townships ungovernable. And that dealt a fatal blow to Pretoria's authority. Unfortunately, ungovernability seems to be surviving beyond apartheid, nowhere more so than in the three-township complex of Katlehong-Thokoza-Vosloorus which is Semoka's home. For the indulgence of most township residents towards whites is not mirrored in their attitude to other blacks, especially if they live in migrant workers' hostels and belong to the Inkatha Freedom Party. Here again, Semoka pleads for tolerance, drawing on the Marxist analysis that exonerates individuals and blames the political system of apartheid for the fighting which has plagued Katlehong. (Semoka is a member of the South African Communist Party, like many young ANC members; but he assures me that the time is not yet ripe for communism in South Africa). He believes Inkatha members are merely innocent victims of a larger state-supported force to destroy peace in the township. 'This is not a Zulu/Xhosa conflict or ANC/Inkatha conflict, it is conflict by forces which are against peace, democracy and freedom in our country. Throughout our struggle, we have fought gallantly to bring about the situation we are in today and now in the era of our freedom they want to turn the clock back. This is not going to be allowed.' Semoka says he has never killed anyone in the fighting, but acknowledges that the youth league has armed 'self-defence units' to protect the community (television viewers will have seen these men shooting AK-47 assault rifles at hostels in the past few days of violence). Still, he is adamant that peace must be made between the community and the hostel-dwellers (who live in what amount to armed camps separate from other residents). Given the brutality of life in the Katlehong war zone - the hideous atrocities committed by both sides, the appalling fear attendant on life in a state of anarchy, the sense of total hopelessness - that is itself a triumph of the human spirit. But one suspects that reconciliation with rival blacks (who are viewed as traitors to the liberation cause) could in the end prove a far larger task for Semoka and his neighbours than learning to live with whites.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / In search of fiscal wisdom for old age: Hugo Dixon on pensions policy in a world of ageing populations and big deficits Pensions are already the single biggest item of government expenditure in almost all industrialised countries. As populations age and schemes set up after the Second World War mature, state pension transfers will consume an ever-increasing share of national budgets. On current trends, they will exceed spending on health care and education combined within the next 50 years. These bald facts explain why most governments are considering revamping their pension systems. Without change, there are fears that ballooning pension budgets will become unsustainable. The next generation of workers may not be willing to pay the higher taxes or social security contributions that will be needed when the current generation of workers retires. Politicians are reluctant to risk the electoral consequences of cutting back people's pensions. They also have little incentive to take painful decisions whose full benefits will only become apparent long after they have left office. The policy questions surrounding pensions are complex. Pension policy has a powerful impact on the wider economy. In particular, it can affect retirement ages, savings and investment, the competitiveness of industry and job mobility. Governments started to reform their pension systems in the 1980s. Japan, whose demographic crisis came early, curbed the generosity of its state scheme and raised the age of entitlement to pensions. In the UK, the Conservative government, driven mainly by an ideological belief in the superiority of private pensions, gave employees tax incentives to opt out of its state earning-related pensions scheme and promoted personal pensions. Continental European countries such as France, Germany and Italy face the greatest pressure to change, partly because of the speed with which their populations are ageing (see chart). But their pensions are also especially generous, typically more than half final salaries. The pressures are less intense in Anglo-Saxon countries such as the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Their populations are not ageing as rapidly and their state schemes are less generous, in part because of the greater role of private pensions. The main response of governments faced with such pressures has been to curb the generosity of their state pension schemes, while keeping their basic structure intact. They have included: Cutting the growth in benefits. The US has several times frozen benefits. The UK, which used to link pensions to average earnings, now uprates them in line with prices. The basic pension, currently 15 per cent of average earnings, is thus projected to fall to 7 per cent of average earnings over 30 years. Raising the state pension age. This saves money by cutting the number receiving pensions and governments hope it could reverse the trend towards earlier retirement in most countries. Japan has raised its pension age from 60 to 65. The US has chosen 67, though this will not come fully into effect for more than 30 years. Germany and Italy are also gradually increasing their pension ages to 65. Other countries plan similar action. A more radical reform is to shift from state to private provision of pensions. It is possible to achieve this by allowing state pensions to wither and relying on people to get the message that they need to save for their retirement. Alternatively, governments can promote private pensions through tax relief for pension funds or by compelling people to save for their old age. No industrialised country has made a wholesale switch, though Chile has done so by making private saving mandatory. Private pensions mean there would be less need to raise taxes in future to finance the pensions of the growing number of old people. Enthusiasts also argue that, by saving for their pensions, today's workers would channel larger sums of money into productive investment so boosting long-run economic growth. But private pensions do nothing to curb public spending in the short run, as those who have already retired still have to rely on taxpayers for their pensions. Moreover, they impose a greater financial burden on today's workers who have to save for their own pensions as well as paying taxes for the pensions of those who have retired. Advocates of private pensions point to their greater flexibility. Instead of contribution rates and pension ages being fixed by governments, individuals are able to choose how much to save and when to retire - though this is less so with occupational schemes than personal pensions. Backers of state provision point out how successful it has been in reducing poverty in old age. Private pensions, they argue, are not well suited to tackling poverty because they cannot easily redistribute money from the rich to the poor. If people had to save for their retirement, the unemployed, women who stayed at home and those on low incomes would suffer. Large chunks of their savings could also be swallowed up in administrative fees. This means that complete withdrawal of the state from pension provision is unlikely to be socially acceptable in most countries. However, the state might reduce its commitment by guaranteeing a basic income for all old people, leaving additional saving to individual choice. However, if this basic income was set at a generous level, the cost could be high. If a low level was chosen, many pensioners could still face poverty. An alternative is to target the state pension on those most in need, while giving nothing to those who have accumulated decent private pensions. But the danger is that people would have no incentive to save for their retirement. In Australia where state pensions are means-tested an increasing proportion of retired people qualifies because they ensure their wealth is invested in ways that do not feature in the test. Compulsory saving would negate the choice and flexibility associated with private provision. From an individual's perspective, state-mandated contributions to private pensions might not look so different from taxes or social security contributions. As short-term budget strains and long-term demographic pressures grow, governments are increasingly finding inaction is not an option. Whether by choice or force of circumstance, a shift from state to private pensions is probably inevitable. This is the seventh article on welfare states around the world.

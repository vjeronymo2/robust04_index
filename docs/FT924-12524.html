			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Setback for Castor Holdings creditors UNSECURED creditors of Castor Holdings, the bankrupt Montreal-based property finance company chaired by Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, the German-Canadian financier who lives in London, have been told that they stand little chance of recouping any of their CDollars 700m (Pounds 315m) investment. Castor's bankruptcy trustee gave the bad news to creditors last week. It came in a progress report based on a preliminary review of the value of the company's assets, which consist almost entirely of high-risk second and third mortgages and construction loans on several dozen projects in the US and Canada. Most of Castor's funds came from European banks as well as private investors in Switzerland and Germany. The biggest unsecured creditors include Chrysler Canada's pension fund and Credit Suisse, which has an exposure of about CDollars 100m. Mr Stolzenberg, Castor's co-founder and chairman, appeared before a Quebec bankruptcy receiver yesterday to answer a list of statutory questions normally put to the directors of insolvent companies. The hearing was held behind closed doors and Mr Stolzenberg was not expected to shed much light on the complex inner workings of Castor. But an official of Richter &amp; Associates, which is acting as trustees, said the firm provided a number of extra questions to the receiver. The Richter official said Mr Stolzenberg was expected to be interviewed in greater depth by the trustees within the next few weeks. Castor's investors earned handsome returns in the early 1980s, when they benefited from the high interest rates on subordinated mortgages and large fees paid by developers. They also enjoyed big tax benefits as a result of Castor channelling much of its money through subsidiaries in jurisdictions which had negotiated favourable tax treaties with Germany. Cash flows and income quickly dried up, however, when the North American property industry sank into reces-sion. Much of Castor's money was invested in hotels and undeveloped land, which are especially vulnerable.</p>

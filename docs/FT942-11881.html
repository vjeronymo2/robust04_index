			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / BHP to face ADollars 4bn New Guinea suit A ADollars 4bn (Pounds 1.97bn) damages suit against Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest company, is to be filed in Melbourne courts later this week by about 6,000 Papua New Guinea villagers. The legal action seeks redress for environmental damage allegedly caused by the Ok Tedi copper mine in western PNG, which BHP manages. The class action is believed to represent the largest compensation claim ever mounted in Australia, with the ADollars 4bn figure comprising ADollars 2bn in compensatory damages and ADollars 2bn in exemplary damages. Shares in BHP edged lower, by two cents to ADollars 16.90, on the news. Details of the action were released by the Australian law firm acting for the villagers, ahead of the actual court filing. The suit itself is likely to be entered on Thursday by Mr Rex Dagi, leader of the Western Province's Miripiki clan, in the Supreme Court. Yesterday's statement from the lawyers said the suit would centre around the alleged pollution and flooding of the Ok Tedi River, due to dumping of waste material from the mine. The Western Province was concerned that the mine had 'caused major damage to wildlife dependent on the river, to most fertile land beside the river, and possibly to the health of local people,' it said. 'The local villagers are demanding a dam be built to contain the waste from the mine and that the river and the land affected by the dumping of waste be restored,' it added. The lawyers said that the ADollars 2bn exemplary damages figure was based on the estimated current cost to build such a dam. Yesterday, BHP said that the Ok Tedi project 'operates in compliance with PNG law and with the full support of the PNG government'. It added that any legal action would be vigorously defended.</p>

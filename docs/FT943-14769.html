			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Scots business rates 'to soar' Scottish businesses are set to suffer badly compared with those in London and the south of England when the results of the latest non-domestic rating revaluation come into force next year, a property consultancy has warned. Grimley JR Eve says businesses in Scotland will see their rates bills soar 50 per cent or more next year if the new valuations are applied in full. While office rental values increased substantially in Edinburgh and Glasgow between the last revaluation in April 1988 and the new one in April 1993, rental values in London fell. The valuations will also nullify much of the benefit Scotland has gained in the past few years from the Scottish Office's policy of reducing the Scottish business rate poundage through increased subsidies to councils. This policy has been aimed at cutting the burden of non-domestic rates in Scotland and bringing them down to the same levels as in England. A uniform business rate is applied in England and Wales, amounting to 42.3p in the pound this year, but a uniform rate has not been achieved in Scotland. Grimley JR Eve says that between April 1988 and April 1993 office rents in Edinburgh rose by 70 per cent, and those in Glasgow by 62 per cent, the highest increases in the UK. But rental values in the City of London dropped by 60 per cent and those in the West End by 53 per cent.</p>

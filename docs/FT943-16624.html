			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Healthcare battle for Congress this week The political battle over US healthcare will move to the floor of the House and Senate after this week's congressional recess following the completion of committee work on the legislation. The Senate finance committee approved on Saturday a version of the bill which drops a key component of the reform envisaged by President Bill Clinton - the employer mandate, under which companies would pay the bulk of their workers' insurance costs. The finance committee's version would rely instead on a mix of tax incentives, insurance reform and subsidies for the poor to try to expand health insurance coverage. The bill falls short of Mr Clinton's aim of universal coverage. In an indication of other struggles to come, the committee adopted an amendment that would allow employers to exclude abortion coverage from any health insurance they may buy their workers. Thirty-six Democratic congressmen have written to Mr Thomas Foley, the House Speaker, saying they cannot support legislation that does not exclude abortion. Four of the five committees with jurisdiction over healthcare have now completed their versions of the bill. The fifth, the House energy committee, has given up the struggle after failing to reach consensus. Three versions of the reform reported out of committee bear close similarities to the Clinton plan. However, the Senate finance committee is considered to reflect closely sentiment within the Senate itself, and some House members may also look to it for a lead.</p>

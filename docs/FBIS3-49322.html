			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] This is Ivica Saric reporting for Croatian radio  from Vitez [passage omitted]    The HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units have the initiative  now and they are trying to retake control of the Vitez-Busovaca  road. Fierce hand-to-hand combat is still going on. Muslim  artillery attacks are continuing. More than 100 shells landed  on Vitez by 1600 and over 200 shells of various caliber were  fired on the defense lines. Five elderly people and one child  were killed and 35 civilians were wounded, including many  children. The defenders have also suffered casualties in heavy  fighting. [passage omitted]    As I am filing this report, dozens of shells are falling on  Vitez and according to military sources, the Muslim army is  bringing in fresh units and military equipment from Zenica so  that new, even stronger, aggressor attacks are expected during  the night or morning on this part of the front in the Lasva  river valley.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of an interview with Interior Minister Chawalit </F> Yongchaiyut by an unidentified correspondent; place, date not  given]    [Text] Some people have described your performance as  interior minister as poor. How do you respond to this  assessment.    Our country has long been plagued with conflicts, political  and otherwise. When I became interior minister, I tried to  solve these conflicts peacefully. I tried to improve the  efficiency of the agencies in charge of administration and  security. Conflicts occurred when I tried to reform the Police  Department. The reforms were implemented, however. As a  result, the police are working harder and more efficiently in  serving the public. Gambling dens have been suppressed and road  check-points set up in an improved effort to keep law and order.    So how do you feel about continued criticism in spite  of all your hard work.    It's normal and healthy for MPs to criticize me. I would do  the same thing if I were in their place. I appreciate the fact  that people were very angry at me following a few violent  incidents, like bomb attacks in certain provinces, and so on.  They wondered why I resisted taking action, like transferring  police chiefs of those provinces, etc. I say to them that  before taking any drastic action we need more evidence and more  time to study the facts of the case.    What do you see as hampering the running of your  ministry.    Bureaucracy in the agencies under my ministry. For example,  the Police Department. Its structure really only allows it to  deal with internal law and order problems, and not with  international terrorism.    You mean the Police Department's structure has kept its  role limited, or are you saying that the police should not be  doing the job in the first place.    Neither the Interior Ministry nor the Police Department can  be expected to perform a task which is beyond their capabilities  or which will require measures which exceed those we have  already prepared in order to cope with any forseeable crisis.  If a major crisis breaks out and we deem it to be beyond our  capability, we should be able to say that it is now time for the  military to step in.    What will you do now that international terrorists have  apparently penetrated our borders.    The situation is certainly not out of hand yet. We have  several devices we can employ to help us spy on the terrorists,  such as an electronic device which can be placed on any concrete  wall less than one-foot thick. That device will enable us to  hear the conversations of the people behind the wall. However,  terrorists could also monitor our electronic eavesdropping tools  or communications equipment.    So, terrorists will know more about the movement of  police from the department's equipment than the police will  learn about the criminals. Is that right.    That's it.    What more will you do to improve the performance of the  Interior Ministry.    We need to improve our intelligence work. We should also  improve the coordination between interior agencies, especially  those concerned with security affairs. The agencies' structure  should also be streamlined to increase efficiency.    Recent incidents have prompted many to think that the  Interior Ministry's performance in protecting people's live's  and property has been poor.    Problems occur in every government. Whenever you have a  situation where there are a lot of conflicts in a country,  incidents like these will happen.    What parties have been in conflict recently.    Last May, we had a political conflict. That conflict arose  because two major groups had different approaches to solving the  country's problems. One side wanted to solve the problems  peacefully while the other wanted to use force.    I myself has been trying to solve problems by reforming the  structure of certain interior agencies, including the Police  Department. But my attempts to reform the Police Department  have led to conflicts in the agency.    So, someone dislikes you.    Of course. There is always trouble inside the Police  Department. This department is one of several government  agencies under political influence.    But why are there so many who disagree with you.    When the department was reformed, illegal businesses like  gambling and prostitution were affected. The revamp has caused  billions of baht in damages to certain groups of people and this  has caused conflict.</p>

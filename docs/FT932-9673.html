			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / SFO seeks more use of remand in custody COURTS should give greater consideration to holding defendants in serious fraud cases in custody before trial, following the flight of Mr Asil Nadir to northern Cyprus, Mr George Staple, director of the Serious Fraud Office, said yesterday. Despite the fact that such cases often took more than two years to reach court, he said that remand in custody might be necessary where there was a strong possibility of a defendant jumping bail and leaving the country to avoid trial. Mr Staple was speaking at the presentation of the SFO's annual report, during which he defended the handling of the Nadir case by his department and the police. He noted that bail conditions remained the responsibility of the courts, but said that the decision of the Polly Peck founder to jump Pounds 3.5m bail last week could lead to a change in attitude to long periods in custody. 'I would be surprised if, in future, courts don't look more critically at these cases.' Mr Staple acknowledged that imprisoning defendants for such long periods before trial would cause considerable concern within the legal profession. To meet such concern, the SFO could try further to speed up its investigation and prosecution processes. The arrest of people in such cases might also be postponed until investigations had proceeded further, he said. Responding to Mr Staple's comments, defence solicitor Mr David Kirk, head of the fraud unit of City law firm Stephenson Harwood, said: 'It is extremely rare for defendants to fraud cases to abscond. It would be unfortunate if the clear requirements of the Bail Act were to be overridden by one isolated, if regrettable, incident.' Defending the handling of the Nadir case, Mr Staple said the SFO had done all it could to ensure Mr Nadir came to trial by opposing the granting of his bail. In sending out an 'all-ports' warning in response to the anonymous tip-off before Mr Nadir's escape, the police had taken action they thought appropriate in the circumstances. Although not 'over-optimistic' about the trial starting in September, Mr Staple said he was not yet prepared to assume that it would not take place. Nadir asked to co-operate, Page 8</p>

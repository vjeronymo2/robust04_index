The mission will include government officials  and a group of entrepreneurs. It will be headed by Economy and  Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas.    An official source told us that there is an important trade  link based on compensation agreements between Iran and Uruguay.    The source said that the products to be negotiated are those  that traditionally have been exchanged between the two  countries. The source stressed, however, that "there might be  significant news for the textile industry, which is particularly  important at difficult times like the present."</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Peru 'corridor' offered to Bolivia LANDLOCKED Bolivia's 113 year-old dream of an exit to the Pacific is set to become reality today when Bolivian and Peruvian presidents Jaime Paz Zamora and Alberto Fujimori meet in the southern Peruvian port of Ilo to sign a bilateral agreement. Peru's President Alberto Fujimori has made an offer of free transit for Bolivian products through a 'corridor' leading to Ilo from the Bolivian frontier town of Desaguadero. Under Mr Fujimori's proposal: Bolivia would be permitted to import and export via Ilo with no customs formalities - perhaps even using their own railway stock on the Peruvian tracks; Ilo would become a free zone with full industrial and commercial facilities; and, Bolivians could even purchase their own seaside residences in a new tourist resort on Peruvian soil. The Peruvian proposal has been enthusiastically greeted in Bolivia, which has been landlocked since it lost territory to Chile in the 1879 War of the Pacific. In return for the concessions, Peru would gain access to the Atlantic, via the network of roads and railways which link Desaguadero to the Bolivian capital, La Paz, and thence to Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina. Ilo, which is less than 300 miles from La Paz, hopes to lure lucrative Bolivian trade away from the northern Chilean ports of Arica. President Fujimori's plan gives priority to Ilo as the principal port for Peruvian and Bolivian (and ultimately Brazilian) exports to the Pacific Rim countries. It is a deep-water port with good basic infrastructure but will require further substantial investment and development. Before leaving for Ilo, the Bolivian president called the meeting one of 'transcendental importance'. 'This is a signal to the rest of the continent,' he said, 'that there's a new way of managing affairs.'</p>

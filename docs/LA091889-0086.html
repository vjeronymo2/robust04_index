			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES: DONATIONS NOT FACTORED IN  </P> <P> Two researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business  announced the results of a study a week ago showing that, contrary to other  recent reports, junk bonds aren't excessively risky.  </P> <P> Officials at the school insist that there is absolutely no connection between  the results of the study and the fact that Michael Milken, the former Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond chief, is an alumnus of the school and over the  years has donated at least $2.25 million to it.  </P> <P> The study by Wharton faculty members Marshall E. Blume and Donald B. Keim  concluded that junk bonds issued in 1977 and 1978 yielded 8.5% in the 10 years  after they were issued, after defaults on some of the bonds were factored in.  They said this was a better return than on medium-term Treasury bonds in the  same period.  </P> <P> Blume, reached by phone, said he was completely unaware that Milken had given  money to Wharton.  </P></p>

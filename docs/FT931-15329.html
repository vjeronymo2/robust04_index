			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Bank of China to issue notes in HK CHINA'S growing role in business in Hong Kong was yesterday underlined when the colonial administration announced that Bank of China would become the colony's third note issuing bank from May next year. The decision to allow Bank of China to issue paper currency was taken yesterday by Governor Chris Patten in a meeting with his Executive Council. Bank of China is Hong Kong's second largest banking group. It oversees the activities of 13 mainland banks operating in Hong Kong. It has been expected for some time that it would gain approval to issue notes. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Standard Chartered are at present the two note issuers in Hong Kong. Hongkong Bank has the largest share of circulation with more than 80 per cent Bank of China plans to issue initially HKDollars 6bn of paper currency, equal to about 10 per cent of the current notes in circulation The Hong Kong government will have to approve its bank note design. Enabling legislation and logistical and administrative measures, Bank of China needs to institute means May next year is the earliest it can issue notes. The Hong Kong government yesterday said it had decided not to introduce a 'deposit protection scheme' for bank depositors. The government does plan to introduce legislation which gives priority to small depositors in the case of bank failure. In the wake of Bank of Credit and Commerce's collapse in 1991, the government came under pressure to legislate for deposit protection. A period of public consultation found little support for the idea.</p>

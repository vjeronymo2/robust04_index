More than 20 international corporations, including China  Resources (Holdings) Co. Ltd of Hong Kong, C. Ito and Co. Ltd of  Japan and Siemens AG of Germany, have set up enterprises in the  province and plan future expansion.    The province has so far approved more than 3,380  foreign-funded programs with a total investment of 2.38 billion  U.S. dollars, according to Cong Dacai, chief of the provincial  foreign investment administrative bureau.    Last year the province attracted one billion U.S. dollars in  foreign investment for 1,720 projects, nearly twice the previous  year's figure.    So far, companies from more than 40 countries and regions,  including the Republic of Korea, the United States, Japan,  Singapore, Canada, Germany, Italy, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan,  have investments in the province.    More than 80 newly approved projects have a foreign  investment of at least five million U.S. dollars each. The  Harbin Sanxin Hydropower Corporation Ltd involves a total  investment of 210 million U.S. dollars, some 52.17 million of  which is from the New Era Land and Securities Investment Co. Ltd  of Hong Kong.    Over 70 percent of the foreign investment goes to the  processing industries such as textiles, garments, chemicals,  electronics, mechanical products and building materials.    Foreign investors are also interested in high-tech  production  and the service industries, including real estate.    Foreign investment is helping state-run enterprises upgrade  their products as well. So far, a total of 360 million U.S.  dollars has been put into major state-run enterprises in the  province.    Half of the province's total overseas investment last year  was from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.</p>

Stanislav Devaty, acting director of the secret  service, said at the meeting with the members of the Defense and  Security Committee of the Chamber yesterday that, although he is  not completely satisfied with BIS personnel, the office  continues to use the expert knowledge of some agents of the  communist secret police.    "I employ them because they are experts particularly on  intelligence technology and are therefore qualified to provide  training for new employees," Devaty explained and added that not  a single one of them worked at the StB in the Department for  Combating the Internal Enemy.    Devaty illustrated this by the example of one of the top men  in the BIS Economic Department who accompanied him yesterday to  the parliament.    Devaty also informed the deputies that BIS spent 489 million  korunas [Kc] from the State Treasury last year.</p>

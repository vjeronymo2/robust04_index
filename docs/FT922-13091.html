			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading POLITICAL worries in Russia curtailed an early advance in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FTSE started the session weak at 2609. But buyers soon showed their hand when June quickly moved forward reaching 2,645 by 9.30 am. This proved to be the high point of the session; thereafter "a badly handled order" sent June tumbling. The negative mid-morning news out of Russia served to bring out more sellers. The afternoon was said to have been dull, characterised by two-way trading, and with a firm Wall Street said to have had no influence on business. June closed at 2629, up 27 on the previous session and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover was a healthy 8330 contracts. Business in the traded options market was buoyant, with turnover reaching 49,892 lots. The FT-SE option was particularly active. It traded 15,472 contracts. Hanson was the busiest stock option and had a day's total of 4,349 lots. This was followed by the Euro FT-SE option at 2402. Some 2,335 lots were dealt in Midland Bank, and this was followed by National Power, in which 2,014 changed hands.</p>

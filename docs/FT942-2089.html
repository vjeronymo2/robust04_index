			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities It will be cold comfort to investors that yesterday's sharp fall in UK equities was brought about by non-domestic jitters. The main trigger was Friday's rise in the US commodities index, which fuelled inflationary fears and savaged bond markets. There is also little comfort in the fact that UK equities fell less far than continental markets. The FT-SE 100 index dropped through the 3,000 mark with few signs of institutional buying. Trading was thin, with most of the action in the futures market. Though it is now harder to argue that equities are overvalued on fundamentals, institutions are unlikely to move in until the market stabilises. The main hope remains that shares will be carried higher as the strength of the recovery in corporate earnings becomes apparent. But the higher bond yields rise, the greater the scope for disappointment on this score too. Profits will notonly be constrained by higher borrowing costs; the increased cost of capital could curtail investment, leading to less robust growth than currently anticipated. So far, the only indications of interest rates curbing activity are in the housing market, where inflation forecasts are being downgraded. But the government's need to plug its deficit seems likely at some stage to crowd out corporate sector investment too. An anaemic recovery would damp inflationary fears and so could be good for bonds. But such an outcome would hardly be bullish for shares.</p>

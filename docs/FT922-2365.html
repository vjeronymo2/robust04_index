			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Tribunal vindicates dismissed striker A NORTH sea oil worker sacked for striking was unfairly dismissed, an industrial tribunal has ruled, Catherine Milton writes. The tribunal, in Aberdeen, found that Mr James Byrne had been unfairly dismissed because he lost his job for taking unofficial strike action in 1990 while Mr John Goddard, described as an 'agent provocateur', had been kept on even though he had taken part in the action. Lawyers for Wood Group Engineering, the employer, argued that Mr Byrne was dismissed for disobeying lawful instructions to leave the oil rig, the site of a sit-in, whereas Mr Goddard had returned to shore. Yesterday the company said it was studying the result. Mr Byrne was one of more than 700 oil workers dismissed after unofficial strike action over recognition in 1990.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / French fighters to help US and Britain police Iraq FRANCE announced yesterday it would contribute about 10 fighter aircraft to help police the air exclusion zone over southern Iraq which British and US officials say will be proclaimed in the next few days. As western officials worked out details of the 'no fly zone', the Baghdad regime declared it would resist the plan 'with all means'. Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, said his country was ready to send to the Gulf about 10 Mirage 2000 fighters, the same type of aircraft that participated in the Gulf war. France already has eight Mirage fighters based in Turkey to enforce an air exclusion zone in northern Iraq to protect Kurds from attack by Iraqi forces. Britain agreed on Tuesday to send six Tornado aircraft to the Gulf to help enforce a security zone in the south to stop Iraqi aircraft from attacking Shia Moslems in the region. The US already has more than 200 combat, reconnaissance and control aircraft in the Gulf area and the Pentagon says there are no plans to send extra aircraft. Britain and the US have denied there is any rift between the allies about the 'no fly zone'. General Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, said the principle of the zone, designed to prevent Baghdad's forces striking the Shia population south of the 32nd parallel, had been fully agreed. Only the details - 'such as who does what, when' - remained to be sorted out, Gen Scowcroft said. US defence officials said the chances of a military confrontation would depend partly on how tough a 'no fly zone' was imposed in southern Iraq. 'Is it going to be really stringent: 'you fly one inch in and we're going to nail you' - or . . . 'we won't attack you unless you attack the Shia'?' one official said. US officials said the three allied governments agreed that their planned action was fully covered by UN resolution 688 and that there was no requirement to return to the Security Council for an additional mandate. Gen Scowcroft claimed there was increasing evidence that President Saddam Hussein was pursuing genocidal policies in southern Iraq. Iraq's defiant response to the western allies' plan came after a meeting of military and political leaders presided over by President Saddam. The Baghdad statement said the Iraqi people and leadership would not allow the 'design' against Iraq to come to pass. They would resist it 'with all means'.</p>

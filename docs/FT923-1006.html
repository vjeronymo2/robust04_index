			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Sluggish growth in US THE US economy grew sluggishly in the second quarter, revised figures from the Commerce Department confirmed yesterday. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.5 per cent, rather than the 1.4 per cent earlier reported. This was the fifth successive quarter of slow growth, following a contraction of output in the winter of 1990-91. The sluggish overall growth reflected a slight fall in personal consumption spending and a deterioration in net exports, offset by a higher investment expenditure and a rebuilding of corporate inventories. The price of gross domestic purchases - a broad measure of inflation - rose at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent compared with 3.1 per cent in the first quarter, confirming that inflationary pressures remain moderate. Separate figures for state unemployment insurance claims, published yesterday, showed a 15,000 increase to 414,000 in the week to September 12, another sign that labour markets remain weak.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Palestinian peace support slips Israel's military officer in charge of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday gave the cabinet a grave assessment of disintegrating Palestinian support for the peace agreement and deteriorating economic conditions in the territories. Major-General Danny Roth-schild told the government that Palestinian opposition to the peace accord was growing daily with the delay in implementing the agreement and the worsening economic situation. At the same time, Palestinian sources reported that three more members of the main Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation had resigned their committee posts in protest at the way the PLO was being run. Gen Rothschild's warning came hours before Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were due to resume peace talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba. Both sides differed widely yesterday about how long it would take to agree an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank area of Jericho. Mr Nabil Shaath, chief Palestinian negotiator, said he believed the two sides could reach agreement within three weeks. However, Mr Yossi Sarid, Israeli minister of the environment, said after yesterday's cabinet meeting he thought the talks could last six to eight weeks. 'We are happy the Taba talks are resuming but we hope the Palestinians will understand this time that time is critical and we won't make concessions on security,' he said. Implementation of the accord has already been delayed four weeks as the two sides failed to reach agreement on three outstanding issues: control over borders, the size of the Jericho area and security for Jewish settlers who will continue to live in Gaza-Jericho. Mr Shaath said over the weekend the two sides had reached broad agreement on many issues such as the schedule of Israeli troop withdrawal; the composition, size and deployment of the Palestinian police force; and the security co-ordination for borders and roads. The remaining issues, he said, could be settled in a similar process of compromise. AP adds from Amman: Share prices on Amman's stock exchange came to life over the weekend in the wake of a Jordanian-PLO economic accord, with particular investor interest in banks which are expected to reopen branches in the occupied West Bank. Bank shares rose by almost the authorised daily limit of 5 per cent and accounted for JD4.5m (Pounds 4.3m) worth of traded stock.</p>

We thank you, your  government, and the British people for the humanitarian aid you  have extended to the Kurdish people in Iraq.    Your envoy, Lord Jeffrey Archer, has read the text of the  message you sent to us in the Kurdistan Parliament. The  measures taken by your government for the survival of the  Kurdish people and to ease their suffering have been extremely  helpful. [words indistinct] the safe havens and Britain's  participation in the [word indistinct] alert force and your  constant pressure on the Iraqi Government to implement the UN  resolutions, particularly Resolution 688, not to mention your  support for democracy worldwide.    I would like to ask Your Excellency, in cooperation with the  member states of the alliance, to try to exclude the Kurdistan  region from the international economic embargo imposed by the UN  against Iraq to improve the difficult economic conditions of our  people. The Iraqi Government has imposed a tight siege on the  Kurdistan region and is selling us fuel at exorbitant prices in  hard currency. A few months ago it cut off the electricity  supply to the Dahuk Governorate. In addition, the abrogation of  the 25-dinar Iraqi banknote has caused grave economic damage to  the Kurdistan region. The living conditions are getting worse  every day.    Let me repeat my request for you to show a historic stance  to  lift the economic embargo on Kurdistan and to continue sending  aid to eliminate the fear, repression, and poverty and maintain  peace and amity. I hope you will be able to visit Kurdistan  soon.    Best regards.    Signed, Kusret Rasul Ali, Kurdistan prime minister    6 January 1994</p>

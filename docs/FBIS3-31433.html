			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At Cotroceni Palace this evening Romanian President  Ion Iliescu received a delegation of the National Trade Union  Block [BNS], led by its leader Dumitru Costin.    During the meeting, the BNS leaders discussed the six issues  they announced from the very beginning of the talks.    The talks concluded half an hour ago and the BNS leader  stated the following to our reporter Sorin Croitorescu:    [Begin Costin recording] In our talks with President Iliescu  this evening we advanced six points. As we affirmed at the  beginning of the discussions, we had the advantage of being the  third confederation that met with the president, so the joint  claims of the major trade unions have already been discussed and  over discussed. Thus, during our talks this evening we had the  opportunity to also approach other subjects that we consider of  maximum importance.    First of all, we provided arguments and reasons that led to  the current relation between our confederation and Romania's  government. The reason is the lack of a relation of partnership  that President Iliescu believes to be the basis for any  relations in any society, especially in a society with problems  such as the current Romanian society.    The second point of our discussion referred to the issue of  joint claims, that is the claims of CNSRL [National  Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Cartel Alfa-BNS, a  point on which we did not linger too long because our  viewpoints, namely the viewpoints of the two confederations, do  not differ.    The third point of our discussions was the draft social  accord that our confederation submitted at the end of January,  and we were surprised to see that there was no reaction  whatsoever from the government, presidency, political parties,  or even trade unions. Very few people praised or criticized this  material and we still believe that only through a  social-economic accord can this moment of crisis be overcome.    The fourth issue discussed was the memorandum with the IMF.  Before the start of talks in the Romanian Parliament, we gave  the press an analysis that we allowed ourselves to make. We  believe that it is absolutely necessary to present a viewpoint  on this memorandum, because even on a superficial reading of the  text, one can notice that the memorandum lacks the social  component. And as far as all current major transformations that  Romania's government wishes to carry out are concerned, if these  are not supported by a program of retraining and by the creation  of new jobs, then the idea of reform will be destroyed from the  very beginning. The reason for this, as I have already  mentioned, the social costs will be very high and if we, as  partners -- on the one hand we, the trade union confederations  and on the other hand the executive power -- will not know how  to find a moment of balance in which the costs of the transition  should be at the lower possible level, at an acceptable level,  we will discredit from the beginning the idea of reform.    This evening, it was suggested to us that we should continue  the discussions that started yesterday with the executive and as  soon as we almost reach the final stage of the talks --  regardless of whether or not all issues will have been solved --  we will certainly have the mediation of the presidential  institution in the conflict that exists between trade union  groups, that is trade union confederations and the Romanian  Government.

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs underperform The drugs sector made modest progress but nevertheless continued to underperform the wider market amid suggestions that at least one big US broking house, rumoured to be Kidder Peabody, had downgraded the pharmaceuticals sector. These rumours offset news earlier in the session that the Clinton administration in the US has postponed its healthcare reforms. Another bull point for the sector was the market's confidence that Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue had coasted home, despite persistent talk in the financial press that the issue would encounter substantial difficulties and had failed to attract sufficient overseas support. Zeneca's rights close on Monday. Zeneca 'old' closed a penny harder at 622p on hefty turnover of 4.2m shares, while the 'new' shares, quoted in fully-paid form, were the same price. ICI held at 697p. Fisons, which drops out of the FT-SE 100 index on Monday, nevertheless proved the best performer in that index over the week. Although 3 1/2 easier yesterday at 171 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 4.2m shares, the stock was still 16 1/2 higher over the five-day period, reflecting a mixture of takeover speculation and the official US launch of its anti-asthma drug Tilade. TSB shares continued to bump up against their all-time high, reached on Monday, before closing a net 1 1/2 better at 195p. The bank is scheduled to reveal interim results on Thursday with pre-tax profits expected to come in at around the Pounds 75m, compared with a Pounds 92m and the market set to focus on the level of bad debts. The water stocks included in the FT-SE 100 list, big winners in mid-week when a number of institutions were said to have been aggressive buyers, fell sharply following a sustained bout of profit-taking. Severn Trent, which goes ex-dividend on Monday, fell 13 to 470p after exceptionally heavy trading of 4.6m. North West lost 10 to 457p and Anglian 9 to 360 1/2 p. Thames eased 7 to 459p. Dealers reported substantial switching out of the electricity stocks ('recs') and into the Scottish generators, where Hydro featured with a 5 rise to 344p. Scottish Power hardened to 322p on 4.2m traded. Southern Electricity dropped 11 1/2 to 455 1/2 p, South Wales 10 to 536p and Midland 8 to 463p. BT came in for sustained buying interest, the shares closing 5 higher at 428p; the BT3 marketing effort moved into overdrive at the start of the week. A bear squeeze drove Cable &amp; Wireless up 9 to 748p. Blick, the electronics group, plunged 43 to 455p after press comment on the company's accounting procedures. Advisors to Blick insisted, however, that the changes were in accounting presentation, not accounting policy. Beales Hunter was another big casualty in the electricals area of the market, the shares sliding 27 to 265p, after 262p, following the profits warning. Shares in Asda, the food retailer, saw the largest volume of trading with some 27.5m changing hands, with an American buyer thought to have bought a block of 6m traded at 75p. The stock closed up 1 1/2 p at 74p. The sector also saw business in Kingfisher, the retail conglomerate, said to be the focus of some big switching activity with a block of 5m shares traded at 592p, the eventual closing price and 3 better on the day. Leading discount food retailer Kwik Save ended its last day in the FTSE 100 index 8 down at 713p, against a background of worries on how the group is coping in an increasingly tough discount sector. Brewers looked a lively sector in comparison, with some dealers selling Guinness, following a presentation by LVMH, the French luxury goods manufacturer with which the brewer and distiller has a 24 per cent cross-holding. Analysts interpreted part of the information as negative about some of the groups' important markets. The shares closed 11 down at 484p. Grand Met was the beneficiary of Guinness' misfortune, picking up 7 to close at 414p. In food manufacturing, a slow day revived rumours of a bid for United Biscuits, where the shares closed up 5 at 400p. The market appreciated reports that British Aerospace is to implement a reorganisation of its businesses, a move likely to improve its dividends paying capacity. The shares rose 12 to 413p after trade of 5.2m. Nervous trading in British Steel ahead of figures on Monday saw the shares give up 3 1/2 to 98 1/2 p, with US selling, mostly in the final hour of the session, prompting the slide. Analysts expect the company to report a loss of Pounds 150 million. Williams Holdings were favoured by several securities houses, including Charterhouse Tilney. The shares put on 9 to 318p. Glynwed International finished 3 ahead at 305p. Carr Kitcat however remained cautious and cut current year profit expectations by 3.5 million to Pounds 39 million. The same house weighed in with a savage profit downgraded for APV, reducing the current year figure by Pounds 9 million to Pounds 14 million. The shares firmed 1 1/2 to 101.5p. Bid target Securiguard added 8 to 309p amid talk that its predator Rentokil Group, 3 up at 188p, would soon raise its offer. Other statistics, Page 12</p>

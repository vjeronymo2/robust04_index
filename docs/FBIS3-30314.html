			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/1/1994 -- Romanian President  Ion Iliescu remains open to the variants of forming the  executive resulted from the dialogue among the political  parties, said presidency spokesman Traian Chebeleu at a press  conference on Friday [28 January]. It rests with the parties,  the spokesman said, to carry out negotiations among themselves  in order to find the best ways of forming a parliamentary  majority or an eventual executive team. "If the outcome of the  negotiations is a parliamentary coalition larger than the one  supporting the current government, the president will salute  that," said Chebeleu.    Government reshuffling is a prerogative of the prime  minister  and he may do it whenever he sees it as necessary, said the  spokesman.    The next week visit to Bucharest by the two co-presidents of  the peace conference on former Yugoslavia was appreciated by the  presidency spokesman as the result of the interest constantly  shown by Romania in supporting the settlement of the Yugoslav  crisis. The role of the Geneva conference as well as of the  neighbouring countries is to support the efforts made by the  countries involved in the settling of the crisis as a viable  solution can emerge only from within the former Yugoslavia, the  spokesman said and further added: "We can only contribute to  the creation of an external climate favourable to the dialogue."  Romania, as a neighbour, is interested in the settlement of the  problems in the zone as soon as possible, leaving out the use of  force means.    The Partnership for Peace is, the spokesman said, an offer  made by the NATO to the Eastern countries, an offer which we  have saluted. Romania's linking to the Euro-Atlantic structures  and the NATO is an important step toward a strengthened security  for Romania. It is a success for the Romanian diplomacy as the  Partnership for Peace matches our constant approaches with  respect to the role of NATO in this part of Europe, namely, that  of not making discriminations with regard to the security of the  countries in the zone. This point of view has prevailed in the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said the Romanian presidency  spokesman.    Presidential spokesman, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu also  referred his news conference on January 28 to President Ion  Iliescu's visit in Timisoara and, before that, in Focsani,  regarding a pointless protest by the county branch of the Alfa  Trade Union Cartel, and, respectively, the president's contacts  with private companies, as seen by an EXPRES MAGAZIN journalist.    The presidential spokesman recalled to the attending  journalists the fact that "during almost all his visits in the  country the president inquired about and visited private  economic enterprises." Ambassador Chebeleu referred in that  context to the Romanian head of state's meeting with Romanian  businessmen on November 30, 1993, his attendance of the "1993  Private Companies' Top" meeting, where he made an extensive  address, as well as to the fact that on his trips abroad, when  he was accompanied by businessmen, the Romanian president  included every time also representatives of private Romanian  firms.</p>

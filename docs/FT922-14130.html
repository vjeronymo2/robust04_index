			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Wall St drives Japan lower JAPANESE EQUITIES opened lower early today following a sharp fall on Wall Street overnight, write Our Markets Staff. The unsettled start in Tokyo, which saw the Nikkei average of leading shares more than 450 points lower in mid-morning, came after the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 61.94 to 3,213.55 last night. The fall in US prices was sparked in part by the shake-out in Japanese stocks in the previous session, when the Nikkei plunged 644.82 to 17,791.55  -its lowest levels since November 1986. The drop on Wall Street also reflected a big computerised sell program, wiping 20 points off the Dow. Japanese brokers and businessmen saw little prospect of a recovery, after last week's government spending package and a cut in the official discount rate had failed to boost confidence. 'The stock market is now like a bottomless swamp,' Mr Yoshinari Yamashiro, president of NKK, the steel company, told a press conference. Any hope that last week's action by the authorities might restore market confidence has been crushed by the selling of bank shares. Yesterday the Nikkei average of bank stocks fell 6.9 per cent, against a 3.5 per cent decline in the overall average. In the past 10 days, bank shares have fallen by 20 per cent, the single biggest element in a 12 per cent decline in the Nikkei. The market value of Industrial Bank of Japan has fallen by 77 per cent from its peak of Y15,000bn at the height of the bull market in December 1989. Nevertheless, brokers report few signs of panic.

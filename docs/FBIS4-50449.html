			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Top Government Trade Mission Woos HK </F> Investors"]    [Text] The mainland is sending a top level trade and  investment delegation to Hong Kong later this month, it was  announced in Beijing yesterday.    The 160-member mission plans to offer 760 business projects  on the mainland to investors from Hong Kong, and other Southeast  Asian countries, said the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation (Moftec).    "Most of the investment projects will be available to the  public for the first time," said Ma Xiuhong, deputy  director-general of foreign investment at Moftec.    The trade and investment forums, which will run May 23-26,  have been organized by Moftec and the Hong Kong Trade  Development Council.    "And we have deliberately included projects in many  provinces  and cities from the country's central and western parts," Ma  said.    The preferential economic deals previously only offered to  the coastal regions are being extended to areas in the interior.    The current special economic zones along the coast offer tax  breaks.    But uniform policies across the country are the basic demand  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which  China wants to re-enter.    The trade-boost visit to Hong Kong is the first of its kind,  Ma said.    Moftec Vice-Minister Zheng Silin will lead the delegation,  which comprises representatives from four ministries and 24  provinces and cities.    These include the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry  of  Electronics Industry, the China National Non-ferrous Metals  Corporation and the China North Industry Group.    Overseas investment grew faster in the interior than it did  along the coast last year, she said.    Wu Yi, Moftec Minister, said that central and western parts  of China, which are abundant in natural resources, will  experience an economic boom in the next century.    Hong Kong investors have gradually expanded their interests  in the hinterland, Ma said.    "And more and more Hong Kong businesses have invested in  infrastructure sectors, like power stations and railways," she  said.    More than 90 of the proposed businesses are in the chemical  sector.    And over 110 of them are big infrastructure projects.    Light industry and electronics schemes each account for more  than 80 of the investment proposals.    And over 160 machinery businesses will be on offer.</p>

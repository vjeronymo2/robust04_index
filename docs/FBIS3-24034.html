			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's </F> ambassador to the Russian Federation, by Ihor Hrushko, under the  rubric "Politics"; place and date not given: "Volodymyr  Kryzhanivskyy: `Let Us Look for the Things That Bring Us Closer  Together'"]    [Text]  <H5>  Guest Seat </H5>   At a time of historic upheavals, when traditional  perceptions have proven false and when the "older brothers" are  only slowly beginning to understand that their "younger  brothers" have become their equals, it is very difficult for  these same "older brothers" to rid themselves of deeply rooted  stereotypes. For those who do not believe this, we offer the  following interview given to HOLOS UKRAYINY's correspondent by  People's Deputy Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's Ambassador  Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Russian Federation. The  first question put to the ambassador concerned what is probably  the most important issue of today: When will a new Friendship  and Cooperation Treaty at last be signed to replace the old  agreement signed back in 1990? For this document will determine  how these two neighboring countries will live with each another  for many years to come.    [Kryzhanivskyy] Ukraine is interested in signing this  document as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we now sense a  certain tendency on the part of the Russians to hold up the  talks. Why? In my opinion, the reason for this is that this  intergovernmental treaty will have to "dot all the i's" once and  for all on certain issues that the Russian side is striving to  hold in a "preserved" state.    Above all, this applies to the Crimea. Because this question  will have to be settled in a definitive fashion. Dual  citizenship is another issue. I might add that the latter is a  contrived issue, despite the fact that it is being trumpeted  very actively by Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev and other  representatives of Russia's political circles. President N.  Nazarbayev properly proposed introducing the concept of  "postponed citizenship." In other words, an individual who  leaves Kazakhstan, for example, to take up permanent residence  in the Russian Federation becomes a Russian citizen. And  vice-versa. A normal solution to the problem, you would think.  But no, some people in Moscow are very much opposed to this.  President N. Nazarbayev cited the example of the Sudeten Germans  on the eve of the Second World War. Their rights had to be  protected no matter what... And Czechoslovakia was the first to  be brought to her knees.    [Hrushko] The declaration signed by the three presidents  relieved the tension surrounding the nuclear weapons located in  Ukraine. However, many analysts believe that now Russia has to  take some concrete steps with respect to the entire package of  agreements -- in particular, provide us with security  guarantees. Is Moscow prepared to do so?    [Kryzhanivskyy] This question is still being "mulled over"  inside the Russian Federation's presidential structures. There  are indications of a certain unwillingness and of an attempt to  delay matters. Even though Russia would benefit most by this. I  believe that if it received a specific document, the Ukrainian  parliament even in its present make-up would finally settle the  issue of Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty.    But so far there has been no anwer. It seems that it suits  someone in the capital of the Russian Federation to portray  Ukraine as recalcitrant and obstinate.    We see further evidence of this in the "invitation" that the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued to Ukraine's  ambassador on 9 February. It is customary in diplomatic practice  to summon ambassadors only in extraordinary circumstances, when  the situation involves something very urgent. Yet when I arrived  at the Foreign Ministry, they expressed their concern to me  about an alleged recent increase in instances of desecration in  Ukraine of monuments supposedly associated with Russian history.    [Hrushko] I have not heard of anything of this sort  happening  recently...    [Kryzhanivsky] Neither have I. They informed me of three  incidents from the "remote past." The first had occurred in  1991. You recall that some disgraceful signs had been posted  near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Kiev. This was an old  affair, possibly even one that had been masterminded by  Kryuchkov's people. The second case dated to the same time --  the incident in which the memorial plaque on the N. Bulgakov  Museum was splattered with paint. And the third, which happened  half a year ago, was the destruction of the bust of M. Kuznetsov  in Rivne Oblast. I regarded this act as absolutely inappropriate  and senseless.    [Hrushko] What, in your opinion, was the reason for this  diplomatic demarche?    [Kryzhanivskyy] One senses that it was largely a calculated  move. Of the 25 million Russians that need to be "protected," 12  million live in Ukraine. But to the great chagrin of some  Russian politicians, nobody is insulting these people, nobody is  oppressing their national feelings or their civil rights. In the  absence of facts, it is necessary to concoct something in order  to persuade the world that Ukraine is uncivilized. This, despite  the fact that the Ukrainian public at large expressed strong  indignation regarding the acts of vandalism that I described  above.    [Hrushko] Another stumbling block in our bilateral relations  is the Black Sea Fleet.    [Kryzhanivskyy] Yes, the problem with respect to the fleet  is  not an easy one. Even though this problem is not at the top of  the agenda at this time. The Russians are in no hurry to settle  this matter. They are obviously planning to approach it from  different angle after the election of Yu. Meshkov. And his  position is clear: the fleet must go to Russia. This is one side  of the issue. On the other side, we have the Trilateral  Declaration, a very important event that put off the resolution  of this question for a while.    In my view, our defense minister, General Radetskyy, "dotted  all the i's" very clearly. I have in mind the procedure for  dividing up the Black Sea Fleet: first we inventory it, perhaps  even reduce it, and then we divide it up. So far, Russia has not  agreed to this and is biding her time.    [Hrushko] The problem of the fleet is closely linked with  the  problem of the Crimea as a whole, especially following the  presidential election on the peninsula. Upon his return from  Moscow, where he met with influential politicians, Yu. Meshkov  began talking of billions and of a ruble zone...    [Kryzhanivskyy] He did meet with S. Shakhray, V. Shumeyko,  and Mr. Ryurikov, the President's aide for international  relations. I see nothing wrong in this. For example, should the  prime minister of Tatarstan visit Kiev, let him meet with  influential people. However, it is premature to speak of money,  especially 50 billion for the resettlement of the Crimean  Tatars. Yu. Meshkov expressed this request. But this is a long  way off from actually receiving the money. The same applies to  the ruble zone. I do not believe that Russia will agree quite so  readily to set up an "aerodynamic pipeline" through which to  pump out its currency. Recall the example of Kazakhstan.    In other words, Yu. Meshkov met with people, they got to  know  him, but with very little in the way of specific results for him.    [Hrushko] Did the Crimean president visit the Ukrainian  Embassy?    [Kryzhanivskyy] No. Perhaps he waited for us to invite him,  or, what is more likely, someone advised him not to visit us.  Still, I eventually spoke to him over the telephone.  Incidentally, we spoke in Ukrainian. I hope that on his next  visit, Mr. Meshkov will visit us, recognizing that the Embassy  of Ukraine is also his embassy. We will always be of assistance  to the Crimea, just as we are to other regions of our country.  [Hrushko] Do you think that we can now speak of an official  position or policy of the Russian Federation with respect to the  Crimea?    [Kryzhanivskyy] The ink has not yet dried on the signatures  placed by the three presidents on the joint declaration.  Consequently, the Russian side's official position is that the  Crimea is Ukraine's internal affair. But there are influential  people in Moscow who would very much like Ukraine to resolve the  Crimean problem according to the principle described by Ilf and  Petrov: "on a saucer with a blue border" [i.e., in very elegant  fashion]. In other words, Kiev gives its approval for a  referendum, following which Crimea becomes independent, and then  as a subject of international law, it speaks of becoming part of  Russia.    Mr. Meshkov, however, is not raising this issue. Because he  is fully aware that this would constitute an anti-constitutional  act directed at undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity,  which would provoke an appropriate response from Kiev and the  world community.    [Hrushko] In the era of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian  Permanent Mission to Moscow served as channel through which the  Kremlin's big bosses sometimes relayed instructions to their  subjects in Kiev. Thank God, the times have changed. A  full-fledged Ukrainian embassy has now been working in Moscow  for more than a year. In your opinion, what are the embassy's  principal tasks?    [Kryzhanivskyy] It is too early to talk of a full-fledged  embassy. We are short of diplomats and short of housing. Of  course, we have had some tangible accomplishments in our work.  But we could have done a lot more if we had enough people. I am  not talking about swelling the embassy staff. But Russia ranks  number one in importance for us. We must therefore do everything  in our power to ensure that the work of this embassy is  productive.    With respect to tasks. Our most important task is to  maintain  close bilateral economic relations. Our two states need to hold  talks constantly. It is essential for us to follow and  understand the complex processes taking place in Russian society  and to be able to foresee the Russian Federation's policy  towards Ukraine.    And, naturally, to disseminate true, undistorted information  about our country in Russia. We all read the Russian press and  watch Russian television. They carry nothing but negative  information about Ukraine. Many Russians have absolutely no idea  what is actually happening in our country.    There are a great number of problems both in our country and  in Russia; life is very hard for the people. But looking only  for the things that divide us will lead us to nowhere. Instead,  we should look for the best in each other, look for the things  that bring us closer together and unite us.    [Hrushko] Thank you for this interview.</p>

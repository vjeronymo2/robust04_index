			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cussins Property back in the black A return to profits in the first half to end-June was reported by Cussins Property Group, the Newcastle-based contracting and construction group. Profit on ordinary activities before tax was Pounds 437,000, against a restated loss of Pounds 271,000. The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 7.22m to Pounds 8.08m and was struck after reduced interest charges of Pounds 355,000 (Pounds 1.05m). Mr Peter Cussins, chairman, said the core north-east housebuilding business was performing well and the current level of reservations promised further improvements in the second half. Borrowings and overheads continued to be reduced, he said, while asset sales were being achieved despite the difficult market. Earnings per share came out at 3p (3p losses). Mr Cussins said the restoration of the dividend was dependent upon the elimination of the deficit on distributable reserves, which currently stood at Pounds 1.43m. The sale of the Denmark Centre for Pounds 3.2m would eliminate Pounds 785,000 of the deficit, he added.</p>

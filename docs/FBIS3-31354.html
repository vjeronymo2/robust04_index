			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Vodusek: "SOVA Abandoning Political </F> Role, Police Taking Its Place"]    [Text] Ljubljana, 6 February -- In a special statement for  DELO, Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek denied the existence of a  secret agreement on the division of interest spheres between the  Slovene intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Internal  Affairs. According to our sources, intensive preparations and  talks on a new organization of the Slovene Intelligence-Security  Agency SOVA and the Security Organ of the Defense Ministry VOMO  are underway.    A working draft of the Law on SOVA, which will appear as  strictly confidential on the agenda of a close session of  Bucar's commission for the supervision of intelligence agencies  this month, has stirred sentiments in the secret services. At  one of many meetings of acting directors of intelligence  services Drago Fers and Dusan Mikus, and Defense and Interior  Ministers Janez Jansa and Ivan Bizjak, they have supposedly  agreed on a new division of interest and working spheres.  According to this information, the Interior Ministry will take  over entirely the counterintelligence activities in March this  year, while SOVA will primarily retain the intelligence work  abroad. Dr. Drago Fers, who, following the resignation of  Silvan Jakin, is acting director until the appointment of a SOVA  director, has confirmed the expert meetings at the "highest  level," but adamantly denied any sort of tripartite agreement,  that is to say, any division according to which one service  would cede some or all activity to another service. It is all  about covering gray areas, Fers assures and stresses the  functional division, according to which SOVA will deal with  intelligence activities exclusively, that is to say, gathering  information abroad, while the protection, that it so say,  counterintelligence activities will be taken over by the  criminal department of the Interior Ministry, which has already  performed these activities since the change of the regime.  Namely, SOVA is not authorized for possible court investigation  in proving criminal activities aimed against the state, that is  to say, undermining the constitutional order at home, but can  merely confirm the connection of the accused with foreign  intelligence services. As Fers assures, they have been  coordinating spheres of action at these meetings and exchanged  views on the formation of the entire security-intelligence  system. According to Drago Fers, SOVA has completely broken off  with the former political police, which chiefly used to monitor  and prove enemy activities, that is to say, the existence of the  internal enemy, as over two-thirds of the information in the  past was counterintelligence information. It will, of course,  not completely abandon its protective role. It is supposed to  share with VOMO some intelligence tasks abroad for which there  is, understandably, no legal basis. Namely, both services are  active abroad and could resolve certain tasks more efficiently  together, Fers says.    Hints about the final dismantling of SOVA have also trickled  into the public because of fear that, due to the specialization  of SOVA's work, more old agents, who were supposedly linked to  the old generation of politicians, would lose their jobs. The  fact that the methods of ruling are actually the same and that  intelligence services are at their core on the basis of events  in the secret services spurred numerous speculations and  criticism of possible political misuse, that is to say, a  political background to the above-mentioned reorganization  within these services. SOVA, which has gone through numerous  reorganizations already, was allegedly not reliable enough for  the political right wing, and for this reason the police, that  is to say, Interior Minister Bizjak would take over the  counterintelligence segment, which is, of course, the most  interesting for the politicians. Jansa's service, which  concentrates primarily on military problems, will stay divided  into intelligence and counterintelligence sections. As Drago  Fers assures, SOVA and VOMO would primarily divide duties in the  realm of intelligence work, which amounts to approximately  one-third of all data. The skeptics believe that the entire  debate is all about political games and less about concern for  national security, because it allegedly involves a controlled  disintegration of the Slovene intelligence system, that is to  say, the dismantling of the former State Security Service.    Leaving aside the rumors that a restructuring of the  political scene is in the background, our sources claim that a  positive scenario of the reconstruction of the security system,  which will primarily have to assume the responsibility for  protection of the Slovene strategic economic interests abroad,  is nevertheless underway.    Despite the formal position of the intelligence service,  Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek has supposedly remained without  strategic information and analyses. As we have learned, the  experts from the United States, that is to say, Clinton's state  security adviser personally, have also been drawn into expert  assistance in the organization of the Slovene intelligence  system. Regarding all this, it would be worth mentioning the  announcement of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek that he will  activate a special service within his cabinet on 15 February.  This service will, despite a rather unambitious task of  overcoming bureaucratic obstacles and helping the citizens, that  is to say, dealing with the problems of a little man, not be  able to completely avoid a sort of intelligence activities,  primarily because of the avalanche of anonymous letters that  supposedly report cases of unlawful privatization, theft,  illicit activities in the economic domain, and, above all,  corruption and other matters in the pasts of several ministers,  for which they should say goodbye to public life.    According to some information, changes in the leaderships of  both intelligence services should also take place in March,  which would conclude the experimental phase in the appointment  of directors of the intelligence services. State security  systems all over the world consist of intelligence and  counterintelligence segments, while the services protecting the  constitutional order are, naturally, also a part of the  repertoire, regardless of how conservative this sounds. The  division of SOVA into intelligence and counterintelligence parts  can only be confirmation of the normalization in the Slovene  secret services. The most dangerous thing is a concentration of  great power within the intelligence system.</p>

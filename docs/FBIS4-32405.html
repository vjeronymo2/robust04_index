			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- Romania does not  hold chemical weapons and has not included in its research  programme the manufacture of such weapons, said at the weekly  meeting with the press the spokeswoman for the Ministry of  National Defense Elena Olariu.    The question of whether or not Romania possesses chemical  weapons was raised, she said, during National Defense Minister  Gheorghe Tinca's visit to the United States as a consequence of  confusing statements made on Romania's joining the Australia  Group for the non-proliferation of the chemical weapons.    "We once again reiterate our previous statement and  underline  once more that Romania is ready to fulfill the conditions for  the ban on chemical weapons," the Spokeswoman said. She also  pointed out that the Romanian side invited through the Defense  Minister Gheorghe Tinca a team of U.S. experts to visit all the  chemical plants so as to dispel any doubts as to Romania's  credibility in this respect.    Under the same topic the press was informed that an  agreement  was signed during Mr. Tinca's U.S. tour, laying the legal  foundations of the cooperation between the Romanian and U.S.  armies. The agreement outlines the main directions for the  development of the military cooperation, the participation in  the Partnership for Peace and the assessments on the stability  and security in Central and Eastern Europe.    Mr. Tinca in his turn imparted on his American colleagues  Romania's assessments of the stability in this area, informed  them about the reform of the army, the training of the staff and  the endowment with modern weaponry and equipment so that  Romania's Army could be on a par with NATO standards. Mr.  Tinca's opinion, the spokeswoman said, is that the relations  between Romania and the United States in the military sphere are  good and that there is the willingness to deepen them.</p>

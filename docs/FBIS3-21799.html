			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Peasant leader Evo Morales of the Chapare coca  growing region has made an appeal to the Cochabamba prefect  because of the peasants' uncertainty and desperation in face of  the government plans to reduce coca plantations by force.    He said: "I have great admiration for the prefect. I believe  he enjoys great sympathy not only among the coca growers but  also among the people of Cochabamba, and his own party. This is  why I would like to ask him to implore to his son (director of  the Agricultural Reconversion Directorate) to prevent the  suffering of coca growers by ordering the suspension of the  mandatory coca reduction."    Less than three weeks ago the son of the prefect, whose name  is also German Lema like his father, took over the Agricultural  Reconversion Directorate which has the responsibility of  implementing the coca eradication policy throughout the country.    Morales said he made the appeal with the understanding that  the first political authority of Cochabamba, due to his great  humanitarian feelings, could intercede and "even order the  suspension of the coca eradication plan because this would be an  instruction not only from a father but from the prefect."    The coca growers believe the government pretext for reducing  coca plantations is exaggerated and responds to pressure from  U.S. organizations interested in eliminating coca.    He said: "The government knows that the Chapare region is a  zone highly influenced by drug trafficking. The government knows  this well, therefore the justifications for reducing coca are  not solid and awaken greater susceptibility on the credibility  of the government operations." [sentence as published]    The peasants of the Chapare region are afraid and they do  not  want to leave their land to preserve their coca plantations  which, according to several governments, represent the basis of  the national economy.    Morales, who is going to Lima to attend an international  meeting of peasants, said he will meet with Nobel Peace Prize  winner Rigoberta Menchu to report the government plans, and to  ask her to send a letter to the president asking him to stop the  coca reduction project.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Saatchis stop Dreyfus buying Adidas shares The Saatchi brothers, Maurice and Charles, have obtained a court order preventing Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a director of the advertising group they founded, from buying shares in sports-wear producer Adidas. Mr Louis Dreyfus moved from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi last year to become chief executive of Adidas but stayed on as a non-executive director of the advertising group. Backed by a Pounds 260m (Dollars 395m) consortium that reportedly included the two Saatchi brothers as well as Credit Lyonnais and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance group, Dreyfus himself took a large stake in the company. In London's High Court this week the Saatchis and Hatzone, an investment company half owned by Maurice Saatchi, won an undertaking from Mr Louis-Dreyfus and Mr Christian Tourres that they would not buy Adidas shares from seven companies. The row over the shares is the latest to hit the Saatchi boardroom. Earlier this year Mr Maurice Saatchi and Mr Charles Scott, both executive directors, had a embarassing falling out in public over group strategy. In April Adidas reported 1993 profits of DM9m against a loss of DM149m in 1992.</p>

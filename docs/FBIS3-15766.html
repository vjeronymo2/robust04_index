			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgian envoy to the European Union, Zurab  Abashidze reported that on 8 March the council of the European  Union made a decision to start negotiations with Georgia on  preparing a comprehensive agreement on cooperation. This  agreement is viewed as the first stage towards getting close  with the central and eastern European states and the European  Union and further integration with them. The Baltic states have  already signed a similar agreement with the European Union and  negotiations are being held with Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova.  Thus, Georgia is the first Caucasian state with which the  European Union decided to negotiate about the agreement.    The next stage of the European integration is getting a  status of an associate member, which has been granted to a  number of the former socialist countries in Europe: Poland,  Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The agreement on  cooperation will create a legal basis for developing  comprehensive relations with the 12 member states of the  European Union and envisages a number of practical privileges in  the sphere of political contacts, economic links, and trade.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / New technology for old pictures THE Hulton Deutsch picture library, one of the largest in the world, with more than 13m images, is moving to the latest CD-Rom technology. The company, bought from the BBC in 1988 by Mr Brian Deutsch, a former cable television operator, published People, its first CD-Rom, this week. A single disc, the size of a conventional music compact disc, contains 10,000 images. The disc, used with a personal computer, is designed for researchers, picture editors and advertising agencies, who can call up a name and see thumbnail pictures with references and captions. The aim is to speed up picture research and the ordering of pictures, which can then be delivered within 24 hours. A second CD of pictures from the 1930s is now in preparation. Each CD costs Pounds 350. Mr Deutsch has recently raised Pounds 5m from a syndicate of investors led by CINVen, the venture-capital group, which has taken a 35 per cent stake in the company. The library was created by Edward Hulton, publisher of Picture Post magazine, and was owned by the BBC between 1958 and 1988. Many early collections have been added and since Mr Deutsch acquired it, the Keystone, Fox and Central Press News archives have been added.</p>

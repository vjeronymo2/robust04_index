			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking causes Nikkei to retreat in quiet trading PROFIT-TAKING pushed the Nikkei average back in quiet trading yesterday after Monday's 3.6 per cent gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 234.79 off at 23,566.39, after a high in the morning of 23,901.89 and a low of 23,514.28. Volume came to 220m shares, against 180m in Monday's half-day session. Declines led rises by 631 to 306, with 143 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 16.76 to 1,746.67 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 3.39 to 1,322.35. A stronger yen and lower bond yields failed to encourage investors. Hopes that the fall in short-term interest rates would prompt domestic institutions to shift funds into the stock market were not realised. A fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life said most institutional investors would find it hard to increase their equity holdings before they closed their books in March. However, Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said last month's discount rate cut by the Bank of Japan had triggered a significant change in the interest rate structure. 'The decline in rates on postal deposits, the sharp fall in the overnight call rate and the bond market rally will prompt a gradual shift of funds into stocks,' he added. Interest rate-sensitive issues, which had gained ground during the past two trading days, receded on profit-taking. Tokyo Electric Power lost Y70 to Y3,630 on institutional selling. Speculative stocks were higher on short-term trading by dealers. Nippon Carbon surged Y230 to Y1,890 on short-covering. The stock has plunged recently on margin selling, falling over 50 per cent from its record high of Y3,450 set in mid-December. Toyo Ink gained Y50 to Y890. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 144.90 to 24,742.37 in 8.5m share volume. Export related issues fell on small-lot selling. Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, lost Y70 to Y2,020. Roundup TOKYO'S fall on profit-taking encouraged investors to do likewise in the Pacific Rim, though Hong Kong managed to close at a new high. HONG KONG resumed its record-breaking advance after Monday's pause, in spite of a wave of selling which brought prices off their afternoon peaks. The Hang Seng index registered a closing all-time high of 4,347.93, up 40.96. Turnover expanded to HKDollars 1.41bn from HKDollars 1.22bn. Jardine Matheson Holdings rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 40.25, while Hutchison Whampoa gained 40 cents to HKDollars 14.90 on rumours that it might float its telecommunications division. AUSTRALIA was disappointed when the central bank did not ease interest rates. The All Ordinaries index ended down 7.5 at 1,667.6 in steady turnover of ADollars 195m. BHP, which rose on oil exploration speculation on Monday, slipped 10 cents to ADollars 13.90. NEW ZEALAND declined in thin trading as a jump in the local dollar prompted profit-taking. The NZSE-40 index ended 29.34 or 1.9 per cent lower at 1,506.52. Turnover fell to NZDollars 13.7m from NZDollars 25.5m. TAIWAN continued to rise on hopes of lower interest rates. The weighted index gained 26.64 to 4,718.81. Turnover was TDollars 35.13bn (TDollars 33.88bn). MANILA rebounded after some intraday profit-taking. The composite index rose 10.24 to 1,241.48, the highest since November 1989, as turnover fell to 80m pesos from 93m. The listing of the electric distribution monopoly, the Manila Electric Co, is due today. SEOUL ended weaker on profit-taking in securities and large manufacturing shares. The composite index was down 4.83 to 645.27 in turnover of Won482.8bn, after Won440.2bn. BANGKOK sold banks after Monday's gains, and turned to construction blue chips. Siam Cement hit its 10 per cent ceiling on foreign buying, closing Bt54 higher at Bt632. The SET index ended 9.43 up at 728.93 in turnover of Bt4.78bn.</p>

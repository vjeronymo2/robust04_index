			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taipei, March 22 KYODO -- A nonpartisan group of  eight Japanese parliamentarians arrived in Taipei on Tuesday [22  March] over an issue of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled  government bonds bought by Taiwanese before and during World War  II.    The Japanese Diet members said they will hold negotiations  with 18 Taiwanese counterparts headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of  the National Assembly, on the issue.    They said during their stay in Taiwan, they will also meet  Taiwanese president Li Teng-hui.    The group of eight comprises two opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) parliamentarians and one each from five  governing parties -- the Social Democratic Party [of Japan]  (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and new party Sakigake -- as well  as one independent.    It is the first time for a Japanese Diet group including an  SDPJ parliamentarian to visit Taiwan for the purpose of  negotiations since Japan broke its diplomatic relations with the  island country in 1972. The SDPJ has traditionally backed  Mainland China since even before 1972.    Japan has voiced its intention to refund the unpaid money to  the Taiwanese from the fiscal 1995 state budget beginning in  April 1995.    Wartime Japanese rulers in Taiwan forced people to deposit  part of their monthly salaries into postal savings accounts.    Many Taiwanese hope to link the unpaid money to indexing,  saying the value has risen by about 4,500 times from 1943 on the  basis of Japanese public servant salaries.    According to a Japanese Government estimate, the postal  savings deposits and other unpaid money totaled 452.4 million  yen owned by about 2,547,000 people.    Of the 452.4 million yen, postal savings account for 369  million yen, postal annuities 1.4 million yen and unpaid  salaries 82 million yen, according to the estimate.    The savings will be recognized as a fixed amount with high  interest, the sources said.    The issue is to be handled the same way the government  repaid  the savings of Okinawa residents deposited before the war, the  sources said.    From December 1969 to February 1972, just before the  reversion of Okinawa to Japan from the United States, the  government reimbursed 94 million yen in savings to residents,  adding 339 million yen to the principal as indexing.    Japan occupied Taiwan from 1885 to 1945. Before and during  the war, Japan encouraged the purchase of government bonds not  only in Japan but also in its former colonies of Korea and  Taiwan.</p>

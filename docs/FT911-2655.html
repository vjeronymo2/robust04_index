			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship - Wigmore Hall It is hard to see why a recession should cause a drop in the output of good young singers. Voices are not acquired on credit and one would have thought there should be a continuous supply of new talent, if the teachers and interest in the art form are still there, as there is every reason to believe they are. The Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship, awarded since 1956, has a history of producing winners who have gone on to successful careers. This year, indeed, it may do the same again, as the prizes went to very worthy competitors. But there was not the same depth of talent that has made it difficult in the past to decide the order of merit between a large field of high-quality entrants. On Friday, at the finals held at the Wigmore Hall, it seemed a fairly straightforward choice between two or three singers. The jury selected the soprano Mary Plazas, not necessarily the most exciting of them, which suggests that they were looking for a sense of style as well as purely vocal accomplishment. Her Debussy and Bellini were equally stylish, quietly expressive, and she sang as though she loved the music, which is always a help. The runner-up was the youngest competitor, 22-year-old mezzo Jane Irwin, and third prize went to the soprano Gail Pearson. I would have put them round the other way or even given first place to Miss Pearson. In a competition that had been singularly lacking in zest, she really made the audience sit up with her bright and confident singing of Gounod's Romeo et Juliette, while always giving the impression that she had plenty of voice to spare. Still, Jane Irwin's programme was well presented and there was every sign in her performances that voice and personality are developing in equal measure, which is a valuable attribute in one so young. In the closing address on behalf of the jury Janet Baker summed up three failings that it was felt had been prevalent during the competition: poor physical presentation; poor languages; and a poor choice of programmes. At many other Ferrier finals this would have seemed a querulous attitude with which to end. But not at this one. For all three faults had been disturbingly in evidence in the course of this last evening.</p>

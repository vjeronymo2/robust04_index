			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU HAS ITS HANDS, NOT ITS STANDS, FULL  </P> <P> What a shame it was to attend the San Diego State-Miami game and have only  34,200 other "real fans" attend.  </P> <P> I'm sure next season the typical San Diego sports fans (also called  "front-runners") will begin to show up and support the Aztec football program.  </P> <P> Al Luginbill has turned the program around and is a top-notch coach. Look for  San Diego State in the Top 20 for years to come. Maybe then, even the  front-runners will regularly attend games.  </P> <P> JOEL H. BRYDEN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUOMO SIGNS BILL TO BAN DWARF TOSSING  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed legislation Tuesday banning dwarf tossing and dwarf  bowling in New York bars, calling the activities a "strange diversion."  </P> <P> "Any activity which dehumanizes and humiliates these people is degrading to us  all," Cuomo said.  </P> <P> "This bill recognizes that and, in effect, declares these bizarre games to be  debased."  </P> <P> The bill, similar to one that became law in Florida last year, amounts to a ban  because the events have not been popular outside bars. It passed the  Legislature with only one dissenting vote.  </P> <P> The law targets taverns, but has no penalties for participants. Bars could  loose their liquor licenses.  </P> <P> Dwarf tossing is a competition in which people pick up dwarfs, who are wearing  harnesses, and heave them as far as possible at a padded target. It produced an  offshoot, dwarf bowling, in which a helmeted dwarf is strapped to a skateboard  and rolled into bowling pins. Both have been held as competitions for cash  prizes, Cuomo said.  </P> <P> "Dwarf tossing belongs in the Middle Ages, not the modern age," said state Sen.  Nicholas Spano, who sponsored the bill.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Colombian  company ECOPETROL stopped pumping crude oil through the Cano  Limon-Covenas pipeline, the country's largest, after a new  attack by the guerrillas.    ECOPETROL sources said the sabotage, which caused a moderate  fire and spilled an unspecified quantity of crude oil, occurred  at Km 150 between Arauquita and La Esmeralda, near the border  with Venezuela.    According to the report, members of the National Liberation  Army detonated three dynamite charges against the pipeline,  damaging a sizable portion thereof and forcing suspension of the  pumping, a suspension that will continue until it is repaired in  a few days.    Colombia's oil infrastructure has become one of the Simon  Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board's main targets. The  guerrilla organization is attempting to thwart the oil exporting  of multinational enterprises.    Authorities of Arauca Department, where the recently  discovered Cusiana oil fields are located, mounted a strong  security operation to preclude new attacks.</p>

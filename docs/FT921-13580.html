			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: B&amp;Q founder joins move to oust Cityvision board MR DAVID Quayle, founder of the B&amp;Q DIY chain, has joined a management group which is seeking to replace the directors of Cityvision, the video rental chain. Mr Quayle was a non-executive director of Cityvision from 1986 until October 1990, and was instrumental in setting its early direction. Institutional shareholders, representing 16.8 per cent of the equity, are seeking to replace the current management with Mr Quayle and two former Cityvision executives, Mr Phillip Crane and Mr Ray Hipkin. The move follows an agreement by Cityvision to be acquired by US-based Blockbuster Entertainment. Mr Hipkin yesterday issued a writ for libel against Cityvision and its advisers, J Henry Schroder Wagg, in connection with comments made about his former employment at the company.</p>

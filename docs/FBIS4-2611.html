			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 11 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher said Washington is ready to act again  against the Bosnian Serbs if necessary.    Confirming that a second air attack today destroyed at least  a Serb tank and two armored personnel carriers, Christopher said  the two U.S. FA-18 fighters that conducted the strikes were  responding to U.N. commander Sir Rose's request.    He again took pains to downplay differences with Russia over  the attacks, he said the two countries share the goal of seeking  an end to the hostilities.    In Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters that the U.S. has no right  to bomb Bosnian Serb positions without consulting Russia first.    Christopher urged the Bosnian Serbs to end the attacks on  the  Bosnian town of Gorazde, a Muslim-dominated enclave, and return  to the negotiating table.    He said he had been in almost hourly contact with U.S.  special envoy on Bosnia Charles Redman and Washington's  ambassador to Bosnia.    Christopher disputed suggestions that the attacks would  lessen the possibility of a solution and said NATO and the U.S.  still favor a comprehensive settlement to the war.</p>

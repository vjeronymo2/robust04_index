			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Margins of a News Report"] </F>   [Text] A German publication carried a sensational report  alleging that Hojjat ol-Eslam Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni played a  role in the suspicious death of an arms dealer years ago; citing  the brother of the deceased, who is the governor of one of  Germany's states, it threatened him with death. This is not the  first time that Western circles and mass media have tried to  create problems and commotions in pursuance of their  anti-Iranian and anti-Islamic objectives. After some time  during which Iran was portrayed as the culprit in the  assassination of one of the defunct Democratic Party leaders,  the German mass media and officials were forced--after extensive  investigations--to officially admit the absence of proof on  Iran's role in this assassination.    The French Government's recent release of two people who  were  accused of assassinating Kazem Rajavi, who was assassinated by  unidentified persons, shows that such accusations cannot harm  Iran's reputation. It seems that there are circles in the  Western countries that are trying to create a commotion with  baseless allegations and thus to provoke public opinion in  Europe, especially in Germany, against Iranians and the Islamic  Republic of Iran.    The remarks by (Barchal), governor of one of the German  states shows that this propaganda policy against the Islamic  Republic of Iran is continuing; according to a report published  in BILD, (Barchal's) brother, who was an arms dealer, died in a  suspicious manner years ago. The group in charge of  investigating the case has claimed that an Iranian group was  involved in the assassination of this person in Switzerland.  But the BILD report gives no facts to prove that Iranian  officials were involved in this act. It seems that in the  current conditions such propaganda aimed at harming Iran's  relations with European countries and especially with Germany is  one of the major topics on the agenda of American, Israeli, and  British espionage agencies. Calculated steps are needed to  neutralize such extensive and calculated propaganda, which has  been going on with specific objectives in mind.    For a governor of one of Germany's states to threaten to  assassinate Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni  is nothing but a terrorist act, and the German Government should  clarify its stance on such threats.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley president to step down MORGAN Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, announced yesterday that Mr Robert Greenhill will step down as the firm's president this summer to concentrate on his work as an adviser on client transactions. Mr John Mack, head of Morgan Stanley's operating committee which oversees the day-to-day running of the firm, will become the new president on June 10, when the company holds its annual meeting. Mr Greenhill will remain on the board of directors. Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman, said the changes at the top would not affect the firm's business strategy or management style. Along with Mr Fisher, Mr Greenhill and Mr Mack have held the reins at Morgan Stanley for several years, guiding the firm through its evolution into a global investment banking and securities trading powerhouse. In recent years, however, Mr Greenhill's role as president, with its management and administrative responsibilities, has clashed with his work as a deal-maker and adviser to Morgan Stanley's biggest clients, which kept him away from the firm's New York head office for long stretches of time. In the past year alone, Mr Greenhill has taken the lead role in advising General Motors on its several billion-dollar stock issues; worked with RJR Nabisco on its plan to sell shares in its worldwide food business (a plan that was formally unveiled yesterday); and advised International Business Machines, the troubled computer company, on its massive restructuring. Mr Greenhill said that after stepping down as president he would devote most of his attention to working with these and other clients. He will not, however, necessarily be working full-time at Morgan Stanley. Mr Greenhill said some of his time will be spent on personal interests.</p>

In January, the authorities  registered 13,154 applicants, which is 879 fewer than last  December, Erwin Marschewski, domestic-policy spokesman for the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]  Bundestag group, told DPA on Wednesday [2 February]. Even the  December number of 14,033 registered asylum-applicants had been  described by the Federal Interior Ministry as being the lowest  figure since March 1991.    Marschewski pointed out than in January 1993 as many as  36,279 persons applied for asylum. The decrease in the number  of applicants by more than half, which was initiated last July  when the new asylum law came into force, is "most encouraging,"  Marschewski said.</p>

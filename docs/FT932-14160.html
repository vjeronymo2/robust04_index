			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivian state and private mining groups in joint venture A JOINT venture contract has been signed between Comibol, the Bolivian state mining corporation and Comsur, Bolivia's largest private mining company, over the Bolivar polymetallic mine. Comibol further hopes to complete two additional joint venture deals before general elections are held in June. Comsur will invest Dollars 13m in Bolivar and anticipates an initial 30 year exploitation plan. Under the terms of the deal Comibol will take 50 per cent of future profits. Future investment in Bolivar will be Comsur's sole responsibility. Both parties have guaranteed the jobs of the mine's existing workforce of about 300 and new jobs may also be created. Local miners are said to be broadly in favour of the deal. However, the directorate of the main miners' union, the FSTMB, remains implacably opposed to joint ventures. Union spokesman Mr Victor Baldivieso said it would try to prevent this joint venture and condemned Bolivar workers in favour of the deal. Mr Jaime Urjel, Comsur's managing director, said the company hoped to take over Bolivar within 45 to 60 days. The mine would then become operational within 15 to 18 months. A new mill - which will be able to deal with 1,000 tonnes of lead/zinc and zinc/silver ore a day - is being built at the site. The plant may process tin in the future. Comibol executive director Mr Armando Guzman said that while the FSTMB union was clearly opposed to the deal, Bolivar workers themselves would carry the day. He said it was possible that RTZ, the UK-based group, which has close associations with Comsur, would be involved in future funding of Bolivar's operations. The International Finance Corporation will also be involved. This is the third joint venture contrast to be signed between Comibol and a private mining company since 1991. But operations in the first two remain blocked by union action. Mr Guzman said both these joint ventures would be activated by August this year. Two further joint venture tenders have been issued by Comibol. The first, for which invitations have yet to be sent, is an exploration venture for alluvial gold deposits in the Pando and Beni Regions. The second, for which invitations were sent out recently, is for the exploration of the Cerro Rico (Rich Hill) in Potosi. A recent study estimated that the hill contained Dollars 400m tonnes of silver ore. Mr Guzman estimates there are between 80m and lOOm tonnes of silver ore reserves. According to figures just released by the Medium Mines Association, Bolivian mining registered negative growth in 1992 of 4.9 per cent, compared with growth in 1991 of 2 per cent. Legal sales and exports of gold fell by 46 per cent. Antimony production was down 34 per cent, wolfram 15 per cent, cadmium 38 per cent, silver 14 per cent and tin 5 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND ROUND OF BIDDING FOR NWA ENDS WITH 4 OFFERS  </P> <P> A second round of bidding for the parent of Northwest Airlines ended Friday  with four groups submitting revised offers.  </P> <P> Few details were available about bids for NWA Inc. from Pan Am Corp., oil  billionaire Marvin Davis, Northwest's machinists union and Los Angeles  financier Alfred A. Checchi. As in the past, NWA refused to comment on the  offers.  </P> <P> The Eagan, Minn.-based airline, the fourth-largest in the nation, invited bids  in April after rejecting an unsolicited $2.7-billion offer from Davis, the  former owner of 20th Century Fox. The company has said it is reviewing options  to "enhance shareholder value," including a possible special dividend to  shareholders, a corporate reorganization or a sale. On June 5, a special  committee of NWA's board of directors rejected all bids for the company, and  invited bidders to submit new offers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Additional Equity  </P> <P> One initial bidder, MEI Diversified -- a snack foods company controlled by  Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad and financier Irwin Jacobs -- dropped out of  the bidding before Friday's deadline.  </P> <P> In a statement, Pan Am said its revised offer included $200 million in  additional equity from Corporate Partners Ltd., a fund organized by the New  York investment firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to take friendly positions in  companies under attack. Earlier this year, for instance, it acquired a 10%  stake in Polaroid, helping to rescue the company from a threat by Shamrock  Holdings.  </P> <P> The alliance with Pan Am suggests that Corporate Partners no longer confines  itself to corporate rescues. Calls regarding Corporate Partners were referred  Friday to Alan Colner, a Lazard vice president, who declined comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Final Offer  </P> <P> Pan Am said that, with the contribution from Corporate Partners, it now has  $600 million in equity available for an NWA acquisition. The New York-based  airline declined to discuss other aspects of its offer, however.  </P> <P> "The new equity allows us to make a bid that is vigorously competitive and  attractive to NWA's shareholders, employees and others who have a strong stake  in Northwest's long-term future," Thomas G. Plaskett, chairman and chief  executive of Pan Am, said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Davis said the Los Angeles investor's revised and final offer  was greater than his previous bid for NWA but declined to provide details.  Davis, who owns 3% of NWA, touched off the auction process with a $90-a-share  bid. On Friday, NWA shares closed at $107.625, up 12.5 cents in composite  trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

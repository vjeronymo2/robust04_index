			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 21 Apr (EFE) -- According to opposition  legislator Roger Caceres [National Front of Workers and  Peasants, FNTC, secretary general], at least 60 people have been  killed in the offensive launched at the beginning of April by  the Peruvian Army against Shining Path [SL] terrorists in the  Huanuco Department jungle area.    Refusing to specify whether the dead were SL members or  civilians, Caceres said he had recently visited the region, and  charged that military forces are "harming the civilian  population" with helicopter attacks.    Caceres said he had toured several areas in Huanuco's  Leoncio  Prado Province, where security forces are conducting the  military operations.    The legislator, who is a member of the Democratic  Constituent  Congress (CCD) Human Rights Committee, said he has asked the CCD  to summon Defense Minister Victor Malca and Interior Minister  Juan Briones to explain the situation in the region.    Caceres has also asked the CCD to summon Attorney General  Blanca Nelida Colan.    In a communique issued 20 April the Defense Ministry denies  that civilians are either being bombarded or attacked, and  reports that the antiterrorist military operations were launched  on 5 April.    Moreover, a communique issued by the National Coordinating  Board of Human Rights reports "massive crimes against a  defenseless civilian population" in districts on the left bank  of the Huallaga River.    Citing settlers who have fled the region, the Coordinating  Board reports that "armored helicopters are firing upon the  civilian population, while military columns on land are  torturing survivors, raping women, and burning down the  peasants' huts."    Peruvian media reports state that bombardments have been  carried out during the 15 days the operation has lasted.    The Lima newspaper "ONDA" reports that the Army "has  launched  an attack by air and by land" and that it is estimated that SL  forces in the area total 500 men.    According to newspaper "ONDA," 70 SL members were killed,  but  the killing of civilians has been ruled out.    The Defense Ministry communique states that from 5 to 18  April, 14 terrorists were killed and 12 others arrested in  clashes between military patrols and SL columns. The communique  adds that three soldiers were injured.    It also states that the military operations "are being  conducted without affecting local settlers."    President Alberto Fujimori has "categorically" denied any  helicopter bombings.    Moreover, Coordinating Board Executive Secretary Rosa Mujica  insists that civilians have been killed, and has requested that  the Red Cross be allowed to visit the area.</p>

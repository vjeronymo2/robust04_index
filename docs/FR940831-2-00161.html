			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5.2.4&blank;Vehicle Maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> With OPM's concurrence, Runzheimer selected the five most common maintenance service/repair jobs performed on vehicles as the basis for vehicle maintenance analysis:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;tune-up,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;oil change,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;automatic transmission fluid change,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;flush/fill coolant, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;muffler installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automobile manufacturers' recommended maintenance schedules were used to determine the frequency of performing each of these maintenance jobs. Maintenance schedules vary, depending on the driving conditions typically encountered. Consistent with the assumptions used for fuel economy and tire mileage, Runzheimer assumed that driving conditions in the allowance areas were generally severe and used the maintenance schedules that reflected that kind of driving. For the D.C. area, Runzheimer assumed that driving conditions were normal and used the maintenance schedules that reflected that kind of driving.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recommended frequency of performing each of these jobs was combined with the prices charged by local dealers and service stations to compute an estimated annual maintenance expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Alaska, Runzheimer included constant velocity (CV) joint boots as well. Runzheimer's research of CV joint boot replacement revealed varying replacement cycles between Alaskan allowance areas: Anchorage_every 45,000 miles (3 years), Fairbanks_every 15,000 miles (1 year), Juneau_every 45,000 miles (3 years) and Nome_every 30,000 miles (2 years). The cost of replacement for all three vehicle types has been factored into the indexes based upon the life cycle of the replacement. For example, 100% of the cost was included for Fairbanks because research indicated annual replacement was the norm. Only 50% of the cost was included for Nome where research indicated bi-annual replacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5.2.5&blank;Tires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Research previously conducted by Runzheimer for OPM (see the June 1992 report) revealed that various factors (e.g., road quality/state of repair, road composition) caused tread life (the average number of miles a tire is expected to last) to be less in allowance areas than in the Washington, D.C., area. Based on these findings (some of which were quantitative), Runzheimer based tire expenses on a 40,000-mile tread-life in allowance areas, and a 55,000-mile tread-life in the Washington, D.C., area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer's research also indicated that four extra snow tires, with studs, would be required for all three vehicles in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau. For Nome, Runzheimer's research revealed that mud and snow tires would be appropriate for the S10 Blazer but not the other two vehicles because all-season radials were reported to be the norm. (Most of the driving in Nome occurs within a very confined area). Therefore, as with the previous survey, Runzheimer surveyed the cost of extra wheels, extra tires, and installing studs for all vehicles in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau and the additional cost of mud and snow tires for the S10 Blazer in Nome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5.2.6&blank;License and Registration Fees, and Miscellaneous Tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Runzheimer obtained information regarding appropriate license and registration fees, and miscellaneous taxes (i.e., personal property tax and motor vehicle registration tax) from each area. One-time fees and miscellaneous taxes were divided equally over each vehicle's four-year trade cycle. Sales and excise taxes were included in the purchase price of each vehicle (see section 5.2.7.). Ongoing fees and taxes were included as part of the annual costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5.2.7&blank;Depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> From Runzheimer's experience, the single largest annual expense related to owning and operating newer vehicles is vehicle depreciation, the lost value of the vehicle as it ages and is driven. To calculate average annual depreciation, Runzheimer divides the difference between the purchase price and the residual value by the number of years the vehicle is owned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the depreciation equation, Runzheimer used suggested retail prices, plus any additional charges, such as shipping, excise tax, dealer prep, and additional dealer markup. (Runzheimer did not believe that negotiated prices could be collected on an equitable basis.) As discussed earlier, the trade cycle was determined to be four years, 60,000 miles. Runzheimer research indicated that residual values were the same in all areas except Fairbanks and Nome. This research effort is explained below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer is aware that several firms and associations track and publish weekly or monthly used-car and used-truck wholesale auction prices. Some firms even publish projections of the future value of today's new vehicles. Most publications provide several residual values for each vehicle, depending on its condition at the time of trade-in (e.g., clean, average, rough). Several common publications of this type are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Black Book, Kelley Blue Book, Automotive Market Report,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NADA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (National Automobile Dealers Association). Unfortunately, these sources only track prices for vehicles sold in the contiguous 48 states and then publish broad-based average residual values for each vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To get specific information from sources knowledgeable about the used vehicle markets in allowance areas, Runzheimer contacted auto dealers and financial institutions in these areas. Most of the sources with whom Runzheimer spoke said that they used the above-mentioned publications as guides, just as dealers and financial institutions across the United States used them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for Fairbanks and Nome, Runzheimer found no conclusive evidence that used vehicles in allowance areas were (on average) worth more or less than used vehicles in the Washington, D.C., area. Therefore, we reported the same used vehicle prices in all areas (except Fairbanks and Nome). An appropriate and logical source for these values was the October 1993 issue of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Black Book Official Finance/Lease Guide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for 1994 vehicles. For Fairbanks and Nome, Runzheimer used 90% of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Black Book  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> projected residual values to reflect rougher conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted for clarification that identical residual values did not translate into identical depreciation amounts in all locations. Depreciation amounts were higher in allowance areas than in the Washington, D.C., area because new vehicle prices in all allowance areas were higher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.2.8&blank;Finance Expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Runzheimer included the average annual cost of financing a vehicle in the total cost of private transportation. Runzheimer surveyed banks in all areas for their auto-loan interest rates, using a 48-month loan length with 80% financing as the basis in all locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / EIB loan accord with Poles The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed a three-year framework agreement with Poland that could result in up to Ecu1bn (Pounds 789m)in loans from the bank for infrastructural projects aimed at integrating the country with the European Union. Mr Wolfgang Roth, a deputy head of the bank, says that the agreement marks a shift in thinking about Poland at the EIB. Instead of treating Poland as a 'post-communist country building a market economy' it is now viewed as a 'prospective member of the European Union'. According to Mr Roth, the EIB is prepared to lend around Ecu3bn to central and eastern European countries over the next three years, with about a third going to Poland. The highway building programme in Poland would be a prime candidate for loans.</p>

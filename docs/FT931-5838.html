			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / American investors target Britain THE UK has received more US overseas direct investment since 1987 than any other country, according to a study released yesterday. Some 21 per cent of US overseas investment came to the UK, which also received 9 per cent of Japanese overseas direct investment, ahead of any country except the US. Within the European Community the UK benefited from 41 per cent of total Japanese investment over the past three years. The study, by the Centre for Economics and Business Research on behalf of the Confederation of British Industry, shows that inward investment has become an important component of total investment in the UK, with nearly one-fifth of the Pounds 220bn invested in British industry since 1987 coming from abroad. The motivations of US and Japanese companies were different, according to the study. US investors aimed at UK domestic markets and specific opportunities in the finance and oil sectors, while Japanese companies pursued access to other EC markets. The study concludes that the spurt in US investment may have ended, with much of the growth in the late 1980s reflecting companies' desire to 'catch up' with the UK's improved economic growth. It says future US investment will be restrained by the lagged effects of the UK recession. Companies from both countries, but particularly the Japanese, said the UK's failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty and the perception that the country was in the second tier of a two-speed Europe would have some negative effect on investment. About 40 per cent of investors said that if the UK withdrew from the EC and the single market it would have a 'major negative effect' on investment.

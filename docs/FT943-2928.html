			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits United Biscuits' acquisition of Dalgety's Dutch snacks business this week highlighted the group's steady progress in building up its presence in continental Europe. However the overwhelming majority of turnover still derives from the UK and the US, markets facing big medium-term problems, as the candidly pessimistic prognosis from UB's management underscored yesterday. In the UK, UB's McVitie's brand commands 45 per cent of the biscuit market, but the generous margins enjoyed in the past are falling, as the company is squeezed between price deflation and the need to step up marketing expenditure. In the US, the belated measures being taken to straighten out Keebler - number two in biscuits behind Nabisco - are unlikely to achieve the desired doubling of margins or regeneration of cash flow before 1996. Against this background, the shares have understandably underperformed the market by a third since their latest peak in May last year. Sentiment has been soured further because gearing and cash-flow have suffered from the combined impact of rationalisation, increased marketing expenditure and acquisitions. The group's financial situation casts doubt over its long-term ability to nourish its core businesses with investment. But the shares are supported by a yield of 6 per cent. And if the stock market is unwilling to look beyond the uninspiring earnings outlook for this year and next, perhaps a predator will place a higher value on the group's portfolio of brands.</p>

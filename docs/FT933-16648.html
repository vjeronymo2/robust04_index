Whereupon he grabbed an axe and, with a blur of movement, felled the tree within seconds. Flabbergasted, the boss asked where he had learned such amazing skill. 'Working in the Sahara,' the axeman answered. 'But there aren't any trees there,' spluttered the boss. 'Of course there aren't, now,' said the midget.</p>

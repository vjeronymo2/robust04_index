			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Serhiy Rakhmanin: "Leonid Kravchuk's Kharkov </F> Pilgrimage"]    [Text] President Kravchuk's voyage to Kharkov Oblast on  the eve of elections is not accidental. Many politicians and  sociologists believe this region to be the domain of Leonid  Kuchma, that is why Leonid Kravchuk and his team are going to  face strenuous work with the Kharkov electorate. One cannot  rule out that the visit to the former Ukrainian capital was to  some extent prompted by the need to talk to local administration  head Oleksandr Maselskyy whose name was included in the "secret  lists of presidential candidates."    In the course of his visit to one of the largest Ukrainian  oblasts, Leonid Kravchuk met with the managers' corps of  agricultural machine-building enterprises, agrarians, and  workers of the gas complex. It is quite natural that under the  extraordinary circumstances -- it is not every day that the head  of state comes on a visit -- complaints, requests, and  suggestions were received and, in some cases, passed for  consideration to the National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko,  Minister of Agriculture Yuriy Karasyk, Minister of Economy  Anatoliy Holubchenko, and other accompanying members of the  president's apparatus.    The state leader did not omit political issues. He paid lip  service to the new Supreme Council adding that the latter would  be unable to resolve any serious issues: "All they can do is  squabble." He hinted that deputies, absorbed in political  battles, have no time to think of the people. He said that he  was sorry to see the few good things that have been created,  turning to dust: "We introduced the post of presidential envoys  in the provinces. Hardly have these people managed to gain  weight when a hue and cry was raised: `That post is a hindrance,  let us go back to the past.' Meanwhile, they mean a worse  version of this `past'." He criticized those political forces  that make profits on speculations about people's hardships: "So  far, I have not seen people in Ukraine who either starve or wear  rags."    Mr. Kravchuk called on the Kharkov residents to go to the  ballot and elect professionals with statesmanlike mentality.  Leonid Kravchuk rejected the claims that he is blocking the  process of restoring economic ties with Russia, saying that  Ukraine has acceded to all the appropriate CIS documents and  signed all the necessary agreements with Russia. Those  agreements do not yield results simply because mechanisms for  their implementation do not exist and "everybody is upholding  their own interests." Those "ardent internationalists" that  accuse Leonid Kravchuk of being a nationalist, do this just to  win cheap prestige.    The president pointed out: "With regard to the economic  union with Russia, I have no powers to sign it for there exists  an appropriate Supreme Council resolution. I should not be  blamed for this. Once the legislature rescinds its reservation  I will sign an agreement."    Leonid Kravchuk bitterly criticized the idea of a Slavic  union and deemed the plans to form this kind of structure a  provocation and an attempt to change the borders and thus, cause  a war.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed formula retained this component with some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification. The principle of stability was maintained to help  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assure that each State agency would receive enough funds to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its current participation level. However, the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted the provision allowing a State agency the option to retain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 percent of funds it returns before July 16 of any given year as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a part of its stability grant the next fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of commenters addressing this issue opposed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision and stated that the current 50 percent recovery credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be maintained. The commenters indicated that eliminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the credit would be a disincentive for State agencies to return  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds, thereby delaying the reallocation of unspent funds. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested maintaining the 50 percent credit for one year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only. A few commenters were strongly in support of the provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to delete the 50 percent recovery credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 50 percent credit was originally intended as an incentive for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency to return food funds that it could not spend, thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making those funds available for reallocation to State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that needed additional funds. However, almost all State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which have elected to return funds under this provision have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those which were in danger of failing to spend at least 95 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of their allocated food funds. Failure to achieve this expenditure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level results in a specific decrease in the amount of food funds in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subsequent fiscal year. In these instances, State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simply returned the amount of funds necessary to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures of at least 95 percent of their adjusted food grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department no longer believes restoration of 50 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned funds to State agencies in the next year is prudent. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restoration of these funds makes it possible for a State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already receiving its fair share funding to retain funds it does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not need. In addition, the credit effectively increases stability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants in the subsequent year by 150 percent of the amount of funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned, since the State agencies returning funds receive a 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent credit in the subsequent year's stability grant, while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies to which the returned funds are reallocated have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their subsequent year's stability grants increased by the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the reallocation. If there are increases in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation levels for the subsequent year, this additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability can be funded. However, if funds in the subsequent year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not adequate to meet all stability grants, all State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share in a grant decrease to accommodate the 50 percent credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, to ensure equity, the 50 percent recovery credit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 246.16 (c)(3)(i)(A) Inflation adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 05 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current food funding formula uses a calculation referred to as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``targeted inflation factor''. It was designed to provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflation adjustment proportionate to a State agency's service to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the highest priority participants. Under this process, the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflation increase is adjusted according to each State agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of participants in the top three priority level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories (Priority I-III women, infants and children at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional or medical risk). For instance, if 75 percent of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency's participation was in the Priority I to III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation categories, and the full inflation rate was 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, that State agency would receive a targeted inflation rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 3 percent applied against its prior year grant to determine its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stability grant. An exception is made for Indian State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which receive full inflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule took a more straight-forward approach by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing all State agencies with a full inflationary increase as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long as funds are adequate to do so. If, however, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation for any given year is insufficient to support prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year grant levels plus full inflation, the proposed funding formula  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would reduce State agency grants to allow for funds allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within available funding. Those State agencies with under fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share allocations would receive first priority for any available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflationary increases, and State agencies at or above their fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share allocation for that fiscal year would receive second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority. The proposal sought to assure continued progress in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the grants of States that are under their fair share.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the commenters addressing this issue were opposed to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision. The consensus was that if funds were insufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide full inflationary increases, then all State agencies should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take a prorata reduction for that fiscal year. The commenters were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to the two-tier concept and stated that small reductions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all State agency grants would be less disruptive to WIC operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than large cuts to a few State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is persuaded by the concerns raised by commenters on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this aspect of the proposed rule. Therefore, Section 246.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(3)(ii) in this final rule provides that in the event that funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are insufficient to support prior year grant levels plus full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflation, all state agencies would take a prorata reduction for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Section 246.16 (c)(3)(i)(B) Migrant set-aside.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 17(g)(4) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0172 columnbreak -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 1786(g)(4)) provides that not less than&blank;&blank; 9/10 of one percent of the funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriated for the WIC Program be available first for services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant women, infants and children. The current regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulated that the full 9/10 of one percent set-aside is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtracted from all States' stability grants and then added to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stability grants of States that report serving migrants. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these adjustments for the migrant set-aside become part of the base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant of stability funds for the next fiscal year, FNS found that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stability grants were skewed over time, directly causing some State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to receive more than their fair share of funds while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventing other States from receiving their fair share. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distorting effect becomes even larger as over-all funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

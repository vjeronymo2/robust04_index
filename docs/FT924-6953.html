			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: YJ Lovell gets extension of loan agreement YJ Lovell, the UK housebuilder and property developer, has negotiated a three year loan agreement with its bankers, writes Andrew Taylor. Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive, said: 'The banks have shown their confidence in the long term future of the group. I am very grateful for the support and advice they have given during this prolonged period of difficult trading.' In February Lovell announced it had renegotiated a 12 month loan arrangement after it breached loan covenants linked to its net worth and interest cover. The deal extends the loan agreement until December 31 1995. Mr Sellier said that the banks, led by Barclays, had treated the group very fairly. Lovell reported net debt of Pounds 111m at September 30 1991, including Pounds 40m off-balance sheet finance. That compared with shareholders' funds of about Pounds 70m. Borrowings are understood to have reduced during the past year following costs cut and restructured finances.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pay is top priority for union members Sir, David Goodhart's article on the future of trade unionism ('On the lookout for the vision thing', September 6) cites a study I carried out for Nupe in 1989 (not 1992 as stated). But the conclusions that he draws, namely that among low-paid public sector workers, advice on disciplinary and grievance issues comes ahead of collective bargaining as the reason for joining a union, is almost certainly no longer valid. Four years ago national pay bargaining was dominant, and did not directly impinge on the workplace. But government initiatives, such as contracting-out, National Health Service trusts and local management of schools, mean that pay negotiations are increasingly a local matter. Consequently, pay bargaining is now likely to be accorded top priority by union members. Finally, and most importantly, it is essential to recognise that individual advice and representation is a key benefit of trade union collective organisation.

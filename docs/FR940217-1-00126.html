			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments are not limited to the above and are invited on any aspect of implementing Regulation 26 on the Great Lakes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal addresses only the four mandatory provisions of Regulation 26 that must be included in shipboard emergency response plans: (1) An outline of procedures for reporting pollution incidents, (2) a list of authorities or persons to be contacted in the event of an incident, (3) a detailed description of the actions to be taken immediately by persons on board to reduce or control discharge of oil following an incident, and (4) a procedure for coordinating response efforts with national and local authorities. The four mandatory provisions of Regulation 26 are the basic items necessary for plans to serve as a tool for shipowners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;151.26(b)(6)(ii)(A) of this NPRM would require each plan to include a separate appendix listing agencies or officials of coastal state administrations responsible for receiving and processing incident reports. The list issued by the MEPC as MEPC/Circ.267 may assist shipowners in complying with this provision. Although inclusion of the MEPC list, or a similar successor list issued by IMO, is not mandated by the proposed regulation, its use would be considered prime facie evidence of compliance with this requirement for enforcement purposes. If a shipowner includes an alternate list in the plan, it should contain comparable information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The non-mandatory provisions of the Regulation 26 guidelines provide guidance on additional information that could be included in the shipboard oil pollution emergency plans, such as diagrams, response equipment, public affairs practices, recordkeeping, regular plan review by the shipowner and exercising. The Coast Guard is soliciting comments on whether plans should be required to address any or all of the non-mandatory provisions, particularly those addressing response equipment, plan review, and plan testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed regulation would require a shipowner to prepare and submit two English language copies of its plan to the Captain of the Port (COTP) or Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) at the ship's home port for review and approval. The approval period for the plan is five years. When the approval period expires, the shipowner would be required to resubmit the entire plan for review and reapproval. The proposed regulation would also require a shipowner to review its plan annually and submit a letter to the COTP or OCMI at the ship's home port certifying that the review has been completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the provisions in this proposed regulation are similar to those of the vessel response plan (VRP) interim final rule (IFR) (58 FR 7376; February 5, 1993) issued under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380). The OPA 90 VRP IFR establishes requirements for tank vessels which include many of the non-mandatory provisions of the Regulation 26 guidelines, in addition to many of the mandatory provisions. Like the VRP IFR, this proposed regulation would require resubmission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans every five years. However, differences between this proposed regulation and the VRP IFR remain. Some of the more important differences include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) This proposed regulation would apply to oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and other ships of 400 gross tons and above, while the VRP IFR requirements apply to all tank vessels which carry oil in bulk as cargo, regardless of size; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) This proposed regulation would require the creation and maintenance of a list of contacts in all regular ports of call worldwide. The VRP IFR requires a complete geographic-specific listing of contacts and response resources for U.S. ports only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) This proposed regulation would require planning the response to all oil discharges, including the ship's fuel oil, while the VRP IFR applies only to oil carried in bulk as cargo. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) This proposed regulation would require procedures and a point of contact on the ship for coordinating response action with shore-based authorities. The VRP IFR generally requires more structured (formalized) arrangements with response organizations in all U.S. ports of call, as well as a shore-based qualified individual to obligate funds on the part of the shipowner or operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

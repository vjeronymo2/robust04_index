			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan has extended a total  of 15.25 million dollars to finance the Palestinians'  administrative expenses in the Gaza strip and Jericho, a senior  Foreign Ministry official said Thursday [26 May].    The assistance is part of the 200 million dollars Japan  pledged last October to provide over two years to finance  reconstruction of the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza  strip, the official said.    Of the total, the government disbursed 3.5 million dollars  to  a World Bank fund dubbed the "Holst Fund," which aims at  financing administrative expenses, he said.    The fund is named after the late Norwegian Foreign Minister  Johan Holst, who played an instrumental role in brokering the  agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation  Organization (PLO) last September for limited Palestinian  self-rule in the occupied territories.    The fund has so far collected 25 million dollars, but it is  expected to fall short by 20 million to 25 million dollars in  June because of the lack of administrative systems such as tax  collection, the official said.    On a yearlong basis, the shortage is expected to amount to  some 120 million to 130 million dollars, he said.    Tokyo also disbursed 10 million dollars through the United  Nations Development Program (UNDP) to provide houses for 800  families of Palestinian police and 250,000 dollars to purchase  computers for the police, he said.    Another 1.5 million dollars was extended to the Palestinian  Economic Committee for Development and Reconstruction (PECDR),  he added.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Aerospatiale posts FFr2.3bn loss AEROSPATIALE, the French aircraft and missile making group, yesterday provided the latest evidence of the recession in the world aerospace industry by revealing a FFr2.38bn (Dollars 432m) net loss for last year. This is significantly higher than the loss of up to FFr2bn the group was forecasting only earlier this month, and reflects heavy restructuring costs in its aeroplane and helicopter divisions. It compares with a FFr213m net profit in 1991. Aerospatiale said results would be better this year, and attributed the 1992 setback to airlines having to cancel or delay aircraft orders 'under the weight of uncontrolled deregulation and a sluggish global economy'. Shrinking military budgets hit defence orders, helicopter sales were affected by a decline in industrial demand and the overall aerospace business climate was worsened by a trade war initiated by the US, said the French group. Aerospatiale's sales climbed from FFr48.6bn to FFr52.3bn, representing a rise of just 1.7 per cent on a fully comparable basis, on new orders stagnant at FFr39bn. Aircraft sales rose by 2.5 per cent, while helicopter sales fell by nearly 12 per cent and space and defence rose by 14.8 per cent. Aircraft represented 42 per cent of turnover last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Chief Airforce Commander Petr Deinekin says  no agreement has so far been reached on the transfer to Russia  of part of the former Soviet Union's strategic bomber aircraft  deployed in Ukraine. In an interview with Interfax on Thursday,  he put the number of such missile carrying aircraft at 42  including 19 TU-160's and 23 TU-95 MC's.    The two countries are still at odds about the price. Kiev  wants Russia to write off Rbl 700 Bn of its debt, but Moscow  agrees to settle for less than a third of that amount.    Deinekin said the Russian Defense Ministry could easily  order  a new batch of aircraft for Rbl 700 Bn at home. He stressed  that the Ukrainian bombers had been grounded for quite some time  because of shortage of fuel and spare parts and extra spending  would be needed to make them airworthy.    He regretted that Moscow's attempts to try to help Ukraine  to  denuclearize itself had failed to meet understanding from the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry. At the same time, he hoped further  talks will be held in an effort to reach compromise.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Fashion: Clothes for the 'petite' Is she, like most of the female population of Britain, under 5ft 5in tall? If so, she may well have difficulty in looking good in many of her favourite designer's clothes. Laura B, who sells her own brand of glamour dressing to a host of sophisticates about town, has made a speciality of always having a supply of sophisticated clothing for those who are kindly called 'petite' and less kindly just plain short. She has her designs specially made in Paris on a petite last and uses many of the same fabrics as many a high-profile designer name. Her black wool crepe suit with the white lapels has been a winner this winter - the perfect lunching outfit at Pounds 495 whilst her chic striped black and beige trousers (Pounds 265) are blissfully comfortable. The black wool jacket (Pounds 375) ought, of course, to go with plenty of other things already lurking in the wardrobe. If a complete outfit is not what you had in mind there are stunning belts of leather with gold tarnished buckles at Pounds 65 - Pounds 95, soft angora wool sweaters (Pounds 85) with matching shawls and a wonderful white lace blouse with pirate sleeves and frilly jabot (Pounds 195). Laura B is at 25b Walton Street, London SW3 2HU.</p>

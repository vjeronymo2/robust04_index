			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, "former </F> Yemeni prime minister and current prime minister of the  government declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Aden," by Sawsan  Abu-Husayn in Cairo on 26 May]    [Text] [Abu-Husayn] What are the most important results  of your visit to Cairo?    [Al-'Attas] During my meeting with President Husni Mubarak,  I sensed full understanding, particularly in connection with  ending the fighting, reviving the dialogue, and concern for the  interests and rights of the Yemeni people. I sensed the same  thing during my meeting with [Arab League Secretary General] Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid who understands the minute details of the  Yemeni crisis and the attempts to resolve it.    [Abu-Husayn] Why did you apply for Democratic Yemen's  membership of the Arab League?    [Al-'Attas] We have asked Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to rectify the  situation and restore it to what it was before, that is South  Yemen as it was before May 22 1990. We are a state already in  existence and we do not require fresh recognition but that state  should be treated the same way it was treated in the past, as an  independent state. Unity, from the day it was declared to just  a few days before the infighting started, was not achieved in  real terms. Now we are trying to regain our positions.  Numerous crises similar to the Yemeni crisis have been settled  along the same lines we are following now but we need Arab  supporting efforts before any Western positions are taken.    [Abu-Husayn] As it is the intention of the south to secede  and return to the pre-22 May 1990 situation, on what basis would  dialogue be restored between you and the north?    [Al-'Attas] As a dialogue between two presidents, 'Ali Salim  al-Bid and 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to discuss the problems  resulting from the war, Yemeni-Yemeni relations, mutual  recognition, and Arab-Yemeni relations.    [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's  call on the Security Council to discuss the Yemeni crisis?    [Al-'Attas] Our view is that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is  our neighbor and is affected by what takes place in Yemen, a  matter which prompts it to take every possible stand to bring an  end to the current fighting. We welcome and support that call,  and we are fully confident that it will produce positive  results. If the Security Council passes a cease-fire  resolution, then both sides must comply. In the event of a  violation by either side, there is Article 7 of the charter  which could mean sanctions or direct intervention.    [Abu-Husayn] What if Western and Arab states refuse to  recognize Democratic Yemen and reaffirm the importance of unity  between the two parts?    [Al-'Attas] I say again, we do not need new recognition. We  are trying to regain our place at the Security Council, the Arab  League, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all  international bodies. What is this unity that the north is now  claiming and talking about? The north was the side which  declared the secession and is emphasizing in practice that it  wants annexation of the south to the north, not on a basis of  unity.    Furthermore, since the war began, the northern leadership  has  taken several secessionist measures, including dismissal of  southern ambassadors and ministers, and it incited the  fundamentalists to kill them. I personally was the target of  many attempts. All this forced us to take the step of declaring  the [southern] republic particularly as there was no full merger  into a unitary state, and there were political practices  combining the state with the tribes, a matter not stipulated in  the Pledge and Accord Document and something which the northern  leadership insisted on doing.</p>

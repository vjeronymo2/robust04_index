			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Slavin: "Nixon's Sounding Out"] </F>   [Text] Former U.S. President Richard Nixon has met with  opposition leaders Aleksandr Rutskoy and Gennadiy Zyuganov. In  his opinion these meetings are "a positive sign," evidence of  the strength and not the weakness of the Russian Government.  Although these meetings were unofficial, competent sources  assert that U.S. President Bill Clinton knew of them, just as he  knew of the planned meeting with V. Zhirinovskiy.    Nixon's talk with A. Rutskoy took place at the general's  home. Despite the fact that it lasted about two hours, almost  nothing is known about it. Rutskoy is keeping it completely  confidential. Just one thing is clear: The talk was conducted  around a discussion of the situation in Russia and the  opposition's place and role in society. Considering that this  is the third meeting between its participants, the talk was  quite frank and serious, obviously touching on many personal  aspects of Russia's present and future leadership.    So far A. Rutskoy is obviously keeping quiet about the  prospects of his future political activity. But I am sure that  this silence will end soon and we shall again see Aleksandr  Rutskoy as a major figure on the political Olympus.    As for Richard Nixon's meeting with Gennadiy Zyuganov,  leader  of the Russian Federation Communist Party, here there was far  more information. The meeting took place in the State Duma.  According to the evidence of the Russian Federation Communist  Party Central Executive Committee press service, there was an  involved talk about the domestic political and economic  situation in Russia, ways of getting it out of the crisis, and  the prospects of Russian-U.S. relations. Gennadiy Zyuganov  spoke unambiguously of the perniciousness of the shock therapy  course and the possibility of a social eruption if it is  continued.    As G. Zyuganov put it, the Russian Federation Communist  Party  will not accept either right or left radicalism and is prepared  to cooperate with all political forces which advocate the  resurrection of a strong Russia. The resurrection of a renewed  Union, in his opinion, is only a matter of time. Gennadiy  Zyuganov told Richard Nixon about the Russian Federation  Communist Party's extensive contacts with the communist parties  of former union republics and countries of remote foreign parts.  The Russian Federation Communist Party press service reports  that Gennadiy Zyuganov stated the party's readiness to cooperate  with representatives of all religions and to promote the  resurrection of spirituality and thousand-year-old Russian  traditions. As for cooperation with representatives of various  religions, the Communists have never rejected it, but that does  not mean renouncing atheism.    In his talk with R. Nixon G. Zyuganov expressed the concern  of all Russia's patriots at the United States' unvarying course  connected with unconsidered support for the executive power  unpopular with the people. It is interesting to note that  Zyuganov's denunciation of the policy of the penetration of  Western mass culture, the cult of violence, and pornography in  the mass media met with Richard Nixon's understanding.    Summing up the results of his meeting with the opposition  leaders, Richard Nixon told journalists that he is inspired by  the fact that the opposition leaders do not want to change the  situation in the country with the aid of force.</p>

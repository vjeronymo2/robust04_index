			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Management: Trading places - John Willman on a scheme that puts top civil servants on the board and executives to work in Whitehall Could your business benefit from the presence of a senior civil servant at board level as a non-executive director? The idea might seem bizarre given the popular image of Whitehall as a home for pen-pushers and faceless bureaucrats. But companies taking on top mandarins find they make a valuable input, says Claire Arnold, managing director of the Whitehall and Industry Group*, a charity set up 10 years ago to improve understanding between business and the civil service. 'They have well-honed minds, used to challenging ministers,' she says. 'They can often bring insights from their experience of government that contribute to strategic thinking.' WIG is a government-backed group, supported by 64 large companies, including Midland Bank, Cadbury Schweppes, Shell UK Oil and British Telecommunications. Each year, a dozen member companies find places for top mandarins on their management committees or on the boards of subsidiaries. For the civil servants involved, the appointments offer useful insight into the world outside Whitehall. Coats Viyella recently appointed Norman Glass, chief economist at the environment department, to the board of CV Apparel, a Nottinghamshire-based subsidiary supplying clothing to retailers such as Marks and Spencer. Bill Shardlow, group personnel director, says he is always keen to encourage diversity on the boards of subsidiary companies. 'Regulation is so important to business these days, and a civil servant brings insights into the views and thought-processes of Whitehall,' he says. 'The feedback is that Norman is a lively and useful board member.' Glass is finding the appointment equally rewarding. 'It is a fascinating experience,' he says. 'The way the company is driven by precise financial and other quantitative targets is so different from the civil service. Civil servants set themselves targets, but are always conscious of the need to respond to the immediate needs of our political masters.' Glass has already helped the board find out what is going on concerning new European Union restrictions on silk imports. And he has been able to provide useful understanding of the advantages to the company of joining Investors in People, a government-backed scheme for improving in-company training. 'I also find I have things to say as an economist, both about the economy as a whole and on particular aspects of business strategy,' Glass says. 'The contact with a business close to retailing is useful to me in getting a feel for what is going on in the real economy.' In addition to placing top mandarins as non-executive directors, WIG arranges shorter business attachments for around 50 senior civil servants each year. In most cases, they spend two or three weeks examining a particular function of the company relevant to their civil service responsibilities. Nicky Oppenheimer, now principal establishments and finance officer at the Lord Chancellor's department, spent her attachment in the personnel department of the TSB, the retail bank. The TSB was restructuring at the time, putting a lot of effort into communicating with staff and handling redundancies sensitively. 'I learnt lessons that have proved helpful in the restructuring we are now involved with in setting up the Courts Service agency,' she says. 'I found much in common between the department and the TSB,' she adds. 'Both have a regional structure which creates difficulties in communicating between regions and the centre.' Oppenheimer also looked at the TSB's approach to staff appraisal, gaining insights for a subsequent review of the department's appraisal system. And she was impressed by the TSB's training programme: 'Their purpose-built training centres with the most modern audio-visual techniques were an eye-opener,' she says. For Kevin McCoy, TSB's training director, Oppenheimer offered 'a fresh pair of eyes' when looking at the restructuring process. 'At the time, we were also developing our policies on equal opportunities, and she was able to bring relevant civil service experience,' he adds. WIG offers member companies the opportunity to learn more about how the civil service works at first hand by arranging short attachments in Whitehall for senior managers. This year it hopes to place around 30 top executives in civil service departments and agencies. Chris Bond, general manager of the export division of HP Bulmer, the cider company, spent four weeks in late 1992 with the Department of Trade and Industry examining licensing arrangements for industry. The project, a pilot for the department's deregulation efforts, identified the licensing problems encountered by small and new businesses. And it suggested ways of simplifying procedures, including the possibility of issuing licences through the new 'one-stop shops' offering small businesses access to DTI support services. Bond found the job interesting, rewarding and a useful introduction to the processes of government. He also found the placement raised his self-confidence by throwing him in at the deep end in an area where he had no previous experience. 'It is a different way of working,' he says. 'Ministers tend to be much more remote from the detail than even the most senior managers in business. The political aspects are also very important considerations which you need to understand and bring out. Politics are part of the game in industry, but nothing like so overtly or as such a priority.' The benefits of this two-way traffic between Whitehall and business has led to a 'sea-change' in member companies' attitudes to WIG, says Arnold. 'At first, they became involved in the programme because they believed it would be in the interests of the country to help improve relations between Whitehall and business. Increasingly they see the loan of a top civil servant as an attractive option in its own right.' *Whitehall and Industry Group, Room C253, 47 Baker Street, London W1A 1DN.</p>

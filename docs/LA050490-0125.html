			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FEUD: The dispute between the airport construction firm and the county over  delays in completing the new terminal got so bitter late last year that  Britain's Lord Taylor of Hadfield, owner of the firm, and county Supervisor  Thomas F. Riley tried to personally negotiate a settlement. . . . Newly  released letters show that secret correspondence and even a face-to-face  meeting in Riley's office failed to fix blame for the delays, and the dispute  remains as hot as ever. . . . At stake: Millions of dollars in withheld county  payments and possible penalties. Jeffrey A. Perlman and Dennis McLellan  </P></p>

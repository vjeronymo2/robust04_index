			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> URBAN LEAGUE DECLARES WAR ON DRUGS  </P> <P> The National Urban League, one of the largest and most influential  organizations concerned with the problems of black America, announced it would  launch a no-holds-barred effort to wipe out drug trafficking in the 113  communities across America where the league has affiliate chapters. League  President John E. Jacob said: "It's not a black problem. It's not a white  problem. Drugs are a national problem, and if the nation isn't willing to wage  war against it, we'll have to ourselves." Jacob spelled out some of the  measures that Urban League affiliates would seek to engage in: creating  information networks with other local organizations to compile name lists of  known and suspected traffickers; cooperating with criminal justice authorities  in sting operations and photographing out-of-neighborhood drug users' cars when  they enter a community to buy drugs.  </P></p>

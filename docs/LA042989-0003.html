			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROY L. WILLIAMS; TEAMSTER CHIEF SPENT TIME IN PRISON  </P> <P> Former Teamsters Union president Roy Lee Williams, who served three years in  prison for bribery and acknowledged that his union was under the influence of  organized crime, died Friday at his farm home here. He was 74, and suffered  from emphysema and heart ailments.  </P> <P> Williams, a protege of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who with Dave  Beck was the third Teamsters leader in 25 years to be imprisoned, was  international president of the union from 1981 to 1983.  </P> <P> He was forced to resign after he and four co-defendants were convicted in  December, 1982, of trying to bribe former U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon of Nevada to  influence trucking deregulation. Cannon was not charged in the case.  </P> <P> Williams served three years of a 10-year sentence before he was released from  federal prison in September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doctor Summoned  </P> <P> A family spokesman said a doctor was called to the Williams house about 70  miles southeast of Kansas City about 5 a.m. when Williams experienced trouble  breathing. The spokesman said Williams did not want to go to the hospital at  that time and went back to sleep.  </P> <P> Dr. Mark Vogt said he returned to the house with paramedics after Williams  became acutely ill but he could not be revived. Williams died of complications  of emphysema, Vogt said.  </P> <P> Throughout his career with the Teamsters, Williams had connections with  individuals considered by law enforcement officials to be tied to organized  crime, including Allen Dorfman, a Chicago insurance executive who was convicted  with Williams. Dorfman was gunned down gangland-style outside a suburban  Chicago restaurant Jan. 20, 1983, while appealing his conviction.  </P> <P> Teamster headquarters in Washington had no immediate comment Friday on  Williams' death.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Kind Words  </P> <P> Earlier this month, William J. McCarthy, president of the Teamsters, had no  kind words for either Williams or Jackie Presser, Williams successor, when he  testified before Congress: "One was a cheat and one was a liar and both were  mixed up with La Cosa Nostra by their own admissions. I didn't care for either  one of them," he said.  </P> <P> Williams claimed that he was set up in the attempted bribery case.  </P> <P> In an interview early this year, Williams said: "I am still just an old truck  driver at heart. It's over now and I am glad of it. I still have to meet my  maker. But I can still say I didn't do nothing wrong."  </P> <P> Several years ago, Williams testified at a casino money-skimming trial in  Kansas City that he had received payments from Nick Civella, the late Kansas  City crime boss, for helping mob figures obtain a $60-million loan from a union  pension fund. Williams said in an interview later that he did so only after his  family was threatened and after Hoffa advised him to do it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Received Payoffs  </P> <P> In his testimony, which he gave in an attempt to have his sentence reduced,  Williams said he received payoffs of $1,500 a month from Civella for seven  years when he was a local labor leader. He said Civella played a key role in  his election to the union's international presidency.  </P> <P> Williams also testified by videotape in a federal court trial in New York  against mob figures accused of fixing his election as Teamsters president, and  that of Presser, who died last July. Three co-defendants were acquitted of that  charge in May, 1988, but convicted of unrelated charges.  </P> <P> Williams is survived by two daughters and a grandson.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 3 Farvardin [19 April] KEYHAN News Service  -- 'Abbas 'Abdi, editor in chief of the newspaper SALAM, who was  arrested early in the month of Shahrivar [23 August-22 September  1993] and was sentenced on 1 Dey [22 December] at the  revolutionary court to one year in prison and 40 lashes in  suspension, was released on a bond payment of 10 million tumans.    The newspaper SALAM made the point that 'Abdi has served 10  months of his sentence and only four months remain, and that  taking a 10-million-tuman bond to free him is not appropriate  for the remaining time. It regarded this as a violation of  judicial procedure.    During the month of Dey [22 December 1993-20 January 1994],  concurrent with the issuance of the sentence punishing 'Abdi and  the press discussions concerning the nature of his crime, the  deputy minister of guidance for press affairs said: The charges  against 'Abbas 'Abdi are not press related.</p>

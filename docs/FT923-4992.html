			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News in Brief: Benetton family reorganises sports sector ITALY'S Benetton family, which controls the Italian clothing group of the same name, is reorganising its sports equipment sector, built up over the past three years through a series of takeovers. The acquisitions, which include Prince, the US tennis racquet maker, have been held by Edizione Holding, the Benetton's private family holding company. Under the reorganisation, a new holding company, Benetton Sportsystem, is being created to control all the family's sports equipment activities. ***** J. Lauritzen, the Danish shipping and shipbuilding group, announced pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1992 of DKr157m (Dollars 29m), compared with DKr118m for the same period last year. Profit after tax and minorities was DKr111m after the first half of 1991's DKr77m, writes our Copenhagen correspondent. The company expected a poorer result for the whole of 1992 than the DKr588m pre-tax profit it posted in 1991. The company said its first-half result was acceptable. However, shipbuilding at its two Danish yards had been disappointing. Lauritzen reported DKr6.85bn group sales for the first half of 1992, compared with DKr6.47bn for the same period last year. ***** Banco Exterior, a state-controlled enterprise and one of Spain's leading financial institutions, raised its first-half consolidated net profits by 16 per cent to Pta16.2bn (Dollars 178.9m), writes Tom Burns. The bank, which is an important player in the public sector and has frequently been cited as a possible candidate for partial privatisation, raised its consolidated operating profit by 3.3 per cent to Pta39.8bn and its cash flow by 15 per cent to Pta58.2bn.</p>

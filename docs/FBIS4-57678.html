			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfredo Villareal from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] A criminal attack took place in San Salvador this  morning. It is still not clear if the attack was criminal in  nature or political. Again, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] leader Nidia Diaz's [nom de guerre for Maria  Concepcion Valladares de Sosa] bodyguard received the brunt of  the attack and this time he was injured in an arm. The  bodyguard suffered a similar attack three months ago. According  to now FMLN Deputy Nidia Diaz, the attack was aimed at her on  both occasions. She, thus, stated that former guerrilla  commanders do not have any security to participate in politics.    Diaz's bodyguard suffered the second attack in less than  three months today. According to the reports, Elmer Cruz  Pineda, a PNC [National Civilian Police] member assigned to  Nidia Diaz' security, drove the vehicle that was hit by 20  rounds of 9-mm pistol and M-16 rifle fire. Furthermore, the  attackers threw a grenade that seriously injured the bodyguard's  right arm.    [Begin recording] [Cruz] There was an attack on Mrs. Nidia  Diaz at about 0600 this morning. It is estimated that it was  carried out by Army soldiers who do not agree with the peace  accords. I believe there is no two ways about this. It can't  be anybody else but them.    [Reporter] What did you do when you were attacked?    [Cruz] I fought off the attack and defended myself. I was  alone at the time and I tried to defend myself. [end recording]    The attack was made on the same vehicle that was attacked  last time; it took place in front of the political leader's  house, located on Los Lirios Avenue in the University  neighborhood, at approximately 0630. The attackers were fought  off by just one man. They crashed their vehicle after the  attack, leaving it approximately two blocks from Deputy Diaz'  house.    [Begin Diaz recording] We no longer use bullets in politics.  We are civilians and work within the institutional framework of  the government. This event is very serious because we  supposedly have guarantees and believe we can have confidence.  I would like to go about without any bodyguards and move about  just as any other person. All of a sudden this happens and you  realize that you have to have a bodyguard. I feel it is much  more dangerous because we have placed our trust is the system  and have presented ourselves, with all our characteristics, our  people, our relatives, under the protection of the government's  institutions. [end recording]    Nidia Diaz, who now has a large group of bodyguards 24 hours  a day, reported the charges to the joint group.    [Begin unidentified bodyguard recording] We have to be on  our  guard at all times when we are with her. We have to make sure  we are not being followed. [end recording]    Definitely, the violence in our country does not stop and  the  people responsible for countering it have not found the means to  do so.</p>

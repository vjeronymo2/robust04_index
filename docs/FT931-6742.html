			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Dutch cyclicals falter as defensives strengthen - The dichotomy remains The dramatic demise of Daf in recent weeks is a disturbing sign of the times for long-suffering cyclical stocks on Amsterdam's stock exchange. In spite of past predictions that cyclical shares were about to take off, investors continue to focus on defensive stocks such as banks, insurers, publishers and food companies. This leaves chemicals, paper and transport groups languishing on the sidelines, awaiting an often predicted, but frequently postponed resurgence. For Daf, recovery will come too late. The company, whose shares came to the market at Fl 47 in 1989, collapsed into receivership in early February. A privately-held successor, DAF Trucks, rose out of the ashes yesterday, partly as the result of financial support by the Dutch and Belgian governments, but investors in the 'old' Daf were left holding worthless shares. The bad news surrounding Daf has coincided with tales of woe and reduced profitability at other cyclicals, including Hoogovens, caught in the steel sector's crisis, Fokker, KLM, DSM and Akzo, and the paper and packaging companies, KNP and Buhrmann-Tetterode. Most analysts do not expect cyclicals to start recovering until the second half of 1993, ahead of a economic upswing in Europe in 1994 and 1995. But the rest of the market is expected to post further gains in 1993, even although the mainstays - publishers, banks, insurance companies and food companies - have already enjoyed a good run. The dichotomy between defensive and cyclical stocks is being heightened by the release of 1992 results, which began in earnest this week. Akzo, which has done better than many of its international competitors, saw its shares fall sharply on Wednesday after unveiling a 3 per cent profit rise and warning that first-half profits might be lower. Unilever, by contrast, was rewarded for its results with a new 12-month high yesterday of Fl 208.50. Other stocks to hit similar records this week were ABN Amro Bank and ING, the banking and insurance group, which analysts see as a further illustration that financials are not yet overpriced. 'By international standards, Dutch financial stocks are still very cheap and they could well outperform foreign financials,' says Mr Dirk de Jong, an analyst at Van Meer James Capel, who forecasts that the equity market will produce a total return of 20 per cent in 1993 compared with some 7 per cent in 1992. At Kempen &amp; Co, Mr Fokko Tuin comments that quality stocks will continue to benefit from re-rating by foreign investors, who have realised that the market is comparatively cheap and that Dutch companies have strong balance sheets. This has led investors to pay more than 18 times earnings for recession-proof publishers such as Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer. There is room for further price gains in 1993, he says, but they will be relatively limited. 'We see the general share index at somewhere between 210 and 220 points by the end of the year,' Mr Tuin says. Since the beginning of the year the index has risen some 6.3 per cent. The timing of an eventual rise in cyclical shares is one of the most vexing issues facing investors and analysts. Twice during 1992 cyclicals seemed poised for a rally, but the rises later stalled in the absence of substantial interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank and the lack of evidence of economic recovery. Currency devaluations in Britain, Italy and Scandinavia in the autumn presented new problems for cyclicals, which are heavily dependent on European exports. In the end, the 3.5 per cent increase in the general share index in 1992 was carried by the publishers, banks and insurance companies, which both registered gains of more than 20 per cent, helping to overcome a decline of nearly 40 per cent in paper stocks and other cyclical sectors. Still, analysts say, the importance of cyclicals should not be exaggerated, nor should they obscure the strength of other parts of the market. Mr de Jong notes that the cyclical companies account for just 10 per cent of the market's equity capitalisation, compared with the 30 per cent share held by manufacturing and cyclical shares in Germany. Although the cyclical companies may be grabbing the headlines, their relatively small market share means that Dutch listed companies as a whole are forecast to show profit gains in 1993 - analysts' estimates range from 7 per cent to 13 per cent - while Germany's companies could well see flat results. This augurs well for the market, as do expected lower interest rates and a stable dollar. In the short term, however, attention is focused on 1992 earnings. A climax of sorts will be reached on Thursday, when DSM, which has a big presence in cyclical bulk chemicals, Philips, considered by some analysts to be a cyclical share, and Heineken, a classic defensive stock, all unveil results. The market has already discounted a halving of DSM's dividend to Fl 4 in 1991. But Mr Tuin of Kempen says: 'If the dividend turns out to be Fl 3, I think DSM could fall by 10 per cent.'</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Blockleys setback as shares dive Shares in Blockleys, the maker of building products, dived 8p to 63p after pre-tax profits tumbled from Pounds 261,000 to Pounds 122,000 in the first half of 1994. Turnover increased to Pounds 5.22m, against Pounds 4.75m. Mr Brian Taylor, chairman, said margins had been under pressure because, following a stock reduction, bricks produced under a reduced output level and at higher cost, were now being sold. Earnings per share came to 0.32p (0.71p) and the interim dividend was cut to 0.4p (0.5p).</p>

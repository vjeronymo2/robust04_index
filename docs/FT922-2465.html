			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Letter: No recognition for deserving engineers in honours list Sir, Having failed to obtain a single award for any one of a large number of highly deserving engineering manufacturers over no less than a decade, may I suggest that your headline, 'Business leaders and former MPs dominate awards' (June 13), may be less than accurate. Every life peer was connected with politics in some way, either appointed by the government or a politician in his or her own right. The word 'dominate' could not apply less to business leaders. Even down the list of civil servants, academics and service industries predominate. They outweigh much more deserving people. It seems to me that the honours list, of doubtful value at any time, has far outlived its usefulness and should be dumped. If this is not to be, then may I suggest that the selection committee and all to do with it be removed from the civil service. Indeed, it seems an excellent example where privatisation might well permit it to do a much better job and perhaps survive. W T Williams, director-general, Engineering Industries Association, 16 Dartmouth Street, London SW1H 9BL</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> RAID INTO LEBANON DEFENDED BY ISRAEL;  </P> <P> LEADER OF IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH ACCUSED OF ROLE IN TERRORIST ATTACKS  </P> <P> Israel on Friday defended its daring pre-dawn raid into Lebanon and the  abduction of a Muslim leader of the militant Hezbollah militia as a necessary  part of its fight against terrorism.  </P> <P> The target of the raid, Sheik Abdel Kareem Obeid, "was known as a preacher and  instigator in carrying out attacks against Israel," according to an Israeli  army spokesman, Col. Ranaan Gissin. "He was the main figure in the (Hezbollah)  organization especially in southern Lebanon."  </P> <P> The army's action immediately sparked threats of retaliation from the  Iranian-backed Shiite group.  </P> <P> But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel was unmoved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Reserves Right to Respond'  </P> <P> "Israel has said several times that when combat against international terrorism  is at stake, it reserves the right to respond whenever it will find it suitable  and effective," he said.  </P> <P> The raid began in the early morning hours Friday as 25 Israeli helicopter-borne  commandos landed near the Shiite Muslim village of Jibchit, about 10 miles  north of the Israeli border.  </P> <P> Obeid, the 36-year-old leader of the militant Hezbollah militia, is both a  spiritual leader and political chief in the village.  </P> <P> Squads of Israeli jets reportedly staged mock raids nearby to distract  attention from the helicopter's arrival.  </P> <P> The commandos surrounded Obeid's building, then knocked on the door of his  apartment on the second floor. They pushed their way in when the door was  opened, waving pistols equipped with silencers. Obeid's wife, Mona, was then  locked in a room with her hands tied and her mouth taped.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Blindfolded My Father'  </P> <P> "They stormed our house and pointed a gun at me and my mother and tied us up.  Then they blindfolded my father and the two others and took them away," Saged,  one of Obeid's five children, was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> Also seized were Obeid's cousin, Ahmad, and a man identified as Hashem Fahes, a  friend who was staying at Obeid's house, according to Lebanese police.  </P> <P> A villager, alternately described as a neighbor of Obeid or one of his guards,  was shot and killed when he looked out his door to see what was going on.  </P> <P> All of the commandos returned safely to Israel.  </P> <P> In Beirut, Hezbollah spiritual leader Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah urged  Muslims to "stand up to their responsibilities to confront the Israeli crime"  and to "let out their anger until Obeid is released safely."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action Condemned  </P> <P> Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the action in a statement. "This shameless  act by the Zionist regime will not remain unanswered by the Muslim and  combatant forces."  </P> <P> Army spokesman Gissin said that in addition to instigating and planning attacks  across Israel's border, Obeid provided weapons to Hezbollah guerrillas in  southern Lebanon and arranged hiding places for those who were carrying out  attacks on Israeli targets.  </P> <P> Reports from Lebanon said Obeid is also suspected of helping to plan the  February, 1988, abduction of an American, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,  who was assigned to a U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon.  </P> <P> Reports from Lebanon said Higgins, of Danville, Ky., was held at Obeid's  apartment for a brief time after his capture. The Oppressed of the Earth, a  group believed to be linked with Hezbollah, reportedly later took Higgins to  another hiding place.  </P> <P> In Washington, President Bush said he did not know if the incident would help  Higgins or the eight other American hostages. In what appeared to be a veiled  criticism of the action, he said, "I don't think kidnaping and violence help  the cause of peace."  </P> <P> The British government condemned the seizure of Obeid and called for his  release. Several Britons are held hostage in Lebanon; one, Terry Waite, special  envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury, was kidnaped in January, 1987, while on  a mission to free other hostages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticism Dismissed  </P> <P> Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, also defended the army  action and dismissed criticism from Britain and others.  </P> <P> "This sheik is one of the most dangerous terrorists in south Lebanon,  personally responsible for bloodshed and a great number of terrorist attacks  against Israeli targets," he said. "I do not remember the same indignation and  condemnation coming from Britain when those despicable acts were conducted  against us."  </P> <P> Israeli government radio, quoting military sources, said the daring arrest of  Obeid and the two other men might hasten the release of three Israeli soldiers  believed to be held in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Hezbollah, or Party of God, is reported to hold several foreign hostages,  including at least two Israeli soldiers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Certain Leverage'  </P> <P> Army spokesman Gissin fueled the speculation, saying: "Clearly, when you  capture one of their top leaders, it can deter terrorism, and you also have a  certain amount of leverage in your hands."  </P> <P> In February, 1986, two soldiers were captured by Hezbollah in Israel's  self-declared "security zone" in southern Lebanon. The third Israeli, a downed  pilot, reportedly is being held by the Shiite Amal militia.  </P> <P> There was no indication Friday night that the capture of Obeid was directly  related to the case of Higgins.  </P></p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UN halts Rwanda operations The UN mission in Rwanda suspended all operations yesterday after a senior officer with its force was killed by a mortar blast, Reuter reports from Kigali. Fighting between rebels and government troops for control of the capital forced a halt to evacuation of thousands of civilians from both the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi tribes trapped in each other's strongholds. The dead UN officer, a Senegalese, was the 12th peacekeeper killed in Rwanda since civil war, marked by the mass killing of civilians, broke out on April 6.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / EU may shake up betting levies Betting on overseas horse races such as the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe could become more expensive if a European Union draft directive becomes law. The proposal, attached to an agricultural directive, is designed to raise more money for the European bloodstock industry. But it would mean that bets taken on races in other parts of the EU would incur a levy imposed by the country in which the race was run. A UK bookmaker would have to pay the 5 per cent French levy for a bet on a French race rather than the UK levy of just over 1 per cent. In the Irish Republic, where there is no levy on off-course betting, the proposal would have a more general effect. More than 80 per cent of all Irish bets are placed on UK races and would attract the British rate. Mr Tom Kelly, director-general of the Betting Offices Licensees Association in the UK, was in Brussels yesterday lobbying against the recently changed text of the agricultural directive. The original plan was to link intellectual property law and betting by giving control of betting information such as odds to the organisers of horse races. This would have conferred a right on them not available in any member state. Mr Kelly said yesterday the European Commission appeared to have listened and dropped the intellectual property clause. But he believed it was wrong to introduce, in effect, a new tax through an agricultural directive and said the plan also breached subsidiarity rules. Horse racing was supposed to be an industry which set its rules at the national level, he said. British bookmakers say the French can afford a 5 per cent levy because their overheads are lower - they can operate in bars and cafes.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Money talks A new breed of successful businessmen is using financial clout to win a political voice, writes Chrystia Freeland in Moscow. Typical is Mr Rafis Kadyrov, a 37-year-old banker running for the Russian parliament and the presidency of the tiny autonomous republic of Bashkortostan. Yesterday, he promised an increase in the wealth of the republic's citizens from Dollars 250 to Dollars 250,000 over the next four years. His model may have been Mr Kirsan Iliumzhinov, a businessman who last spring was elected president of Kalmykia, another autonomous republic, after promising to pay each citizen Dollars 100 out of his own pocket.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Recruitment: Behold, some good omens at last - Latest count of executive job offers gives hope of return to sustained growth in demand 'BEHOLD there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.' So spake the prophet Elijah's omen-spotting servant on returning from the top of Mount Carmel some 2,850 years ago - and since he'd been sent up there six times previously only to see nothing, he no doubt spake with relief. The Jobs column now knows how he must have been feeling, thanks to the accompanying table which has appeared regularly in this corner of the FT for a good 10 years. As always, it tracks changes in the United Kingdom market for managers and higher-ranked specialist workers, as gauged by the MSL International consultancy's three-monthly counts of executive-type jobs advertised in national journals. Before directing attention to the equivalent of Elijah's cloud - which, as readers will recall, was a good omen - I'd better explain the table's workings. The upper part focuses on the 12-monthly period which ends on September 30, going back to 1988-89, and shows the number of job-openings advertised in eight broad types of executive work. Each opening is counted as one, no matter how many times the advertisement for it appears. The catch-all 'Others' category, by the way, includes people such as buyers, company legal staff, economists and assorted consultants. The eight separate counts are followed by the 12-monthly total. Then come the four quarterly tallies, covering all categories, of which the total is composed. As the advertised demand ebbs and flows seasonally, the percentage change after each three-monthly tally shows how it differs from the count for the corresponding quarter of the year before. Now, measured by the number of omens offered, the table is more generous than the view from Mount Carmel that day nigh three millennia ago. Instead of one good portent, there are two. They are the plus signs before the latest percentage changes in both the 12-month total and the July-September quarterly count. But although doubly blest in that respect by comparison with Elijah's servant, I doubt that his sense of relief could have been any greater than mine is today. For whereas he vainly scaled the mountain's peak only six times before spotting the cloud, I have returned to the jobs-market table no fewer than 18 times without seeing a plus sign in either of the two positions named. The last time the most recent 12 months showed a rise in demand was in the spring of 1989. And a full five years has gone by since a three-monthly period produced an increase over the corresponding previous quarter, in July-September 1988. During the interval, the UK advertised market has plumbed the lowest depths recorded in the 34 years MSL has been keeping its counts. Indeed, even in the recession of the early 1980s, the tally for a 12-monthly period to September 30 never fell below 17,886 - 13.2 per cent more than the improved total of 15,521 just appeared. So relief at seeing the two good omens is no occasion for joy unconfined. For they might well betoken mere momentary upturn rather than sustained recovery in the market as a whole. After all, of the eight categories in the upper part of the table, six ended last month still in decline. Nevertheless, while the fate of my previous fits of optimism these past five years should perhaps have taught me better, my guess is that the growth will spread. One reason is the two successive rises shown by the sales and marketing category, which has consistently proved a lead indicator of UK demand for executives in general. True, its first rebound in 1991-92 has as yet been copied by only one other specialism, computing. But that may be because recovery of the advertised part of the market has been delayed by a special factor. During the recession, huge numbers of able people made redundant through no fault of their own have put themselves on the books of recruitment agencies that keep registers of job-seekers in various fields, supplying lists of candidates on request from employers. Some large groups avalanched with speculative applications have apparently set up their own similar registers. Hence, for as long as the data-bases can provide adequate candidates, employers see less need to advertise their openings. But the main reason for my expectation of a general return to growth is a further omen which, since the three-monthly counts lump all types of executive work together, isn't visible in the table. The third good sign is that not only did the quarter just ended bring a jump of 36.8 per cent in overall demand, but it saw all eight categories rise over their tallies for July-September 1992. Even so, I cannot foresee the advertised market ever returning to the heights of the mid-1980s, when 12-monthly totals topped 40,000. And the reason for that longer run pessimism lies in the demand for innovative specialists represented by the research and development category. A dozen years ago it rose steeply in advance of the boom for other types of staff. But since its 12-monthly peak of 7,538 in 1983-84 it has plummeted to a mere 1,248 jobs - only half the number offered in the depths of the previous recession in 1980-81.</p>

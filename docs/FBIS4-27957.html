			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday that China has shown a  willingness to cooperate in international efforts to settle the  North Korean nuclear problem and was unlikely to present an  obstacle.    Han, visiting New York to clarify South Korea's position and  cooperate with U.N. Security Council [UNSC] members on the  nuclear problem, said there is no just cause for Chinese  opposition to a U.N. resolution imposing sanctions on North  Korea.    "Nobody can tell what China has in mind, but I think China  does not have any just cause to oppose a U.N. resolution  imposing sanctions on Pyongyang since North Korea is being  uncooperative and there is no other way but to impose  sanctions," Han said.    Han expected that a draft resolution would not be introduced  at the Security Council in one or two days, saying, "a draft  resolution has not been decided yet, and it should be decided  through discussion among related nations."    The permanent UNSC members are in frequent contact on an  unofficial basis because the North Korean nuclear problem is  urgent, Han said.    "After having separate contacts with the ambassadors of the  five permanent UNSC members and Japan, I have become aware that  there is a consensus in the positions of South Korea, the United  States and Japan and that the permanent UNSC members generally  sympathize with the South Korean position," he said.    After holding talks with the ambassadors, Han met with  Robert  Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of State for political and  military affairs, to reaffirm bilateral cooperation on the North  Korean problem.    Han also met with Security Council President Salim Bin  Mohammed Al Khussaiby and talked to U.N. Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who is visiting Europe. Han is scheduled  to hold a press conference on Tuesday before returning home.</p>

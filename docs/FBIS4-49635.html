			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- In order to maintain  the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, it is of vital  importance to maintain the stability of the Chinese mainland,  without which, the principle of "one country, two systems" will  be built on sand, a Chinese official said.    "By `one country, two systems' we mean that the main body of  the country practices socialism, which is the fundamental system  of China, while as a supplement to the socialist state, Hong  Kong continues to practice capitalism," said Lu Ping, director  of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a  luncheon given in his honor here today.    "When we say there will be no change in the principle of  'one  country, two systems', there are actually two aspects: the  capitalist system of Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and the  fundamental socialist system of the country will also not  change," he said.    "Otherwise, it will be 'one country, one system', instead of  'one country, two systems'," he said.    Lu said that some people believe that only when China turns  capitalist, can Hong Kong's capitalism be guaranteed. "This is  an entirely wrong concept," he said.    "If in case (which is an impossible supposition) China turns  capitalist as some people wishfully think, where will Hong Kong  stand? Can Hong Kong continue to play its role as a bridge,  which contributes as a major factor to Hong Kong's prosperity  and stability?" Lu asked.    He said that Chinese leaders are determined to build a  strong  socialist China and any movement or action to change this  direction may cause chaos and disruption to the Chinese economy.  Any foreign government or anyone in Hong Kong trying to exert  pressure on the Chinese Government will not succeed. China  would not want itself to be rampant with chaos, he said.    "Furthermore, can Hong Kong continue to prosper with a  turbulent mainland at its back? During the Cultural Revolution  (1966-1976), which was purely an internal conflict, Mao Zedong  and Zhou Enlai to some extent, could still exercise some control  over the 'Red Guards'. Do you know that in 1967 it was Premier  Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the 'gang of  four' to send troops to Hong Kong?    "Do you know that in order to maintain the prosperity and  stability of Hong Kong, China has been imposing strict  self-control on the exodus of immigrants to Hong Kong?    "It has been and still is, the People's Liberation Army  which, under the strict orders of the central government, has  been guarding the Hong Kong borders and maintaining the  stability in Hong Kong," he added.</p>

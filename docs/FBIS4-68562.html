			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Davit Tumanyan, candidate of economic sciences </F> and director of the Yerevan Employment Center: "The Labor Market  and Employment of the Population in Armenia"]    [Text] The Armenian labor market is characterized by a  number of special features:    a) The new type of labor market is in a state of formation  which has been proceeding in parallel with the transformation of  the economic system together with fuel, raw-material, energy and  financial crises as well as the war in Karabakh.    b) A restructuring of the economy, based on new forms of  ownership, is under way in the republic. As a result there is a  movement of the workforce from the state sector of the economy  to the private one. However, the weak private sector cannot  absorb the supply of available idle labor. A class of private  entrepreneurs and employers who can employ large numbers of  workers from the labor market while building or developing  production units has not yet formed. The essential and proper  conditions to organize production are not yet present in the  republic. Only small enterprises are created in which the  recruitment of workers is based on ties of friendship or blood.    The number of persons employed by the state sector of the  economy in 1993 was 3.2 percent less than what it was in 1992  (1993 figures are estimated). The number of persons employed by  the entire economy dropped by a similar amount over the said  interval. There have also been significant changes in the  structure of labor resources. The relative weight of persons  employed in public production declined by 2.8 percentage points  while those who are unemployed increased by 3.1 percentage  points.    c) The branch structure of the republic's economy has not  yet  been determined. As a result, the formation of demand for labor  is blocked. The resolution of the branch structure policy became  essential beginning in 1990 when it was decided to make a  transition to a new economic system. However, that was not done.  Today work in that direction is slow. The policy on economic  branch structure must be in harmony with the republic's resource  (both material and labor) potential as well as its internal and  external economic, social and military interests. It must reduce  the production volume of energy- and material-intensive branches  and expand the volumes of labor- and knowledge-intensive  branches. Special attention must be paid to the service sector.  It must be pointed out that in all developed countries more than  half the workforce is employed in the service sector. In those  countries, the number of persons employed in the primitive  sectors of the economy (agriculture, forestry and fishing) is  small (2 to 10 percent of the total workforce). In our republic,  20 percent of the workforce employed in public production is  employed in primitive sectors, and 40 percent is employed in the  service sector. This distribution must be gradually changed, and  the relative weight of the service sector must be increased.    d) The imbalance between the supply of and the demand for  labor is associated with the reduction in the overall number of  work places. A rigorous inventory of work places in the republic  has not been taken. As a result the dynamics of their  development can be estimated only on the basis of indirect data.  Analyzing the last few years' data for capital investments, the  utilization of primary resources and the number of persons  employed in the economy as well as the results of individual  studies, one can conclude that the number of work places has  followed a declining trend since 1991. The number of work places  in 1992 was roughly 4 to 6 percent less than in 1990. The  qualitative aspect of the correlation between work places and  the workforce is characterized by a severe imbalance. Most of  the existing work places are incompatible with current  scientific and technological standards and Armenia's new  situation. The republic must have work places equipped with  modern technology and equipment in order to open up to the world  market. Unfortunately, most of the basic resources of existing  enterprises are fatigued metaphorically and physically. In many  work places the basic conditions necessary for work are  nonexistent.    e) The low level of wages is aggravating the problems of the  labor market. The wage level has also become the important  factor which is forcing a large number of employed persons to  seek better-paying employment and to change the nature of their  work.    f) A portion of the workforce is leaving the republic in a  disorganized manner. That has reduced the scale of the problems  of the labor market. It must be pointed out that most of those  who leave are highly-trained specialists, craftsmen as well as  businessmen who could have raised the standard of employment by  a certain amount.    g) The role of the labor unions in the organization of the  workforce is very poor. Although an agreement was signed between  the labor unions and the government last year, no practical  results have yet been observed.    h) The presence of a large number of refugees [from  Azerbaijan] in the republic has heightened the tensions in the  labor market.    In order to visualize the scale of the problems of the labor  market in Armenia let us review certain data we have computed.  In Armenia, an average of 340,000 to 360,000 persons look for  work each year. An overwhelming majority of these people are  persons who want to change the type of their work. Of these, 43  percent find work. About 68 percent of unemployed citizens and  only 2 percent of those who want to change the type of their  work apply to employment centers. On the average, only 25  percent of all persons looking for work apply to employment  centers.    As of the beginning of 1993, 67,600 persons were registered  at employment centers. Of those, 64,400 were unemployed persons.  By the end of 1993, the total number of persons registered at  employment centers had risen to 114,000 of which 110,200 were  unemployed. At the end of year, the supply of [idle] labor had  increased by 68.6 percent compared to the beginning of the year,  while the demand for labor had declined by 37.3 percent. Because  of the low demand for labor, only 5,400 citizens were placed in  work by employment centers in 1993. As of 1 January 1994, more  than 102,600 citizens had the status of unemployed. More than 60  percent of the persons with the status of unemployed are women.  The number of young unemployed persons is also quite high. The  education level of more than half of the unemployed citizens is  middle-school education or lower. Those with higher [above high  school] education constitute 17 percent of the total.    The labor market in Yerevan is significant because of its  large size. Approximately one-third of the republic's population  lives in that city. The capital is home to a substantial portion  of scientific, cultural, industrial enterprises and agencies of  the state apparatus. Also the population of the capital is  highly mobile which expands the outer limits of the labor  market. The labor market of Yerevan is characterized by severe  imbalances. Nearly 90 percent of the jobs offered through the  employment centers are worker positions and 10 percent are  service positions. The supply of [idle] labor, however, has  exactly the opposite distribution. As a result, the number of  citizens with the status of unemployed had increased by 11,100  (2.2-fold) at the end of 1993 compared to the beginning of the  year.    The [earthquake] disaster zone encompasses 15 districts  [rayons] and four cities subject to republican administration.  As of 1 January 1993, 25.2 percent of the republic's population  lived in this region. Although 5 years have passed since the  earthquake of December 1988, the status of reconstruction work  is far from being satisfactory. In the conditions that have been  created, that work has either come to a stop or continues at a  very slow pace. Because few enterprises have been rebuilt and  construction work is continually postponed, the level of  unemployment is quite high. The disaster zone accounts for 34  percent of the unemployed persons in the republic.    These figures refer to unemployed persons who are officially  registered. There is a large number of hidden unemployed persons  in the republic. Generally industrial enterprises either do not  work at all or work with interruptions. Those who work in those  enterprises are, in effect, unemployed. According to statistical  data, 12 to 15 percent of persons employed in the state sector  (90,000 to 115,000 persons) were subject to forced layoffs each  month in 1993. In industry that figure is as high as 24 to 31  percent (71,000 to 82,000 persons). Hidden unemployment is  always present in agriculture. The number of people in that  category has grown recently because of the war situation in the  border regions. Finally, there is a substantial army of jobless  persons amongst the unemployed (migrants, "small vendors,'  swindlers, etc) and refugees.    When these groups, that is the hidden jobless, are taken  into  account, the number of unemployed persons in Armenia can be  estimated to be 250,000 to 350,000.    The special peculiarities of the workforce in Armenia are  likely to persist in the near future. More importantly, in  conditions of high rates of currency devaluations it is  impossible to keep work places that are not operational. If the  phenomenon of hyperinflation penetrates the industrial sector it  would be impossible to avoid massive unemployment.</p>

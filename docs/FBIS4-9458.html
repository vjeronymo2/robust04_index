			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 24 April (MTI) -- "Such a rapid decline of  the former Soviet Union, the Balkan war, the drought that  afflicted the country, and the global economic recession could  not have been predicted," Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross  said on Sunday [24 April] evening.    "However, even amidst such circumstances, Hungary was able  to  transform its industrial structure, halt inflation, and the  government has taken successful steps to find markets for the  changed agriculture", he added.    Speaking at the election rally of the Sopron (western  Hungary) local organization of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF], Boross, who is the prime minister candidate of the MDF,  pointed out:    "Although we have made many mistakes, we have confessed to  these and have learned from them."    Boross voiced the hope that the Hungarian Democratic Forum  will achieve good results in the May parliamentary elections.    "I would like to serve on as prime minister for another four  years," he said.</p>

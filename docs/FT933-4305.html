			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Plasmec shares react to poor first half The shares of Plasmec were marked down 12p to 66p yesterday as the group announced that it had run into a Pounds 237,000 loss in the first half of 1993 and was halving the dividend to 0.75p. The group makes products for telecommunications and switching, and electronic and mechanical systems. A satisfactory profit was expected for the second half, to put the group in a strong position to enter 1994. Sales suffered a 19 per cent fall to Pounds 5.96m (Pounds 7.32m). That was blamed on completion of the contract for Littlewoods Pools, the decline in microfilm reader business, and the sluggish pace of business recovery in the first quarter. The impact on operating profit was a decline of 55 per cent. There was a restructuring provision of Pounds 313,000. Losses per share were 3.6p (earnings 4.3p).</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (4): Suharto is untouchable - Manuela Saragosa notes more open debate in politics President Suharto is unlikely to go down in history as a born-again democrat, but his recent calls for more open public debate, with his moves to reduce the number of military men in government, indicate that there is change brewing. The changes started when Mr Suharto, a former general, entered his sixth five-year term in office in March last year, having run in elections as the sole presidential candidate and been backed by both opposition parties and the ruling Golkar party. First, he introduced a surprise cabinet reshuffle. Out went many of the older 1945 independence generation ministers; in came younger faces. In the process, members of the armed forces were reduced to eight from 11 in a 41-member cabinet, with only two of them on the military's active service list. A few months later, President Suharto was calling for more open public debate. Politically sensitive subjects such as his own succession, human rights in East Timor, and the role of ethnic Chinese Indonesians in the country's business and economy are no longer completely taboo. 'The degree of political openness is unrecognisable from three or four years ago,' says a Jakarta-based western diplomat. To be sure, Mr Suharto and his family remain untouchable. Earlier this year, students who demonstrated outside parliament, demanding that Suharto account for his leadership, were each sentenced to six months imprisonment for defaming the president. Open discussion of Mr Suharto's family business monopolies, which extend from satellite communications to cement manufacturing, also remains off limits in the national press. What is interesting is not that the press has become bolder, but what has motivated Mr Suharto to call for more open public debate. Observers point to his increasingly frequent hints that he may step down when his presidential term ends in 1998 - he will turn 77 that year - but they also mention the strain involved in keeping a lid held down on a society which is demanding more democracy to accompany its more open economic policies. The national press is still constrained by a law which empowers the government to revoke publication and broadcasting licences when 'the wrong kind of information' is dispersed - but Jakarta roof tops are littered with large satellite dishes, soaking up information from international broadcasting networks. 'Mr Suharto realises that with globalisation it is inevitable that people know about what is happening instantly,' says Mr Juwono Sudarsono, professor of International Relations at the University of Indonesia. 'He realises that managed openness is better than a complete clampdown. It is more effective in managing change.' Political analysts say that Mr Suharto's moves to foster open political debate show he is concerned about the legacy he will leave when he steps down. Over the last few years he has successfully dubbed himself as 'the father of development' in Indonesia and his rule is credited with consistency in sustaining a healthy level of economic growth. Politically, his track record is not squeaky clean, particularly on the subject of human rights. An attempt to set the record straight on that front was carried out earlier this year when the Indonesian government invited journalists from all over the world to attend a government-guided tour of East Timor - part of a campaign to improve Indonesia's international reputation. The campaign is accompanied with a gradual reduction of military presence in government. The military, however, remains a force to be reckoned with. Much of the public debate in the press is a reflection of the power struggles taking place in the ruling elite - technocrats and military men battling with technologists - and debate between the generations. Political analysts note that a new generation of ministers has entered Indonesian political life and that, unlike the 1945 independence generation, they are less concerned with cohesion and national unity. Many of them have been educated in the west and have tasted political freedoms which they do not have at home. They stand behind the drive for more transparency in government. However, rather than argue things out in parliament, some politicians have resorted to tossing subtle barbs at each other in the press. One example is the controversy surrounding Mr JB Habibie, the minister of technology and research. Pressure on Mr Habibie's demands for a budget of Dollars 1.1bn for the purchase and upgrade of the former East Germany's fleet of warships was mounted by the minister of defence and security, who commented to journalists that the budget request was excessive. A few days later the minister of finance forced Mr Habibie to slash his budget to Dollars 482m. Increased political openness has also had its negative manifestations. Some newspapers have used their freedom to vent racist feelings against ethnic Chinese Indonesians. Their grievances are based on the fact that the ethnic Chinese control about 75 per cent of the country's private capital although they only make up about 2 per cent of the population. Observers say that attacks on ethnic Chinese Indonesians are also veiled criticisms of government officials who benefit from their association with large Chinese-dominated conglomerates, and an indirect attack on President Suharto, who has often protected Chinese business interests in Indonesia. It is certainly true that resentment of ethnic Chinese domination in industry and commerce has been an enduring characteristic of Indonesian politics since independence. But some observers say that in this sprawling archipelago, consisting of hundreds of different ethnic groupings who together count as the world's fourth largest population, things could easily slip into chaos. They point to the labour riots, laced with anti-Chinese sentiment, in the north Sumatran town of Medan earlier this year. In the meantime, Indonesians are watching the massacres in the former Yugoslavia with a mixture of horror and interest. Events there are a grim reminder of the consequences of ethno-nationalism. Analysts say, however, that a Balkan type break up is unlikely to occur in Indonesia because there is a strong sense among the ruling elite and military that stability is essential to keep up the momentum of economic growth. Thus, while the press may be bolder, there is still no freedom to assembly, no freedom of association and people's right to information is limited. As Mr Sudarsono puts it; 'The government wants to strike a nice balance between openness and stability.'</p>

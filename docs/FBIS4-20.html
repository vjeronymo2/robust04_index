			<p>ISSUES        The controversial decision of the Moscow City Court to try Vil  Mirzayanov for blowing the whistle on possible chemical weapons  violations in 1992 played into a much wider debate in the Russian  media over providing necessary protection for state secrets while  avoiding old-style censorship.  Although the charges against  Mirzayanov were finally dropped, recent actions by the Russian  Government to define state secrets continue to prompt concerns over  freedom of the press.      MIRZAYANOV ARTICLE      In September 1992 an article by Professor Vil Mirzayanov,  published in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (MOSCOW NEWS), claimed that the  Ministry of Defense was continuing to develop and produce chemical  weapons in violation of international agreements made by Russia and  in violation of orders from both former President Mikhail Gorbachev  and President Yeltsin.  The article created a major scandal at the  time, not only over the alleged violations, but because it was  originally seized prior to publication from the weekly newspaper  ARGUMENTY I FAKTY by Ministry of Security officials, thus raising  serious constitutional questions about freedom of the press.  The  article, "Poisoned Politics", was later acquired and published by  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (MOSCOW NEWS).  Mirzayanov and coauthor Dr. L.  Fedorov were arrested, held briefly for questioning, and charged  with violating Article 75 of the RSFSR Criminal Code "revealing  state secrets."  Then they were released on their own recognizance  until an investigation could be completed and a determination made  whether the case should be brought to trial.  (For complete details  of the case see FBIS Foreign Press Note:  "Russia: Chemist Involved  in Development of Chemical Weapons Arrested, Released;" FB PN 93-  019, 13 Jan 93.)      ARREST AND TRIAL      On 25 December 1993, investigation of she case was completed and  submitted to Moscow City Court No. 30 for trial.  A subpoena ordered  Mirzayanov to appear for a hearing on 6 January.  Because of the  illness of Mirzayanov's lawyer, the session was postponed until 24  January (MOSCOW NEWS, 4-10 Feb 94).  Meanwhile, the issuance of the  subpoena was made public, and it immediately provoked protest  actions and a highly critical press campaign.      Mirzayanov initially refused to cooperate with the court,  claiming that the trial was illegal because the charges against him  were based on a secret list of state secrets that had never been  published.  According to Article 15, Point 3 of the constitution,  "no legal acts concerning the rights, freedoms, and obligations of  individuals can be applied if they have not been officially  published.  The court rejected Mirzayanov's arguments and ordered  him to return the following day, 25 January.  Mirzayanov said he  would not return (INTERFAX 24 Jan 94).      When Mirzayanov did not appear for the next session as ordered,  the Moscow City Court issued a warrant for his arrest and scheduled  a hearing for 3 February.  Mirzayanov was detained at his Moscow  apartment and later taken to Matrosskaya Tishina Prison (Radio  Rossii 27 Jan 94).  The 3 February hearing was also postponed,  however, this time because the guards accompanying Mirzayanov to the  Moscow City Court Building were unable to get through a crowd of  picketers and reporters with television cameras.  They returned  Mirzayanov to prison. (INTERFAX 3 Feb 93)      The court met again on 7 February.  At that session three  "experts" testified that Mirzayanov "did not reveal information that  constituted a state secret" (Radio Rossii 9 Feb 94).  On 11  February, Prosecutor Leonid Pankratov asked the court not to render  a verdict, but to return the case for additional investigation.  The  court acceded, and on 22 February Mirzayanov was released from  prison "on the condition that he would not leave Moscow while his  case was being reexamined."  Commenting on the prosecution's  decision and the "unsatisfactory conclusion" of the case, IZVESTIYA  writer Valeriy Rudnev noted that "cases like Mirzayanov's do not go  to court a second time--they are buried in the procuracy forever"  (Russian Television 23 Feb 94; IZVESTIYA, 16 Feb 94).      Dissatisfied with the court's failure to render a decision, the  press began lobbying to have the trial brought to a conclusion.  Finally, pressure was brought to bear from the highest levels.  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that President Yeltsin wished  to see the "unfortunate episode closed on lawful foundations and  without further delays" (INTERFAX 3 Mar 94).  On 11 March, the  Prosecutor General's Office announced that it had decided to drop  the case altogether because Acting General Prosecutor General  Aleksey Ilyushenko "was unable to find a corpus delecti in the  chemist Mirzayanov's actions" (IZVESTIYA, 12 Mar 94).      PRESS, PUBLIC REACTION      Protests about the Mirzayanov case began as early as 4 January,  when a group of well-known Russian public figures published a  statement in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI criticizing the Moscow City Court's  secret hearings and demanding that they be stopped.  "The far-  fetched nature of the accusations and the secrecy of the trial are  symbols of a bygone era.  Silence in this situation means solidarity  with lawlessness."  Organizations protesting the trial included the  Russia's Choice voters association, the Russia's Choice faction in  the State Duma, (SEGODNYA 2 Feb 94), the Democratic Union of Russia  (INTERFAX 10 Feb 94), and the Human Rights Committee of the Russian  Federation Union of Lawyers (INTERFAX 2 Feb 94).  Civil rights  activists held several news conferences, claiming that the trial was  "purely political" and that it represented the most serious attempt  by the Russian special services and military-industrial complex in  recent years to suppress dissidence" (IZVESTIYA 28 Jan 94).      The Russian press also gave the trial much publicity and  criticized it severely.  IZVESTIYA, in its lead editorial, called  the case absurd, noting that the charges were leveled by the  Ministry of Security, which no longer exists.  No one seemed to know  who was insisting on the prosecution of the case.  IZVESTIYA said  the failure to find a "specific addressee" is clear evidence of a  "slide toward despotism" (IZVESTIYA 29 Jan 94).      ITAR-TASS reported that according to President Yeltsin's national  security advisor, Yuriy Baturin, Yeltsin too was displeased, because  he believed the case to be unconstitutional.  Baturin said Article 6  of the criminal code states that charges may be dropped if  circumstances change.  The new circumstance is the new constitution  which guarantees everyone the right to "look for, receive, transmit,  produce and distribute information by any legal means.  The list of  information comprising state secrets is determined by federal law.  The list of state secrets has not been published yet.  Therefore  criminal charges can be dropped." (ITAR-TASS 4 Feb 94)      PRESSURE FOR INCREASED SECRECY      The Mirzayanov investigation and trial took place against a  background of pressure on the government to take action to protect  state secrets and prevent what is perceived as the detrimental  transfer of secret technology to the West and Japan.  Over the past  two years, numerous articles have appeared in Russian newspapers  criticizing the "cheap sale" of Russian technology and warning of  the dangers of Western S&amp;T aid programs.  In 1992, for example,  several articles appeared criticizing the U.S. Department of  Energy's nuclear research contract with the Kurchatov Institute,  because the United States was "getting Russia's best nuclear  scientists" for a "very insignificant amount" (RADIKAL, Aug 92).  Similar criticism was doled out over a 1992 high-power laser deal  made with Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (IZVESTIYA, 3 Nov 92).      Russia's space program has also received an enormous amount of  criticism for not getting an adequate return on its technology and  services.  For example, the $7.5-million sale of Russia's Topaz-2  nuclear reactor is regularly cited as a "technology giveaway,"  which, because of its alleged SDI applicability, is also a threat to  Russian security (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 9 Nov 93).  In 1992,  Russian  Space Agency Director Yuriy Koptev claimed that Russia was losing  over a billion rubles a year due to the leakage of information or  technology sales (RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 13 Nov 92).      Although most articles stress the economic aspect of technology  transfer, the problem is also seen as a national security issue.  According to an article by two analysts at the Russian Academy of  Sciences Institute of International Economic and Political Research,  "national technological security is an integral part of national  security," and the "undermining" of national technological security"  is becoming uncontrollable.  The two scholars warned that "detailed  knowledge regarding our potential enables the West to identify the  most promising lines of research and the most qualified and  productively working scientific personnel for their later use in the  interests of the development of Western science and technology and  the Western economy as a whole."  The article went on to say that  aid given to Russian scientific institutions "provides the West with  the possibility of destroying a substan- tial portion of Russia's  scientific-technical potential."  It claimed that many scientists  and whole collectives are ready to sell S&amp;T achievements for  practically nothing, warning that this is "especially dangerous in  the sphere of the military-industrial complex, since it is directly  related to the weakening of the country's defense potential"  (ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, 20 Oct 93).      SECRECY ACT, OTHER MEASURES      Several measures undertaken by the Russian Federation Government  over the past year suggest that it is aware of these concerns and is  acting upon them.  In September, the text of a state secrecy act was  published which President Yeltsin had signed into law on 21 July  1993.  The law, which was passed by the Supreme Soviet shortly  before its dissolution in October 1993, defines what is and what is  not a state secret.  It also creates procedural and administrative  mechanisms for protecting state secrets, specifies  classification/declassification authority, provides for the  declassification of state secrets, and assigns penalties both for  unauthorized disclosure of classified information and other security  violations (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 21 Sep 93; full translation appears  in JPRS Report: CENTRAL EURASIA, FBIS-USR-93-127, 1 Oct 93).      On 10 March, the Interdepartmental Commission of the Security  Council of the Russian Federation on Information Security met to  discuss "realization of the Law on State Secrets adopted in 1993 and  creation of up-to-date mechanisms to protect state secrets."  The  commission approved "recommendations for speeding up the state  program for the comprehensive modernization of the state secret  protection system."  Representatives of the Russian Government, the  Russian Academy of Sciences, and ministry and department leaders  participated in the session (ITAR-TASS 10 Mar 94).      President Yeltsin also abolished the Information Resources  Administration (IRA), an organization tasked with "rapidly providing  all Russian territories down to the rayon level with information on  events in the country and abroad."  The IRA installed high  technology information systems, which it acquired from Western  companies, in order to transmit news agency reports, official  information from federal authorities, and Foreign Intelligence  Service analytical materials to chiefs of administration at all  levels.  Officials in the Security and Communications ministries  were concerned that Western special services had enlisted the aid of  these companies to install special equipment making it possible for  them to secretly monitor Russian Government communications.  With  the abolishment of the IRA, the system was dismantled and all of the  IRA's functions were transferred to the Federal Government  Communications Agency, alleged to be the former telecommunications  service of the KGB (SEGODNYA, 30 Jul 93; MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, 5  Feb 94; KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 23 Feb 94; IZVESTIYA, 24 Feb 94).      According to General Nikolay Golushko, former director of the  Federal Counterintelligence Service, Yeltsin issued an edict  reorganizing the service on 5 January 1994.  The document detailing  the structure and functions of the reorganized service have remained  classified.  Golushko said that although he recommended that  responsibility for the protection of state secrets be devolved to  the organizations directly concerned with them, his recommend- ation  was apparently not accepted.  Ultimate responsibility continues to  reside with the Counterintelligence Service (IZVESTIYA, 2 Mar 94).      On 11 February, President Yeltsin signed a directive which  invested officials of 38 ministries, state committees and federal  services with the authority to classify information as a "state  secret".  The directive was severely criticized in a long IZVESTIYA  editorial.  IZVESTIYA  was willing to concede the necessity of  giving this authority to defense organizations and organiza- tions  dealing with sensitive technologies, such as the Ministry of Atomic  Power, but questioned why it was needed by the ministries of  agriculture, health, and environmental protection.  Only seven  ministries out of 23 were not given classification authority--the  ministries of justice, labor, the social protection of the  population, cooperation with the CIS states, educa- tion, culture,  and affairs of nationalities and regional policy.  IZVESTIYA said  that, in addition to abuses which could occur with such a widespread  distribution of classification authority, the nation would suffer  enormous financial costs as well.  IZVESTIYA said that it was unable  "to understand the logic of the president's document."  Contrary to  those who have com- plained about the revelations of "state  secrets," IZVESTIYA warned that "by 'closing' and 'making secret'  our scientific research institutes and 'hush-hush' institutions, by  fencing ourselves off from each other with a barrier of departmental  instructions and special sections, we drastically delayed the  development of our own science and technology" (IZVESTIYA, 26 Feb  94).      Similar sentiments were expressed by Viktor Loshak, chief editor  of MOSCOW NEWS, the paper which originally published Mirzayanov's  article in 1992.  "The bureaucratic stratum between the men of power  on one hand and readers and television viewers on the other is  becoming wider and wider." "When such things are happening, secrecy  is paramount.  One wants to avoid public attention, but at the same  time to be in a position to define the dosage and truthfulness of  information and to shape public opinion."  "Secrets must be guarded  closely.  It takes more than just Lubyanka (KGB prison) to do this.  Where are you masters of Glavlit [Main Administration for  Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press]?  A censorship order has  come in" (MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, 20-27 Feb 94).      According to ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova, journalists  are already complaining about infringements of their right to  information in contraven- tion of the law on the press.  The  Judicial Chamber on Information, a new office of the president,  discussed the issue at its first meeting on 17 February.  According  to the Judicial Chamber's president, Professor Anatoliy Vengerov,  the "refusal to supply journalists with information that does not  contain state secrets may be the reason for legal proceedings (ITAR-  TASS, 17 Feb 94).

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1320 GMT on 1 February broadcasts a report by Aleksandr  Ruvinskiy in the studio. He says that many Federation Council  deputies came to Chekhov St. to pay their last respects to actor  Yevgeniy Leonov. As there was no morning session the deputies  had plenty of spare time. They spent the time holding the first  organizational sessions of committees and commissions of the  Federation Council.    Whereas, he says, in the Duma, the Duma Council met and  agreed on who would head the committees, these people were  ratified by overall vote and then each deputy could register in  one committee or another.    On the other hand, here in the Federation Council it was  different. First, the composition of the actual committees was  formed, and then within these committees the deputies themselves  elected their own chairmen. This is because a factional party  principle does not operate in the Federation Council.    There were some surprises, Ruvinskiy continues. Vyacheslav  Zvolinskiy became chairman of the Agrarian Committee. He is  director of the scientific production association Nizhnyaya  Volga in Astrakhan. On this committee are such deputies as  Vasiliy Starodubtsev, [Vyacheslav] Lyubimov from Ryazan, an  active member of the Communist Party, and others. Today, the  first session of the committee was held.    The first session of the Committee for Budget and Finance  was  also held. On this committee, deputies elected Nikolay Gonchar  as their chairman, former chairman of Mossovet. Also on this  committee are such deputies as Yuriy Boldyrev, well-known from  the Congress of USSR People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet.    Ruvinskiy then speaks to Boldyrev. He says that Boldyrev  told him that he considers one of his main tasks as being to do  everything necessary to fight corruption. He thinks a chamber  of accounts should be set up and there should be a law on  responsibility of government members for nonimplementation of  legislation and for inappropriate expenditure.    Ruvinskiy and the announcer discuss the question of  extending  the emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia.</p>

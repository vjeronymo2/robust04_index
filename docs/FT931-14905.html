			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Jones Stroud advances 32% to Pounds 3.29m JONES STROUD (Holdings), the manufacturer of accessories and materials for the textiles and electrical industries, lifted pre-tax profits by 32 per cent from Pounds 2.49m to Pounds 3.29m in the six months to September 30. Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said it was pleasing to report a recovery despite the difficult trading conditions. Turnover grew to Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 31.9m) and trading profits were up at Pounds 3.31m (Pounds 2.72m). This time there were no exceptional charges (Pounds 123,000 for factory closures). Net interest payable was reduced to Pounds 19,000 (Pounds 104,000). Mr Jones said that the recent devaluation of sterling had affected raw material costs 'at a time when increases are difficult to recover'. He added, though, that Jones Stroud should also benefit from the concomitant improved competitiveness in overseas markets. The interim dividend is lifted by 10 per cent to 3.3p, payable from earnings up 34 per cent at 12.32p. Mr Philip and Mr David Jones, managing director, together own 70.05 per cent of the company's equity.</p>

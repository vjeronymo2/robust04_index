			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Kohl cautious in welcome for Berlusconi Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday gave Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, a cautious initial welcome to the inner circle of European heads of government. On the Italian's first official foreign visit since emerging victorious from national and European elections, Mr Berlusconi was accorded full military honours, and promises of continuing close co-operation. But he apparently failed to persuade the chancellor to back his conservative Forza Italia movement in a move to join the European People's party - the Christian Democrat group - in the new European parliament. Instead, he said his party would form its own independent movement for the time being. On the other hand, there was no word of criticism about the presence of members of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) in Mr Berlusconi's government, and Mr Kohl was anxious to express his desire for continuity in their close relations. The two men discussed both the forthcoming summit of the European Union on Corfu, and the Group of Seven world economic summit in Naples. They failed to agree on a common candidate to be the next president of the European Commission, the Italian prime minister indicated later. The official visit gave Mr Berlusconi his first big opportunity to launch a public relations defence of his new government before an inter-national audience, and he roundly denounced any suggestion that 'fascists' were members of it. 'I cannot allow anyone to make a statement so far removed from the truth,' he said. There was 'absolutely nothing undemocratic' about any of his ministers. Yet it is the presence of those MSI members of the National Alliance in the government which has clearly caused concern in Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, as well as the opposition Social Democratic party. The chancellor insists that the question of Forza Italia joining the Christian Democrats in the European parliament does not arise, because they have not applied to do so. There is little secret, however, that a majority of the party would like to, although a minority favours the alternative liberal group. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the two government leaders pledged their determination to continue the 'traditional close co-operation' between their governments, and in particular 'intensively' during the coming German EU presidency.</p>

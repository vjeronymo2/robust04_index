			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Pitchford gift PITCHFORD Hall in Shropshire, arguably the most important half-timbered house in England, has been offered as a gift to the nation. Mr and Mrs Oliver Colthurst, whose family have owned the house since the 15th century, will give the Grade I house and 70 acres of park and garden, currently on the market at Pounds 1.25m, to a heritage body if its important contents can be kept intact. The offer was announced yesterday after a stalemate in negotiations to secure the future of the estate, a victim partly of Lloyd's losses. The National Trust has had a team of 26 experts looking at Pitchford in the last few months and is keen to take responsibility if the Government provides special funds with which to endow the house and purchase its collections. If no decision is reached by August 1, Christie's will sell the contents, valued at Pounds 2m, in September.</p>

But at no time were any threats made  regarding RPT supporters, nor was there any violence used on RPT  supporters anywhere. It is not in the CAR's interest at all to  provoke incidents in electoral constituency where it is poised  to win at least 60 percent of votes in the second round, with  the help of other parties of the democratic opposition.    Second, the CAR was informed that acts of provocation were  going to be committed by RPT militiamen, disguised as supporters  of the democratic opposition, in order to set off repression,  which would frighten away voters in favor of change in electoral  constituencies where the RPT is neck and neck with opposition  candidates. Furthermore, plans reportedly have been hatched to  assassinate some democratic opposition leaders, in order to  decapitate the democratic forces before the second round of  polls.    Third, in his communique, the minister of territorial  administration and security does not give any proof of his  allegations. He rather displays his partiality by designating  the CAR by name, whereas a few days earlier, he declined to  blame a party which was responsible for the serious incidents  which occurred at Agou, although he knows the culprits quite  well.    Do we have to remind the minister of the acts of  intimidation  and corruption exerted on the traditional chiefs of the northern  region, which prevented free expression by the voters of that  region? Is the minister's communique not actually meant to  prepare people's mind for the acts of violence planned by the  RPT?    The CAR launches an urgent appeal to the head of state and  the authorities to assume their responsibilities, to the  International Monitoring Committee to intervene so that military  and civilian observers are deployed as a matter of priority to  the 11 electoral constituencies where the opposition is facing  the RPT.    The CAR once again affirms its irrevocable option for non-  violence and calls on the people to remain vigilant and not to  give in to provocations and intimidations.</p>

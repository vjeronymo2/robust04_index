			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "kum": "Referendum on Maastricht"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt, 14 February -- The Presidium of the  Association of Free Citizens considers the 12 June European  elections to be a "German referendum on the Maastricht Treaty  and the future of the German mark." In a petition dealing with  policy on Europe issued by the party, which was founded recently  by former FDP [Free Democratic Party] politician Brunner, the  Presidium warns of the consequences of the Maastricht Treaty.  "Maastricht, a product of secret cabinet politics, will fail,  because the Germans will not allow themselves to be deprived of  the German mark, because Europe's cultural diversity will not  tolerate a super state, and because liberal democracy inevitably  will be destroyed along with the nation." Europe cannot be  forced into being a community, but should be organized as "an  association of sovereign states." The petition further states  that the Maastricht Treaty will result in central planning  overcoming a market economy in Europe, and a bureaucratic  "redistribution apparatus," largely financed by Germany, which  will come into being and ruin the German economy. To check this  "regulation madness" and "the power of bureaucracy," all  guidelines and directives that extend beyond the single market  should be approved by the national parliaments. The document  does not deal with the European Parliament in Strasbourg.    The presidium calls for the abolition of EU [European Union]  agricultural subsidies, which are a described as a "corrupt  farce." One quarter of agricultural subsidies end up in  "dishonest hands." The destruction of food on a massive scale  must end. The party opposes the "imposition of uniformity" by  European laws and is in favor of minimum standards that will  enable each country to "introduce tougher or the toughest  possible criteria if it so wishes."    The petition expresses support for EU common foreign and  security policies. "While the EU is smothered by bureaucracy  and is in the process of dismantling liberal democracy, it is  still unable to pursue a common foreign policy on really major  issues." The EU was helpless and in disagreement in the face of  the outbreak of war in the Balkans. A common foreign policy  must be based on the right of peoples to self-determination.  "If unanimity cannot be achieved on foreign policy issues,  there should be an obligation to exchange information and  maintain peace," the document states. However, a security  policy that is independent of the United States and NATO runs  counter to German interests. Finally, the party leadership  proposes that the the states of Central Europe become EU members  "as quickly as possible." Political stability and the economic  development of the new democracies in East Europe are the  central element in the Association of Free Citizens policy on  Europe.</p>

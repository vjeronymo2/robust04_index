			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall again STERLING futures again fell sharply yesterday after Sweden raised its marginal interest rate to 75 per cent and the Bundesbank drained the German money market of much more liquidity than had been expected. For the second day running, futures reflected profound uncertainty over the prospects for UK base rates. In recent days, several dealers have said that a rate rise could happen even if the French vote Yes to the Maastricht treaty in their referendum next Sunday. In part, that is because the Bundesbank's intentions on the Lombard rate remain uncertain. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the German central bank's president, tried to soothe markets at the weekend by saying that there could be no rise 'in current circumstances'. Yesterday, however, the Bundesbank drained a huge DM17bn from the banking system, pushing call money up to 9.70 per cent, fractionally below the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent. If call money rises above the Lombard rate, the Bundesbank could be forced to lift interest rates to keep a tighter control on the market. Sweden's massive rate rise has also worried traders because it shows the lengths to which a European country will go to protect its currency from the mighty D-Mark. The Swedish move throws the spotlight on the UK as the one EMS country which has not adjusted rates to support its currency. These fears pushed the December contract down 27 basis points from its previous close yesterday to a low of 89.19. It later recovered fractionally to finish at 89.24. Period rates in the cash market rose in thin trading. Three-month money finished  1/4 percentage point firmer on the offered side at 10 9/16 per cent. In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 67m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent and Pounds 239m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent. The forecast was later revised up to Pounds 900m and the Bank purchased Pounds 11m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 450m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 1.05bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 10m of Band 1 bank bills. Late assistance was Pounds 40m.</p>

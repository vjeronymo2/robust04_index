			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- Investment in the Russian economy  has continued to fall this year. During the first quarter of  the year over 12 trillion rubles, originating from all sources  of finance, was invested. But this was 28 percent less than the  corresponding period last year, ITAR-TASS learned at the Russian  Economics Ministry.    State- and municipally-owned enterprises and organizations  accounted for 59 percent of all investment and 45 percent of  state investment. Last year the equivalent figures were 66 and  53 percent.    About 50 percent of all this investment was spent on  construction of production facilities. During the same period  last year the equivalent figure was 65 percent.    At the majority of the most important projects, financed  from  the federal budget, work is now at a virtual standstill. This  is jeopardizing the fulfillment of this year's program for  commissioning of the most important economic projects. The  Economics Ministry experts say that this situation has been  brought about by delays in financing projects from the budget  and the failure to release preferential credit earmarked for  investment.    The situation with construction projects that are financed  from local budgets or nonbudget sources is very difficult. Work  on most of these has stopped, since subcontractors cannot  continue work if they are not paid for what they do.    The critical state of capital construction has had a  negative  impact on other spheres of the economy. During the first  quarter investment in most sectors averaged about eight-10  percent of the target for the year as a whole.    Foreign investment in the Russian economy remains at a low  level. Such investment totalled more than 180 million dollars in  the first quarter. This sum constitutes the authorized capital  contributed to more than 1,300 joint ventures. However, direct  investment of foreign capital actually injected into these  ventures, including reinvestment and loans, is estimated at  approximately 2.6 billion dollars since the beginning of this  year.</p>

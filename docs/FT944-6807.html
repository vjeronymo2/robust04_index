			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Syndicated loans Margins on international syndicated loans have shrunk to wafer-thin levels. The Bank for International Settlements confirmed as much in its quarterly survey last week. The most credit-worthy companies can currently borrow for as little as 15 points above the London inter-bank offer rate, compared with as much as 50 points just two years ago. That is lower than the level reached during the last cycle. The reason for the keener pricing is an imbalance in supply and demand. Banks, awash with capital following improved financial results and a decline in bad debts, have been anxious to build their loan portfolios. But the corporate sector, busy paying down debt, has not had much appetite for borrowing. Competition between banks has forced margins down. For companies, raising money through syndicated loans is doubly attractive, given the high yields they currently pay for issuing bonds. Cut-throat competition is worrying, however. With spreads so narrow, few banks are making money. Moreover, in their efforts to win business, they have competed by loosening covenant terms. That could store up trouble during the next economic downturn. One might think banks would walk away from such unprofitable business. The snag is that many see syndicated loans as loss leaders, on the back of which they can sell corporations more profitable products such as derivatives. There is therefore little chance of a pick-up in margins. In fact, with Japanese banks expected to rush to make loans by the end of their financial year in March, a further squeeze is likely.</p>

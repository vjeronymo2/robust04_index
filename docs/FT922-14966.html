			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (2): Momentum is key question - The Development Corporation The Milton Keynes Development Corporation has been the driving force behind the establishment of the city. But the corporation has been wound up since March 31, so where does Milton Keynes go from here? In the early days - the corporation was set up in 1967 - the MKDC's activities were all-embracing. It bought up all the land which was not being used, about 18,000 acres. It serviced the land, putting in primary infrastructure such as sewerage and water. It built roads on a grid pattern and a parallel system of walkways and cycle paths, known as Redways. It constructed houses, factories, offices and shops. It built parks, social centres and sports facilities. In all, it is estimated 13m trees, plants and shrubs have been planted throughout Milton Keynes. Private developers became interested as commercial rates of return were achievable on speculative building of offices and houses and the development corporation latterly became more of a catalyst Not only did the MKDC have government money at its disposal, it also had planning rights. Land was sold on to developers. Offices were disposed of to tenants where possible and shops and other commercial amenities to institutions. Postel, a trade union pension fund, bought the half mile-long covered shopping centre in central Milton Keynes, for example. Mr Frank Henshaw, general manager of the corporation before it was wound up, estimates that about Pounds 1bn of government money at historic cost has been pumped into Milton Keynes over the the 25 years of the corporation's life. This money came in the form of loans from the government. Virtually all of the Pounds 1bn has been paid back from the proceeds of asset sales. Mr Henshaw estimates that if certain deals on land go through, then the money paid to the government will exceed Pounds 1bn. The figures are not strictly comparable since the outlay is at historic cost and certain loans were written off in the mid-eighties. Receipts are more recent and in some cases at current cost. However, by the end of the century, total private and public sector investment could exceed Pounds 5bn. This is because although the development corporation has been wrapped up it is handing on considerable assets. To date it is estimated that private sector investment in Milton Keynes has been about Pounds 2bn at historic cost. The key question is whether the momentum will continue after the recession and without the development corporation to act as handmaiden to developers and businesses. Mr Henshaw has no doubt that Milton Keynes will be developed further along the lines already established He says: 'If you had asked me two years ago whether the outstanding land would be developed in the same way as the rest of Milton Keynes, I would have had my doubts. At that stage the local authorities had different ideas to us about the way forward. 'Since then, we have serviced all the outstanding land and gained planning consents for much of it. There is a tremendous commitment among the local authorities and the business community that Milton Keynes should continue to grow.' The main commercial assets which the corporation is passing on are being taken over by the Commission for New Towns (CNT). This is the government agency charged with realising the outstanding assets of all the new towns: there were 21 new towns in Britain excluding those in Scotland. Milton Keynes is the last of the new towns to be wound up. The CNT estimates that over the years the government invested some Pounds 4bn, at historic cost, in the new towns. It is a measure of the size of Milton Keynes development that about one quarter of these funds has gone into this single new town. The outstanding assets are also on a grander scale than those of the other new towns. There is relatively little built property to be disposed of, either let or sold - about 500,000 sq ft of offices and factories. But there is 2,000 acres of land which is serviced and has specific planning consents. There is a further 1,500 acres which is serviced but does not have planning agreements as yet. This land, with the right mix of housing, offices and factories, could accommodate another 50,000 people. Sir Neil Shields, chairman of the CNT, is sure that Milton Keynes will continue to grow once the recession is over. He says: 'The development corporation has done a terrific job in developing Milton Keynes, especially when you consider they were not able to offer grants or other incentives. But there comes a time when a new town ceases to be a new town and achieves a critical mass. 'You need government money to prime the pump at first, put the roads in and so on. Developers generally won't do that. But then the private sector takes over. The Milton Keynes Development Corporation has done such a good job it has put itself out of a job.' But Sir Neil says the government has accepted that there is still a lot that could be done. 'There is an awful lot of land still left,' he says. 'There is ample scope for the population to grow to 200,000 by the end of the century. The factors which made Milton Keynes attractive still exist. Its position between London and Birmingham and on the M1 is excellent. Housing is still cheap, relatively speaking, and more houses will be built. It is a question of waiting for this recession to end.' The CNT has been given a specific brief for Milton Keynes. It will not just be trying to realise the assets by disposing of them at the best market price but actively developing the land in line with the master plan. It is being given special funds for promotion which are being ring fenced. These run to several million pounds a year, according to Sir Neil, and are in addition to the money being spent by MK Marketing, the development agency established to succeed the development corporation. MK Marketing and the CNT are hoping to pick up where the corporation left off. The CNT, unlike the corporation, will not have planning powers. These go to the borough council. But since much of the land already has planning consents, this hardly matters.</p>

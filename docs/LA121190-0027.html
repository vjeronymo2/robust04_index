			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BISHOP BROM URGES CONGRESS TO AVOID WAR WITH IRAQ  </P> <P> Bishop Robert H. Brom, leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, urged  Congress on Monday to avoid using military force against Iraq, saying the  United States must "seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis and pursue  legitimate objectives by nonviolent diplomatic means."  </P> <P> In a prepared statement read during a rally at the University of San Diego,  Brom condemned Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, but stressed that the invaded  country's biggest hope for peaceful liberation is through internationally  applied sanctions.  </P> <P> He also said that any actions taken against Iraq should not deprive civilians  of food and medicine.  </P> <P> Brom's statements, read by diocese spokeswoman Jeanne Ertle, were based on ones  made during last month's national meeting of bishops in Washington. The  National Council of Catholic Bishops became one of the first major U.S.  organizations to challenge the Bush Administration's policy in the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> Brom was not able to attend the rally because of the short notice, Ertle said.  </P> <P> Monday's rally drew more than 150 students, who gathered in front of Hahn  University Center in bright sunlight to listen to speakers talk about the gulf  crisis. Student volunteers collected signatures for a petition as part of a  statewide effort on university campuses to urge Congress and Bush to avoid war  with Iraq.  </P> <P> The signatures will be combined with those from similar rallies at UC San  Diego, San Diego State University and Grossmont College, and will be presented  to local members of Congress by New Year's, said rally organizer Robert  Simmons, who teaches law at USD.  </P> <P> "If war comes," Simmons said during the rally, "and the body bags start coming  home, you and I will never forgive ourselves for the rest of our lives unless  we do everything in our power now to prevent this war from occurring."  </P> <P> Student speaker Anna Barhum warned that the United States should look at future  relationships with countries in the Middle East rather than exploiting them for  their natural resources. She said there are many options in the Persian Gulf  crisis that have not been fully explored, such as letting the countries  involved work out a solution for themselves.  </P> <P> "We have to decide on our foreign policies and what image we want to present,"  she said. "We are perceived as being the bully. Saddam Hussein is seen as a  hero just for standing up to us."  </P> <P> Vietnam veteran Terry Hertzler warned students that, if there is a war, chances  are they will be fighting it.  </P> <P> "War is sometimes inevitable," he said, "but I think it has to be the absolute,  final option we can choose, because of what it does to all of us. . . . Wars  aren't pretty."  </P> <P> Hertzler visits college campuses each semester to teach students about the  Vietnam War. He said today's students in some ways are more sophisticated than  he was at age 18, but in other ways are much more naive.  </P> <P> "To many students, the Vietnam War may as well be the Crimean War," he said.  "It's ancient history in many ways. The students are very interested, but  there's not a lot of knowledge out there. "  </P></p>

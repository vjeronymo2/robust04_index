			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE;  </P> <P> JONES PITCHES 2-HITTER TO SPARK TUSTIN  </P> <P> Tustin High School got by with the expected and unexpected Wednesday in its Sea  View League baseball game against Estancia.  </P> <P> The expected came in the form of pitcher Monte Jones and his overpowering  fastball, which made a 1-0 lead stand up at Tustin.  </P> <P> A two-hit shutout, nine strikeouts, only four balls hit out of the infield --  just another day on the mound for Jones (4-0).  </P> <P> "Monte usually has more strikeouts," Coach Vince Brown said. "We actually had  to field the ball a little more behind him today."  </P> <P> Which is where the unexpected came in.  </P> <P> The Tillers (7-5 overall, 2-0 in league play) have been anything but exemplary  fielders. Already this season the Tillers' infield has made 16 errors,  including five in one game against Santa Ana.  </P> <P> But on Wednesday, the infielders made big plays whenever Jones allowed runners  on base.  </P> <P> With one out in the third inning, Estancia's Jason White drew one of the five  walks allowed by Jones. But the rally never got going.  </P> <P> First, Tustin third baseman Brian Gill chased a foul pop fly half way down the  left-field line, making an over-the-shoulder catch. Second baseman Chuck Var  then made a diving stop on a ground ball to end the inning.  </P> <P> With one out in the fifth, the Eagles (7-5, 0-2) put two runners on base via  walks. But again, the Tillers' infield bailed Jones out as Var started an  inning-ending double play.  </P> <P> "Early in the season, we were working a lot on hitting and our fielding kind of  sagged," Brown said. "The last couple of weeks we've been putting in a little  extra time on the fielding."  </P> <P> Tustin certainly had a better time in the field than the Eagles, who committed  two costly errors in the second.  </P> <P> After Eric Grove doubled with one out, Var hit a routine ground ball to  shortstop White, who bobbled it to put runners on first and third. Ted  Wieczorek then hit a chopper that went through the legs of third baseman Gary  Burrows, scoring Grove.  </P> <P> In other Sea View League games:  </P> <P> Corona del Mar 3, Newport Harbor 2 -- Reese Thorkelson's base-loaded single  scored the winning run with one out in the bottom of the seventh for Corona del  Mar (5-6, 2-0).  </P> <P> Saddleback 4, University 3 -- George Canhem singled home Sean Simon with no  outs in the top of the seventh for Saddleback (6-6, 2-0).  </P></p>

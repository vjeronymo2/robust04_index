More than 300 students in Kwangju in their anti-U.S. protest  in front of the "American Centre", charged that the United  States was whipping up the atmosphere of war on the Korean  peninsula, increasing pressure on the North over the "nuclear  issue".    They strongly demanded that the United States stop  pressuring  the North for nuclear inspection and the "Team Spirit" joint  military exercises.    The protesters threw a hundred bottles of paint and rocks at  the "American Centre" in the fierce demonstration.    On the same day about fifty students rushed to the "American  Centre" in Taegu and staged a surprise anti-U.S. demonstration  shouting "we oppose the United States increasing tensions on the  Korean peninsula" and pelting scores of paint cans at the  building.</p>

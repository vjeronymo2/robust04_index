			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE KILLED, FOUR HURT WHEN BOAT HITS GAS LINE, EXPLODES  </P> <P> A 160-foot fishing boat hit a gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico and exploded  Tuesday night, killing three people and injuring at least four, the Coast Guard  said. At least seven people were missing.  </P> <P> "It was just a boom and a big ball of fire went up into the air about 300  feet," said Allen Willett, a private helicopter pilot who ferries drilling  crews to offshore rigs.  </P> <P> "We got three life rafts in the water and I hovered low over the water,"  Willett said. "My mechanic jumped in. . . . He got the one in the most  distress, got him inside the life raft. The other two made it on their own."  </P> <P> Fourteen people were aboard the Northumberland when the boat hit the pipeline  about a half-mile offshore, said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Don Merwin.  </P> <P> Two Coast Guard boats and helicopters and private planes and watercraft were  helping in the search.  </P> <P> One of the injured was in critical condition with severe burns over most of his  body.  </P></p>

Valeriy Kuznetsov, Meshkov's military adviser, told  ITAR-TASS  on Wednesday that consultations are now underway with a top  military commander from the Odessa military district to iron out  disagreements and work out a compromise.    The most probable solution would be to leave half of 3,400  draftees in the Crimea and send 20 per cent (about 680 people)  to the Ukrainian Army and 1,000 (about 30 per cent) to the Black  Sea Fleet, he said.    Kuznetsov said the other half will be sent to adjacent  Ukrainian regions for military training since the Crimea does  not have enough training facilities and expressed the hope that  30 to 40 per cent of them will return to the Republic upon the  completion of studying.    Speaking about the autumn drafting campaign, Kuznetsov said  that "we hope all prerequisites and conditions will be created  for military service in the Crimea."</p>

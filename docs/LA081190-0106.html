			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDBERG BEATS CHANG, PASSES LENDL FOR NO. 1 RANKING  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg defeated Michael Chang on Friday -- and with the victory earned  the No. 1 ranking in the world.  </P> <P> Edberg defeated Chang, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, to move to the semifinals of the  $1.3-million ATP championship at Mason, Ohio. The victory also moved Edberg  past Ivan Lendl for the top spot in the ATP computer rankings.  </P> <P> "Not everyone is going to be No. 1 in the rankings," Edberg, 24, said. "You  need to play good tennis. I've done that this year. (Being No.1) is something  that I've wanted to do. The last couple of years I thought I had a chance. Now  I've done it."  </P> <P> Edberg, the Wimbledon champion, passed Lendl to become the eighth No. 1 since  the computer ratings began in 1973. Lendl, who didn't play in the tournament,  has been No. 1 for most of the last seven years, except for a brief period when  another Swede, Mats Wilander, was on top.  </P> <P> Edberg said that he was aware that he could take over the top spot this week.  He also said that he was aware of what came with it.  </P> <P> "Life is still going to go on," he said. "I will try to stay up there as long  as I can. My main goal now is to play well at the (U.S.) Open."  </P> <P> Edberg said he would celebrate by taking a four-day vacation next week. His  only commitment before the U.S. Open, Aug. 27-Sept. 9 at Flushing Meadow, N.Y.,  is an exhibition the week before the final Grand Slam event.  </P> <P> His quarterfinal victory over the Chang wasn't easy, though. Chang had to fight  to hold serve to start the third set, then built a 3-1 lead before Edberg won  the next four games to take command.  </P> <P> In today's semifinals, Edberg will meet Andres Gomez, who is ranked fifth in  the world. Gomez defeated Jim Courier, 6-1, 6-4, in another quarterfinal.  </P> <P> Defending champion Brad Gilbert held off Jakob Hlasek, 2-6, 6-1, 7-5, to earn a  spot in the semifinals against Scott Davis. The unseeded Davis held off  15th-seeded Richard Fromberg, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10-8).  </P> <P> Sixth-seeded Susan Sloane upset fourth-seeded Dinky Van Rensburg of South  Africa, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, to move into the semifinals of a $150,000 women's  tournament at Albuquerque, N.M.  </P> <P> Sloane will be joined by second-seeded Laura Gildemeister of Peru, who  rebounded from an 0-6 loss in the first set to beat Anne Minter of Australia,  0-6, 6-3, 6-2. Third-seeded Anne Smith beat South Africa's Amanda Coetzer, 6-2,  6-1.  </P> <P> The Raleigh Edge advanced to the championship match of Team-Tennis with a 27-16  victory over the Miami Beach Breakers in the Eastern Division finals at  Raleigh, N.C. Raleigh will play the Los Angeles Strings for the title Sunday  night at the Forum.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAMBODIA ASKS SIHANOUK BACK  </P> <P> Cambodian Premier Hun Sen invited resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk to  return to his homeland as head of state in a dramatic bid today to end  Cambodia's civil war.  </P> <P> "There has been quite a lot of progress," said Hun Sen after five hours of new  peace talks with his longtime rival. "We asked Prince Sihanouk to return home  as the head of state and chairman of a supreme council to organize elections."  </P> <P> Sihanouk, head of a U.N.-recognized coalition of three rebel groups, said his  answer will depend on further unspecified changes in Cambodia's constitution  and whether Vietnam withdraws its 70,000 troops by Sept. 30, as promised.  </P></p>

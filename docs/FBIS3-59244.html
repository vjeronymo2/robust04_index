No, in his State of the  Union Address Bill Clinton could not and did not want that  impression to be created. Yet, if one analyzes Clinton's  report, then one finds that it contains ample proof that  American society today is not healthy, and cannot be healthy,  because of the omissions of Clinton's predecessor. Clinton had  to try to strike this peculiar rhetorical balance to make clear  the urgent nature of the issues that most concern him.    There are 58 million Americans who lack sufficient  protection  against illness -- this figure that Clinton gave must also come  as a surprise to statisticians, because until now it was said  that only 37 million citizens lack insurance. State expenditure  on welfare has been badly structured and it imposes an  exceptional burden on the public purse. Clinton's actual words  were: "If we allow our health care system to operate in the  same way as before, Americans will receive less assistance, have  fewer opportunities to choose their doctors, and have to pay  higher bills." The president sees this as being the point of  departure for his next reforms. His plans for 1994 are even  more ambitious than those for his first year in office. Clinton  himself said what had only been said by his critics so far: "We  must tackle both things at the same time" -- that is, institute  health care and welfare reforms at the same time. In 1993 too,  he addressed many issues at the same time.    Bill Clinton is taking advantage of a favorable situation.  In his first two years in office, he succeeded in settling two  extremely difficult trade policy problems at the same time --  NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] and the GATT  negotiations -- because despite opposition from within his own  political camp, he practically decided on reducing the budget  and increasing taxes at the same time and believes that he can  overcome the institutional weaknesses of the presidency  vis-a-vis Congress in the future too. He is burdening his  government and congressmen with a mammoth program and has  praised them for their work in the previous year, when he could  have laws passed without using the presidential veto. If there  were presidential elections now and not until 1996, Clinton  would have a good opportunity to win once again. Despite the  reports of affairs that have surfaced recently, the respect that  he enjoys among people is at its highest point since he took  office a year ago. Acting in a politically wise way, the  president has attributed positive economic trends to himself:  the lowest interest rates for 20 years as well as the lowest  inflation rate for two decades (that is wrong, they were lower  under Reagan in 1986) and an opportunity for Americans to get  rid of high mortgage burdens of the past by means of debt  rescheduling and lower interest rates.    The president is proceeding in the right direction in one  respect: his free market orientation. Despite the social  democratic direction of his economic policies, he is placing an  astonishing amount of store on market forces -- even by the  health reform, which the market is to complete with its own laws  once it has been prompted by the government.</p>

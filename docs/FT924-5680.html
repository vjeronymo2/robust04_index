			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers face some tough talking in Vienna - Output cuts are necessary if a quickening price slide is to be averted MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries face some tough talking when they meet later today in Vienna. Tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran is expected to dominate the meeting where ministers must agree to cut oil production levels for the first quarter of next year if they are to stop a price slide. The organisation will also hear complaints from some smaller members that membership fees are too high and Ecuador is likely to make moves to leave its ranks. 'Ministers realise that a crisis is beginning to brew for Opec which is causing a lot of heart-searching,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry expert at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. World oil prices have already slipped as the market has become nervous at the posturing by rival delegations in advance of the meeting. North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery in January was steady yesterday at Dollars 19.07 1/2 a barrel after losing 30 cents a barrel on Monday. Growing political animosity between Saudi Arabia and Iran could make compromise on oil output difficult to reach. Iran is challenging Saudi Arabia's leadership of Opec by its efforts to boost production capacity and secure a bigger share of the market. Tehran is investing Dollars 14bn to increase its oil capacity to 4.5m barrels a day by next March. Rather than cutting its output under the terms of Opec's last agreement in September, the republic has been demonstrating its peak production capacity, which it says is 4m b/d. In September, Opec countries agreed to rein in production to 24.2m b/d, with a special allowance for Kuwait. However, most Opec nations paid only lip service to the deal and independent estimates put present Opec output at between 25m and 25.3m b/d. As a consequence of the higher output, along with fears that sanctions against Iraq may be lifted by the new US administration, allowing Baghdad to return to the oil export market, oil prices have dropped by almost Dollars 2 a barrel since October. Nevertheless, the producers' club remains sanguine about the prospects for demand in the first quarter and its economists are forecasting a call on Opec oil of 25m b/d during the first three months. Opec estimates overall demand at 25.7m to 25.9m b/d with the rest coming from producer stocks. Mr Ken Miller at Purvin and Gertz, the oil analysis group in Houston, Texas, agrees with these forecasts, but puts the stock drawdown at about 1m b/d. 'The market is not awash with oil, the fundamentals do not support a Dollars 2 drop in price since October,' he said. Mr Miller believes the market is reacting to Opec's lack of discipline in enforcing production cuts as well as perceived disarray in the producers' club. For this reason traders need a clear message that producers will cut production if prices are not to slide further. 'The mood in the market is very bearish - if there is no agreement, prices could slide Dollars 1 to Dollars 1.50 a barrel,' said Mr Mohammed Adbeljabbar, economist at Petroleum Finance Company in Washington. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister is expected to resist calls to trim the kingdom's output. He is likely to clash with Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister, who has in the past called for deeper production cuts in order to boost prices. The power struggle between the two is not just based on short-term production cuts, but centres on the philosophy of the organisation and the future basis for determining oil output allocations. Since the Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has called for member nations' production levels to be more closely based on capacity. This would chiefly benefit the kingdom which has increased its oil output by 3m b/d in the past couple of years. Iran, on the other hand, has pushed for the reinstatement of historical production quotas while at the same time, boosting its own capacity. These arguments will come to a head when Iraq returns to the market and other members will have to cut back deeply to accommodate it. But these issues are unlikely to be resolved until the sense of crisis is more urgent than it is now. This week's meeting could hedge a compromise by agreeing a cut of say 500,000 b/d from current production. This would involve a small cut for most producers but a rise in September's ceiling. There is likely to be much wrangling about how the cuts are shared out and it is doubtful whether a cut of this amount would do much to boost prices.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: A VOTE FOR LETTING THE SACRAMENTO SHOW BEGIN  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council doesn't want to show telecasts of state  legislative sessions on the city's public affairs channel.  </P> <P> The Assembly has offered to let the city pick up its sessions for free. So far,  the city has said no. As a news junkie, I was enraged. I demanded an  explanation. Nobody would talk on the record. But one city official said, "Why  should we put on their show when we have our show?"  </P> <P> He was speaking of the telecasts of Los Angeles council meetings. In other  words, the Los Angeles City Council is afraid of competition.  </P> <P> I protested that the City Council has a duty to show legislative sessions. None  of the Los Angeles television stations cover Sacramento unless there's a  terrible crisis. People here never see their state legislators in action.  </P> <P> The City Hall official was unmoved. I suggested a plan: Have the Sacramento  gang put together a highlights tape of "Great Moments in the Legislature." It  would be like a National Football League highlights film. If you enjoy the  tape, pick up the sessions. He shook his head and walked away. I interpreted  this as permission to go ahead.  </P> <P> I advise state legislators to begin their highlights tape with the  Legislature's great fights.  </P> <P> One would be the 1 a.m. Peace vs. Ferguson scuffle in a corridor in the Capitol  last week. According to witnesses, Democratic Assemblyman Steve Peace of Rancho  San Diego slapped Republican Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach. The  older but trickier Ferguson slipped the slap. It merely glanced off his  shoulder.  </P> <P> Then we'd go into the archives and pick up the most famous fight, the 1974  battle of the century between former Assemblymen Lou Pappan, who used to be in  the FBI, and Kenny Meade, an ex-UC Berkeley football player. Meade was KOd, his  head cut and his eye blackened.  </P> <P> Of course, the star of "Great Moments" would be Assembly Speaker Willie Brown  of San Francisco. We'd see him at the rostrum, elegant in one of his many  beautifully cut suits, making even the best dressed of his 79 colleagues look a  bit dowdy. Democrats approach him with respect and fear, happy for a few small  words from the Godfatherly boss. Republicans sit nervously at their desks,  waiting for the next time he tries to slip something by them.  </P> <P> "Great Moments" will show how he almost did, late last Friday night. A  Republican rookie, the lowest form of life in Brown's world, presented his  first bill. Brimming with good intentions, Jeff Marston of San Diego asked for  an aye vote on legislation raising the fines for illegally parking in  handicapped zones.  </P> <P> From somewhere in his expensive suit, Brown pulled an opinion from the  legislative legal office saying that Marston's bill violated a procedural rule.  Marston is being challenged in November by a Democrat Brown likes, and the  Speaker didn't want to build up the Republican.  </P> <P> When the other Republicans figured out what was happening, they rallied to  Marston's side. They refused to vote for one of the Speaker's bills, denying  him the two-thirds majority he needed for its passage. Six hours later, Brown  surrendered.  </P> <P> That brings up the final highlights segment, humiliation. The Marston episode  was humiliating for all concerned. But for real humiliation, we return to the  archives, to the days of the late Speaker Jess Unruh in the 1960s. He knew how  to humiliate.  </P> <P> We'll show his revenge upon a Republican from South Gate, Floyd Wakefield.  Wakefield had crossed Unruh. During a Capitol remodeling, the Speaker gave him  a temporary office. The office also happened to be the men's toilet. When  colleagues used the urinals, they walked past Wakefield, whose desk was in a  small entry alcove. He could hear the flushes, and presumably worse, from his  desk.  </P> <P> It's understandable that the council would be afraid of such telegenic  competition. The highlight of a council week is often ceremonial Friday, when  restaurant owners, family friends, campaign contributors, city retirees, Little  League baseball teams and foreign visitors are given hand-lettered  proclamations and honored with long speeches. The only excitement is watching  council members get mad when Gloria Molina lectures them. Instead of Willie  Brown's suits, the council has Marvin Braude's plaid sport coats and polyester  blazers.  </P> <P> That won't sell in the era of the Simpsons.  </P> <P> Still, the City Council members ought to allow the Sacramento show on their  station. Given the attitude of local television news directors, it is the only  way Los Angeles viewers will ever see their state lawmakers at work. Whenever  news directors here are asked why they don't cover Sacramento, they insist no  viewers are interested.  </P> <P> I doubt that. At any rate, excitement -- and ratings -- shouldn't be standards  for scheduling public television. Let the show begin.  </P></p>

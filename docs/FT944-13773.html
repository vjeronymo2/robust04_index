			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Guardian Media shows 45% advance to Pounds 16.7m The Guardian Media group, publishers of The Guardian, The Observer and the Manchester Evening News, yesterday announced a 45 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits. The increase for the six months to October 1 - from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 16.7m - exceeded pre-tax profits for the last full year. Turnover was up from Pounds 122m to Pounds 143m. Mr Harry Roche, chairman and chief executive of the Guardian Media Group, conceded that the results reflected the decision to take the full costs of redundancy and integration of The Observer purchase in last year's figures. All the company's operations - including broadcasting, publishing and local newspapers - were showing strong growth. 'We are very happy to have maintained the sale of our national newspapers without having to resort to cover price reductions,' said Mr Roche. 'But we take a cautious view of the future, given the costs of competing in the market and the projected increases in newsprint costs,' he added. In the six months to September, The Guardian averaged daily sales of 398,566. This was a drop of 1.5 per cent, but sales bounced back in September and rose to 410,886, representing an increase of some 8.39 per cent. The Observer's circulation averaged 487,800 for the six months, representing a drop of 1.88 per cent. Mr Roche said yesterday the group's balance sheet remained 'exceptionally strong'. Further acquisitions were likely as opportunities arose.</p>

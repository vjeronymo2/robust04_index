			<p>BFN     [Text] On 15 April President Zhelev received Klaus Kinkel,  German vice chancellor and minister of foreign affairs.  Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president, describes the  character of the meeting:    [Begin Stoyanov recording] President Zhelev again stated  that integration into European structures is a basic priority of  Bulgarian foreign policy. He expressed the hope that Germany  will facilitate the ratification of the agreement on Bulgaria's  associated membership in the European Union.    Klaus Kinkel said that the ratification will probably take  place before the elections. In addition he said he would do  what he could to help increase German investments in Bulgaria.  He pointed out, however, that this also depends on Bulgaria.  We must become a more attractive country.    President Zhelev again stressed the losses Bulgaria is  suffering from the Yugoslav embargo and pointed out that not  only economic operations that have been affected, as the road to  the West has been closed. Despite the fact that there are no  military actions on Bulgarian territory, we are considered a  risky state merely because we are located in the Balkans. This  is something from which we will perhaps suffer even in the next  few years. [end recording]</p>

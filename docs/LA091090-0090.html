			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> CHILDREN OF BALI AT SUNSET CANYON CENTER  </P> <P> With flowing arm movements but with hands stretched rigid, fingers quivering,  the Children of Bali made a ceremonial entrance down the middle of the sold-out  audience seating area at the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center on Friday.  </P> <P> The troupe, made up of dancers age 10-15, appeared dressed in simmering greens,  golds and oranges, wearing golden aprons, peaked helmets or headdresses crowned  with flowers.  </P> <P> With eyes staring wide open or darting from side to side or lowered modestly,  the dancers executed quick shifts between acute-angle poses, their neck  movements gracefully transporting the head from side to side to signal the end  of a dance phrase.  </P> <P> The program opened with a slow, graceful Rejang for six girls, and ended with a  episode from the dance drama "Legong Keraton," in which the Prince of Lasem is  threatened by the Bird of Ill Omen for attempting to seduce the Princess  Langkesari.  </P> <P> In between, two boys' solos exhibited a range of virtuosic purpose. In "Kebyar  Duduk," 13-year-old Ida Bagus Putra Kenaka Wedana executed quicksilver moves  and freezes, including a series of squatting turns. In "Baris Tunggal,"  12-year-old I Made Bagus Basuki Mahardika showed a young warrior exercising  feints and attacks as preparation for battle.  </P> <P> After the Children of Bali, audience members moved to the upper meadow to watch  Larry Reed offer an heroic and humorous shadow play in Balinese and English  involving characters from the "Mahabharata." Simultaneously, in the lower  theater, the Uwanuda Kagura troupe from Japan was scheduled to offer a repeat  of the previously reviewed "Yamata-no-oro-chi."CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that  terrorism cannot be judged on a human rights level and that  Turkey categorically opposes the proposal to send a CSCE  delegation to Turkey. Cetin replied to questions by Turkish  reporters in Strasbourg, where he is attending the Council of  Europe Committee of Ministers meeting.    Answering a question, Cetin warned that assessing the  question of terrorism in Turkey from a human rights viewpoint  creates the impression that terrorism is being supported.  Sending a CSCE observer delegation to Turkey is definitely  unacceptable, Cetin stressed.    In reply to a question on recent developments in northern  Iraq, the foreign minister recalled that the region is part of  Iraq and stated that it is out of the question for Turkey to  mediate between clashing Kurdish groups.</p>

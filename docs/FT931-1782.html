			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Foreign bidders seek phone deal TWO OVERSEAS companies are among the four shortlisted to take over the telecommunications system linking government offices across Britain when it is privatised this year. OTC Australia, the international arm of Australia's state-owned telecommunications carrier, and Sprint, which is the third-largest long-distance carrier in the US, are bidding against British Telecom and Mercury for the three-year contract. The contract, worth about Pounds 11m a year, is to operate the 13 switch centres and subsidiary centres linking about 250,000 officials in 1,000 government office locations. The Government Telecommunications Network, with assets of about Pounds 10m, handles more than 66m calls a year. It is served by the Government Centre for Information Systems, an in-house concern. The long-distance part of its business is being privatised under the government's market-testing policy. Although the trunk lines linking the locations are leased from BT or Mercury, the foreign suppliers see the contract as an opportunity to establish a presence in the UK telecommunications market, and a vantage point from which to exploit the European market, which is gradually being liberalised. OTC Australia is also applying to the Department of Trade and Industry for an international simple resale licence, under a competition regime for international calls established at the end of last year. The licence would enable OTC to lease international circuits and resell services. If OTC gains the licence it is likely to seek to undercut BT tariffs for calls to Australia. OTC's goal is to build Pounds 1bn of business outside Australia in the next five years. In the past two years it has lost a tenth of its domestic business in the newly liberalised Australian market to carriers including BT and Cable and Wireless, which owns Mercury. Sprint, which is similarly anxious to break into the European market, has applications pending with the DTI for licenses to provide local, trunk and international services on its own network.</p>

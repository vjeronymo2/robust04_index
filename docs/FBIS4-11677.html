			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The first political commentary of today is in  connection with the outcome of the investigation into the cause  of the crash of an Iranian C-130 plane in Nagorno-Karabakh.  With the issuing of a statement by our country's Foreign  Ministry, which highlights the direct role of the Armenian  Government in shooting down the Iranian transport plane over  Karabakh, public opinion has become more sensitive about the  incident.    The cause of the incident, which resulted in the death of  several Iranian diplomats and their families, was scrutinized by  a special investigative team, comprising Iranian Foreign  Ministry and Air Force experts. Finally, in light of bona fide  proof and undeniable evidence, Armenia's responsibility in the  incident was ascertained.    For some time now the Government of Armenia has fanned the  flames of the Karabakh dispute and, by trampling on the  independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of  Azerbaijan, has violated that country's sovereignty. Despite  ostensible support for Iran's peace-seeking and mediation moves,  it has, in practice, rendered all efforts at mediation  fruitless. Therefore, the shooting down of the Iranian  transport plane would naturally result in Iran's doubting  Armenia's goodwill and intentions.    Although the Government of Armenia has so far not clearly  admitted its responsibility for the shooting down of the Iranian  C-130 plane, the existing proof and evidence have shed  sufficient light on the matter. Therefore, it is necessary for  the Armenian Government to take steps, as soon as possible, to  bring to trial and punish the perpetrators of this crime. Also,  the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right to follow up the  crime and claim damages for the families of the victims.    Undoubtedly Armenia should be aware of the importance of its  relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and not be  influenced by foreign suggestions and mar and destabilize its  relations with Iran any further. That would be of no benefit to  that country. Rebuilding those ties, which have been maintained  under the most difficult conditions, would necessitate a great  deal of effort on Armenia's part.</p>

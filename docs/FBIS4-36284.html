			<p>BFN     [Text] The news agencies yesterday evening circulated the  statement of the minister of foreign affairs of the ruling  military regime in Sanaa, Muhammad Salim Basindwah, in which he  announced that his government will commit itself to the  cease-fire with effect from midnight yesterday. The Democratic  Republic of Yemen [DRY], which for its part announced its full  commitment to the UN Security Council resolution which was  issued last Wednesday [1 June], is also ready to satisfy [words  indistinct]. As for the ruling military regime in Sanaa, it  issued this announcement as a new lie and a political maneuver,  the target of which is to hypnotize the world community and to  absorb the Arab and world's anger for its defiance of the UN  Security Council resolution and all the Arab and international  efforts, the last of which was the American warning and the  Egyptian communique.    Since midnight last night the ruling military regime in  Sanaa  has ordered its forces to launch a total and wide-scale attack  on all fronts. In other words, it considered the time fixed as  a cease-fire deadline, which deluded the public opinion, as a  zero hour for the wild, total, and hostile attacks against our  people in the DRY. Thus, this adventurous military regime  continues its flagrant defiance of the world community and at  the same time releases news to the outside world about its  acceptance of the cease-fire.    The DRY, which was and is still ready for an immediate  cease-fire since the UN Security Council's resolution was issued  last Wednesday, finds itself compelled to defend itself in front  of a brutal enemy who has been waging this criminal war for 44  days running, amid local, Arab and international objections and  on the debris of the skulls of thousands of the sons of our  people as well as the destruction of cities, villages, and vital  economic installations.</p>

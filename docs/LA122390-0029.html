			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MR. NEWMAN  </P> <P> Regarding Kenneth Turan's commentary on Paul Newman (Calendar, Dec. 2): For all  I know, Paul Newman might be fantastic in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." I haven't seen  that film.  </P> <P> In his autobiography, "An Open Book," John Huston relates how he first offered  one of the leads in "The Man Who Would Be King" to Newman. Newman thought that  the leads should be played by two Englishmen, and recommended Michael Caine and  Sean Connery for the parts.  </P> <P> I guess in this case Newman did not think that it would be wise to stretch  himself for that role. If Newman had enough integrity to remove himself from a  good role because he believed that there was someone else more appropriate for  the part, then your critic has the right to legitimately raise the issue as to  Newman's casting in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge," whether or not we agree with his  conclusion.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, he has the right and duty to raise that issue at any time,  concerning any actor and any film. If he doesn't, he is depriving the reader of  his thoughts. Yes, freedom of expression also applies to critics.  </P> <P> LOUIS WEISS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Long road to an Emu MAASTRICHT represented the end of the beginning in the European Community's progress towards economic and monetary union. The heads of government of the European Community there agreed on an apparently final deadline of 1999. But, as perusal of yesterday's speech by the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, makes clear, much that will determine Emu's workings and much that will prove politically challenging remain obscure. Emu raises many questions, some technical; but the most important are political. As the governor stresses, the Emu now agreed has become feasible only because of the prevailing consensus on free markets and price stability. Emu will come about only if that consensus is acted upon. The governor believes it will be. In view of the loss of credibility that would now follow failure, one must hope he is right that 'assuming no really major disruptions, the relevant question is perhaps not whether Stage 3 will start in this century, but how many countries it will involve, and which they will be'. Yet even if Emu will happen, it remains unclear how it will work. Will there be monetary targets and, if so, how will they be determined? Should there be reserve requirements? And where might the European central bank be located? (In lovely, liquid London, pleads the governor). Fundamental questions These matters, important though they are, pale next to the fundamental political questions raised by Emu. Above all, the workability of Emu depends on acceptance of the German approach to economic policy. This does not mean that monetary policy becomes a technical matter, like cleaning the drains. It means that political decisions can be legitimately taken by a non-elected body. The Bundesbank does not pursue a precise objective labelled 'price stability'. On the contrary, the D-Mark has lost more than two-thirds of its value since 1948. What the Bundesbank tries to do, instead, is to hold down the rate of change of prices. This policy involves large doses of judgment, not merely about policy means, but about ends; about, for example, how much disinflation may be appropriate to achieve how rapid a reduction in inflation. German consensus What permits the Bundesbank to make such judgments is the German consensus on what policies should be like, not merely monetary policies, but fiscal and exchange rate policies as well. The governor is right to stress that consensus, not any treaty, is what will make Emu workable. If the German consensus were shared by all main participants, they would not force inflationary exchange rate policies upon the ECB; nor would they pursue irresponsible fiscal policies. But there can be no guarantee that the German consensus - some might say the erstwhile German consensus - will operate throughout the EC, a worry that has now seized a German polity already shaken by German economic and monetary union. If the consensus were to disappear, so would Emu. Emu will also have large implications for fiscal policy. It is almost inconceivable, for example, that greater efforts would not be made to prevent a country from adopting a fiscal policy as anti-communautaire as the one the Germans are pursuing today. Contrary to the governor's view, fiscal transfers will also increase - not merely because the poor countries want them. It is not that transfers are needed to achieve convergence and integration (though they would be if the EC were to implement the more nonsensical parts of its proposed social charter). It is rather that larger transfers will be needed to deal with regionally differentiated shocks in the absence of exchange rate flexibility. At Maastricht the EC agreed on a long and difficult journey. But this is not just an economic journey. Emu demands political commitment and requires political consensus. Greater political integration will be the outcome of a successful Emu; but a deep consensus is the principal precondition for its success.</p>

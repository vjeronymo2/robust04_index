			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Swept apart by the torrent: Western policy towards Bosnia is in disarray The Bosnian conflict has seen many unexpected and contradictory developments since it began more than one year ago. But few of them have been quite as dramatic or significant as those of the past week when the peace agreement brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen was first signed by the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and then rejected by his self-styled 'parliament' a few days later. Those successive events appeared first to vindicate the proponents of a diplomatic solution of the Bosnian problem, like Lord Owen himself and members of the European Community, and, subsequently, to strengthen the arguments of those advocating military measures, like the US. They have, not surprisingly, had a profound influence on the discussions held over the past week by Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, in the main western European capitals and Moscow, but have left western strategy in a state of considerable disarray. Mr Christopher's mission to Europe had a two-pronged objective: to co-ordinate western and Russian policy on the implementation of the peace plan and to bring them 'on side' for military measures under the umbrella of the United Nations, if the peace plan, already approved by the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, was not endorsed by the Bosnian Serbs. Success on the first point was more easily achieved than expected. The US offer to contribute about one-third of the 70,000-strong Nato-led international force opened the way to promises of substantial pledges of troops from Britain, France and, not least, Russia. Pinning down the European allies and Russia on military measures, in case the peace plan was rejected by the Bosnian Serb assembly, was altogether a more tricky task. The allies wriggled as much as they could, while doing their best to avoid giving the impression of a serious rift with Washington. They did not rule out tougher measures, possibly in the form of air strikes, but insisted that further consultations would have to be held before any decision to embark on such a course was taken. These differences did not matter so much as long as they referred to a hypothetical situation. They have become much more of a threat to a united western front and, indeed, US-Russian relations, since the Bosnian Serb assembly rejected the plan. While President Clinton has been calling insistently for the international community 'to unite and act quickly and decisively', his European allies have found another reason for delaying military action. Ironically, a lifeline has been thrown to them by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, the very man whose particular brand of Serbian nationalism provoked the Bosnian conflict in the first place. Only Mr Milosevic has sufficient clout and influence over the Bosnian Serbs to bring them to heel, Mr Vance and Lord Owen have always claimed. That proposition has been proved at least partially incorrect by the refusal of the Bosnian Serb assembly to heed the Serbian leader's passionate plea for approval of the peace plan. The marionettes no longer seem to react to the tugs of the puppet-master. Yet the clout is still there. Mr Milosevic's swift move following the rejection of the peace plan to seal all supply routes from Serbia to the Bosnian Serbs, except for food and humanitarian supplies, will plug a big hole in international sanctions. It is also clear that the move is likely to rule out the bombing of one of the obvious targets for air strikes, the Bosnian Serb supply routes. Will the US want to go ahead in these circumstances? For President Bill Clinton, who is expected by the international community to take a leading role in the Bosnian affair, the dilemma is painful. It sometimes seems that fate deals unkindly with Democratic US presidents. Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK and LBJ, even, to a lesser extent, Jimmy Carter, all found themselves sucked into foreign vortexes when they wanted to do much more at home. In the case of Mr Clinton, perhaps more than any of the above, there is an especially bitter irony. Not four months into office, elected to put the domestic house in order and with no known desire to be tested in the crucible of battle, this first post-Cold War president finds himself standing on the brink of a military engagement in a distant part of the world ruled by mediaeval passions, which are the the antithesis of everything this very modern man stands for. At stake for him is not only his own credibility as leader of the world's sole remaining superpower, but that very domestic agenda by which he puts so much store and which already is proving such a struggle to implement. For if Vietnam killed off the Great Society and the last World War brought an end to the New Deal, so can Bosnia prove a dagger into the heart of the many programmes that he used to call the New Covenant. As Mr Anthony Lake, his national security council adviser, said yesterday, conflict is still 'avoidable.' Mr Clinton has decided what he would do, but not yet to do it. Lining up the European allies and Russia remains an incomplete and fraught process. But, perhaps more important than anything, the president still has to prepare his domestic audience for the fateful step of overseas military engagement. Put simply, his country needs to know 'why'. The common denominator in US opinion is that there are no good options in Bosnia. Yet, as Mr Thomas Foley, the Democratic Speaker of the House, frequently says, there is 'an overall presumption', based on precedent, that if Mr Clinton goes to Congress and asks for authorisation to use force he will get it. President Bush did so for the Gulf War and President Johnson for Vietnam, even after intense debate. But, political wisdom also runs, Mr Clinton must first make the case for action, which he has yet seriously to attempt. He has to lay out the vital US interests in the region, what the objectives and duration of any military engagement might be and even, in these budget-straitened times, how it is going to be financed. Both support for and opposition to the use of military force cuts across party lines. Tom Foley and Bob Dole, the Republican Senate leader, are for it, Lee Hamilton, doveish chairman of the House foreign relations committee and John McCain, the hawkish ex-Vietnam POW and Republican senator from Arizona, are against. All agree, however, that the US cannot act alone. In the middle are countless voices preferring one option or another. Mr Larry Eagleburger, the former secretary of state and old Yugoslav hand, confesses himself at a loss: 'I don't think we are in a position at this stage to be very clear about what we should do next.' The New York Times leader column, previously red-blooded behind intervention, could only advise yesterday that Mr Clinton first pursue 'the still shaky political and diplomatic fronts." Discontent with the reluctance of the European allies to fall into line is palpable. Congressman Tom Lantos, the California Democrat, is far from alone in deriding 'the pitiful performance of the great European powers' in 'flunking' their first test of post-Cold War leadership. Cartoonists are having a field day with depictions of European statesmen washing their hands of the Balkans, but inviting the US to get involved. Yet President Clinton has made it clear that the US will not go it alone in Bosnia. The question that must still be answered is whether the allies will sink or swim together in the Bosnian whirlpool.</p>

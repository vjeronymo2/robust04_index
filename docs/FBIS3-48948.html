Participants in today's 6th meeting of  "Slovaks Living in Southern Slovakia" appealed to President  Michal Kovac and Slovakia's state bodies not to allow a possible  anticonstitutional contents and consequences of the meeting  which had been convoked by the Association of Towns and Villages  of Zitny Ostrov (SMOZO) in Komarno, south Slovakia, on January  8. The alleged aim of the meeting is to create "a special  status" (Hungarian minority's) territory in the nationally mixed  south of Slovakia. According to earlier reports, a 100-man  assembly is to be elected at the meeting.    Most of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (11 per cent of  Slovakia's total population) live in southern Slovakia. The  appeal also calls for the passage of a law on the protection of  the republic, a law on the protection of the state language and  demands that at least one Slovak school be functioning in every  community, something that ceases to be natural in southern  Slovakia.    The appeal demands that the resolutions in which the Slovak  Parliament pledged to fulfil the CE recommendations made when  Slovakia was admitted to the council on June 30, 1993, be  revised. The recommendations include bilingual road signposts  in ethnically mixed communities, the possibility to use  Hungarian first names, and others.    A second part of the document calls on ethnic Hungarians not  to help foment conflicts between the Slovak and Hungarian  population. The Surany meeting was attended by the deputy  premiers, Jozef Prokes (Slovak National Party, SNS) and Roman  Kovac (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), Culture  Minister Dusan Slobodnik, chairman of Matica Slovenska cultural  and educational organisation founded in 1863, Jozef Markus,  deputy chairman of the Democratic Left Party, SDL) Pavol Kanis,  and HZDS Deputy Chairman Augustin Marian Huska.    Speakers at the meeting of 500-600 people expressed Slovaks'  fears of alleged attempts by the Hungarian parties represented  in the Slovak Parliament at gradual "ethnic cleansing" of  southern Slovakia of Slovaks and subsequent revision of the  state border with Hungary. Kovac stressed that the government  would not allow any territorial-administrative rearrangement of  Slovakia on the basis of the ethnic principle which would aim to  expel Slovaks from newly created micro-regions and would soon  initiate the conclusion of a treaty with Hungary on the  inviolability of the state border.</p>

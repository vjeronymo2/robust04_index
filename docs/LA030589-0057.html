			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 1 INCUMBENT A CINCH TO WIN SCHOOL BOARD RACE  </P> <P> Redondo Beach voters will decide Tuesday whether to keep two incumbent members  of the local elementary school board or to replace one of them with a retired  principal. The two candidates with the most votes will win seats on the  five-member board.  </P> <P> The incumbents, Howard Huizing and Rebecca Sargent, and challenger Andrew  Deliman agree that Redondo Beach City School District is in excellent shape  after adjusting to a traumatic drop in enrollment over 20 years from 10,000  students to 3,800 today.  </P> <P> In interviews, the three candidates said the financial condition of the  district is sound, the quality of education is high, teachers and  administrators are first rate and many programs cut during the lean years have  been restored.  </P> <P> "It's a happy place," said Huizing, 69, the board president, who is seeking his  second term. "Other districts envy our position."  </P> <P> "Everything is going extremely well now," said Sargent, 43, who is running for  her third term on the board. "But we need to keep moving forward."  </P> <P> "We have a fine school system," said Deliman, 68, who worked for the district  for 27 years as a principal before retiring in 1985. He listed 12 areas in  which he would like to see further improvements, such as class-size reduction  and computer education.  </P> <P> The three candidates agreed that elementary districts in the three beach cities  -- Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach -- are likely in the near  future to absorb the secondary students now served by the troubled South Bay  Union High School District. What form the reorganization may take will be  discussed by the boards of the four districts at a joint meeting March 14.  </P> <P> At South Bay Union, the student population has dropped from a high of 7,000 in  the 1970s to 3,300. The decline is expected to continue along with mounting  budget problems. The high school district has proposed a  kindergarten-through-12th grade unification of all three beach cities.  </P> <P> Deliman said: "Redondo Beach wants its own school system. . . . I might  consider Hermosa Beach joining us, since it has only about 700 students."  </P> <P> Both incumbents said a separate unified Redondo Beach system, possibly  including Hermosa Beach, may be the best way to go, but said they will be open  to all the options until they hear the views of the other districts.  </P> <P> "I think unification is a good thing and we want to discuss the best way to do  it," Huizing said.  </P> <P> Sargent, who works as a paralegal in a Torrance law firm, was first elected in  1981. She has been active as a volunteer in a number of state and local  educational groups.  </P> <P> Deliman worked for the Redondo Beach district for 29 years, including 27 years  as a principal at various schools. Since retiring, he has worked as a  substitute teacher in Torrance. He said he would like to see a stronger role  for teachers in the district's operations and he proposed providing an annual  report on school affairs to the community.  </P> <P> Huizing also is a veteran of service in the Redondo Beach district. He was a  teacher and basketball coach, then principal of the Washington school for 27  years. Since his retirement, he has worked as a real estate agent.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ari'el Sharon: "A Smoke Screen"] </F>   [Text] Once the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee [FADC], as well as other bodies that deal with  security issues, used to keep their discussions more secret. In  these new times, everything is open, there are no barriers and  no brakes.    Several days ago, as the citizens of Israel were anxiously  listening to accounts of the Cairo encounter between the Israeli  foreign minister and PLO representative Abu-Mazin [Mahmud  'Abbas], the media again announced, citing a "soothing"  statement by the head of the FADC's intelligence branch: "A  majority of the residents of the territories support 'Arafat."    Those who took pains to make this announcement in such a  manner must have had good reasons to try to calm the public in  view of the rising doubts, the uncertainty, the growing mistrust  of the government announcements.    I do not discuss the FADC sessions as a rule, and I have  even  requested that others refrain from disclosing my remarks at  these sessions. But a situation has arisen in which the  government makes cynically selective use of the information it  receives from intelligence elements, and there is therefore no  alternative but to present a fuller picture. I trust the  military censor to delete anything that can be really  detrimental to state security.    Recently all the intelligence elements have been repeatedly  reporting on 'Arafat's negotiating stands. In general, they  believe that 'Arafat has firmly adhered to his stands since the  beginning of the negotiations, not budging from them one bit.    And this is what the intelligence elements are saying:    -- As far as 'Arafat is concerned, the agreement should lead  to the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria,  and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, at the end of the  process. Anything that serves this purpose is acceptable to him.  Whatever does not, is rejected by him.    -- In the matter of the border crossings control, the  struggle is not over "Palestinian dignity versus Israeli  security." The struggle is over external manifestations of  Palestinian sovereignty versus Israeli security. Even if  'Arafat's demands on the matter of dignity are satisfied, the  crisis will not be resolved without Israeli concession on the  matter of external manifestations of sovereignty. (Israel has  in the meantime given in on both the sovereignty and security  issues.)    -- 'Arafat demands guarantees for future stages of the  process without linking that to him meeting the government's  expectations from the agreement. The process and every  implemented stage thereof are irreversible. This is not an  experiment after which, if it fails, the situation can be  reversed.    -- A prolonged dialogue resulted in an agreement between  Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which stated:  The two organizations will not fight each other either in Gaza,  Jericho, or any other place. This is the authoritative stand of  the Israeli intelligence services.    -- Hamas will be incorporated in the Palestinian  establishment that will come into being after Israeli  evacuation. Negotiations are already under way for the  inclusion of Hamas in the Gaza city council (proportional to  their strength, which is about 40 percent of the Strip versus 50  percent Fatah and 10 percent Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine).    They will presumably be incorporated in every Palestinian  self- administration branch, including the police.  Hamas-initiated terrorist operations will continue even if and  when its members join the Palestinian establishment. In all the  contacts between the two organizations, Fatah has never demanded  that Hamas discontinue its terrorist activities against Israel.    The intelligence elements believe that, during the interim  period, terrorism is expected to intensify in Judaea and  Samaria, and in other places in Israel. Fatah and its leader,  'Arafat, regard terrorism an important tool in the political  process. Knowing the Israeli public's sensitivity to terror  victims, 'Arafat hopes to extract additional concessions from  Israel with the help of intensified terrorism,    There is no Fatah agreement that, after the evacuation,  Israeli security forces will be allowed to carry out preemptive  acts when Israel has information regarding preparations for  terror activity. Fatah will also not allow the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] to pursue the perpetrators of terrorism.    -- The PLO will not revoke the Palestinian Covenant which  calls for the destruction of Israel, even in the future.    -- 'Arafat does not intend to distance the PLO from the  terror organizations which have always opposed the agreement  ("the rejectionist front"), and which call for the  intensification of activity against Israel. Furthermore, he  does not sanction them.    -- After the IDF evacuation, it will be impossible to  identify or supervise those who carry guns. The Palestinian  forces will be armed with assault rifles, machine guns, and  armored vehicles.    -- Even if Israel learns, in advance, of an intention to  shell Sederot from the Gaza area, or Kfar Sava from Qalqilyah,  the only option at our disposal will be an appeal for the PLO  interference.    Fatah continues perpetrating terror acts, such as the recent  incidents: the murder last weekend of the immigrant Anatoliy  Kalasnikov, may the Lord revenge his blood. The stabbing of  Yuval Golan in Adorayim two days ago, perpetrated by a Fatah man  who was released from jail, upon a Fatah request, 10 days  earlier. He probably was a new recruit with the Palestinian  police, as was one of the murderers of Hayim Mizrahi from Bet  El....    All of this has been reported to the members of the FADC,  but  not published. This was no accident, because they are putting  out a smoke screen.    Possibly, some Jews want to be cheated. Our history has  witnessed terrible times when the leaders of the ghettos and  many of the Jews there acted this way (I find it hard to judge  this because I was not there), and the results are known.    Nevertheless, it is important that we know the truth which  is  often being hidden from us. It is essential that we know that  there is nothing left of the government's grounding assumption  before the agreement is implemented. Let no one later say: "We  had no idea." Everything is in front of us.</p>

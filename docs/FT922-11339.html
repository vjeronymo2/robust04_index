			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / City of London boundaries widen the local authority for the 'square mile' of the City of London - were announced by the Local Government Boundary Commission yesterday. London borough boundaries are under review as part of the Boundary Commission's programme. The corporation, Britain's smallest local authority with 5,000 residents sandwiched between seven inner London boroughs, includes most of the City's old business district. The changes will add about 1,000 to its residential population. Notable additions to the City are the Golden Lane housing estate, north of the Barbican; the entire Broadgate development, beside Liverpool Street station; Milton Court, off Chiswell Street; and a large business district east of Chancery Lane, including the Public Records Office. The only notable loss is an area on Bishopsgate fronting the Spitalfields development. Welcoming the extensions, Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy committee, said: 'This will simplify the preparation, implementation and monitoring of appropriate planning policies for the world's principal financial centre.' The corporation was under threat of abolition by Labour, but with the Tories' re-election its future appears secure.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand growth forecast for copper COPPER DEMAND is almost wholly insensitive to price because nearly all of the metal's uses are determined by technical rather than economic considerations, says the Commodities Research Unit consultancy group in a report today. Its analysis shows that copper gained markets in the late 1980s when metal's price was relatively high. The report concludes that the copper industry can look forward to 'years of sustained demand growth, capacity constraints and profitable mining'. Copper's price must remain above 90 cents a lb in the long term as this is the level that will encourage mining companies to go ahead with projects at present under consideration, the CRU suggests. It claims the study breaks new ground by presenting data and analysing copper consumption by end-use sector in the developing countries, as had previously been done for the developed world. The report provides guidance for copper fabricators as well as mining companies preparing their strategies for the next decade. Copper's growth prospects are underpinned by the developing countries of south east Asia, India, China and Latin America, according to the report. Although these areas account for only 18 per cent of western world copper consumption at present, more than 60 per cent of the expected increase in demand will come from them in future. Refined copper consumption in these areas will grow at nearly 5 per cent a year in the period to 2005, suggests the CRU, whereas growth will be only 1 per cent in the developed world and 2.1 per cent for the western world as a whole.

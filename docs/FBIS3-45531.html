According to a local official, last year 1,653  foreign-funded  enterprises were approved, with a promised investment of 1.55  billion dollars, up 73 percent and 77 percent over 1992,  respectively.    And ten projects financed with loans of foreign governments  to the tune of a total of 519 million U.S. dollars started in  1993.    As a result, a batch of medium and large state-owned  enterprises have made great progress in their restructuring by  utilizing foreign funds.    For example, the newly established Jiaozuo Xinda Chemical  Company, financed with 10 million U.S. dollars by a chemical  industry factory in Jiaozuo City and a Hong Kong firm, has  become the largest ink powder producer in the world.    The official said the paid-in investment reached 376 million  U.S. dollars in 1993, exceeding the total in the previous 14  years.</p>

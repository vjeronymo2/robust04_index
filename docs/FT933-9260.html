			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: The cake that may need reslicing - How new disclosure rulings have hit life insurers THE Treasury has dropped a bombshell on the life insurance industry by ruling that, for the first time, companies would have to tell prospective policyholders how much the product costs, how much the sales agent will be paid and what penalties will bite if it is surrendered before maturity. That announcement prompted a sell-off in life insurance company shares which has yet to correct itself. The Treasury was responding to a report from the Office of Fair Trading which had concluded that the current disclosure regime for life insurers had 'significant anti-competitive elements' and that consumers knew too little about what they were buying to choose products wisely. And while the industry strove to put on a brave face, the stock market showed clearly why life insurers have fought tooth and nail against disclosure rules which were proposed as long ago as 1988. Before the Treasury's announcement, the life insurance sector was trading at a 48 per cent premium to the FT-A All-Share Index, close to its historical high. Within two days, the premium had fallen by 14 percentage points to 34 per cent, an unusually large drop for the sector. 'These insurance companies haven't really lived in a fully competitive environment before,' said Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'And how managements face up to that will decide who survives.' The absence of competition in an industry with a plethora of competitors is a bit of a conundrum. But because customers are unaware of the price of the products they buy, firms have found it makes more sense to compete for sales agents than to compete for ultimate buyers. Analysts believe that the new transparency requirements will for the first time expose to buyers the unattractive elements of some of the industry's most profitable and widely sold products, particularly, mortgage-linked endowment policies. Moreover, sales agents of all types will have to disclose to customers the substantial commissions they receive on each sale - a development which some analysts feel could drive customers into other savings media. 'Some endowments which would have been sold will not be sold,' said Mr Roman Cizden, analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court. 'When the husband and wife go to their insurance salesman they will fall off their chairs when they see those numbers. They are so big,' Mr Cizden said. A 25-year mortgage endowment with a Pounds 50 per month premium will give the average insurance salesman a minimum Pounds 486 commission up front, with many receiving up to twice that amount. And all of that comes out of the policyholders' funds. Endowments are probably the single most profitable product life insurers sell, analysts say. They were roughly 75 per cent of the market in 1992 and of these, mortgage-related endowments were nearly 60 per cent. Other products, such as single-premium bonds and pensions policies have been gaining ground on endowments in recent years, but carry smaller profit margins. 'Pensions business has a smaller profit margin than endowments and single-premium products are less profitable than both.' Thus, companies will have to increase volumes of lower-margin business and slash expenses in order to stay profitable. And the less efficient, particularly mutuals without access to the capital markets, will find it difficult to survive. According to Mr Nick Anderton, a consulting actuary and publisher of an industry newsletter, up to 20 life insurance companies are currently on the auction block following several mergers already announced earlier this year. Meanwhile, analysts say that companies such as the Prudential, which have already embarked on significant cost reduction programmes, are likely to have an edge in the new competitive environment. Mr Ziai is forecasting that those companies who already have a niche selling to either high income individuals or to the relatively poor will experience the least competition. But those who concentrate on the middle market, the C2s and Ds, will have to struggle to maintain market share. Companies such as Britannic Life or London and Manchester Life Assurance, which have done well in so-called Industrial branch business  - in which an agent makes weekly collections of small premiums - are selling a product which is not likely to be price-sensitive. 'The same agent has probably been selling policies in the same street for years. Everybody knows him and he probably sells to two or three members of the same family,' Mr Ziai said. However, although there is little competition for this business, there is also little profit in it. Several companies, including Britannic, have had to raise their minimum monthly premiums because they calculated they could not earn money on small sums. Both the Prudential and Britannic did so last year, and consequently reported drops of IB sales in the first half of 1993 of 12 per cent and 66 per cent respectively. But Mr Cizden argues that from an investor's point of view, the heightened industry competitiveness could be a good thing. It will narrow the field, leaving those who survive with a larger market share. 'I will argue that in the future, the cake will be sliced differently,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kan San: "Sichuan Lays Down Rules for New Shares] </F>   [Text] Sichuan Province has adopted regulations designed  to ensure openness and fairness in deciding which companies will  be authorized to issue shares publicly this year.    The regulations permit every city in the province to  recommend one local enterprise to the provincial government.    Then the provincial commission on economic restructuring  will  organize lawyers and accountants to investigate the businesses.    Their reports will be sent to the provincial securities  regulatory commission.    Then the provincial securities policy committee will select  the companies by secret ballot.    The provincial government said the chosen firms will be  mainly in the energy, transport, and raw materials industries.    They should be able to prove they have had a satisfactory  business record for three consecutive years and have violated no  laws in that period.    Each firm's net assets should exceed 30 million yuan ($3.5  million).    The foundation for a sound equity market in Sichuan was laid  last year, and a securities network centred in the capital  Chengdu and in Chongqing now includes more than 10 cities.    By the end of last year, 50 Sichuan companies had issued  shares publicly and 14 of them had been listed on the Shanghai  and Shenzhen securities exchanges.    The province has setup five securities companies and many  others based in Shanghai or Shenzhen have opened branches in  Chengdu and Chongqing.    Across the province, 407 outlets allow investors to trade  shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.    More than 100,000 people in Sichuan have traded in stocks  with a transaction value of 20 billion yuan ($2.3 billion).    The province has invested 2 million yuan ($230,000) to set  up  the Sichuan Securities Trading Centre, which has a  700-square-metre trading floor and more than 200 seats, in  Chengdu.    The centre lists 20 kinds of treasury and corporate bonds  with a value of 700 million yuan ($80 million). A computer  link-up with the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges is  expected this year.</p>

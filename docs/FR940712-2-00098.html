Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange's Plan provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $2,500, on any member, member organization, allied member, approved person, registered or non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a minor violation of certain specified Exchange rules. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The BSE's Plan for enforcing and reporting minor disciplinary rule violations was approved by the Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989), 54 FR 16438&hyph;I (April 24, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;88&hyph;2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Plan is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a sanction is appropriate but when initiation of a full disciplinary proceeding is not suitable because such proceeding would be more costly and onerous than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. The Plan provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Exchange's initial filing which set forth the provisions and procedures of the Plan, the Exchange indicated that it periodically would amend the list of rules subject to the Plan as the Exchange deemed appropriate. The Exchange now seeks to add the aforementioned rules and policy to the List. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(6) of the Act, in that its members and persons associated with its members will be appropriately disciplined for violation of rules and policies where the Exchange has determined that such violation is minor in nature. In accordance with Sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act, the Plan provides for a fair disciplinary procedure for the imposition of sanctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / European Finance and Investment, Germany (1): Going for the lion's share - Is Germany poised to make a decisive leap forward in its campaign to challenge London as Europe's chief financial centre? David Waller discusses the programme being mapped out by the government to establish Finanzplatz Deutschland HANGING ON the wall of the office of Mr Rudiger von Rosen, managing director of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, there is a large and lurid picture of a lion chasing two people through a jungle. The picture poses a tantalising question, one which fascinates Mr von Rosen as he sits in his office working on plans to bolster Germany's standing as a financial centre. Is the lion about to catch the people? Or are they on the point of escaping? Mr von Rosen is inclined to see the picture as a metaphor for his own campaign. Is Germany about to make a decisive leap forward in its campaign to challenge London as Europe's chief financial centre? Or is the prize on the verge of slipping away? These questions were discussed in this very room in January this year when Mr von Rosen was entertaining Chancellor Kohl on his first visit to the Exchange - by far the largest in Germany - in nearly 10 years in office. Mr Kohl's visit to the exchange - he gave a talk to the flower of Frankfurt's financial and business community - was charged with symbolic significance. It represented a turning point in the government's attitude to the development of Germany as a financial centre. Hitherto, the Frankfurt stock exchange and the banks had been left largely to themselves in their battle to enhance Germany's competitive position. True, in recent years the government had helped the German financial services industry through deregulation, for example abolishing stock exchange turnover tax and removing the obstacles which prevented Germany establishing its own futures and options market, or which stopped German companies from issuing commercial paper. But, in his speech to assembled financiers, Mr Kohl was able to offer something new - concrete and co-ordinated government backing for Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre. The details of the programme had been rushed out on the previous day. A paper drafted by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, outlined the government's backing for, inter alia, a centralised supervisory body for the Germany securities industry and a law against insider dealing (at present insider dealing is not illegal in Germany). It also spelt out the government's support for: greater transparency of shareholder registers; moves to bring Germany's eight stock exchanges under one roof; the introduction of money-market funds (which give investors direct access to short-term money-market instruments); and further computerisation of stock-market trading. In decentralised Germany, Bonn is in no position to impose these changes. In signalling its position clearly it has, however, brought pressure to bear on the numerous parties which must come to an agreement before action can be taken, especially the Lander (states) which play a powerful role in stock market supervision. Taken in total, the package could - in the long term - help to give Germany's financial services industry a role in Europe commensurate with its status as Europe's strongest industrial power. At present, Germany's status as a financial centre is somewhat schizophrenic. On the one hand, Germany has an unassailably powerful position in European financial markets as a result of the Bundesbank and the D-Mark. Germans hope this would be consolidated if the European central bank were sited in Frankfurt or Bonn. On the other hand, Frankfurt has lost out when competing with other financial centres to provide a range of financial services, and the German equity market is especially underdeveloped. The Bundesbank has been fighting inflation - successfully - for decades. This gives it, and the currency which it defends, unrivalled strength, and investors will always find reasons to buy D-Marks and D-Mark Bunds. Last year, for example, domestic and international investors invested record amounts in the German Bund market (DM127bn and DM61bn respectively). Their enthusiasm has been tempered by the unfavourable outlook for interest rates, but the attractions of Bunds and the currency were drawn into sharp relief by the result of the Danish referendum on Maastricht. The threat to monetary and political union prompted investors to buy the D-Mark, and, at the very least, to hold on to their Bunds while they sold off other countries' government securities. That the Bund market is structurally sound is proven by the ease with which the government has been able to use the market to finance its increased borrowings following reunification in 1990. But a sound bond market alone does not constitute a strong financial centre, as the Finance Ministry paper implicitly recognised in January this year. Germany's fragmented stock-market structure is a source of inefficiency and has helped to drive a significant proportion of turnover of the shares of Germany's largest companies to London. Germany has started to hit back, in two ways. First, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange has promoted new technology in a bid to bring back business to Germany. An increasing volume of trading is being handled by the IBIS system, introduced as an information exchange system in December 1989 but upgraded to a trading system for Germany's top 30 shares (and leading bond issues) in April last year. According to Mr von Rosen, this has succeeded in wrestling business back from the London-based SEAQ system. Second, as prompted by the Waigel paper, Germany's eight stock exchanges have agreed to come together under one roof as the Deutsche Borse (German Exchange), although it is not clear when this will finally take effect. Another key element of the Waigel proposals is the commitment to introduce insider dealing laws and a centralised regulatory body. Germany's failings on this count were brought into sharp focus last year as a result of a series of securities scandals in Frankfurt. Changes are now supported by the leading financial institutions and - in principle, at least - by the governments of the Lander. The latter will have to cede regulatory powers to the centre, and it remains to be seen what form the new body will take. The Waigel paper does not tackle - indeed could not hope to tackle - the weight of cultural obstacles standing in the way of Germany's development as a financial centre. Here are just two of the cultural barriers: The stock market plays a limited role in German corporate life: there are only around 660 listed companies in Germany and the capitalisation of the market is significantly smaller in proportion to GNP than in the UK or the US. Equity financing plays second fiddle to bank finance and the vast majority of quoted companies - all but about 50 - are majority-controlled by other corporate shareholders or financial institutions. Liquidity in all but the biggest company shares is limited. Companies cannot easily be taken over and there are no share options to give German managers a direct personal interest in share price performance. Domestic institutional investment is slight: insurance companies invest 85-95 per cent of their portfolio in government securities and the pension fund industry is in its infancy. German individuals, with copious amounts of surplus cash, tend to avoid the equity market in favour of Bunds, in spite of better returns on shares. There are only about 4.2m shareholders in Germany - around 5 per cent of the population - compared to 12m in the UK and 51m in the US, 20 per cent of the population in each case. In fact, the average German household is thought to spend more on flowers each year than on shares. Many Germans will argue that the limited role of the stock market is a source of strength for the German economy, rather than a weakness, in that it encourages long-term thinking, liberating company management from the need to please short-sighted institutional investors. Whether or not this is the case, it seems improbable that Germany can develop into a leading financial services centre without developing a financial culture as well. Mr Waigel's plans represent an important step forward - but it is likely that it will be some years before Mr von Rosen will finally be able to conclude that the lion on his wall has caught up with its human prey.</p>

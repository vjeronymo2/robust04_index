			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Observer: Musical chairs With simultaneous puffs of white smoke from New York and London yesterday, two of the world's best known business weeklies change editors. In the US the parents of Barron's, one of Wall Street's more conservative institutions, played safe. By contrast, albeit true to form, the owners of The Economist catapulted yet another young fizzer into the editor's chair. The contrast between the two new editors couldn't be wider. Barron's James Meagher, now 57, is a career hack who was number two to Alan Abelson, the revered editor for over a decade. The Economist's new chief Bill Emmott is a good 20 years younger, and has what Americans would describe as an Ivy league background. He was chosen over the magazine's 46-year-old deputy editor, Nicholas Colchester, an old FT hand and fellow Oxford man. They even went to the same college, Magdalen. The Economist has a tradition of picking young turks as editors. One has to go back over 30 years, to Donald Tyerman, who took over from Geoffrey Crowther, to find an editor who was over 40 when selected for The Economist chair. Given that Tyerman was one of the less successful editors, The Economist's emphasis on youth has paid off to date. The magazine's circulation has long since surpassed Barron's and is rising. Emmott is a popular choice among his staff. His intellect is not in doubt and his managerial skills have been tested by a stint knocking the Economic Intelligence Unit into shape. That said, however, there's always a risk in leap-frogging an older generation. Not least because there is so much farther for The Economist to fall in its 150th year.</p>

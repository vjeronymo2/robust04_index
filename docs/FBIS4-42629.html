			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["dr"-signed report: "The Chancellor Will Tolerate No One </F> But Himself at Remembrance Anniversary"]    [Text] Berlin -- In the run-up to his election as federal  president, Roman Herzog made a point of noting the date of the  anniversary of the assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler.  Speaking to SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, he described the first major  speech that he would deliver after taking office --the speech  scheduled for the 50th anniversary of 20 July -- as a test.    The federal president has been spared the test. The  chancellor has decided to step in. He wants to give the speech  himself and has attracted disapproval from the SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] and resistance associations. SPD's  Rudolf Scharping -- it is being said that he himself would have  liked to have delivered a speech on the anniversary -- explained  yesterday that "it is impermissible for anyone to use the  anniversary for election campaign purposes." He thinks it would  have been appropriate if the chairman of a party that  particularly suffered under the dictatorship of the Third Reich  had been invited to take part in the event. Scharping now wants  to express his views on the occasion "in an appropriate manner."  The Federal Chancellery did not want to comment on the  criticism.    That Kohl should dominate the proceedings is something that  resistance associations themselves do not want. Speaking to  TAGESZEITUNG, Claritta von Trotz zu Solz, the widow of  resistance fighter Adam von Trotz zu Solz who was executed in  1944, said: "I am very sad that a speech delivered by a man who  stands for one particular political current will fail to reflect  the diversity of the resistance, especially here in Kreisau  District."    Peter Steinbach, the director of German Resistance  Monuments,  has distanced himself from plans for the commemoration to date.  He does not agree with the military ritual and would have  preferred to have a civilian event, but failed to get his  arguments accepted. The Federal Defense Ministry has planned a  march by a guards battalion and a column of soldiers.    Annemarie Renger, the former Bundestag speaker and chairman  of the Central Association of Resistance and Persecuted Persons  Organizations, has called for the main speech to be delivered by  the president. However, the chancellery of future Federal  President Roman Herzog states that it is aware of no such plans.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP: HOT ON THE TRAIL OF 2-CUP TEAKETTLE  </P> <P> For a friend, Tye Roy of Orange would love to find a two-cup teakettle that  whistles. Can you help with an idea that will fit the friend to a T, or will  they both be blowing hot air until they're in their cups over this?  </P> <P> William Carnahan of San Pedro, who is restoring a landmark house, is  practically on his hands and knees in search of an old-fashioned linoleum rug  for the kitchen; the one he is looking for should be appropriate for the '20s  or '30s. Armstrong discontinued making these rugs a few years ago, but Carnahan  hopes someone still has one in stock; size is not a problem. If you could help,  you'd never hear another squeak out of Carnahan; as a matter of fact, he'd  positively be floored.  </P> <P> Pat Bias of Tujunga is trying to replace her husband's favorite weeding tool --  a round bulb with a straight handle and a two-pointed prong; except for the  tip, it was made of wood. Unless you can dig up a source, don't expect Bias'  husband to turn over any new leaves this spring.  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader-Help Line: Doris at (213 697-8480 is trying to locate an  obsolete Rival Shred-O-Mat for her daughter; please see to it that neither  Doris nor the daughter goes to pieces over this. . . . Dorothy at (818)  789-5803 would like to find a hair roller made decades ago by the Goody Co.  It's a 5" stainless-steel cylinder, slotted in the center, with a red rubber  tip at one end. Let's hope you know where to get one right off the top of your  head, otherwise Dorothy may start tearing her hair out. . . . Dolores at (213)  273-3113 needs a Neva Clog Hand Stapler, Model J-30, and some Model D-J-340  Neva Clog staples to go with it; she would even settle for someone who can  repair the staplers, since they are very light and she has arthritis. Nobody is  trying to make light of this, but Doris could sure use a helping hand here.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is for one-time items or for products no  longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to publish  your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> John Aldrich of Santa Barbara and Dennis Madison of South Laguna, both of whom  were looking for an electric gadget that tells owners of rural mail boxes when  the mail has arrived, will soon be able to stay posted. Joseph S. Kovacs saw  such an item at The Best of Everything, in the Westwood Pavilion, Los Angeles.  Ruth Frantz of Santa Barbara, Margot Jensen of Whittier, William Watson Jr. of  Vista, Verna Newland of Downey and John Saxby of San Clemente all told us about  an item made by Signa Mail Systems, 204 E. 2nd Ave., San Mateo, Calif. 94401,  (415) 340-0126; however, according to Saxby, this works only on mail boxes with  doors that are hinged at the bottom.  </P> <P> More sources: Julie C. Hopkins of Studio City told us about a gadget from the  Gardener's Supply Spring Catalogue, 128 Intervale Road, Burlington, Vt. 05401,  that flips up a metal flag when the carrier opens the box. Muriel Menasco of  Orange says a similar item is Mail Time, made by Alsto Co., P.O,. Box 1267,  Galesburg, Ill. 61401; it costs about $8.50. Of course, these have value only  if the mail box is visible from the house.  </P> <P> Pat Davey of Northridge and Monique Marti mention a Motion Alert, which sets  off a musical alarm inside the house and is available from Sporty's, Clermont  Airport, Batavia, Ohio 45103-9747. According to Ken Haagensen of North  Hollywood, the same item was listed in a recent -- but not the latest --  catalogue put out by DAK Industries, 8200 Remmet Ave., Canoga Park, Calif.  91304-9955. And Ivan Maruno of Whittier sent us a page from Computers &amp;  Electronics magazine that describes how you can put together and install your  own Mailbox Sentry; this is for do-it-yourselfers who enjoy tinkering with  electronics. (If interested, send us a stamped, self-addressed envelope.)  </P> <P> For Sally Dewald of Colton, who wanted a frosted-denim slit skirt, we have only  one reply. Barbara Myers of Claremont said a catalogue put out by Blair,  located in Warren, Pa. 16366, features some of these skirts. We have forwarded  that information to Dewald.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WAY TO PAY THE CLEANUP BILL  </P> <P> There are hundreds of thousands of underground gasoline storage tanks in  California and some of them are leaking. The cleanups will be messy. They will  also be costly.  </P> <P> Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency mandated that every tank owner  who sells fuel must furnish proof of financial responsibility up to $1 million.  One million dollars can be a lot of money for the average gas station owner.  </P> <P> At the time the federal regulations were enacted, the expectation was that  insurance companies would see the market and offer affordable policies to cover  tank operators in case of a leak. That has not happened. Instead, states across  the country have had to form their own schemes to pay the cleanup bill.  </P> <P> The standard approach has been to license underground tanks and use the  licensing fees to form a statewide cleanup fund. California's proposal, SB 299  sponsored by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), follows this pattern, charging $200  per license to create a cleanup fund of $24 million. What makes this proposal  especially attractive is that the bill mandates that small proprietors have  priority over larger companies, ensuring that the bulk of the fund will go to  help out the people who need it most.  </P> <P> Last year a similar bill was passed by the Legislature only to be vetoed by the  governor. The EPA deadline is now only a year away. If the bill fails this  year, hundreds of convenience stores and mom-and-pop gas stations will miss the  deadline and may go out of business.  </P> <P> Licensing underground storage tanks may not be a guaranteed vote-getter, but it  is good public policy.  </P></p>

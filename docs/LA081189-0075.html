			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'HE HAD A REAL LOOK OF VENGEANCE ON HIS FACE';  </P> <P> POSTAL CLERKS DESCRIBE THEIR TIME OF TERROR  </P> <P> Two postal workers were already dead outside and John Merlin Taylor was  marching into the Escondido postal station and up an aisle, wounding a third  employee and firing shots into the walls and ceiling.  </P> <P> "I saw John coming through the door," recalled Michael Collins, a 17-year  veteran of the U. S. Postal Service, describing the next few seconds of terror  Thursday morning.  </P> <P> "He had a look on his face, like, 'Everybody's going to die.' He had a real  look of vengeance on his face. He pointed through the door and started firing.  </P> <P> "I was frozen. I thought it was a joke. John was the last person I thought this  would happen with."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Model Employee'  </P> <P> Dressed in his postal uniform and described as a "model employee in a model  station," Taylor aimed the .22-caliber, semiautomatic Sturm Ruger pistol at  Collins.  </P> <P> "He pulled the trigger," said Collins, recalling how Taylor stood a few feet  away and leveled the barrel at him. "He pulled the trigger, but it didn't fire.  I don't know why."  </P> <P> As Taylor fumbled for more ammunition, Collins had to choose quickly between  disarming him and running. He ran.  </P> <P> "He was reloading when I ran through the door," Collins said. "I yelled at  everybody else to 'Get out! Get out! Get out!' "  </P> <P> According to Escondido police, the 52-year-old Taylor killed three people: his  wife at home, Elizabeth, and two close friends and fellow workers sitting on a  bench outside the suburban station, Ron Williams and Richard J. Berni.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wounds Clerk in Arm  </P> <P> He also wounded Paul DeRisi, a postal window clerk who took a bullet in the  left arm. Another postal employee, Phyllis DeVito, suffered serious facial cuts  and bruises when she fell head-first down a flight of stairs while scrambling  to leave the building and escape the gunfire.  </P> <P> Finally, Taylor turned the handgun on himself and fired a bullet into the right  side of his head.  </P> <P> Police said that, sometime before 7:35 a.m., Taylor shot his wife to death,  left his home and parked his gold, 1974 Plymouth Duster in the postal building  parking lot. It was about the time he arrived at the post office most workdays.  </P> <P> Each morning, he would meet co-workers Williams and Berni at a small park bench  outside the office, where they would drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. They  met there because smoking was not allowed inside, and they would talk about  sports, families and their jobs.  </P> <P> Williams had been shot once, struck slightly behind the forehead, his body  slumped over to the right of the table top. Berni was shot in the front part of  his body, and fell backward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Sign of Struggle  </P> <P> There was no sign of a struggle. A coffee cup rested on a chair, maybe spilled  a little. A newspaper, which apparently had been read once, was folded back  neatly.  </P> <P> Inside the station, the dozen employees heard the gunfire, but thought it was  either fireworks, a car backfiring or metal trays clattering.  </P> <P> DeRisi, a window clerk at the front counter, stepped back inside to check on  whether another worker had arrived when he spotted Taylor.  </P> <P> "John Taylor walked through the side door," said DeRisi, 30, who has worked  five years for the postal service.  </P> <P> "He had his arm up like he was waving. I said, 'Good morning,' and then I heard  a pop. I noticed he had a gun in his hand and the second shot went through my  arm."  </P> <P> Taylor was less than 50 feet from DeRisi when he fired. DeRisi staggered but  didn't fall.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize I was shot," he said. "I grabbed my arm, and I felt the  blood. I took off for the front door, and another bullet passed by me, on the  floor.  </P> <P> "I ran next door to a restaurant and told them to call the police. I sat down  outside and said to myself, 'Why John Taylor? Why is he doing this?' "  </P> <P> Others were also scrambling to get out, and station manager Bob Henley walked  outside his office to see what was wrong. He saw DeRisi bleeding from the arm,  running for the door. And then Henley looked right into the face of John  Taylor. And Taylor spoke to him.  </P> <P> "He said, 'I'm not going to shoot you,' " Henley recalled.  </P> <P> But he said Taylor fired the gun to the side, the bullet whizzing past him. "I  went back in and closed my office door," Henley said. "I called 911."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chamber Was Empty  </P> <P> In the hallway, Taylor spun around, spotted Collins, and attempted to shoot him  too. The trigger slammed, but the chamber was empty. Collins fled. Taylor  dropped the box of shells and two ammunition magazines he was carrying in his  other hand.  </P> <P> Reginald Keith, a postal custodian, saw Taylor begin to reload, and then he  watched him march down the hallway to the water foundation on the other side of  the building. By now, according to police, 15 to 20 shots had been fired, many  of them striking the walls and ceiling.  </P> <P> "It was startling," Keith said. "Some of the ammunition was spilled on the  floor. I think it was a clip that went on the floor. Then he walked right by  me. He had the gun pointed right at the floor. He kind of looked at me, but his  eyes were kind of dazed."  </P> <P> Postal clerk William Karlson, who had been standing in an aisle between  10-foot-high mail bundles, said Taylor walked right by the aisle without seeing  him.  </P> <P> "He looked so cold, so determined," Karlson said. "I thought he was still  looking for someone to shoot. I just tried to keep calm. I don't know if he  would have shot me or not."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shot Himself at Fountain  </P> <P> At the water fountain, he shot himself.  </P> <P> Another employee, Roger Hutchins, was screaming at workers to evacuate the  building, possibly saving lives in the process, Karlson said. Hutchins shadowed  Taylor's movements, and at one point talked to the gunman, Karlson said.  </P> <P> "He told him to put the gun down," Karlson said. "From what Roger told me, John  said, 'OK, I won't shoot you,' and walked away. Then he put the gun to his  head."  </P> <P> After Taylor shot himself, Hutchins kicked the gun away and checked Taylor for  a pulse. According to Chief Jimno, there was the barest beat.  </P> <P> Even before police arrived, 27-year-old postal worker David Canales was pulling  into the parking lot. He was late for work, and he could hear the gunfire.  </P> <P> Canales said he was confused. He normally sat outside with the three smokers --  Taylor, Williams and Berni. He would join in on the conversation, and would  have been there Thursday morning too had he not been late.  </P> <P> "I would have been dead too," he said.  </P> <P> Contributing to this report were Times staff writers Tom Gorman, Anthony  Millican and Lori Grange.  </P></p>

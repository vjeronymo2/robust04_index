			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: The Humana Festival, Louisville - Theatre 'Why do we have the Humana Festival? Because I live in Louisville, Kentucky, and I want to live in an interesting place.' Thus John Jory, producing director of the Actors Theatre of Louisville, explains the hidden agenda behind the Humana Festival of new American plays, which he founded 16 years ago and has now become America's premiere trade show. During Special Visitors Weekend, - 'big weekend' to locals, the penultimate weekend of the six-week festival - a dizzying array of agents, theatre professionals and critics from New York, Hollywood, the regions and abroad convene to sift through the festival's offerings looking for next season's hit. Most who came to Louisville to 'shop' this year were disappointed - a representative of one large dramatic publisher said it was the weakest for ten years. In purely theatre-business terms, few of the plays at Humana were viable products which could, in their present states, make it on to Broadway, but since Broadway is more interested in money than art, that says little about their artistic merit. Jory thinks that much of the exciting work in the American theatre is happening outside the mainstream and many non-traditional plays were featured in this year's festival. He will continue to present adventurous work in future festivals, whether commercial producers like it or not. The most exciting play in the festival was Jose Rivera's Marisol. Rivera's play is similar in scope and theme to Tony Kushner's Angels in America, now enjoying a successful run at the National Theatre in London. Both plays portray a pre-millennial America in such dire straits that angels come down to save it. While Kushner takes Aids as his central theme, Rivera addresses the alienation of minority cultures in urban America. Marisol (played by Karina Arroyave) is a young professional Puerto Rican American who denies her background every time she goes to work: 'I amputated neat sections of my cultural heritage . . . keeping so much pain so far deep inside my Manhattan bosses and Manhattan friends and my broken Bronx conscientiousness never even suspected.' Marisol lives in a New York where apples are extinct, the moon is hiding behind Saturn's rings, and her guardian angel deserts her to lead a celestial rebellion against God. No longer protected from the horrors of urban life, she wanders into a nightmare world of lunatics, neo-Nazis and credit card debt collectors. Rivera interweaves possible and impossible situations - some clearly imaginary, some familiar from the news, some, says the programme note, from Rivera's own life - constantly displacing the viewers' sense of what is real. Rivera succeeds in reminding the audience that Mirasol's world is becoming our own. But his message is one of hope. In the final moments of the play the angels are joined in their battle by 'the disenfranchised of the earth . . . the poor, the homeless, the frightened.' Mirasol's guardian angel - a butch black woman in leather and high-top sneakers - crowns herself lord of the new millennium and, in director Marcus Stern's final stroke of genius, stepped out of the world of the play into the theatre's elevator for her final exit. London's Royal Court has Mirasol, and American productions at La Jolla Playhouse in California and the New York Shakespeare Festival are in the works. Another highlight of the festival was Jane Anderson's Lynette at 3 O'Clock, co-winner of the National 10-Minute Play Contest. The play featured witty and well-wrought dialogue, and the Humana production had one flash of directorial inspiration: by slipping a bed on its side and standing the actors against it the viewers had the ceiling's eyeview of the sleepless Lynette and her boyfriend Bobby, which Anne O'Sullivan as the loopy Lynette exploited hilariously. The other Contest winner, Lanford Wilson's Eukiah, was a moody tale of deceit, well played by Mark Shannon and Shaun Powell; the third 10-Minute offering, Joyce Carol Oates' Procedure, a spare exploration of people's need to dull their responses to death. Both productions aspired and achieved modestly. Local audiences loved Marsha Norman's D. Boone, which celebrates Kentucky's hero Daniel Boone and refers heavily to Kentucky lore. Actors Theatre commissioned the play, which was funded by the Honourable Order of Kentucky Colonels, a charitable organisation. Norman's dialogue is witty and crisply written, but the play is troublingly schematic. The central character is a contemporary woman, Flo, who dislikes her world so much that she wills herself into the past to be with a perfect 'real man'  -Boone. The play becomes an uncomfortable mix of Back-to-the-Future caper and contemporary domestic drama, with various of Flo's suitors joining her in 18th century Boonesborough and finding therapy for their personal problems by helping Boone battle the Indians. Flo, though, never stops defining herself by the men around her, and some of Norman's other characterisations are equally troubling  - implacable Indians, and a gay museum curator who gains real man status in Boone's world. The two other festival plays addressing American history and culture were not nearly as slick as Norman's, but more admirable in intent and imagination. John Conklin's The Carving of Mount Rushmore is an investigation of the creative process, mixing historical monologues about the creation of the mountain monument with poetry, music, and visual images. Conklin, an accomplished designer, designed and directed the Humana production, which was certainly beautiful to look at, but came across more as a work-in-progress than a finished product. Evelyn and the Polka King, by book writer John Olive, lyricist Bob Lucas and composer Carl Finch, is also not finished yet, but could, when complete, trigger a renaissance of that most mid-Western of musical forms. Even Big Weekend's icy Saturday night audience was thawed by Hank Czerniak's (Tom Ligon) second-act sing-along, 'I lover to hear the vendor shout, kielbasa beer and sauerkraut.' The festival's more conventional productions were well-wrought and executed  -The Old Lady's Guide to Survival, by Mayo Simon, a funny and touching exploration of ageing and Alzheimer's, and Ross Maclean's Hyaena, a strongly gripping evocation of a world of twisted values that successfully forces viewers to re-evaluate their own. Under Mladen Kiselov's tight direction, William McNulty gave a harrowing performance as the Hyaena, a carer of the sick and dying who preys on their agony, and Michael Hartman excelled as his victim. Two one-acts, David Henry Hwang's Bondage and Suzan-Lori Parks' Devotees in the Garden of Love, presented under the heading 'Rites of Mating', were interesting but eventually unsatisfying experiments. Hwang and director Oskar Eustis investigated preconceptions about race by wrapping the performers, Asian-American actor BD Wong (Tony Award winner for his performance in Hwang's M. Butterfly) and Caucasian actor Kathryn Layng in full-length leather as they played out sexual fantasies based on the racial stereotypes in an S &amp; M parlour. Parks' rich language was the highlight of her play about disappointment in the courtship wars, whose meaning, however, remained opaque to most viewers.</p>

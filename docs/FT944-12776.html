			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US airlines The US airline industry no longer looks cyclical. Four years after the economic recovery began, the sector should be enjoying a boom. But last week's batch of third-quarter results was nothing to boast about - despite the fact that the quarter is traditionally the year's best and fuel costs remain low. Continental Airlines' net margins were just 2 per cent, while USAir was in the red. Even AMR, the strongest of the large carriers, achieved margins of only 5 per cent. The industry's big problem is the ease with which low-cost, low-fare airlines can enter the market offering no-frills services. Aircraft leases are cheap, trained pilots are available and few US airports have slot shortages. The low-cost groups control roughly a third of all capacity in the US. Their heavy price discounting has reduced yields - average revenue per passenger - throughout the industry. Some airlines, such as United and Continental, have responded by launching their own low-cost subsidiaries. The jury is still out whether they can create the right culture. Continental's failed to break even after a year, prompting the chief executive's resignation last week. Others such as American and Delta are concentrating on cutting costs. The problem is that such attempts at self-help will not return the industry to good health so long as aircraft manufacturers continue to subsidise financing and Chapter 11 protects airlines from bankruptcy. Until then, most airlines will be hard-pressed to earn decent returns on capital.</p>

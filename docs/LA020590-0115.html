			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> S. AFRICA WON'T END SCHOOL APARTHEID;  </P> <P> POLICY: TWO CABINET MINISTERS SAY NEIGHBORHOODS AND EDUCATION SHOULD BE DIVIDED  BY RACES. OTHERWISE, 'THERE WILL BE . . . CHAOS.'  </P> <P> The government remains committed to segregated neighborhoods and segregated  public schools despite President Frederik W. de Klerk's announcement of major  political reforms, two Cabinet ministers said today.  </P> <P> "Black people should be running their own education and white people should be  running their own education," said Stoffel van der Merwe, the white official  who oversees education for blacks.  </P> <P> Otherwise, he said, there will be "tremendous chaos."  </P> <P> Herman Kriel, minister of planning and provincial affairs, said the government  has no plans to repeal the Group Areas Act, which mandates racial segregation  of residential areas.  </P> <P> "We cannot allow the minorities that live here to be swamped by majority  decisions," he said. "We believe community life is a right."  </P> <P> The two ministers spoke at briefings for journalists covering the start of  Parliament. On Friday, in a historic speech opening the session, De Klerk  lifted bans on the African National Congress and other militant opposition  groups, declared a moratorium on executions, eased restrictions on the media  and pledged to free ANC leader Nelson R. Mandela soon.  </P> <P> De Klerk said his intention was to draw black leaders into negotiations on a  constitution that would extend political rights to the black majority. He said  Sunday the government would implement major constitutional changes only after  white voters were allowed to convey their views.  </P> <P> In a related matter, an attack on the British Embassy has increased fears that  white extremists may begin lashing out in anger at the sweeping political  changes proposed by De Klerk.  </P> <P> Assailants shot out windows at the embassy in Pretoria on Sunday, a day after  right-wing graffiti was spray-painted on the building. The graffiti said: "The  Struggle Begins -- Order of the Boer (Afrikaner) People."  </P> <P> Police said they have never heard of the group but are investigating.  </P> <P> "It is suspected that the attack by the right-wing might have come about  because we, the British government, have emphasized our support for the  decisions announced by President De Klerk," embassy spokesman John Sawyer said  today.  </P> <P> Right-wing whites accused the president of capitulating to the country's black  majority and have vowed to resist the changes.  </P> <P> Robert von Tonder, leader of a group that seeks a whites-only homeland, said De  Klerk's changes could lead to the formation of an underground guerrilla  movement for whites.  </P></p>

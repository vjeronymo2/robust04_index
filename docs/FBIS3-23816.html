The government forces, using arms, wiped from the  face of the earth a military barracks in the center of a densely  populated city. There were victims, including peaceful residents  who suffered.    And now the organizers and participants in this action will  have to face the court. The former chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of Azerbaijan Isa Gambarov and the ministers of defense  and internal affairs have been charged under two articles:  57-"prime," part 2, which indicates: "The use of armed forces  against the people" and envisions prison sentences of from 10 to  25 years, and also the death sentence. The second article is  less "terrible"--168-"prime"--exceeding one's authority. It  envisions up to seven years of isolation from the society. Also  charged under this article are the former procurator general,  the minister of national security, and his deputy.    This remains an open question so far: Were criminal charges  brought against former president Abulfaz Elchibey and former  prime minister Panakh Guseynov? But it is obvious that both of  them are out of the reach of the investigatory organs. The  former continues to live guarded by his supporters in his native  village of Keleki, and the latter is on the run and, according  to certain operational information, is outside the country.</p>

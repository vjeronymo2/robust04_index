			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / The feel-bad US factor A visitor from Britain who spends even a few days in the US is struck by parallels. In both countries a vigorous economic recovery is under way - in the US more than 3 1/2 years old. In both countries it has been accompanied by low consumer price inflation and even lower rises in producer prices. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the Bank of England governor, Eddie George, have spoken about the best chance in 30 years of achieving stable inflation-free growth. Yet the two countries conspicuously lack any feel-good factor. In the US this absence has been demonstrated not only by the sweeping Republican congressional victories but by an election campaign, nasty even by American standards. It was impossible to listen even to classical music radio channels without being interrupted by knocking copy advertisements on the lines of: 'Helen X is a liar. She says she is tough on crime. She voted three times against the death penalty.' Feel-bad is not only in the mind. I attended a Federal Reserve Bank of New York colloquium on wage trends which echoed widespread concern at growing 'pay inequality'. But would so many people worry about inequality if national pay levels had been rising sufficiently to bring up living standards of the bottom 20 or 30 per cent? The root problem is that average hourly pay peaked as long ago as 1978 and has since fallen by 14 per cent, with no improvement even in the current upturn. The conference papers concentrated on the rising premia for skill, education and experience; which leaves a lot to explain. I suspect clues are to be found in the less polite subjects of drugs and illegal immigration. Drug prohibition lies behind a good half of US crime, which in turn offers a more attractive, if high-risk, prospect to many young people than training for promotion in fast food outlets or supermarkets. Immigration helps to raise wages and reduce pay differentials in the North American continent but increases the differentials inside the US. The now-approved California Proposition 187, denying social services to illegal immigrants, is a characteristic feel-nasty response. The Clinton team helped to bring nemesis on itself by its 1992 election slogan 'It's the economy, stupid' - itself a stupid slogan. This not only made the boom look like a slump. Much worse: it whipped up already unrealistic expectations of how much government action could achieve. These disappointed expectations have been transformed into a vicious hatred of everything to do with government, except the subsidies and payouts it distributes. The similarities between the US and the UK extend to monetary policy. Both the Fed and the Bank of England have tightened policy and are expected to tighten further, not because of actual inflation, but preemptively. There are two sets of indicators which trigger US inflation alarms. First there are signs of excessive growth. Real GDP has been rising at over 3 1/2 per cent per annum - maybe more - well above the estimated trend rates of 2 1/2 per cent. And, in contrast to the UK, official estimates show that the recession's slack has already been more than absorbed and that capacity utilisation is above normal. Unemployment is, at 5.8 per cent, below the best guess for the 'natural rate' above which inflation is supposed to accelerate. Those sceptical of macroeconomics can point to a second set of warning signals from the markets. Dollar commodity prices have risen by more than 30 per cent this year. This has been paralleled by a much less spectacular rise in the inflation rate for non-food intermediate materials, from below 0 at the turn of the year to above 3 1/2 per cent. The dollar has fallen by well over 10 per cent against major currencies; and bond yields have increased by over 2 percentage points. But the gold price has not risen. Greenspan attributes the rise in bond rates to deep-seated forces. Like many central bankers he worries most about the budget, saying in a recent speech that 'entitlements are programmed to grow at a rate that will surely exceed the growth of the tax base'. Even the Congressional Budget Office, which is more pessimistic than the Administration, does not expect the federal deficit to exceed 2 1/2 per cent of GDP in the years immediately ahead. But there are widespread fears that the growth of social security payments and existing Medicare programmes, could, as the population ages, push the deficit up towards 10 per cent early in the next century. Greenspan spoke of 'higher long-term bond rates with both a greater inflation premium and an expectation of higher real short-term rates in the future as government spending increasingly crowds out private spending'. The Clinton Administration intends to make the most of Republican rhetoric about fiscal responsibility. But, in common with many in the financial markets, it draws only limited comfort from the Republican commitment to a balanced budget constitutional amendment. As this has Democrat support as well, its chances are higher than they have ever been. But the texts in circulation lack a means of enforcement; and nearly all the specific items in the Republican 10-point 'Contract', used as a sort of manifesto during the congressional elections, pledge either spending increases or tax reductions. The more realistic hopes of the budget worriers centre round the report of the Commission on budget entitlements chaired by Senator Bob Kerry (Democrat, Nebraska) due soon to report. One idea is that the pension age should be indexed to the actuarial expectation of life at the relevant age. There are those who say that, for all its fiscal worries, the Fed itself has been 'behind the curve' in its own monetary area. The Fed funds rate - the one interest rate under its direct control - has hovered around 4 3/4 per cent, only about 2 percentage points above the inflation rate and remarkably low so far into an expansion. Henry Kaufman, the noted New York analyst, has said even a funds rate 100 basis points higher would not be sufficient to bring the growth rate down to trend. The Fed Open Market Committee meets tomorrow; and David Hale of Kemper Financial Services plausibly suggests there is a 95 per cent chance it will increase short-term rates by at least 50 basis points and a 50 per cent chance it will increase them by 75 to 100 basis points. Meanwhile short-term commercial paper rates have risen well above the Federal funds rate in anticipation.</p>

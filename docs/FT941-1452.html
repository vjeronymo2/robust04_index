			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Economy is vulnerable to unrest The size of Mexico's current account deficit, put last year at more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn), has left it highly dependent on capital inflows from foreign investors. Thus the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio presages a period of uncertainty for Mexico's financial markets which could have important consequences for the country's economy. With the passage in November of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the US and Canada and its coming into force at the start of this year, many foreign investors had expected to avoid the financial uncertainty which is usual in Mexico during an election year. However, this optimistic outlook was shaken by the unexpected peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, which started on New Year's Day, and by the uncertainty that it generated in the Mexican political system. Mr Colosio's murder has dealt a further blow to this confidence, and though Mexico's own markets were closed yesterday - in an attempt to reduce financial market volatility - the prices of Mexican assets dropped sharply in New York. The Mexican economic programme sponsored by Mr Carlos Salinas and Mr Pedro Aspe, his finance minister, was built on fiscal rectitude, a dramatic privatisation programme and a guarantee of economic stability ostensibly offered by Nafta. Critics have seen its weakness in its dependence on foreign capital - to support big current account deficits - and the policy of a strong exchange rate to try to squeeze inflation out of the system. Furthermore, while inflation was brought down to single digits by the end of last year, growth also sunk to zero. 'They have tried to force a double-digit economy to have single-digit inflation,' argued Mr Paul Luke, chief emerging markets researcher at Morgan Grenfell in London. Joining Nafta this year was widely expected to allow the country to become a member of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, the so-called rich man's club of industrialised nations. It was also expected to presage its upgrading by the main US rating agencies as an investment grade credit, significantly widening the potential investor base for Mexican bonds. 'A country that appeared on the verge of investment grade and joining the OECD suffers its first political assassination since the ruling party took over in 1929. It's clear that the political agenda is longer than the markets thought,' said Mr Luke. The only US rating agency to assign an investment grade rating to Mexico's sovereign debt - Duff &amp; Phelps - said yesterday that while volatility in Mexican financial markets could be expected in the aftermath of the assassination, Mexico's stable political institutions and fundamental good economic management justified the retention of its rating. Financial markets were indeed volatile. The price of Mexican shares trading in international markets was marked down by 10 per cent in London trading, while the price of the country's Brady bonds - issued as part of its last restructuring - also fell sharply. But there was some recovery of shares in later New York trading. According to Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns in New York, Mexican issues traded in the US were 2-7 per cent down at mid-session yesterday. Mr John Purcell, head of emerging market research at Salomon Brothers, said the market in New York appeared to be calming as the day progressed, helped by statements from President Bill Clinton and widespread confidence in the ability of the Mexican administration to deal with the crisis, he said. There would be some nervousness today as the markets reopened in Mexico, however. The Mexican peso also weakened but, in the absence of the Mexico City market, trading was thin and quotes hard to get. Mr Dennis said he believed the peso would trade close to its floor of 3.36 to the dollar today, making some intervention by the Mexican central bank necessary to keep it within its permitted band. 'I think the peso may test its floor, but I expect it will stay within the band,' said Mr Lawrence Brainard of Goldman Sachs in New York. Mexican reserves were last reported at Dollars 29bn, giving some confidence that even a sustained attack on the peso could be withstood. The US has pledged to provide support for the peso if necessary. Mexican interest rates were also expected to rise to defend the currency, although if they stayed too high too long, this would conflict with the government's other imperative of trying to revive the weak economy. A quick announcement of the replacement candidate - most financial market observers appeared to favour the nomination of former budget minister, Mr Ernesto Zedillo - would also benefit stability.</p>

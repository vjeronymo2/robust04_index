			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Fables and foibles of the old year: FT writers select the best books for the business reader in 1994 The new year looks set to be the year of the political short game, on both sides of the Atlantic. And when governments are looking for ways to boost their popularity - as they are in the UK and US - inflation hawks get worried. They might be reassured by Bob Woodward's account of President Bill Clinton's first year in office, which describes how an expansionist Democrat was turned into a deficit hawk. The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House (Simon &amp; Schuster) tells of how political ideals run up against economic reality. More surprisingly, it is an account of how the economic authorities went out of their way to help. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, went beyond the strict call of duty in convincing Mr Clinton of the benefits of winning the markets' trust. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Clinton's first treasury secretary, and Mr Robert Rubin, Mr Bentsen's successor, gave able support. The selling of Mr Clinton's political agenda, by contrast, was all too haphazard. A leftish administration - say, the Labour party in Britain  - should perhaps take note. There were more valuable economics lessons in Russell Roberts' The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism (Prentice Hall). Paul Samuelson, Nobel laureate in economics, described the theory of comparative advantage as the only proposition in social science that is both true and non-trivial. Unfortunately, few people understand it. In a fascinating fable, Roberts renames comparative advantage the 'roundabout way to wealth'. Explaining this idea in the book is David Ricardo, the inventor of the theory, sent back after death to turn the US of 1960 away from a protectionist path. His audience is Ed Johnson, chief executive officer of Stellar Television, a company threatened by Japanese imports. Johnson is also the moving spirit in a campaign to stop imports into the US. Ricardo takes Johnson to Rahway, New Jersey, to show him a television factory of the future. 'Where's the television factory?' asks Johnson. 'You're looking at it.' 'But the sign says Merck and Co, Inc, a pharmaceutical company. Doesn't that mean they make drugs?' 'Indeed, they do, Ed. They send some of those drugs to Japan. In return Japan sends America televisions.' If you want to understand comparative advantage read this book. It is brilliantly conceived. P J O'Rourke is no economist. But All The Trouble in the World (Picador), probably contains more economic home truths than most economic treatises. Auberon Waugh (of all people) complains that this author cannot make up his mind whether he is a humorist, or means it. But he is funny and in this book takes us to Third World jungles that most of us would rather visit from an armchair. His conclusion is: 'Money is preferable to politics. It is the difference between being free to be anybody you want and being free to vote for anybody you want.' His explanation for contemporary miseries is that the advance of society has merely produced people like himself - or the reader. O'Rourke is more pithy than the World Bank, to whom we can turn for the subtleties and qualifications. But if any one would like the same point of view in good-humoured, but straightforward, form then read No, Prime Minister by Ralph Harris (IEA Occasional Paper). This consists of newspaper articles from 1965 to the present, all of which are still easily accessible today. For those more interested in the Square Mile, David Kynaston has provided a fascinating insight into British financial history. The City of London: A World of Its Own, 1815-1890 (Chatto), the first volume of his three-part work on the Square Mile, is a splendidly readable account, wonderful on the sociology of 19th century banking and broking, and the development of City institutions. The book appeals as much to the general reader as to the specialist, not least for the indirect light it casts on Dickens and Trollope. The later volumes will do well to match the standard of this first offering. Indispensable in a different way is Jonathan Charkham's comparative study of corporate governance in the US, Japan, Germany, France and Britain. Keeping Good Company: A study of corporate governance in five countries (OUP) is a masterly overview by a former adviser to the governor of the Bank of England. Mr Charkham's book is unlikely to be bettered, either for its description of how management is held to account (or not, as the case may be) in the five countries, or for the judicious assessment of the merits of the respective systems of governance. Corporate-level strategy: creating value in the multi-business company (John Wiley &amp; Sons) touches on some of the same issues from the narrower perspective of the business manager. The authors, Michael Goold, Andrew Campbell and Marcus Alexander, argue that most big companies are 'value destroyers', because they do not have a proper strategy for 'parenting' their subsidiaries. Bosses should decide which of three fundamental 'parenting styles' is best suited to their mix of businesses, and apply it consistently to all. If individual subsidiaries do not fit this approach, it is easier to change the portfolio than the style. Despite its length, this book's basic message does not stretch far beyond that of Goold &amp; Campbell's original, and influential, Strategies &amp; Styles. But it offers a wider spread of case histories, and many practical ways of implementing its theories. Parent-company managers will find it helpful. Reviews by Malcolm Rutherford, Martin Wolf, Samuel Brittan, John Plender and Peter Martin.</p>

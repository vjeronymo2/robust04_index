The Kremlin is frankly  claiming its sphere of influence in eastern and central Europe,  where Russians think that Washington has nothing to do. Under  such circumstances, the Chisinau officials plead for neutrality;  this gesture is equivalent to "an act of national suicide," the  quoted source asserts. President Snegur signs the adherence to  the NATO program Partnership for Peace, and then tells Moscow,  Tiraspol, and Comrat that this "will not make the Republic of  Moldova orient itself toward the West and that it will remain a  neutral state." The adherence to the Partnership for Peace  requests the abandoning of the neutral policy in the prospect of  gradual integration in European military structures. The  Romanian space has always sought a support in the West, and when  it could not find one, it had losses: An example is the loss of  Bessarabia and Transylvania by [Romania's King] Carol II in  1940. In the situation when both sides want the expansion of  their territory of influence, "our incorporation into the free  world" is mandatory. Otherwise, the present state of this  territory will degenerate in a free fall into the chasm of  history, the author believes.</p>

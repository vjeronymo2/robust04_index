			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Deak, Hungarian Army chief of staff </F> and nominee to the position of army commander, by Attila  Zsoldos; place and date not given: "Damaged NATO Aircraft in  Hungary?"]    [Text] The Defense Committee of the Hungarian parliament  held a hearing for Lieutenant General Janos Deak and unanimously  supported his nomination to the position of commander of the  Hungarian Army. In the course of this hearing, among other  things, Janos Deak declared that the leadership of the Hungarian  Army should consider the situation in Bosnia and prepare for any  possible consequences.    [Deak] If NATO intervention takes place in Bosnia, we will  have to prepare to deal with a possible influx of refugees. It  is also possible that allied combat aircraft might get damaged  in the course of their action and will be unable to return to  their base in Aviano in Italy, and it could happen that they  land in Hungary. I am not thinking of the development of an  armed incident along our southern border; this is in the  interest of neither the Croats nor the Serbs, so there is no  such danger. However, in the event of intervention, anything  can happen and we must prepare for this.    [Zsoldos] From a military point of view, in your opinion, is  intervention in Bosnia inevitable?    [Deak] Several versions are possible. It is possible that  there will be no need for intervention, because the sides  involved in the conflict fulfill the UN demands. If they only  partially fulfill the demands, the armed conflict could still be  called off. However, there is a chance of military intervention  too.    [Zsoldos] If such intervention takes place, what measures  should be taken along our southern border?    [Deak] In such a case, it is the task of the border police  to "handle" the expected influx of refugees. The army should  increase its radio surveillance so as to have a clear picture of  the situation.    [Zsoldos] Have you worked out any special crisis management  plan?    [Deak] No. The Hungarian Army would act in accordance with  crisis management plan adopted by the late prime minister and  the president of the republic two years ago.</p>

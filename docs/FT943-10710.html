			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: NZ Rail impresses New Zealand Rail, which was bought last year by a consortium led by US-based Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation, yesterday announced a tax-paid profit of NZDollars 38.86m (USDollars 23.55m) for the year to June 30, up 130 per cent on the previous year's NZDollars 16.87m, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The company, which has overcome a long industrial dispute over manning levels and 24-hour operations for the Cook Strait ferries, said it intended to buy a high-speed ferry for the link between the north and south islands.</p>

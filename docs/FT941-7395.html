			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Aircraft orders boost US durable goods New orders for US durable goods rose 3.7 per cent between December and January - more than expected in financial markets - but the figures were distorted by a surge in aircraft orders, which are volatile on a monthly basis. Excluding transport, orders rose 0.3 per cent, suggesting a weakening in the rate of industrial growth since late last year. Excluding defence orders as well as transport, orders declined 0.2 per cent. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the jump in aircraft orders - which nearly tripled between December and January - was good news for the still-depressed Californian economy. He said the figures did not include any of the new orders expected from Saudi Arabia following the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) deal struck this month between President Bill Clinton and King Fahd. Some analysts had feared that a big jump in durable goods orders would cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. Yesterday, however, the relative weakness of non-transport orders was seen as further evidence that the pace of growth had slowed to a more sustainable pace after a surge in the final quarter of last year. Reports yesterday of another increase in weekly claims for unemployment insurance, to 378,000, was seen as confirming a deceleration in the pace of job creation. However, the data on both jobless claims and civilian orders may have been adversely affected by recent very cold weather. The increase in durable orders in the year to January was 12.6 per cent, reflecting strong gains in the second half of 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>   [Excerpts] As of 1400 yesterday, the Palestinians in the  Gaza Strip have been running their own lives.    Thirty-four civilian offices were handed over to the  Palestinians in a lengthy ceremony held at the Civil  Administration's new offices in the Erez industrial zone, and  the Israeli Civil Administration in the Gaza Strip officially  became the civilian liaison center between Israel and the  Palestinians.    The civilian Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip is  headed by Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, and  Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun. The three will operate out of a new office  set up near the Palestinian police building in Gaza.  Forty-eight vehicles to be used by the Palestinian Authority  arrived in the Gaza Strip yesterday from Egypt.    The first decisions passed by the Palestinian Authority were  to declare Friday the official day of rest and the days of Id  al-Adha a holiday. [passage omitted]    After an initial meeting between the sides, representatives  of the Israeli offices and their Palestinian counterparts  proceeded to sign the transfer of powers. Representatives of 34  offices -- transportation, education, treasury, interior,  health, and others -- spent four long hours signing the letters  of empowerment written in English.    The civilian powers were officially handed over to the  Palestinians after Brigadier General Dov Gazit, head of the  Civil Administration, and Palestinian representative Frayj  al-Khayri signed the letters.

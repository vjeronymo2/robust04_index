			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Plenty of free lunches in Kuwait campaign ELECTIONS are an inflationary business in Kuwait. For one thing, the cost of buying a vote has rocketed since the last poll in 1985 - and the price of sheep has doubled. No one admits to buying votes or to having been bought, of course. But equally, everyone believes that it happens, if on a small scale. By common reckoning the going rate today is anything up to KD3,000 (Pounds 6,000) a vote, against a modest KD300 for the last elections. In Kuwait, there are just 25 constituencies, 50 seats in the National Assembly and only 81,400 voters. Whatever the truth to vote-buying accusations, it is clear that a lot of money could go a long way towards securing a candidate's election. Most constituencies average only around 2,000-3,000 voters and the smallest, on the country's southern border, has just 896, along with five candidates and, doubtless, a delighted returning officer. But small constituencies do not, in Kuwait at least, make for cheap campaigns. By one western embassy's calculation the average candidate has spent around KD160,000 on his campaign, and some probably spend much more than that, though a straw poll puts the average expenditure at nearer KD50,000. For comparison, British candidates are allowed to spend Pounds 4,330 plus up to 4.9p per voter. Kuwait has no election rules limiting spending or sources of funds and most candidates finance themselves. Except, allege opposition groups, some pro-government candidates. 'Strange things happen,' says Mr Abdulla Nibari, leader of the Kuwait Democratic Forum (KDF), a liberal opposition group. 'Some candidates who are known to have no wealth of their own - their expenditure is surprisingly extravagant.' But then Mr Nibari's group is campaigning on political idealism and a shoestring. He reckons the cost of running the KDF's nine candidates will be no more than KD50,000, with volunteers pitching in their time, spare telephones, portable cabins and anything else which will help. For most candidates the money goes on buying newspaper advertisements, erecting placards which line the streets in Kuwait City, hiring staff and setting up Bedouin-style tents which candidates use as campaign headquarters. Which is where the price of sheep comes in. Most campaign tents offer refreshment. At a modest KDF tent in the Jabria constituency, Mr Mohammed al Fadil, the campaign manager, says they can run only to felafel and soft drinks. 'We're a bit tired of felafel after three weeks.' Less than 100 metres up the road, however, a rival candidate, Mr Ali Omar, offers in the shade of a 60-metre-long tent a 60-metre-long buffet. Waistcoated waiters - some of Mr Omar's 300 campaign staff, a number equivalent to 10 per cent of his constituency's electorate - preside over tables of steaming lamb and rice dishes. From a separate mini-marquee, waiters bustle back and forth bearing trays of orange and grapefruit juice, Pepsi and tea. The bigger campaigns, and Mr Omar's is not the biggest, serve hundreds of meals every night to thousands of voters who gather to chew over the issues. And at Kuwait's main livestock market at Shuwaikh, traders are delighted. 'Business is profitable,' explained one dealer who yesterday shifted 100 Syrian sheep at a mark-up he put at 100 per cent. Over the three weeks of the campaign, the price of an average sheep has risen from KD25-35 to upwards of KD60. The Commercial Bank of Kuwait has won a US lawsuit against Iraq's two main banks, charging they defaulted on Dollars 1bn of loans after the 1990 invasion, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The Kuwaiti bank sought Dollars 60m plus interest from the Central Bank of Iraq and from Rafidain Bank, a state-owned commercial bank. It was part of several loan syndicates that loaned more than Dollars 1bn to Iraq between 1983 and 1988. Iraq stopped making repayments in 1990. The lawsuits raise the delicate issue of what the Bush administration plans to do with Iraqi assets frozen in the US.</p>

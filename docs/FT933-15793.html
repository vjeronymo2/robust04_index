			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT Granada's acquisition of a further slice of LWT only makes sense as a stepping-stone to the wider restructuring of commercial television. As a trade investment alone the holding hardly makes sense, not least because Granada is buying LWT shares at an unusually large price-earnings premium. The financial risk is limited if Granada is eventually forced to sell back to the market. But that would still tarnish the record of Mr Gerry Robinson, which has been unblemished since he took the helm. Mr Robinson's reading of government is clearly that an industry rationalisation is on the cards. He is betting his reputation as well as cash on that outcome.</p>

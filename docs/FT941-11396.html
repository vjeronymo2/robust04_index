			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: Dead Funny - Theatre It has been a good week for British comedy. After John Godber's April in Paris at the Ambassadors comes the premiere of Terry Johnson's Dead Funny at the Hampstead Theatre. Johnson is becoming a prolific playwright. Hysteria, his piece about Sigmund Freud and Salvador Dali, was shown at the Royal Court only last autumn. Dead Funny is more down to earth. Although Freud is still mentioned and medical science is never far away, this is a play about relatively normal people in Islington, 1992. Richard, a handsome consultant obstetrician, returns late for dinner, having performed five hysterectomies in the course of the day and stopped in the pub on the way back. He is not drunk, just nervous, for it is Wednesday - the night for sex therapy at home. However good Richard may be as a surgeon, he has come to find his slightly older wife (41 to his 38) physically repellant. Tonight the therapy may be working. A naked Richard lies reluctantly on the floor while his wife tries to stir him. Then the doorbell rings and in comes a neighbour, Brian, to announce that Benny Hill, the comedian, is dead. I shan't go on with the plot except to say that in parts of Islington - clearly a classless society - the news is quite as shocking as (say) the death of the Queen Mother. Richard is a leading light in the Dead Funny Society, which reveres a long line of stand-up British comics: Jimmy James, Max Wall, Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd - the lot. The rest of the play is about how - appropriately - to pay tribute to Benny. In the course of it, the sexual hang-ups of his admirers emerge. There are only five characters on stage. The sole non-admirer is Richard's wife, Eleanor, played by Zoe Wanamaker. Ms Wanamaker is a wonderful actress. She personifies sexual frustration without the slightest inhibition. Her eyes can be fierce: she can exude venom with the tiniest movement of a nostril. Sometimes she looks as if she has developed a technique of conveying a whole facial expression from the top of her nose. She can also smile with a tear in her eye. This is a marvellously disciplined performance, even though - perhaps to tip the balance in favour of the Dead Funny Society - she does not always have the best lines. The other outstanding performance, the full extent of which is held back until after the interval, is Niall Buggy's Brian. In Act 1 he is bumbling, officious, fussy lower class camp. In Act 2 he comes out. 'Benny,' he announces, 'was gay - and so am I' He has bought a ticket to Amsterdam to celebrate, but tears it up and ends consoling Eleanor. What they both want, they say, is 'a nice young man, preferably virile, possibly the same one'. There are additional delights in the plot. A defect is that, as in Hysteria, Johnson is not always sure what genre he is working in. He moves into farce and out of it for no obvious reason. But Dead Funny is bursting with life. Johnson directs, and the excellent set is designed by Sue Plummer. Hampstead Theatre. Tel (071) 722 9301</p>

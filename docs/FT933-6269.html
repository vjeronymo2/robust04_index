			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / The Long View: From boom to doom PENDING Barry Riley's return from holiday next week he has arranged for a number of distinguished guest experts to contribute, in brief, their current views on the booming stock markets. Stanley G. Sachs At last the stock market has ceased to focus on trailing price / earnings ratios which are depressed by bottom-of-cycle provisioning, especially by outdated dinosaur companies like IBM, and instead investors are beginning to anticipate the coming earnings boom. This will arise from the benign influences of low inflation, resumed economic growth and low interest rates. Meanwhile our composite value indicators and our bond-equity yield ratio measures show no strain. Many equity market analysts have made the error of comparing current conditions with the 1970s or the 1980s. In fact there are much better precedents from the 1960s, when inflation and interest rates were low, growth was steady, and equity values were very high. We see the Dow Jones Average at 5,000 and the London Footsie at 4,000 within 18 months. Dr Mort Duhm No less than 22 of my 23 regular indicators of value are now approaching critical levels in most markets, to an even greater extent than in 1987. For instance, the price / earnings ratio is in excess of 25 on Wall Street, and only marginally lower in London. Dividend yields are historically unattractive, and moreover dividend cover is exceptionally weak. Corporate earnings prospects are not nearly good enough to justify the current stratospheric valuations. The boom in stock prices, and the sustainability of low dividend yields, has depended critically upon the fall in global bond yields, which in turn has relied heavily upon the willingness of the US Federal Reserve to pump vast quantities of cheap credit into the US banking system. Within the next few months I anticipate a meltdown in which the Fed will turn down the tap, hot money will panic out of bonds and stock prices will become value-based and not liquidity-driven. Hold on to your crash helmets. Hector Dow-Elliott European markets are still within their reverse triangle pattern and are re-entering the longer-term trend channel from which they will break out upwards so long as the neckline of the head-and-shoulders formation is not penetrated by the 120-day moving average before the end of September, on the basis of the FTA Europe ex UK Index. When the DAX breaks 2,000 with strength the next upward leg will be confirmed but hesitation at 1,950 would indicate a switch into the CAC subject to the satisfactory completion of a consolidation pattern and the abortion of the threatened upside-gap two crows on the Japanese candlestick charts. However, if the Finnish HEX outlines a double top at 1,500 and thus reaches its theoretical Fibonacci target all bets will be off. Morgan Schroderburg Too many investors have underestimated the secular fall in inflation and the extent of the loosening of monetary policy, certainly in the US and Japan, if not yet in Europe. I believe the uptrend in equity markets has some way to go, but disappointing economic growth next year may lead to a setback. For companies, I would point out that the next six months may represent a rare window for raising new capital or floating off poorly-performing subsidiaries (which we prefer to describe as 'non-core') at unusually attractive prices. As for investors, my advice would be to to remain fully invested but to avoid new flotations or companies that raise new capital. Rhys Mogg-Williams Consensus economists have been thrown completely off balance by the sluggishness of the global economy and the (to them) mysterious collapse of inflation. As far as the stock market is concerned, investors have been unable to adapt to the fall in long-term interest rates which they ignorantly assume must result in higher equity valuations. However, the current conjunction of the downswings in the Kondratieff and Juglar cycles is plainly creating industrial havoc in the Western world. In the context of chronic excess capacity, many production industries are being devastated by Third World competition and even the protection of domestic brand names is becoming almost worthless, as we have seen with Philip Morris and Procter &amp; Gamble. Technological progress will begin to create splendid new opportunities later in the 1990s as the next Kondratieff upswing develops, but meanwhile investors will be sadly disappointed. Murray Henderson In our view the latest upward breaks in most markets should not distract attention from the scope for sector rotation. Although the general switch from blue chips into small company stocks recommended at the beginning of the year may have matured, our special situations fund is still performing very well. As for recovery stocks, in fact there is now an opportunity to profit from the cheapness of pharmaceuticals shares through our Health and General fund. For those who are worried about poorer values in the leading markets - concerns not shared, incidentally, by our top fund managers - we have a number of attractive suggestions, including our Managed Futures Fund, our Emerging Markets Trust, on which there is a 2 per cent discount for the rest of this month, and our brand new China Millennium Fund. George Palindrome Normally I refrain from making stock market forecasts in public because I might be accused of undermining the capitalist system through speculation. Also, my 1987 prediction of a Tokyo market collapse proved embarrassing. Now that there are no more soft exchange rate targets to aim at, however, I consider I am justified in taking stock market positions again. I am extremely bullish of the US, Japanese and European markets, and I shall continue to hold this view in public until the day after I have sold out.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / US compromise on gays set to draw fire: Clinton backs away from campaign pledge to end ban on homosexuals in military PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday at last announced his policy on gays serving in the armed forces, 'an honourable compromise' that falls far short of his campaign promise to end the ban on homosexuality in the armed services but which seeks to end military witchhunts against gays. Mr Clinton told an audience of senior officers that the new policy would judge servicemen and women on their conduct rather than their sexual orientation, and would continue the practice he instituted at the beginning of his presidency of not asking recruits if they were homosexual. Anyone openly declaring themselves to be gay would create a 'rebuttable presumption' of an intention to breach military conduct rules; these conduct rules would be enforced uniformly against heterosexuals and homosexuals, 'with decent regard to the privacy and associational rights of all members'. 'It is not a perfect solution. It is not identical with some of my own goals, and will clearly not please everyone, perhaps not anyone,' Mr Clinton said. A senior administration official described the new policy, which has won the grudging acquiescence of the joint chiefs of staff, as 'don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue'. They said any attempt to lift the ban on homosexuals in the forces outright would have been overridden by Congress. 'I think that any reasonable reading of where the Congress is at this point would lead you to think that it would be almost impossible to sustain a complete lifting of the ban,' a senior administration official said. 'In all honesty, I must say that I do not think the proposal I would like him to put forward would be sustained,' agreed Mr Barney Frank, one of Congress's two openly gay members, adding that he believed Mr Clinton had been 'very courageous' in taking on the issue. But even the limited measures proposed yesterday may be too much for Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, who carries considerable clout in the Senate both because of his expertise on military questions and because of his leadership of a bloc of southern conservatives. Mr Nunn, who was largely responsible for derailing Mr Clinton's efforts to dispose of the issue quickly at the start of his presidency, is expected to seek today to write some of the existing prohibitions against homosexuality into law as a rider to this year's defence authorisation bill. Besides a protracted battle in Congress, gay advocacy groups are now expected to press a number of lawsuits contesting the military ban.</p>

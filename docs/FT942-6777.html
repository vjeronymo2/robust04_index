			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Tourist interest in gardens increases Museums are losing their appeal as tourist attractions while gardens have benefited from an increase in visitors, the British Tourist Authority said yesterday. Numbers visiting UK museums and galleries fell 1 per cent last year, but visits to gardens rose by 6 per cent. Hampton Court in south-west London was the most popular garden with 1.1m visitors in 1993. The Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire topped the table of visitor attractions that charge for admission with 2.6m. Second was the London waxworks museum Madame Tussaud's (2.4m) and third was the Tower of London (2.3m). The top two, and sixth-placed Chessington World of Adventures, belong to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Visits to leisure parks were up 4 per cent compared with 1992, while workplaces - such as whisky distilleries and the Cadbury World chocolate factory - were up 5 per cent. The most popular attractions in terms of numbers were Blackpool Pleasure Beach and the Wembley Stadium complex in west London which each had 6.75m visitors last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a provincial meeting on party schools and  education for party members held yesterday, provincial party  Secretary Yin Kesheng pointed out: CPC committees at all levels  must attach importance to the overall ideological work, and  truly strengthen their leadership over party schools. They must  actively explore new ways for education of party members to  further give play to the role of fighting bastions of party  organizations at all levels, and the vanguard role of the broad  masses of party members.    Yin Kesheng added: At present, our reforms have entered a  stage of taking strong fortifications characterized by the  integration of overall advance with major breakthroughs. New  situations and tasks have set new and more demands on the level  of our theories, policies, knowledge, and work. Using Marxism,  and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics in particular, to arm all party members  and cadres is now more urgent than at any time in the past.    Yin Kesheng continued: In recent years, party schools and  organization departments of CPC committees at all levels in our  province and relevant departments have conscientiously  implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress. They  have made marked achievements in using the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm all party members.  The fighting bastions role of party organizations at all  levels, and the vanguard role of the broad masses of party  members have been further brought into play. In the meantime,  however, we must soberly realize that under the new situation,  some new problems have occurred. The broad masses of our party  members and cadres are facing a new and severe test. The more  we do to promote reform and opening up and develop the economy,  the more we must do to consciously strengthen party building,  stick to the correct political orientation, and increase our  sense of responsibility and urgency to arm the entire party with  the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Yin Kesheng stressed: Party schools are schools for  educating and training party members and cadres under the  leadership of the CPC committees. The work for party schools  must conform with the demands of the new situations and tasks.  The key in this regard lies in deepening reform. At present  and for a period to come, while carrying out reform in party  schools, we must devote our efforts to enhance the  applicability, aims, and efficiency of the teaching content.  Solving difficult and key problems arising in reform, opening  up, economic construction and teaching should be treated as a  focal point in the scientific research work of party schools.  We must make efforts to establish a teachers' contingent noted  for its fine quality, strong party character, correct study  style, and worthiness of the name of teachers.    While talking about the issue of education for party  members,  Yin Kesheng pointed out: With regard to education for party  members, we must persist in combining theory with practice, and  strengthen the applicability of the education. We must persist  in mainly educating by positive measures, and giving full play  to the exemplary role of outstanding party members. We must  persist in differentiating one kinds of student from another,  and providing education at different levels. We must persist in  organically combining education for party members with control  and supervision over them. In the meantime, we must persist in  laying our stress on constructive work, and treating the work of  benefiting party members as a foundation of our education to  establish and improve the system and mechanisms for party  members' education to push our province's education for party  members to a new level.    Yin Kesheng called on CPC committees, party work organs, and  leading cadres at all levels to approach the issue of party  schools and education for party members from the high plane of  the strategy for building socialist modernization and a lengthy  and peaceful era in our country to truly put these issues on  their important work agenda. They must clearly understand the  situation and their tasks, and work in a down-to-earth manner to  create a new situation in the development of party schools and  education for party members in our province.</p>

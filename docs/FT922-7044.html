			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Letter: UK must counter ageism in Europe (2) Sir, Your report on the policy of ageism suggests that the EC's policy is as irrelevant and 'stupid' as the employment minister, Michael Forsyth, implies. The notion of 'jobs for life', which is suggested by the proposed Brussels policy, has largely disappeared, but so has 'over the hill at 40'. The minister was right to point out that the recession has resulted in experienced and talented people in mid-career being made redundant, but being in mid-career is not necessarily proving a stumbling block in finding new jobs. A recent survey by my company found that less than 20 per cent of client respondents aged between 40 and 55 quoted age as a barrier to new appointments. Increasingly employers are recognising the benefits of maturity. W G Methven, 26 Park Row, Leeds LS1 5QB</p>

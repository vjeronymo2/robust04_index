			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Food falls Pounds 0.8m into red Reorganisation and restructuring costs totalling Pounds 684,000 pushed Yorkshire Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated in March last year, Pounds 780,000 into the red in the first half. However, turnover for the six months to June 24 advanced by 72 per cent from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 50.6m following the first full-term contribution from last August's acquisition of Del Monte's dried fruit business in California. Integrating the acquisition and repackaging the Del Monte brand for the US market accounted for Pounds 587,000 of the restructuring charge. The seasonal nature of the business means that profits are weighted towards the second half, when 60 per cent of annual trading is done. Last year's first half ended in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 376,000. Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that the overall performance was much better than the previous first-half, and he was confident of a satisfactory outcome for the year. The increase in turnover, mainly from the US, included organic growth of 16 per cent. Higher direct sales to manufacturers, both in the UK and the US, accounted for 13 per cent and 9 per cent of turnover respectively. This has reduced the group's dependence on UK retailers, which accounted for 19 per cent of sales, down from 24 per cent. Net interest payable rose from Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 707,000, reflecting increased working capital, higher stocks ahead of the imminent Del Monte relaunch in the US, and Pounds 3m of investment in plant and machinery in the UK and the US. The loss per share was down from 2.19p to 2.06p. The interim dividend was increased to 0.80p (0.72p).</p>

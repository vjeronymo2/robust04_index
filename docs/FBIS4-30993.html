			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 1 (ATA) -- At today's proceedings of  the People's Assembly, the speaker, Pjeter Arbnori, told  deputies to vote the draft law for some changes of the Law on  the State Budget of the 1994 and after it to discuss the draft  law on the Advocates Office in the Republic of Albania. But,  Mr. Arbnori said that he was giving the floor to the chairman of  the SP [Socialist Party] parliamentary group, Namik Dokle, who  has requested to read a statement.    Mr. Dokle said in his statement that "whatever might be the  result of the local government elections in the Libofshe  commune, the Socialist Party declares it as unsupportable  because there have been irregularities during the elections,  violence, buying of the votes, manipulations, ill-treatment of  the SP members in the election's commission and even to the six  SP deputies."    Addressing to the SP deputies, Mr. Arbnori said you should  accept the result of the elections. At this moment, the  deputies of the SP parliamentary group stood up creating a tense  situation and slapping the tables started coming out of the hall.    In this tense situation, Mr. Arbnori gave the floor to the  chairman of the DP [Democratic Party] parliamentary group, Ali  Spahia. Mr. Spahia said in his statement that "we are seeing  the continuation of the policy of destabilization and tension,  violation of the law and confrontation of the justice by the  Socialist Party. The Socialist Party created that tense  situation in Libofshe. The Democratic Party held three peaceful  meetings. The meeting of the Socialist Party was provocative  making insulting and provocative appeals against the Democratic  Party, and extremist and Enverist shouts such as "Long live the  Labour Party," etc.    Mr. Spahia said that the Socialist Party is the offspring of  the dictatorship but now it is not able to deceive the people.  "During all the electoral campaign, no DP activist or supporter  have used insulting words against any political personality or  party or the Socialist Party, no in the special meetings nor in  the open ones," Mr. Spahia said adding that "our messages have  always been constructive, peaceful, and brotherly ones, having  the thought that the elections will be won by that political  force which is chosen by electors."    During all the time Mr. Spahia was speaking, the SP deputies  continued to slap the tables and shout trying to interrupt him.    At this moment, Mr. Arbnori canceled the seance. After the  break, the deputies approved the draft law for some changes on  the Law on the State Budget of the 1994. The SP deputies did  not vote but continued their protest.</p>

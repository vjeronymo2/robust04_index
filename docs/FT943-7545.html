			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Taiwan raises stakes in poll fraud battle: A look at vote-buying tactics for December elections Taiwan yesterday raised the reward for information leading to vote fraud convictions to Dollars 385,000 (Pounds 256,000) in an effort to keep pace with the spiralling costs of electioneering Taiwan -style. In a bid to stamp out myriad ingenious vote-buying schemes ahead of December 3 elections for Taiwan provincial governor, provincial assembly members and Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors, Mr Ma Ying-jeou, justice minister, said officials would shortly begin monitoring candidates and gathering evidence. 'We will have to come up with detailed plans because many candidates are starting early, extremely early, their preparations or other illegal methods,' Mr Ma said. 'The criminal methods used in elections change with each passing day, and candidates are continually inventing new schemes.' One popular method of winning voters' affections is to throw lavish banquets at which each guest is given a present - perhaps a can of tea with TDollars 3,000-TDollars 5,000 (Pounds 73-Pounds 122) in the bottom or an expensive watch. At the grassroots level, aspirants to political office may give gifts such as stoves to each family in a district. In county elections last November, one candidate held a county-wide lottery which was actually a disguised vote-buying scheme. While Mr Ma himself is considered above reproach, some viewed the ruling Kuomintang's reward offers as a case of the fox guarding the henhouse. 'Only the KMT can really buy votes,' said one observer. 'Not only does it have the money, but it has the party machine. It has the on-the-ground administration to get the names, addresses, telephone numbers and background of each family.' Mr Ma launched a high-profile anti-corruption campaign in 1993 and is credited with the arrest of 341 out of 883 councillors elected early this year. Buying votes is estimated to have a 30 to 40 per cent overall effectiveness rate. In cities people are wont to take the cash and vote as they please, but in the countryside people have a higher standard of 'ethics' and thus seven or eight out of 10 people will vote for the candidate who bought their vote. Observers doubted that vote fraud could be obliterated in part because such activities are often legally ambiguous, and in part because giving hungpao - red envelopes, or gifts - is so thoroughly ingrained in Taiwanese culture. Most people do not regard such practices as corruption but rather as a gesture of respect on the part of the candidate. After all, it is troublesome to take time out to go to the polls.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: RTZ Pillar up for sale to help focus on mines UNTIL YESTERDAY, the RTZ Corporation had never publicly admitted that the diverse group of companies gathered together under the RTZ Pillar banner was up for sale. Yet for years it has been clear that there was no place for Pillar if RTZ - as it promised - was to concentrate on its core business. RTZ's strategy is a simple one: it wants a share in as many of the world's top-class mines as possible - and Pillar's motley collection of downstream industrial products certainly does not fit this bill. This strategic emphasis was clear even before RTZ in 1989 became the world's biggest mining group with the Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2bn) purchase of most of British Petroleum's mineral and mining assets. Pillar contributes most of RTZ's UK profits. Turnover of Pillar last year was Pounds 1.42bn but it produced only Pounds 17m of net attributable profits compared with a peak contribution of Pounds 162m in 1988. The following year the UK recession began to take its toll, and Pillar was always among the first businesses to suffer in an economic downturn. Since then the Pillar management has been 'restructuring to match capacity with demand' and the workforce has been cut by 7,000 to about 18,000. Although RTZ insists its policies are never tax-driven, there were good tax reasons for keeping those remaining UK earnings. However, if the UK government goes ahead with plans to change the present corporate tax system which discriminates against companies like RTZ with substantial overseas earnings, the rationale for retaining Pillar will have gone completely. RTZ acquired Pillar Industries in 1970. Pillar was a large user of aluminium for castings and RTZ was a big supplier of the metal in the UK so it was argued that the two made a good fit. In 1988 the business took a leap forward with the acquisition of MK Electric for Pounds 260m - after an aggressive dawn raid that netted 20 per cent of MK. Three smaller electrical companies were acquired for Pounds 23m shortly afterwards. The explanation for this expense was that MK's electrical products would dovetail with Pillar's business for making aluminium, steel, glass and plastic products for the construction industry. Pillar's best-known business, apart from MK, was Everest double glazing  - but this was sold to MB-Caradon in 1988 for Pounds 80m. However, RTZ recently picked up the name and some assets of the Alpine double glazing business which is in receivership. There are four operating subsidiaries within Pillar: building products, engineering, electrical and Indal Industries. Building products supplies the housing and construction industries in the UK, Portugal, Italy and Denmark with products including steel lintels, aluminium and wooden windows, steel and plastic cladding and DIY equipment. Last year it contributed Pounds 10.6m of net profit, up from Pounds 9.7m. Engineering provides products and services to the aviation, automotive and general engineering industries in the UK. Net profit last year was down from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 8m. Electrical produces a wide range of electrical goods including wiring devices, power distribution systems, security and safety systems, doorbells, emergency lighting and building management systems. Net profits last year were down from Pounds 24m to Pounds 18.5m. Indal is a diversified industrial company supplying doors and windows, glass, zinc, steel, aluminium, vinyl and wood products, cladding systems and automotive components in North America. Its net losses last year increased from Pounds 5m to Pounds 9m. There is no guarantee that any deal will be worked out with MB-Caradon but, now it is widely known that Pillar is up for sale, there should be no shortage of offers. RTZ likes to drive a hard bargain when selling assets so whether an acceptable offer comes along remains to be seen.</p>

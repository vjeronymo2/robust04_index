			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland: </F> "Europe's Common Destiny"]    [Text] "When the constitutional court in Germany  reviewed the Maastricht treaty, it stressed that the European  Union (EU) is the member nations' tool for solving problems they  cannot handle alone. I have yet to hear a leading EU politician  say that the EU should develop into a state formation similar to  the United States. That will simply not happen and this is not  strange when we look at the history of Europe," Prime Minister  Gro Harlem Brundtland writes.    Where does Norway belong in a changing Europe? That is the  question many people will be preoccupied with this year.  Starting in 1995 the EU could include almost all of West Europe  and over 95 percent of the Nordic population. The membership  applications of Hungary and Poland open the possibility of an  expansion to the east. At the end of the century we could see an  EU made up of 20 countries.    Such an EU will be a diverse community. If the EU can  contain  outlying countries like Greece and Ireland, big countries like  Germany and France, small countries like Denmark and Luxembourg,  and new democracies like Hungary and Poland, it can also contain  Norway, Sweden, and Finland.    But do we need the EU, can't we just cooperate on a  case-by-case basis? As I see it, the idea that each country can  manage alone has never been as remote as it is today. That is  because we are so strongly influenced by what other countries do  -- and do not do. Europe's land borders do not bar capital,  trade, technology, pollution, or crime. Our right to national  self-government is not enough in itself to ensure our national  future. We are linked with the countries around us in a common  destiny, whether we like it or not.    Therefore Europe needs binding cooperation to resolve all  the  questions resulting from common interests and conflicts of  interest. A hundred years ago opposing interests between nations  could lead to war, if worst came to worst. Today nations can  take care of special national and regional interests and at the  same time resolve shared concerns in a peaceful and democratic  way in the EU. What do the people who say they would like to see  the EU disbanded envision as an alternative? Does it ensure  peace if each country assumes sole responsibility for its own  security? Will jobs be more secure if each country builds  protective barriers around its own market? Will the environment  be better if each country determines emission levels? We must  consider the answers to such questions carefully.    Many people ask what role a country like Norway can play in  the EU. To answer that we must first look at the nature of the  cooperation. The EU consists of independent and sovereign states  that want to solve certain problems as a group. They have chosen  this cooperation voluntarily. This involves a supplementary  democracy -- which gives us possibilities beyond those we can  manage on our own. When the constitutional court in Germany  reviewed the Maastricht treaty it stressed that the EU is the  member nations' tool for solving problems they cannot handle  alone. I have yet to hear a leading EU politician say that the  EU should develop into a state formation similar to the United  States. That will simply not happen, and this is not strange  when we look at the history of Europe. Can anyone imagine that  countries like France, Belgium, Denmark, or Spain would give up  their independence?    Every six months the EU countries take turns leading the  cooperation. In this way Luxembourg and Germany have an equal  opportunity to influence the agenda at the outset. In an EU with  16 members, a Nordic country will have the chairmanship every  fourth six-month period on the average. If we have faith in what  we stand for, membership will provide us with entirely new  opportunities for impressing our values on the European  cooperation. When decisions are made, states with smaller  populations have greater influence than the population figures  might indicate. Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark with their  25 million inhabitants would have a bigger combined voting  weight in the Council of Ministers (13 votes) than Germany with  its 80 million inhabitants (10 votes).    Some people advise against joint policy when it comes to  such  things as the economy, currency, foreign policy, and security  policy. I have a different view: It is a big step forward that  the European countries can talk about joint policy in these  areas. It would be a poor alternative if they each went their  own way. That does not serve peace, jobs, or the environment.    Why does Norway have an interest in an economic and monetary  union that will eventually lead to a common currency? Primarily  because we, perhaps more than others, need stability in the  market that buys 90 percent of our exports. We saw this when the  value of the Finnish markka and the Swedish krona fell sharply  in 1992. That had a direct effect on Norwegian jobs. We were  adversely affected by the instability.    A common currency means that we know what a krona, a mark,  and a franc are worth, both now and several months from now.  Until 1971 we had a common currency in practice as long as each  country's monetary unit had a fixed exchange rate in relation to  the U.S. dollar. This stability was a prerequisite for the  period of growth we experienced then.    To achieve the goal of balanced economic development and a  high employment level the countries must aim at low inflation  and limits on budget deficits and national debts. These are  goals we are very familiar with in Norway. They have been  important basic elements in the policy the government has  pursued in recent years, with support from the Christian  People's Party (KrF) and the Center Party. We have strengthened  Norway's economy and done well in the fight against  unemployment. We can continue to pursue this policy in the EU  and at the same time contribute to a stronger coordination of  initiatives and investments that will provide more jobs.    What then is involved in a joint policy in the area of  foreign and security policy? The treaty says that the countries  will gradually implement joint initiatives in the areas where  they have common interests, such as arms reduction, the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and steps within the CSCE  framework. But in order for such steps to be taken  everyone must agree on the guidelines.    This means that a country cannot be forced to accept a  policy  it basically disagrees with. But at the same time we should  realize that in a cooperation in which everyone must agree it is  often those who want the least who set the pace. In many areas,  such as the environment, foreign aid, and peacekeeping actions,  Norway is a proponent of stronger international cooperation and  joint solutions. Here we would want a greater degree of binding  cooperation.    Many people ask: What will happen in the future, do we have  guarantees for how the EU will develop, and can we rely on the  agreements we have entered into? No one can guarantee the  future, either for Norway or for the EU countries. But we can  reduce the uncertainty. In my opinion we can do this best by  ensuring our participation and influence in the organization  where the most important decisions are made.    When we enter into agreements we have a basic trust that the  other party will respect them. Without such trust all  cooperation is meaningless. We take it for granted that NATO  membership gives us a security guarantee because we have  confidence that the member countries stand by the agreement they  have entered into. Eleven out of the 12 EU countries are our  NATO allies. When we trust them in the NATO context, we must  also be able to trust them in the EU context. Therefore our  basic assumption is that the EU countries will respect the  agreements they have entered into, whether they concern fishing  administration in the north, subsidies for northern agriculture,  or guaranteed Norwegian sovereignty over Norwegian energy  resources.    Many have doubts about the EU. There are no definitive  answers. But those who are in doubt must be aware that both a  yes and a no vote will have consequences. Either way we stand at  a crossroads. A no vote is not an affirmation that everything  will stay the same. A new situation will arise if everyone else,  including our Nordic neighbors, chooses cooperation while we  remain outside. It will change our relations with the EU and our  Nordic neighbors. Sweden and Finland will be linked more closely  to European cooperation than Norway, and the boundary between  Norway and the EU will be drawn along the Swedish border, the  longest land border in Europe.    EU opponents call for answers to every conceivable and  inconceivable future development. But we have not yet heard  their alternative and their answer to how we will otherwise  strengthen our ability to cooperate and take joint action when  challenges make this necessary. As far as I can see it will not  provide greater security to leave this responsibility to other  nations and rely on them to speak on our behalf.</p>

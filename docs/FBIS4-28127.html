			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Embargoed by KYODO for release at 1700 GMT 6 June] </F>   [Text] Paris, June 6 KYODO -- The Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has revised upward  its 1994 economic growth forecasts for Japan, the United States,  and Germany, OECD officials said Monday.    The OECD predicted Japan's economy will grow 0.8 percent for  1994 from a year earlier, revised upward from a 0.5 percent  growth forecast made last December. The figures, to be submitted  to an OECD ministerial meeting to be held Tuesday and Wednesday  in Paris, are in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), which  measures the total value of goods and services produced within  the country.    The OECD officials also said the U.S. economy will advance  4.0 percent, compared with 3.1 percent estimated previously, and  the German economy was forecast to grow 1.8 percent, up from the  earlier prediction of 0.8 percent.    The average projected growth figure for the 25 OECD member  countries for 1994 was given as 2.6 percent, compared with the  previously estimated 2.1 percent.    The officials attributed the upward revision to the  advancing  U.S. economy, boosted by growing domestic demand and steady  exports, and improved exports from Germany and other European  nations as well as the ongoing effect of Japan's economic  pump-priming measures launched in February. They said, however,  that Japan's economic growth will remain sluggish, in contrast  with the recovering world economy. The Japanese Government has  forecast a 2.4 percent growth for fiscal 1994 that started April  1.    For 1995 projections, Japan's economy is forecast to show a  2.7 percent year-on-year expansion, while the U.S. is projected  to expand by 3.0 percent and germany by 2.6 percent, the  officials said.    Following are the real economic growth rates in percentage  for 1993 and their forecasts for 1994, with the December 1993  projections in parentheses.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Real GDP Growth                                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |1994 Forecast            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Japan                    |0.1                      |0.8 (0.5)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |U.S.                     |3.0                      |4.0 (3.1)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Germany                  |-1.3                     |1.8 (0.8)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |OECD                     |1.2                      |2.6 (2.1)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

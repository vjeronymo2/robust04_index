			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Changes to the Hospital Wage Index and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Possible Refinements to Labor Market Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Medicare prospective payment system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different payment rates are calculated for hospitals located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in rural, urban, and large urban areas. For purposes of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardized payment amount, section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Social Security Act requires that we use Metropolitan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statistical Areas (MSAs) as defined by the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget (OMB) to determine whether hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are located in rural, urban or large urban areas (areas with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a population over 1 million). However, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides for the elimination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate urban and rural standardized payment amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning in FY 1995. This change is discussed below in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section IV.C. of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that, as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the methodology for determining prospective payments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals, the Secretary shall adjust the standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts ``for area differences in hospital wage levels by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital compared to the national average hospital wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level.'' In accordance with the broad discretion conferred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by this provision, we currently define hospital labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas based on the definitions of MSAs issued by OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, as discussed below, we adjust the wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to take into account the geographic reclassification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals in accordance with sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(10) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act also requires that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index be updated annually beginning October 1, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section further provides that the Secretary base the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update on a survey of wages and wage-related costs of short-term acute care hospitals. The survey should measure, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent feasible, the earnings and paid hours of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment by occupational category and must exclude data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to the wages and wage-related costs incurred in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnishing skilled nursing services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For determining prospective payments to hospitals in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1994, the wage index is based on the data collected from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Medicare cost reports submitted by short-term acute care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, cost reporting periods beginning on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1989 and before October 1, 1990). The current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index includes wages and salaries paid by a hospital,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home office salaries, fringe benefits, and certain contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor costs and hours. The current computation for the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index excludes salaries and wages associated with non-hospital type services, such as skilled nursing facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services, home health agency services, or other subprovider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components that are not subject to the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in detail below, we are proposing to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> updated wage data to construct the wage index as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act. The FY 1995 wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be based on data for hospital cost reporting periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning on or after October 1, 1990 and before October 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991 (FY 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. FY 1995 Wage Index Update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We propose to base the FY 1995 wage index, effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hospital discharges occurring on or after October 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 and before October 1, 1995, upon the data collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Medicare cost report (Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by hospitals for cost reporting periods beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in FY 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to use all of the categories of data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected from Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FY 1995 wage index reflects the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Total short-term acute care hospital salaries and hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Home office costs and hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fringe benefits associated with hospital and home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> office salaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Direct patient care related contract labor cost and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The exclusion of salaries and hours for non-hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type services such as skilled nursing facility services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home health services, or other sub-provider components that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not subject to the prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Verification of Wage Data from the Medicare Cost Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The data for the proposed FY 1995 wage index was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained from Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II, of the HCFA&hyph;2552  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by short-term acute care hospitals for cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting periods beginning during FY 1991. The wage data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are reported electronically to HCFA through the Hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). Because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial deficiencies in the initial data reported by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals on the cost report (including missing data items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as excluded hours and total paid hours), we initiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an intensive review of the wage data and made numerous edits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure quality and accuracy. Medicare intermediaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were instructed to transmit any revisions through HCRIS by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early January 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We subjected the revised cost report data to several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edit checks. Of the 5,294 providers in the data base, over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,400 providers had data elements that failed an edit; 53 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these involved mathematical errors and have been resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

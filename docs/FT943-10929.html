			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks sold debt worth Y147bn in July Japanese financial institutions sold bad loans totalling Y147.1bn (Dollars 1.46bn) to a joint debt-purchasing agency in July, the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Corporation (CCPC) announced yesterday. The company said it paid Y52.1bn for 138 non-performing loans, a discount of 66 per cent to book value. The CCPC was formed last year to take over problem loans from Japan's banks, heavily burdened with such loans following the collapse in property prices. The CCPC removes the loans from company balance sheets and disposes of the collateral. However, banks lend the money to the CCPC to buy the loans, and are themselves responsible for the difference between the value of the loan and the value of the collateral sold. Since starting operations the company has acquired loans with a total nominal value of Y4,820bn, and has managed to recover just Y58.9bn, or 1.2 per cent of the value. The average discount to book value of the loans bought by the CCPC has risen from 34 per cent in March last year, to the 66 per cent, indicating the weakness of the Japanese property market.</p>

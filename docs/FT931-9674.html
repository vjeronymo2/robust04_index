			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / British motor sport goes west THE UK MOTOR racing industry, including component and accessory suppliers, is to stage its first large commercial and technology exhibition in North America. It will take place in May at the Indianapolis 500, the US premier motor race, with the backing of the Department of Trade and Industry and Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The venture was unveiled at the society's London headquarters on the eve of a four-day motor sport show at Earls Court, west London. The exhibition of cars includes the 1956 Osca Maserati. It is aimed at making north Americans - 500,000 of whom will attend the Indianapolis race - more aware of the dominance of the UK racing car industry even in North America. At least 31 of the 33 cars entered for Indy single-seater racing this year will be British-made, led by Lola Cars of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. 'We believe it is time to build upon British supremacy in this area of automotive technology and this exhibition is designed to open up new markets for smaller UK businesses as well as the larger ones', said Mr Roger King, the society's public affairs director. The venture comes at a time of unprecedented interest in Indy car racing - the North American equivalent of grand prix - because of the planned participation in it during the coming season of British Grand Prix world champion Nigel Mansell. It may also serve to further the aim of motor sport authorities to bring greater integration to North American and European forms of motor sport. 'Oval' racing as typified by the Indianapolis 500 is now confined almost exclusively to North America. However, East Northamptonshire council is considering a planning application for a 1.5 mile oval circuit on a former steelmaking site at Corby. And entrepreneur Mr Tom Wheatcroft, owner of the Donington Park circuit in Leicestershire - scheduled to host this year's European Grand Prix - is seeking planning permission for a new multi-million pound motor-sports complex near Rugby, Northamptonshire, capable of hosting Indy races. The moves comes, however, at a time of increasing divisions among commercial sponsors, teams and motor sport authorities about what constitutes an appropriate future for grand prix itself.</p>

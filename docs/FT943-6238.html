			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Warning on German growth The German economy is clearly growing faster than could have been expected at the beginning of the year, but there are grounds for concern, said Mr Tyll Necker, head of the Federation of German Industry. Mr Necker said he agreed in the main with the forecast published on Monday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which said it expected the German economy to grow 1.8 per cent in 1994. He said he saw a pattern common to German recoveries, with exports picking up first, then capital goods, and lastly a recovery in employment and consumer spending. The economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, this month raised the government's forecast of 1994 growth from 2.0 to 2.5 per cent. But Mr Necker said increases in taxes and other administrative costs expected in 1995 could pose additional economic burdens that could choke off the recovery.</p>

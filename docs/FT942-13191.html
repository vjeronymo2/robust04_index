			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Goodyear posts record first term Goodyear, the US tyre group, yesterday said strong US sales and operating efficiencies had contributed to a surge in first-quarter net income. Net income jumped 33 per cent to a record Dollars 116m, or 77 cents a share, from Dollars 87.1m, or 60 cents, before the effect of an accounting change in the first period of 1993. Goodyear, which supplies more than 80 per cent of the tyres fitted on new Chrysler cars, benefited from a powerful recovery by the US automotive industry. Overall, revenues climbed to a high of Dollars 2.91bn, a 3.4 per cent improvement from the year-earlier quarter. 'This outstanding performance is especially gratifying in light of economic conditions in various regions of the world,' said Mr Stanley Gault, chairman and chief executive. In the US market, tyre revenues climbed 4.7 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn, while unit sales were up 12.1 per cent. Elsewhere, business was mostly lacklustre. International revenues edged 1.5 per cent ahead, partly because of a decline in Europe, where the original-equipment passenger car market contracted. In Latin America, which generated 23 per cent of Goodyear's operating profit last year, sales and income were robust. Strong demand in the US enabled the group to make more efficient use of its plant capacity, lifting segment operating margins to 9.4 per cent, from 8.4 per cent a year ago. Lower interest expense was also a factor. Separately, the company reached a tentative, three-year labour agreement with the United Rubber Workers at the weekend, just hours after the previous contract expired. Neither side would disclose details of the pact, pending ratification by union members. If approved, the URW would use the deal as a model in negotiating contracts with other tyre groups operating in the US. News of the agreement helped push up Goodyear's share price in early trading on Wall Street. The stock rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 3/4 even though its first-quarter results were at the low end of analysts' expectations.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Military pilot training to be contracted out THE MINISTRY OF Defence is preparing to privatise part of its pilot-training programme in a deal worth about Pounds 30m to the winner of the contract, Daniel Green writes. The four bidders include British Aerospace, which has a training college at Prestwick, Scotland, and Oxford Air Training School, Britain's largest professional air training organisation. Bidding closed at the end of February and the MoD says it will make its recommendation to the government in the autumn. It wants to name the winner in January next year, with the 10-year contract starting the following July. The RAF trains 72 pilots every year at the elementary level and the Royal Navy trains a further 105. The MoD specified that the winner of the contract should own and operate the 20 training aircraft needed. The winner will have to operate from Topcliffe Royal Air Force station at Thirsk, North Yorkshire, where it will supply elementary training. The Oxford Air Training School is offering British-built Slingsby aircraft or Zlins, which are made in Czechoslovakia. BAe would use the Swiss-built FFA Bravo.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trebruk buys Polish paper group TREBRUK, a Swedish paper producer, yesterday took over Poland's heavily indebted Kostrzyn pulp and paper manufacturer for 800,000 zlotys (Dollars 40). The Swedish group will take over a 180bn zloty debt which is to be repaid in annual tranches over the the next three years. It has promised to invest Dollars 55m in the plant. Last summer, a number of local creditors agreed to waive Kostrzyn 275bn zlotys worth of debts to make the sale possible. Trebruk's investment funding for Kostrzyn is to come from a Dollars 32m loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) of which at least Dollars 7m will be syndicated to Polish and foreign commercial banks. The EBRD financing is conditional on the raising of a further Dollars 20m by Trebruk from the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation and other investors. Trebruk is planning to quadruple output at the Kostrzyn plant on the Oder river, 70km from Berlin, to increase exports to the EC, Mr Olle Grundberg, the company's chairman said yesterday. In 1989, Kostrzyn produced 68,000 tonnes of paper compared to 169,000 tonnes of paper produced in that year at Kwidzyn, the most modern Polish mill which was sold last year for Dollars 175m to the International Paper Company of the US. The deal leaves several more paper companies to be sold including the Kielce paper works. The Polish government was advised on the privatisation of the sector by Hambro's Bank until the end of June this year when Hambro's contract was not renewed. Schroders, which earlier this year advised the Polish government on the privatisation of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, has established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland.</p>

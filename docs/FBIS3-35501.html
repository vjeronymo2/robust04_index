There is no  understanding of, nor forgiveness for such a horrendous act, the  president said, extending his condolences to the bereaved  families, the residents of Hebron, and the entire Arab  population in Israel and world-wide. The president added: This  act must not harm the peace process and the chance of fostering  cooperation and coexistence in the region. At this difficult  hour, I call upon all leaders, religious and otherwise, of all  parties -- Jews, Muslims, and Christians -- to share in the pain  of the unnecessary loss of life, but to show restraint and to  prevent a further deterioration.    Israel's Chief Rabbi Me'ir Lau said we have always opposed  bloodshed, especially when it is committed against a religious  background, and at a holy site and during prayers especially.  It is the right of every person to pray to his God according to  his faith, and anyone who deprives him of doing so is  undermining the base of support on which human beings rely,  particularly members of the Jewish nation who suffered from  persecution and bloodshed throughout the ages.    Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has instructed the establishment  of an emergency committee which will coordinate with the  security forces on action necessary to prevent an escalation in  the wake of the Hebron incidents.</p>

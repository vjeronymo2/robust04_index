			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / BR will continue to run railways until end of century BRITISH RAIL will continue to run the railways to the end of the decade and beyond under the government's substantially watered-down plans for privatisation to be set out in a white paper tomorrow. The slow-track approach will be greeted with relief by BR, but will come as a bitter disappointment to Tory backbenchers and others who had hoped to see a more radical shake-up and sale of the corporation. Although BR's stations are to be put up for sale, ministers acknowledge that only a minority of BR's passenger train services are likely to find their way into the hands of the private sector in the foreseeable future. They are pinning their hopes on the possibility that this small number of privately-operated services will set an example that embarrasses BR into doing better. The latest plans will leave BR in charge of the railway tracks indefinitely. Privatisation will consist mainly of trying to get the private sector to run the trains. However, only freight trains will be offered for outright sale. On the passenger side, the private sector's role will be limited mainly to operating some routes under franchise. The government is likely to proceed extremely cautiously with the award of franchises because of the private sector's lack of previous experience operating complex railway services. The private sector is also wary of the opportunities because of uncertainties over whether there is any money to be made from running trains. It has not been reassured by the escalating losses reported by BR two weeks ago. The white paper will attempt to ease some of the private sector's anxieties about costs by allowing franchisees to lease passenger trains from BR instead of buying their own. If a franchise is not renewed, BR will guarantee to take the trains back from franchisees. This will considerably reduce the risks to the private sector in taking on a franchise. In addition to privatising BR's existing services, the white paper will allow would-be operators to start up new services alongside BR's. Several companies such as Virgin Atlantic, the airline, have expressed an interest in doing so. However, this is unlikely to produce large numbers of additional passenger services because operators will need to secure access to BR's tracks, many of which have little or no spare capacity.

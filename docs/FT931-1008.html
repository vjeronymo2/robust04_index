			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Council acts on teachers' boycott WANDSWORTH COUNCIL in south London is seeking a High Court injunction to require the NASUWT, the second-largest teaching union, to withdraw an instruction to members in the borough to boycott national curriculum testing and assessment, John Willman writes. The union is to fight the challenge which, if successful, would almost certainly trigger similar actions throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said the boycott was not directly against testing but against the excessive workload imposed on teachers in implementing the testing arrangements. However, legal advice obtained by teaching unions not involved in boycotts has indicated that such action would be illegal. The application is likely to be heard at the High Court today, when a date could be fixed for a full hearing early next week.</p>

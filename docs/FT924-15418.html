			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Broad support found for Cadbury proposals NEARLY TWO THIRDS of directors, stockbrokers and auditors support the proposal to require companies to disclose their level of compliance with the Cadbury code on corporate governance, a survey showed yesterday. Two thirds also believe that self-regulation is better than statutory enforcement in improving the way companies are run. The study of 354 senior executives is published in the latest edition of the Arthur Andersen Corporate Register. The Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance reported during the summer and is due to publish a revised version before the end of the year. One of its suggestions is that all companies should be required to show compliance with its code of practice as a condition for a stock market listing. In an indication of dissatisfaction with the present situation, only 23 per cent of the survey believed leading institutional shareholders already carried out many of the functions proposed by Cadbury for non-executive directors, such as scrutiny of other board members. Just over half believed that financial markets would provide tougher sanctions than external regulators against companies failing to reach accepted standards of corporate governance. Smaller companies disagreed more strongly with the Cadbury recommendations such as the compulsory establishment of audit committees, arguing that they would introduce costly additional expense and bureaucracy. More than half agreed with the statement that the role of chairman and chief executive should be split, and almost as many that annual accounts should split directors' remuneration between salary and performance-related pay. Sixty per cent agreed with the Cadbury suggestion that audit committees should be composed entirely of non-executive directors. Only half the companies responding had an audit committee, and nearly a quarter of those that did said it met just once each year. Only 9 per cent of those said its terms of reference resembled those proposed. Of those that had audit committees, more than two fifths said they had a beneficial effect on company performance. Two thirds of companies had a remuneration committee, of which about half met once each year. Most of those were constituted as recommended by Cadbury.</p>

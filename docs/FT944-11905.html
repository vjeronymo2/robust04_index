			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (2): Short-term overkill? - The economy: far-reaching reform is proving slow When Turkey's economy crashed this spring, the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, reacted by concocting a remedy so severe that even the International Monetary Fund feared she was going too far. Despite its misgivings, the Fund - after prodding from Turkey's allies in Washington and other western capitals - quickly agreed to a Dollars 756.2m standby loan in July. In her letter of intent, Mrs Ciller promised policies that could only gladden the IMF's heart: spending controls, a clamp on public sector wage claims, public sector price increases and restrictions on central bank lending to the Treasury. The government also imposed a range of one-off taxes to help close the budget deficit of 12 per cent of GNP. Ibca, the London-based rating agency, commented: 'The projected tightening in policy is worth more than 10 per cent of national income over just nine months. This is one of the most severe fiscal packages ever imposed on an economy in such a short period of time.' The government now says it has met its principal targets of lowering inflation (expected to drop to 20 per cent at annual rate by December), redressing external imbalances (the current account was Dollars 1.1bn in surplus by July) and rebuilding central bank reserves (up to Dollars 7bn in October). Mr Yaman Toruner, central bank governor, says triumphantly: 'All the IMF figures are met. We are the best performing country the IMF has ever met.' However, sceptics are not convinced. One foreign economist says: 'Ciller's package was comprehensive, but the thing that concerned outsiders was that they were not very front-loaded. There were too many announcements.' The key difficulty is dealing with the gaping public sector deficit, the central cause of Turkey's external imbalance and inflation. The 1995 budget forecasts a deficit only one-quarter the size of this year's. Few independent economists think the government will hit this target. No government since 1980 has ever come near to meeting its budget targets. Ibca calls this 'a breathtaking record of fiscal incontinence'. Economists complain that Mrs Ciller has relied on too many one-off tax and spending measures and is too optimistic in her 1995 tax and growth assumptions. Furthermore, elections are looming, and she will certainly be tempted to try and spend her way to victory. Inflation and interest rates will not fall until the government stops overspending. Interest charges already consume one-third of the government's Dollars 38bn annual budget - the same as its wage bill. Mrs Ciller's attempt last year to drive short term-rates down unilaterally sparked this year's financial crash. She decided to print money instead of accepting the bond market's high price for refinancing maturing government debt. Now, the central bank's tight money policy is keeping real interest rates at punishingly high levels. In October, real interest rates were as high as 40 per cent a year. Upbeat as always, Mr Toruner says: 'We want to have a very stable monetary policy. After (any crisis) it is normal for there to be some fluctuations, but (with time) these fluctuations will get smaller and smaller.' Even Mrs Ciller's few structural changes smack of vacillation. She restricted central bank lending to the government, but not too much. This year, for instance, the central bank can lend the Treasury the equivalent of 15 per cent of the budget. Lending must fall by three percentage points a year until ending in 2000. However, Mr Toruner says he is not lending to the government at the moment. The government has made little progress in talks with the World Bank, which it asked in April to support public sector reform. A World Bank official says the main objective is to 'improve macro-economic management, with emphasis on privatisation, social security (system reform) and revenues, and then on project lending to emphasise health, education, urban infrastructure and supporting transformation of the economy.' Mrs Ciller is shrinking from reforms that would strike at Turkey's patronage-driven political system. Mr Osman Birsen, the technocratic assistant treasury secretary, says frankly: 'Adjustment will require political determination, and this process has only just started.' Privatisation has split the cabinet, where partners in the unstable right-left coalition haggled for months over draft legislation to go before parliament. However, privatisation looks inevitable, simply because the state companies' deficits are unsustainable. The only question is whether it will be carried out by this government or after general elections to be held by November 1996. The government may be slow at public sector reform, but it is making good progress in tax reform. It has reduced tax exemptions, tightened up on enforcement and reduced corporate tax rates to 25 per cent from 46 per cent. Next year, for the first time, Turks will be given individual tax numbers and the tax authority fully computerised. Much still needs to be done. Turkey's tax burden of 20 per cent of GNP (excluding social security contributions) is the lowest of any OECD country, and is even lighter if one allows for the large underground economy. And the country is moving too slowly to reform the bewildering array of incentives, loans at negative real interest rates, duty exemptions and subsidies to business. The World Bank says these supports are indiscriminately accessible and poorly targeted. Turkey's economic problems are not overwhelming. It has a flexible, diversified and energetic private sector. Its fundamental problems are political: retrograde politicians and their hunger for patronage are preventing far-reaching reform.  ------------------------------------------------------------- TURKEY: MACRO-ECONOMIC DATA  -------------------------------------------------------------                                      1994       1993      1992  ------------------------------------------------------------- GNP (Dollars bn)                       na     175.61    155.66 GNP growth (% change)  over previous period               -4.2*       7.60      7.30 Population                          61.2m      59.9m     58.6m GNP per capita (Dollars)               na      2,931     2,655 Public sector borrowing  requirement (% of GNP)            10.3**       11.9      10.9 Consumer prices (change  % over previous period           67.2***       66.1      70.1 Exports (Dollars bn)                7.81*      15.61     14.89 Imports (Dollars bn)               10.43*      29.77     23.08 Balance (Dollars bn)               -2.62*     -14.16     -8.19 Current account (Dollars bn)        0.30*      -6.38     -0.94 Capital account (Dollars bn)        -1.65       8.96      3.65 External debt (Dollars bn)      67.25****      67.36     55.59 Exchange rate (average  Turkish lira/Dollar rate  for period)                  25,108*****     10,986   6,887.5  ------------------------------------------------------------- *Jan-June; **First quarter, programmed; ***Jan-Aug; ****First quarter, provisional; *****Second quarter Source: Central Bank of Turkey  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / MP uproar over guilty verdict THE Indian parliament was in uproar yesterday over a court verdict in which Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief minister of Maharashtra state and a potential future prime minister, was found guilty of corrupt electoral practices, writes Stefan Wagstyl. Opposition members of both the upper and lower houses demanded Mr Pawar's resignation and staged walk-outs in response to the ruling Congress (I) party's refusal to allow a debate on the judgment on Tuesday by the Bombay High Court. Mr Pawar, who comes from Bombay, recently returned to the city as chief minister of Maharashtra after serving as defence minister. He has taken charge of efforts to rebuild confidence in Bombay following recent inter-religious riots and terrorist bombings. The judgment concerned a contest held in the parliamentary constituency of South Ahmdnagar in Maharashtra during the 1991 general election. The election was won by a Congress (I) party candidate strongly supported by Mr Pawar. But Mr Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil, the losing candidate from the left-wing Janata Dal party, appealed against the poll result, alleging malpractice. The court upheld his appeal, finding that Mr Pawar and the successful Congress (I) candidate had defamed Mr Vikhe-Patil by wrongly alleging in speeches that he had tried to bribe voters with money, gifts and alcohol. Congress (I) is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court. If the appeal fails, the election result will be set aside and a new poll held.</p>

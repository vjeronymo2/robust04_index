			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CTK report: "The RDP Group Is Eager To Have the Czech Army </F> as a Customer"]    [Text] Prague--The RDP Group consortium, associating 40  arms enterprises, is interested in having the Czech Army as a  customer. Viktorie Hradska, director general of the consortium,  said this in an interview for CTK yesterday.    She believes that the statement that Defense Minister Baudys  has no intention of dealing with the RDP Group is "rather  exaggerated." Disputes that have arisen between the consortium  and the Army, if any, should not be generalized, according to  Hradska.    Baudys says in his statement that he has no intention of  negotiating with the RDP the deliveries of military material to  meet the needs of the Czech Army. The reason is the fact that  the minister wants to directly address the manufacturers when  making purchases. According to what he said, the Army does not  need a mediator when concluding contracts.    Hradska is convinced that the existence of an organization  of  the RDP type, which would provide an umbrella for the given  sphere of industry, is necessary. According to her, such  company allows a rational arrangement and mutual interlinking of  the production programs of the consortium members as regards  research, development, and strategic planning, which would be  too expensive for a single company. The RDP also should provide  some guarantee that some of the Czech companies will not be  swallowed by foreign industry, the director believes.</p>

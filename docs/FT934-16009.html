			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / A caravan lost in the sands: Hard thinking on prospects for European monetary union has begun In a secluded hotel outside Brussels, European Community finance ministers gather today for a strategy meeting that could also represent a session of revelatory group therapy. For the first time since the summer monetary crisis which led to the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism, the ministers will discuss what went wrong, and what happens next. Although French and Belgian politicians have made intermittent statements blaming 'Anglo-Saxon speculators' for the currency unrest, the public debate on the lessons of the July-August debacle has barely begun. But in private, there has been plenty of hard thinking about the future of European monetary co-operation and the goal of economic and monetary union. The question is whether the EC has the political will to chart a new course to restore confidence in the project for economic and monetary union - or whether European currencies will continue to drift apart. The emergency agreement on August 2 on wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the ERM brought the EC a breathing space after the successive currency upsets since autumn 1992. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has forecast a slippage of 'a year or two' in the Maastricht timetable. The Bonn government and the Bundesbank, however, maintain that the band widening leaves the EC fundamentally on track for the Maastricht aim of achieving Emu by 1997 at the earliest and 1999 at the latest. In spite of discomfort in Paris over the weakening of the French franc's link with the D-Mark, this view is backed by the French government. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, has struck a jarring note by saying the Emu plan has 'all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency' - a statement which has caused irritation in the EC Commission in Brussels. In some German business and financial circles, there is agreement with Mr Major's view that the Maastricht timetable is unrealistic - but this is a long way from the official line in Bonn. One point seems to be undisputed: there will be no return to the old ERM, in which most currencies fluctuated around a 2 1/4 per cent band, until the recession on the Continent has clearly come to an end. Earlier hopes of a progressive narrowing of the 15 per cent fluctuation bands by the end of the year have been quietly dropped. Yet the common European interest in monetary stability should not be under-estimated. Most member states want to avoid competitive currency devaluations - shown by the way that ERM members have not used their new-found flexibility during the last two months to lower their currencies significantly against the D-Mark. Far less common ground exists on what might replace the old narrow-band ERM which was supposed to represent the route to Emu. Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, has toyed with the idea of curbing currency speculation by placing exchange controls on speculative borrowing. His sentiments are fairly widely shared on the continent, but his suggestion has drawn criticism from the UK, and even the French government regards it as a non-runner. Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner for external affairs, has meanwhile urged states to stick to the Maastricht objectives but to make use of their greater exchange rate flexibility. He has called on countries such as France and Belgium to take advantage of the looser ERM arrangements to cut interest rates and promote economic recovery. In Brussels, the Commission is pinning its hopes on the European Monetary Institute. It is to be set on January 1, 1994 - at the beginning of so-called 'stage two' of Emu - as the forerunner of a future European Central Bank. One idea circulating in Brussels is that individual central banks should pool resources so the EMI can intervene to defend embattled currencies. This idea is, however, rejected by the Bundesbank, which wants to retain complete autonomy before the planned establishment of a fully-fledged EC central bank. A broader goal of most EC governments is to use the EMI to help persuade the Bundesbank take other countries' economies into account when taking interest rate decisions. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said this week he hopes the EMI will ease the 'frustrations' of having to wait 'week by week' for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates. So far, member states have failed to agree on the EMI's location or its president. EC leaders will try to break the deadlock at a special summit on October 29, when the Community is expected to place the EMI in Germany. However sensitive the question of where to site the EMI, the real issue is the drive by other EC members to draw the Bundesbank into a more formal system of monetary co-operation. Much will depend on the state of the Franco-German alliance, which was badly bruised during the summer. Mr Horst Teltschik, former foreign policy adviser to Chancellor Kohl, and now a board member with the Munich-based BMW motor group, describes French requests for unlimited support for the franc during the monetary upset as irritating: 'They sometimes confuse our interests with theirs,' he says. One senior member of the Bundesbank council singles out for criticism Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, over his much-publicised call in June for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates: 'He is a beginner, and he made a beginner's mistakes.' France wanted to take advantage of Germany's perceived economic weakness caused by reunification to push for greater monetary co-ordination. The signs are that Paris has not abandoned this strategy. In August, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, persuaded Mr Kohl to agree to a 'convergence' programme which Brussels and Paris officials believe could pave the way for more institutionalised co-operation. The immediate outlook, however, for progress along the path towards Emu appears gloomy. Three obstacles are apparent. Germany's own post-unity problems. Large fiscal transfers from west to east Germany - currently more than DM150bn a year - will be needed for at least another decade to maintain east German living standards. During this period of strain for the 'anchor' economy in Europe, Germany is unlikely to be politically or economically ready to subsume its D-Mark into a single European currency. The diminishing chances that member states can meet the Maastricht convergence targets, set down as conditions for Emu. This year, general government deficits across the EC will average about 6 per cent of GDP - double the 3 per cent target set at Maastricht. The increasing temptation for European countries to see exchange rate flexibility as a means of solving economic problems. Britain, Italy, Sweden have shown that devaluation can be the clue to lowering interest rates and restoring modest economic growth. France's position is crucial. It remains torn between its desire to maintain a tight link with the D-Mark and its need to engineer an economic recovery. The Paris government's cautious monetary policy since August has allowed French long-term interest rates to fall again to German levels. France is hoping for a faster lowering of German interest rates next year, and a corresponding weakening of the D-Mark. But this is a gamble for the Balladur government as France heads towards the 1995 presidential elections. The French strategy underlines how the Bundesbank remains the EC's supreme monetary arbiter. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its new president, last week signalled that the central bank's policies would remain geared to Germany's economic priorities, not the rest of Europe. Thus for all the ERM's new-found flexibility, the Bundesbank's anti-inflation stubbornness could still cause difficulties. Some EC Commission officials worry that members of the ERM 'hard-core' such as France, Belgium and Denmark will be unable to maintain their recent currency stability unless they soon act to restore economic growth through more aggressive cuts in interest rates. If these cuts do not materialise, these Brussels officials believe, another currency upheaval could be in store - an event which would postpone Emu until the next century.</p>

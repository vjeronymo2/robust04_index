			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Thatcher attacks defiant Major on European union MRS Margaret Thatcher issued a direct challenge to the authority of her successor with a scathing condemnation yesterday of Mr John Major's support for European union. Her onslaught came as the prime minister raised the stakes in the Conservative in-fighting over Europe by indicating at the Lisbon EC summit that he regards successful ratification of the Maastricht treaty as an issue of personal honour. Speaking in a television interview with Mr David Frost, Mrs Thatcher said: 'Maastricht is a treaty too far. This is a treaty we didn't need and we didn't want. I most earnestly hope that it will not be ratified.' She congratulated the Danes for rejecting the treaty, called for a referendum in Britain, and said she would vote against ratification. Mr Major, whose government takes over the presidency of the Community on Wednesday, plans to re-introduce the bill to ratify the agreement when the House of Commons returns from its summer recess in October. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, signalled yesterday that the government was drawing up a strategy to circumvent plans by rebel Conservative MPs to prolong indefinitely the debate on the legislation. Cabinet colleagues rejected suggestions that Mr Major would threaten in advance to resign if the Commons did not pass the legislation. But he would be prepared to turn Maastricht into a 'confidence issue' for the government. The implication was that if Euro-sceptics on the Conservative backbenches joined with the opposition parties to wreck the legislation, they would be threatening another general election. Mr Major will remind Tory MPs later today that they pledged their support for Maastricht during the April election campaign. Reporting on the outcome of the Lisbon summit, he will claim that the debate over the future of the Community has now moved decisively against federalism towards the wider, looser structure favoured by Britain. Mrs Thatcher, who will take her seat in the House of Lords tomorrow, combined a blistering attack on the prime minister's approach to Europe, with a sharp rebuke to the government for not lowering borrowing costs. She said there was no prospect of economic recovery unless he was prepared to risk a devaluation of sterling in the Exchange Rate Mechanism by cutting interest rates. But she reserved her most scathing remarks for Maastricht. Mrs Thatcher described the agreement on political and economic union as a blueprint for a 'central state' which would destroy British democracy. She said she would be prepared to campaign for a referendum, and derided as 'gobbledegook' the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the treaty. Urging Conservative MPs to join her in voting against the bill, she suggested that they should put their obligations to 'the people' ahead of loyalty to the prime minister. She plans to develop the same themes in her maiden speech to the House of Lords on Thursday, but Mr Major is said to be determined to avoid a personal slanging match with his predecessor.

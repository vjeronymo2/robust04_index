			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _Data and Information System Management. For this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority, proposals are sought which reflect an understanding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the uses to which data are to be applied (e.g., patient care,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality assessment, resource allocation, research, etc.) and of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the questions they are to answer. Projects should reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarity with efforts of NHTSA, HRSA, the Centers for Disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control and Prevention (CDC), and the EMSC program to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national uniform data sets, if appropriate to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project. States are encouraged to develop EMS data systems which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all the elements of a national uniform data set and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of describing the nature of EMS provided to children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Demonstrations of linkage of data sources to provide an optimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> picture of EMS furnished to children is one example of a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project under this priority; such proposals would be expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show considerable familiarity with previous linkage efforts by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above organizations and others. Another example is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement of the quality of data that relate mechanisms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury to assigned E-codes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Communications. For this priority, proposals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sought which take advantage of new telecommunications technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to improve EMS for children. Proposals could promote access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``911'' or ``enhanced 911'' emergency telephone systems. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects might use the ``Make the Right Call'' campaign on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide basis, with modifications that include educating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public_including children_about when to access EMS services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for children; such projects would be expected to incorporate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well conceived evaluation of the impact of such a campaign.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, proposals could promote the use of advanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies to improve care for children. For example, projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might use new technology to improve communications among health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care facilities, linking hospitals, health care agencies and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers; or to educate various categories of providers by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing on-line pediatric medical control via new technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals are also sought which evaluate, describe, analyze, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve the pattern of EMS communications, dispatcher protocols,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or on-line medical control as they affect the care of children or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in relationship to pediatric utilization of emergency medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. This priority has been developed in cooperation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HRSA's Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Violence and Injury Prevention. For this priority,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities could include advocacy, education, training, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> curriculum development, especially in the development of programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which expand the role of EMS personnel in prevention of injury,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpersonal violence, or youth-on-youth violence. Innovative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies to link EMS personnel with law enforcement personnel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary care providers, and community resources are sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples are programs to reduce children's access to firearms or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to educate children about the use of seatbelts or bicycle helmets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further examples include the use of EMS personnel as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trainer/educators, advocates, and organizers for community based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violence prevention initiatives in schools and other settings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serving youth, such as recreation centers, detention centers, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> youth employment centers; or the use of EMS records to study the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of violence or for education about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of violence. Violence and injury prevention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiatives might also focus on enhancing preparation of EMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel for providing initial attention and arranging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate follow-up when there are violent, destructive,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damaging, or hurtful behaviors, or when there are injury-risking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behaviors, such as combined drinking and driving, substance abuse,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or attempted suicide by intentional overdosing on drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Psychosocial/Behavioral. Proposals are sought for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority focusing on strategies to reduce the emotional toll of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> childhood emergencies on the child, family, and/or providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples include development and evaluation of techniques to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the sensitivity of EMS personnel to psychosocial issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting children, adolescents, and their families and enhance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMS provider skills, knowledge, and crisis intervention capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in dealing with these issues; development and evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches and techniques for assisting EMS personnel in dealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with child and family crises arising from abuse, neglect, sexual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assault, or noncompliant and other high risk behaviors; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities that foster greater synergy between primary care and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mental health specialty personnel in dealing with psychosocial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of EMSC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

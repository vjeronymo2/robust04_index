			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Munich has unveiled a new hotel -- the elegant little Rafael. This is a  charmer. Only 74 rooms (just steps from Munich's famous Hofbrauhaus, the  Glockenspiel and the chic shops of Maximilianstrasse). Its restaurant, Rafael's  World, features an international menu. The new Rafael joins a group of 11  properties that include the Breidenbacher Hof in Dusseldorf and The Mark in New  York. Rates begin at 350 marks per night for a single (about $225 U.S.), 500  marks double occupancy (approximately $320), including a continental breakfast.  </P> <P> Hotel Rafael, Neuturmstrasse 1, 8000 Munich 2. For reservations see your travel  agent or telephone toll-free (800) 223-1588. Callers from New York should dial  (212) 661-4540.  </P> <P> A Bit of Britain: The Close Hotel is a 400-year-old mansion in the village of  Tetbury in England's Cotswolds. Fifteen guest rooms. Four-poster beds. This is  one of England's top country-home hotels. The former private residence has been  restored floor to ceiling. The Royal Automobile Club gave it a blue ribbon for  excellence. Sitting rooms, drawing rooms, antiques, old-fashioned wardrobes,  thick comforters on the beds. The hotel's restaurant features fresh baked  breads/pastries, turbot, bass, salmon, rack of lamb, quail, pheasant. Manager  David Broadhead, formerly of Claridge's and the Savoy in London, offers  individualized service.  </P> <P> The Close Hotel &amp; Restaurant, Tetbury, Gloucestershire, England GL8 8AQ.  Doubles from $156 U.S. per night, including morning tea, a continental  breakfast, newspaper.  </P> <P> Colorado Inn: Readers continue to praise Colorado's Eagle River Inn near Vail.  Dates from 1894. Adobe walls, a dozen guest rooms, Santa Fe-style furniture, a  beehive fireplace. Decks overlook the river. Guests soak in a hot tub on chilly  evenings. Fresh flowers throughout the home. Marvelous views of the Rockies.  Wine/cheese by the fireplace each evening. The breakfast menu includes granola,  yogurt, croissants, fresh fruit.

No smoking, no pets.  </P> <P> Maui Hideaway: On Maui there's a hideaway up-country from Wailea on the flanks  of Haleakala (the extinct volcano that dominates the island's skyline), where  the air is cool and the pace is laid-back. It's called Makawao. No swaying  palms, no big hotels, no fancy restaurants. This is a cow town that resembles  the set in a Hollywood Western. Cowboys (paniolos) with plumeria in their hat  bands roam the main drag, and women wear jeans rather than string bikinis.  </P> <P> Plenty of action at Kau Kau Korner, a tiny cafe that serves saimin, rice, beef  hekka, salted pork cabbage and pork tofu. Seats only a dozen customers.  Meanwhile, islanders drive for miles to buy fresh bread and pastries at  Kimodo's Store &amp; Bakery. The lineup begins at 6 a.m. Sometimes they're sold  out by noon.  </P> <P> Makawao was settled by Portuguese ranchers at the turn of the century. During  World War II, U.S. Marines claimed it as their turf. (More than one leatherneck  returned after the war to take up permanent residence.) Makawao is a low-gear  town. A good destination for day-trippers.  </P> <P> For the Record: A Tips item last Sunday told of a free round-trip flight (LAX  to Cabo San Lucas) for guests booking rooms for four nights at Hotel Cabo San  Lucas. Failed, however, to mention the offer is good during July only. Rates  begin at $112.50 per guest, double occupancy, including breakfast, lunch,  dinner and complimentary drinks till 6 p.m. The Twin Dolphin is a low-rise  resort with 50 rooms/suites on the Sea of Cortez.  </P> <P> Contact your travel agent or call the Twin Dolphin at (213) 386-3940.

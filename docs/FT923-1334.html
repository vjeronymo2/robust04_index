			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rumours abound as German M3 grows POLITICAL realities have intervened since the last time the German M3 money supply figures came out, and a rise from 8.5 to 9 per cent in the August M3 growth rate - conventionally a bad indicator for interest rate prospects - had less of an impact on bourses than might have been expected, writes Our Markets Staff. In Frankfurt, even after coming off the top, bund futures were actually running 40 basis points higher in mid afternoon, at 90.74 for the December contract, than they did in the morning. This reflected rumours, subsequently denied, that the ERM might be suspended but there was parallel, and more sustained talk of a Bundesbank rate cut. Mr Werner Wanke, a partner of B Metzler in Frankfurt and a known proponent of a German interest rate cut of two or three percentage points, said that the cut would have to come this month to avoid severe consequences for other members of the EMS. PARIS was assailed in late trading by rumours of impending cuts in French and German interest rates accompanied by a realignment of the ERM. The improvement in sentiment was largely driven by strong futures and bond markets where the speculation, officially denied, was for between a 0.5-1 percentage point cut in the key intervention rate. The CAC-40 index closed 6.75 higher at 1,832.81, off an intraday high of 1,849.19. Turnover was FFr2.7bn. Credit Lyonnais startled the market by reporting a massive drop in first half net. The state-controlled bank also warned that debt provisions would have to remain high for the remaining six months of the year, and its certificates closed down FFr42 at FFr510. This affected Thomson-CSF, which has a 15.5 per cent stake in the bank, and it closed FFr12.00 or 8 per cent lower at FFr135.90. Michelin fell FFr4.70 to FFr199.80 on first half figures which disappointed some analysts and led to a number of downgrades. FRANKFURT incorporated post-bourse losses from Monday and the DAX index showed a fall of 23.52, or 1.5 per cent on the day at 1,550.34. Volume crept up from DM4.6bn to DM5.2bn. 'We have a currency market, not an equity market', said one dealer, reckoning that foreign investors who came into German equities as a bet on the D-Mark took their profits yesterday. The least liquid of the big carmakers, BMW, fell DM11.50 to DM525.50. Meanwhile the big three chemicals, convenient avenues for international investment, saw unusually big declines with BASF DM5.50 lower at DM209.50, Bayer down DM8.20 to DM268.30 and Hoechst by DM6.50 to DM246.20. MILAN also took in Monday's late losses as the Comit index dropped 10.69, or 2.8 per cent to 369.59. Lira weakness contributed, but dealers said that there were also fears that a stiff budget containing L93,000bn of spending cuts could end up being modified substantially or could exacerbate political tensions. ZURICH rose on lower interest rates, the SMI index closing 11.6 higher at 1,900.4 with banks topping the active list. UBS bearers added SFr7 to SFr776, CS Holding put on SFr20 to SFr1,910 and SBC were SFr5 firmer at SFr273. Banks were also lifted by hopes that Swiss voters, in a referendum next Sunday, would approve a revision of the Swiss securities stamp tax. The change is designed to improve Swiss banks' international competitiveness. AMSTERDAM remained relatively calm. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.5 to 112.5. Elsevier continued its recovery, gaining Fl 3 to Fl 108 while DAF was 20 cents lower at Fl 17.390 as the market seemed uninterested in news that it had held cooperation talks with a Japanese truck manufacturer. MADRID failed to find a refuge from the battering it has ben subjected to in the past week and the general index recorded another fall, down 3.22 to 207.56. Turnover remained strong at some Pta15bn. Utilities remained under pressure with Union Fenosa down Pta28 at Pta437. BRUSSELS saw strong activity in Delhaize which saw its shares shed 5.6 per cent as its US division Food Lion fell to a year's low in New York. The Bel-20 index fell 9.38 to 1,114.50 in turnover of BFr855m. Delhaize closed down BFr90 at BFr1,600 in volume of 205,500 shares. Food Lion reported poor third quarter results recently. STOCKHOLM heard SE-Banken say that it had outstanding loans of SKr1bn to the Gota group, which suspended payments to creditors last week. SE-Banken A fell SKr1 to SKr11.50. Handelsbanken A touched a new year's low of SKr21.50 before recovering slightly to close SKr1.50 lower at SKr22.50. All in all, the bank sector dropped more than 6 per cent as the Affarsvarlden index fell 9.1 to 736.0. OSLO fell 2.3 per cent in spite of firmer North Sea oil prices and a cut in domestic interest rates. The composite index ended 7.81 lower at 325.61 in turnover of NKr222m. The industry index, which includes stocks linked to North Sea oil, fell 12.74 to 577.42, Norsk Hydro losing NKr4.50 to NKr141.00. VIENNA eased two per cent as the market was depressed by German M3 data. The ATX index was down 17.39 at 822.44.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 22                             Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open   10.30am   11 am    12 pm     1 pm    2 pm     3 pm     close 1044.05  1043.54  1041.12  1039.64  1040.00  1043.95  1046.77  1044.34                   Day's High  1047.82    Day's Low  1039.17         Sep 21     Sep 18      Sep 17     Sep 16      Sep 15        1050.43     1070.95    1058.13    1053.63     1051.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bramalea creditors approve proposals TWO leading groups of creditors of Bramalea, one of three property companies controlled by Edper-Hees of Toronto, have approved its planned financial restructuring. The company expects other creditor groups to come into line, enabling it to emerge from bankruptcy protection and return to profitability in 1994. The two creditor groups comprise mortgage holders owed CDollars 800m (USDollars 634.9m) and others with CDollars 1.5bn of claims against Bramalea secured income properties. The banks, owed CDollars 1.4bn, have approved the plan. The remaining creditor groups are to vote on the restructuring by this evening. Bramalea, a North American property and land developer, plans to sell CDollars 2.2bn of assets in the next five years and exchange debt for equity. The assets include nine US shopping centres, as well as office buildings and shopping malls in Canada. This would reduce debt by half. Trizec, a larger publicly-traded property company also controlled by Edper-Hees will see its interest in Bramalea fall from 70 per cent to 20 per cent, with the creditors taking effective control. Elan Energy, the former Lasmo Canada and fully independent from Lasmo, the UK energy group, is buying OMV Canada from OMV Gruppe of Austria for CDollars 180m. OMV Canada has reserves of 28.5m barrels of oil and 73bn cu ft of natural gas, and has strong cashflow from production. Elan has developed its directional drilling techniques in western Canada, and has become a medium-size exploration, development and production group. It recently bought producing properties from Chevron, Imperial Oil and Petro-Canada. Oil production is running at about 20,000 b/d. Lasmo sold its 55 per cent interest in Lasmo Canada last year in a public offer. Then Lasmo Canada changed its name to Elan Energy.</p>

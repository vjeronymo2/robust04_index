			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Malbak shows improvement MALBAK, the industrial arm of the Gencor group, weathered the effects of a worsening economy to record a 29 per cent increase in earnings in the six months to the end of February. Turnover rose by 27 per cent to R5.3bn (Dollars 1.84bn), assisted by a number of acquisitions. Operating income was 10 per cent higher at R393m. Attributable earnings rose to R152m from R118m. Earnings per share dropped by 3 per cent to 55.1 cents following a share increase. The interim dividend was maintained at 12.5 cents a share. The reporting period was a busy one for Malbak as it acquired control of Fedfood and SA Druggists, and disposed of its holdings in Darling and Hodgson and half of its stake in Standard Engineering. It also arranged a R430m rights issue. The effect of these deals was to give Malbak a stronger consumer focus, particularly in food and pharmaceuticals, while largely removing it from the engineering and construction fields. Mr Grant Thomas, executive chairman, said he was delighted with the performance, which was in line with forecasts. But he cautioned consumers were only now feeling the full effects of the recession and hence no significant upturn in the group's sales was foreseen in the second half.</p>

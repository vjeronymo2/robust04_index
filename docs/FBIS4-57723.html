			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] CARDENAS MEETS WITH EASTERN  INDIANS--Meeting with representatives of Indian communities of  Oriente, the Chaco, and the Amazon for the first time in the  history of the Bolivian Republic, Vice President Victor Hugo  Cardenas reviewed the contents of the Popular Participation Law  promulgated on 20 April. He explained that the law recognizes  peasant and Indian communities and, by increasing the number of  municipalities from 21 to 301 nationwide, "will better cover  health, education, and development needs in previously neglected  areas." Cardenas stressed the importance of the right to vote  under the new Law to elect officials who have the welfare of  Indian communities in mind and who are committed to their  development. He promised to push through Indian demands in the  National Congress and said that he agreed with President Sanchez  de Lozada that, without the development of these communities,  democracy will remain "crippled."    Speaking on behalf of the Indian representatives, Vicente  Pessoa, president of the Confederation of Indigenous People of  Eastern Bolivia (CIDOB), affirmed his community's support for  the Popular Participation Law if it responds to "specific  demands" such as effective Indian participation in  decisionmaking and management of the country, recognition of  grass-roots organizations, and respect for traditional  authorities and autonomy. Pessoa also asked that the Indian Law,  which would guarantee Indian rights through succeeding  administrations, be approved. The vice president responded that  many of the concerns and principles of an Indian Law are already  included in the Popular Participation Law and the Education  Reform Law, soon to be passed in Congress. [Cochabamba LOS  TIEMPOS 20 Apr]    URU INDIAN DEMANDS--Leaders of the Uru nation reject the  government's new Popular Participation Law and instead have  asked the government to reactivate the Integral  Ethno-Developmental Plan launched in 1992 for the Uru, Ouechua,  and Aymara communities. This plan aims at granting lands for  agricultural use and raising of livestock, needed by these  communities to "subsist and live with dignity," according to  leader Juan Condori. He stressed his opposition to the  government's Popular Participation Law, charging that "it is not  true that it will serve the needs of the poorest." On the  contrary, he said, this policy will "widen the gap between rich  and poor."

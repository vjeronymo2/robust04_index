			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 May, while handling affairs at the Shandong  Academy of Agricultural Science, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the  provincial party committee, stressed: To push agriculture onto  a new stage, we must first push agriculture-oriented science and  technology onto a new level. All levels of party, government,  and agricultural departments should, without exception, put the  agriculture-oriented science and technology in the first place  and make a great breakthrough in research, development, and  utilization of agriculture-oriented science and technology.    Comrade Jiang Chunyun has been extremely concerned with the  work of agriculture-oriented science and technology. Since  1986, he has traveled to the provincial academy of agriculture  science on four occasions to conduct investigations, resolve  problems, and guide the work.    Early on the morning of 1 May, Jiang Chunyun and Vice  Governor Wang Jiangong again led responsible persons of  pertinent provincial-level departments to this academy to handle  affairs on the spot. They viewed the vegetable research  institute, the central laboratory, the crop science and  technology development department, the institute for research in  atomic energy application, and the wheat varieties exhibition  center of the academy. They asked questions while viewing and  highly praised many high science and technology items that were  under researches.    When seeing the wheat grinder that is advanced in the world,  Jiang Chunyun encouraged (Zhao Zhidong), researcher of the  vegetable research institute, to seek cooperation with foreign  traders and try the best to bring in, master, and apply advanced  foreign technologies in an effort to develop and produce the  advanced agriculture-oriented scientific and technological  equipment of our own.    On 1 May, International Laborers' Day, Jiang Chunyun  extended  festive greetings to hard-working scientific and technological  workers wherever he went, and extended cordial regards and lofty  respects to laborers on all fronts of the province on behalf of  the provincial party committee and the provincial government.    While handling affairs on the spot, Jiang Chunyun also  conscientiously listened to the reports made by (Xie Yunchun),  secretary of the party committee of the provincial academy of  agricultural science, and by (Wang Dagang), president of the  academy. Then, he delivered a speech on how to further develop  the province's agriculture-oriented science and technology.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Now, the province's agriculture  is precisely at the critical moment of embarking on a new stage.  To develop a high-yield, fine-quality, and high-efficient  agriculture, we must depend to a large extent on science and  technology, In developing agriculture, we must depend on  science and technology to resolve problems. He called on top  party and government leaders at all levels to pay attention to  the primary productive force, put the agriculture-oriented  science and technology in the first place, actually grasp the  research, development, and application of agriculture-oriented  science and technology with a view to promoting the large-scale  development of agriculture.    Jiang Chunyun also expressed hope that the provincial  academy  of agriculture science would carry forward achievements and  advance on the crest of a victory. In the next step, the  academy should make a new breakthrough in research of  agricultural science, should, in particular, achieve even more  notable results in the research of biological projects, should  make a new breakthrough in development, popularization, and  application of advanced technologies, and should translate even  more scientific and technological research results into  practical productive forces. At the same time, the academy  should make a new breakthrough in studying and introducing  advanced domestic and world technologies in order to make even  greater contributions to accelerating the progress of the  provincial agriculture-oriented science and technology and  promoting the large-scale development of agriculture.</p>

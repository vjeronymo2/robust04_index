			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Hackers due for sentencing today COMPUTER HACKERS broke into an international network belonging to SG Warburg, the investment bank, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday. Mr Neil Woods and Mr Karl Strickland broke into one of the systems operated by Warburgs and gained full system manager status. The two had access to the bank's computers around the world, Mr James Richardson, prosecuting, told the court. Radio pager numbers and home telephone numbers of Warburg computer staff were found by police at Mr Woods' home. The two men had swapped network user identifications and authorisation codes enabling them to dial into other systems belonging to other companies such as British Telecom, education establishments and the European Community, Mr Richardson said. Mr Woods, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, and Mr Strickland, from Liverpool, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiring to obtain telegraphic services dishonestly. They also admitted engaging in the unauthorised publication of computer information. Mr Woods also admitted causing damage to a computer owned by Central London Polytechnic. The two men are expected to be sentenced today. In March this year Mr Paul Bedworth, a student from Ilkley, West Yorkshire who joined the two men in some of their hacking activities, was acquitted of offences under the Computer Misuse Act. His trial was the first test of the legislation since it was passed in 1990.</p>

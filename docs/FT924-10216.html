			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Petrofina shares jump on news of safety proposals SHARES in Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, jumped in late trading on the Brussels bourse on Friday ahead of publication of proposals by Phillips Petroleum of the US to improve safety measures at its Ekofisk oil field, writes Andrew Hills in Brussels. Petrofina's shares were hit by the announcement earlier this month that the Norwegian authorities might consider closing the Ekofisk oil and gas processing and storage centre for safety reasons. Petrofina owns about 30 per cent of the field, which accounts for half its crude oil production. The group's shares closed up BFr300 on Friday at BFr8,080 their highest level since the Norwegian authorities issued their statement on October 8.</p>

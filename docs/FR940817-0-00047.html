			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule set forth regulations implementing these provisions of section 503 of IMMACT. A total of 235 comments were received, reviewed, and considered in writing this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five commenters stated that the proposed rule failed to comply with section 4(b) of E.O. 12291 as it relates to the comments of persons directly affected by the rule, and sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of E.O. 12778 as they relate to adherence to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the provisions of E.O. 12291 pertain only to major rules. In the proposed rule, the Attorney General stated that this rule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291. Therefore, section 4(b) of that Executive Order is inapplicable. With regard to E.O. 12778, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a Memorandum for Agency Regulatory Contacts dated January 9, 1992, stating that there are two ways that an agency may certify compliance to OMB as part of the regulatory review process. An agency may attach a certification of compliance with E.O. 12778 to Standard Form 83 signed by an attorney, or an agency may insert a statement of such certification in the preamble to the draft rule itself. The Department of Justice (Department), following review of the rule in light of E.O. 12778 and in compliance with that Executive Order, attached a certification of compliance. Accordingly, the Department and the Service believe that the requirements of E.O. 12291 (which was superseded by E.O. 12866 on September 30, 1993), 12866, and 12778 have been met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the proposed rule may be in violation of the Service's contract with its collective bargaining unit because the required negotiations have not occurred regarding those aspects of the rule that constitute substantive changes in conditions of employment affecting the bargaining unit. During development of the final rule, negotiations occurred with both the National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council and the National Border Patrol Council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asserted that the existing Service Firearms Policy could not be changed because it constituted an agreement with the employee unions. The Service disagrees because there is no agreement between it and the employee unions regarding the existing Service Firearms Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter pointed out that the proposed rule failed to indicate whether the regulations would preempt state or local laws regarding peace officer status. The regulations implement new statutory authorities pertaining to arrests and service of process for federal matters and would not affect current practices with states. State law may provide immigration officers with peace officer status that would also provide the authority to make arrests for state law violations. However, unless specifically authorized as a peace officer under state law, an immigration officer's authority to enforce the state statute is that of an ordinary citizen. The limitations and liabilities associated with such action are defined in state law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the proposed regulations appeared to conflict with sections 101(a)(18) and 235 of the Act as they relate to the definition of ``immigration officer'' and an immigration officer's authority to administer oaths, take and consider evidence, and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and production of documents. The Service disagrees. Section 101(a)(18) of the Act authorizes the Attorney General to designate, individually or by regulation, any employee or class of employees to perform the functions of an immigration officer specified by the Act or any section thereof. In the proposed regulations, the Attorney General accomplished this by designating those categories of immigration officers authorized to perform the functions of sections 242 and 287 of the Act. The commenter stated incorrectly that &sect;287.5(a) of the proposed rule required certain immigration officers to obtain individual or class designation in order to be authorized to interrogate and administer oaths. The proposed rule in &sect;287.5(a) allowed any immigration officer as defined in 8 CFR 103.1(q) to interrogate and administer oaths. With regard to subpoenas, the proposed rule made no changes to the current regulations in &sect;287.4 pertaining to the subpoena process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters criticized the proposed rule for not providing a sufficient statement of the legislative history of section 503 of IMMACT in the Summary section. An adequate description of the requirements of section 503 was provided by the notice of proposed rulemaking in the Supplementary Information section of the rule in accordance with the Federal Register's document drafting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended that the effective date of the final rule for other than permanent full-time (OTP) immigration inspectors be extended to two years from date of publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is order to have sufficient time to provide both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new enforcement standards. Such an extension is impracticable as many permanent full-time immigration officers will also need to receive both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new enforcement standards. It would be inappropriate to allow the OTP immigration officers to take more time in meeting the training timetable than the permanent full-time employees because this would result in having OTP immigration inspectors operating under the old regulations while working side by side with permanent full-time immigration inspectors recently trained in, and operating under, the new regulations. This situation would not only promote procedural inconsistencies and confusion, but also subject the public to two different regulatory standards at ports of entry. The Attorney General has delayed implementation of the final rule to one year from date of publication in order to ensure training of approximately 10,000 immigration officers in the new enforcement authorities and standards. The Attorney General recognizes the difficulties inherent in meeting this rigorous training schedule. However, she is committed to ensuring a consistent and unified implementation approach nationwide that only one delayed implementation date can provide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

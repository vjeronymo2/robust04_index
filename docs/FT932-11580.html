			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The Spanish peseta has regained some of its strength in the European exchange rate mechanism grid, rising from bottom place to second-from-bottom. Its rise has partly been due to last week's strong indications that the Bundesbank will continue to cut Germany's short term interest rates this month, reducing pressure on the peseta/D-Mark cross rate. Bank of Spain intervention has also supported the currency, although dealers remain concerned that this has led to a heavy depletion of official reserves. Currencies, Page 31</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Bulgaria to resume paying debt interest BULGARIA WILL start paying off overdue interest on its Dollars 12bn foreign debt on September 15, ending a break of more than two years in debt repayments, Mr Ivan Kostov, finance minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Sofia. 'The first payment will be 25 per cent of Bulgaria's overdue interest,' he said. Bulgaria's last communist government suspended payments of principal on foreign debt in March 1990 and froze interest payments in June of that year. The country owes Dollars 10bn to more than 300 commercial banks and Dollars 2bn to the Paris Club of official creditors. Mr Kostov said Bulgaria would pay Dollars 10m each month but did not specify how the money would be shared between the commercial banks and official creditors. He also said further negotiations with the London Club of commercial creditors had been set for October 5. The start of payments would not affect the exchange rate between the Bulgarian lev and the dollar on the Bulgarian currency market, where daily turnover is around Dollars 40m. Last month, Mr Kostov called on the Bulgarian central bank to scale down its dollar buying on the foreign exchange market in a move interpreted by economists as an attempt to boost the lev to make dollar-denominated debt repayments cheaper. But the bank countered by saying that the lev had strengthened against the dollar and that the currency had achieved internal convertibility.</p>

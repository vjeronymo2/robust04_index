			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMERICA LEGIONS CHEER NEW CHIEF RUFF  </P> <P> Thousands of FundAmerica members poured into a Costa Mesa hotel Tuesday night  for what author and forecaster Howard Ruff called the "rebirth and the  resurrection" of the Irvine-based firm, which securities regulators raided two  weeks ago, calling it a pyramid scheme.  </P> <P> In his nearly two-hour presentation, Ruff, who replaced Robert T. Edwards as  president and CEO on Monday, said he had not ruled out taking the company into  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, though he felt confident that  he could restore the firm and had plans to actually take it public in the next  few years.  </P> <P> He said he had decided to take over the company because "I had an obligation to  protect my friends." Some 1,500 subscribers to Ruff's financial newsletter have  joined FundAmerica.  </P> <P> The audience was enthusiastic about Ruff's speech.  </P> <P> "I'm very positive," said Mark Guest, a 25-year-old FundAmerica member from  Monarch Beach who said he has made a six-figure income with the company. "He  (Ruff) has the vision of the power and the marketing and the membership of this  company."  </P> <P> Ruff was greeted with a standing ovation and whistles. His circus-barker-type  presentation was transmitted via telephone lines to 15,000 FundAmerica members  in eight states.  </P> <P> Ruff told members that they were not permitted to talk to the media under any  circumstances or they would lose their membership.  </P> <P> Edwards, who founded the company in 1986, was arrested July 19 by Florida  authorities on charges that he was running an illegal pyramid scheme. If he is  convicted, he could receive more than 30 years in prison.  </P> <P> Released on $1-million bond, Edwards has disputed the charges. He did not  attend Tuesday night's meeting.  </P> <P> Ruff is best known for his gloom and doom predictions of the 1970s. He wrote  the 1978 bestseller "How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years," as well as  "Famine and Survival in America."  </P> <P> FundAmerica is under investigation in at least three of the eight states where  it does business.  </P> <P> Florida officials charge that the company has no real product and exists solely  as a pyramid scheme, using membership dues from new investors to pay bonuses to  existing ones. The company has vehemently denied the charge, saying its  principal business is obtaining cash rebates for its members. Because it has so  many members -- about 100,000 -- the company says it can get major discounts by  buying in bulk.  </P> <P> But regulators say the rebate system is rigged because FundAmerica uses money  from new investors to subsidize rebates offered by companies such as Citibank.  Once the company failed to attract new investors, it would have collapsed,  regulators say.  </P> <P> FundAmerica's presentation Tuesday was similar to the revivalist-style  get-togethers that the company has held at the Red Lion Inn twice a week for  the last several years. Those meetings were effervescent, complete with glowing  testimonials about how much money people had made recruiting new members.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a federal judge in San Francisco modified a total freeze on  FundAmerica's assets, which was put into effect after a class-action suit was  filed against the company. The suit seeks more than $150 million in damages on  behalf of its 100,000 members.  </P> <P> U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Patel decided Tuesday that FundAmerica could  spend more than $1 million of $17 million in several bank accounts so it could  meet payroll and severance obligations.  </P> <P> "We think the people who work for FundAmerica deserve to get their back pay,  obviously, but they may want to reconsider their employment, given the fact  that the company's former president is under criminal prosecution for running  the company," said Daniel C. Girard, one of the attorneys filing the  class-action lawsuit.  </P> <P> Some of FundAmerica's employees were threatening to walk off the job Tuesday  unless they were paid.  </P> <P> Patel rejected a request by the company to pay some $5 million in commissions  to its sales representatives. She did say, however, that it could pay each  representative up to $3,000 in commissions.  </P> <P> FundAmerica charges $140 for a basic membership but pays bonuses to members who  recruit new people. Bringing in new blood is the principal way that people  achieved overnight success through the company.  </P> <P> "We opposed the $5-million request on the grounds most of that money was going  to go to a small group of participants, because it's a pyramid scheme -- people  like Edwards in particular," Girard said.  </P></p>

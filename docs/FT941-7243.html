			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Virgin Retail sets up Hong Kong link Wheelock, the trading conglomerate formerly known as World International, has teamed up with Virgin Retail in a bid to bring Virgin Megastores to the colony and, later, to China and Taiwan. Virgin Megastores (Hong Kong), the joint venture company, will be equally owned by Wheelock Pacific and Virgin Retail. In line with other Virgin Megastores throughout the world the store will bring together experience of the local retail market with Virgin's home entertainment retail concept. Potential sites - which include developments in the Wheelock land bank  - are already under consideration, and it is expected the first joint venture megastore will open early next year at the latest. Wheelock said the move was in line with its plans to form alliances with large international groups as part of its strategy to broaden its business base, especially in the east Asia, Hong Kong and China regions. Mr Will Whitehorn of Virgin, said plans to tap into the growing home entertainment market in China were complicated by the Chinese government's attitude towards intellectual property rights protection. Ms Lee Sands, the US trade representative's director for China, has urged the Beijing authorities to clamp down on intellectual property rights infringements - a long-running source of friction between the two countries.</p>

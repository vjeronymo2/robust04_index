			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election 92: Farm survey blow for Tories THE Conservatives are losing support among recession-hit farmers in key areas, according to a poll published yesterday. A survey for the magazine Big Farm Weekly found most farmers in the sample - 63 per cent - intended to vote Tory next month, but that farmers' support for the party had dropped by 25 per cent since the 1987 election. One in four now said they intended voting Liberal Democrat, twice as many as in 1987. Six per cent said they would vote Labour, compared with 1 per cent five years ago. One in 20 would vote for other parties, including the Scottish National Party, according to the poll of 502 farmers by Mass Observation UK.</p>

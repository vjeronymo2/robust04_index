			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Property: Turnround down under - Australia's improving commercial market Wander through the heart of Sydney's business district, and you will notice an elegant, refurbished deco property, known as the Grace Building. Encompassing some 21,500 square metres of empty office space, it was sold by Japan's Shimizu corporation to the Malaysian Low Yat group for ADollars 16.5m (Pounds 7.8m) earlier this year. Given that the Japanese had bought the property for more than twice this amount, the sale would not seem to be the brightest harbinger for the Australian property market. Yet the fact that it took place at all, and that properties are finally changing hands, is interpreted as a healthy development. Agents and investors generally agree that the commercial property market, which collapsed in 1989, turned a corner in the latter half of 1993. Initially, they say, there was a marked 'bounce-back' in values, followed by a more recent period of consolidation. What happens next, says a senior property manager with one of the country's largest institutions, will depend upon the pace and sustainability of the current economic upturn. 'What had occurred in the commercial property market was an overreaction,' he says. 'There's been a significant spring in values over the past 12 months. Now it's a question of waiting for the fundamentals, such as an expansion of tenants, to gather strength.' The peaking-out of the commercial property market in 1989 came at the end of a 19-year cycle, and was triggered by a combination of debt-financed, speculative overbuilding and crumbling demand as the business sector contracted and the economy went into recession. The result was predictable. Vacancy rates soared in the early 1990s as a backlog of newly-built offices emerged in the main urban centres - Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and, to a lesser extent, Brisbane. In Melbourne alone available office space increased by almost 40 per cent between 1990 and 1994, a net addition of about 900,000 sq m. Almost half of this increase was accounted for by new 'landmark' towers, according to Graham Strachan, research director at Richard Ellis, surveyors. The result was a buyers' market. Efforts to woo tenants intensified, and incentives ate up an increasing proportion of the face-value of new lease agreements. The number of commercial property transactions, meanwhile, nose-dived as institutional investors wound down their property portfolio weightings and big foreign investors, such as the Japanese, retrenched. In broad terms, institutional exposure to property halved between early 1988 and 1993, reaching 6-7 per cent of total portfolio weightings by the end of that year. Many of the market's problems have been little different to those of the US or UK sectors, which both experienced bruising property downturns in the late 1980s. However, the Australian market's turning-point came somewhat later, perhaps six months behind that of Britain's in early 1993. Some Sydney residents think that the decision to award the 2000 Olympics Games to their city, announced in late-September last year, marked the start of the upturn - although they admit that the effect was primarily on sentiment. The net impact of the Games on construction activity nationwide was put at only ADollars 373m, while peak demand for extra office space was estimated at 75,000 sq m, or less than 2 per cent of Sydney's current 'central business district' market. What has occured since the end of 1993 is a selective recovery. In terms of rental demand, most of the leading cities have seen a flurry of activity at the top end of the office market. According to Philip Lees, associate director at Knight Frank Hooker, office vacancies in Sydney topped out at 23-24 per cent in the first quarter of this year and are now 'rapidly diminishing' for prime or A-grade properties. Much of this, he admits, is due to tenants trading into more favourable locations. The use of incentives to woo new clients is still widespread but has at least fallen from a peak of 45 per cent of the face-value of the lease. Rent reviews, he says, are now being introduced from year six of an agreement. In Melbourne, Mr Strachan of Richard Ellis sees a similar situation, but stresses that it is only the top end of the market which is benefiting. Vacancy rates in the 'top 20' business locations have fallen from about 30 per cent in 1991, to about 11 per cent at present. But this improvement has been at the expense of second-grade properties. The vacancy rate overall is still about 24 per cent. One outcome of these still-patchy conditions has been the much-publicised trend towards converting commercial properties to residential use - with the end-result usually billed to home-buyers as trendy 'Manhattan-style', warehouse living. But at least some property companies think the vogue may have attracted more attention than it deserves. 'These conversions happened because of the poor state of the office market, and were led by developers not customers,' says one agent. 'The banks are now more stringent, and demanding that 80 per cent of units are pre-sold. The market is correcting itself.' On the sales side, meanwhile, the feeling among agents and investors that the commercial property market has passed its nadir is growing, and that there is evidence that buyers are returning. This is partly a domestic trend: several institutions - such as the National Mutual, the Australian Mutual Provident and Bankers Trust Australia - are thought to be back in the market, and fund managers privately confirm this. More marked, however, is the overseas interest. South-east Asian investors - notably from Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong - have been prominent, seeing Australia, with its stable political system, as a 'safe haven'. Some agents report that these investors tend to prefer good, second-tier properties, and have thus helped to underpin the lower end of the market. The increase in buyer interest, meanwhile, has allowed some Japanese investors to liquidate holdings - a process which is still continuing. This week, for example, the Park Grand hotel, in central Sydney, was sold for an undisclosed sum, thought to be in excess of ADollars 300m, by Kajima Properties, which had placed the property in receivership in February. In this instance, the buyer was American - ITT Sheraton, the hotels group.</p>

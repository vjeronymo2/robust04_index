			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Congress prepares to move on bank insurance weakness US CONGRESSIONAL leaders are preparing urgent action to bolster the federal bank insurance fund which protects depositors. This is in face of new estimates by the General Accounting Office that the fund's financial position is worse than thought. Mr William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said that the annual GAO audit, due to be released tomorrow, would show that the fund stood at only Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn at the end of last year, compared with the FDIC estimate of Dollars 8.4bn, which it still defends. The difference reflects varying views on when to take account of anticipated losses from bank failures. Mr Seidman said yesterday that the GAO figures could increase the pressure on Congress to act quickly on the problems of the fund and the banking industry. Proposals by House Democratic leaders to separate the immediate recapitalisation of the bank insurance fund from the fundamental structural changes to the banking system proposed by the administration, threaten both the scope and the substance of the plan. After meeting House Republican leaders yesterday, Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury Secretary, said the administration still hoped for a broad bill, but did not expect to 'get everything we want.' Proposals to allow commercial companies to own banks have always looked highly unlikely to pass but the Treasury stil hopes that any legislation include not only the overhaul of deposit insurance, recapitalisation of the insurance fund and tighter supervision, but also nationwide branch banking and, preferably, a destruction of barriers between commercial and investment banking. The main bank regulators all favour a broad-ranging package. However, Congressman Henry Gonzalez, Democratic chairman of the House Banking Committee, has said it will act on the fund recapitalisation 'not later than May 15.' Despite assurances by Democratic leaders that broader banking reform would still be tackled, the Treasury fears that, having dealt with the immediate problem, Congress will postpone action on the more controversial long-term issues. The Treasury may be forced to compromise over the Dollars 70bn insurance fund recapitalisation, in face of the opposition both of Congressional Democrats and Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, to the proposal that the fund should be able to borrow Dollars 25bn from Federal Reserve banks.</p>

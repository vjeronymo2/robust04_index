			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Herzog to be German president: Victory will boost Christian Democrats' election prospects Mr Roman Herzog, president of the German constitutional court, was yesterday elected as the next president of Germany, in spite of a split within the ranks of the ruling coalition. After three rounds of voting in the 1,320-strong federal assembly, Mr Herzog, 60, the country's most senior judge and a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, emerged with a clear victory over Mr Johannes Rau, the Social Democrat prime minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The final count of 696 votes to 605 in the German Reichstag building in Berlin cleared the way for Mr Herzog to succeed President Richard von Weizsacker in the largely ceremonial, but very visible and symbolic post of head of state on July 1. His victory will give an important boost to the electoral hopes of the CDU, and the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, its conservative sister party, for the coming European and national elections, as well as 14 other state and local polls. However, it only came about after a split within the ranks of the Free Democratic party, the minority liberal party in the ruling coalition, which saw two-thirds of the party voting for Mr Herzog, and one-third for Mr Rau. Mr Herzog, a Bavarian Protestant with a reputation as an independently minded conservative, both as a constitutional lawyer and former interior minister, gave a tearful acceptance speech after becoming the first German president to be elected in a united federal assembly. 'We never thought that such a moment would have been possible again in our lives,' he said, reminding his audience that when the last west German president was elected in Berlin, in 1969, the East German communist government closed the border in protest. He appealed to both east and west Germans to overcome the barriers between them in the process of unification. 'I will do everything possible to be the federal president of all Germans,' he said. 'There are many barriers in our state and our society which we must overcome. But there is an enormous amount in common which binds us all.' He called on west Germans to make further material sacrifices for the sake of unification, saying they amounted to 'compensation for the injustice of world history' which left Germany divided at the river Elbe. The way ahead was less certain than it had been five or 10 years ago, he said, 'but we Germans have the strength, we Europeans have the strength, to find this way and follow it'. The key to the outcome of the election was the way in which the FDP would vote, between Mr Herzog and the left-of-centre Mr Rau. Leading liberal members of the FDP had expressed the fear that Mr Herzog would present too conservative a face of Germany to the outside world. Mr Herzog's victory was not in doubt once the division in the ranks of the FDP became clear. The 109-strong party group split 69 to 40 in favour of Mr Herzog. The CDU/CSU candidate had a clear lead in all three rounds of voting, but lacked the absolute majority needed to be elected in the first two rounds.

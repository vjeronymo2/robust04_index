			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: FRANKS-AND-BELL EXPRESS HEADS FOR THE DEPOT  </P> <P> Without a doubt, Michael Franks and Robert Bell are the restaurant kingpins of  the South Bay. Their company already owns Chez Melange and Chez Allez in  Redondo Beach, plus Fino and Misto in Torrance. Now they're at work on yet  another place in Torrance, the Depot, scheduled to open in February.  </P> <P> The new restaurant will occupy the recently restored 1912-vintage Southern  Pacific railway depot in downtown Torrance. "It looks exactly as it did when it  was built," says Franks, "except that back then it was surrounded by fields."  Now it will be the centerpiece for the Depot shopping complex. Franks describes  the place as having "an almost Southwestern look outside, with high ceilings,  brick walls, and lots of color inside." The food, which Franks says is  "completely different from anything we've done so far," will be in the "modern  grill style with an Asian eclectic feel to it." There will be an oyster bar and  lots of fresh fish on the menu, entree prices will range from $7 to $14, and  the chef will be Jim Barnett.  </P> <P> LOOK WHO'S COOKING: The last time we heard news of Vern and Charlene Rollins  was in late 1987, when they were discovered behind the stoves at the Longfellow  Cafe in Mt. Vernon, Wash. The couple -- who ran the acclaimed restaurant New  Boonville Hotel in Northern California's Anderson Valley -- had disappeared  suddenly in 1986, leaving behind a number of disgruntled employees and  investors. Their friends and fans might be interested to learn that they are  now established in Ashland, Ore., at the tiny but popular Sammy's New Age  Cowboy Bistro.  </P> <P> SALT AND PEPPER: Tomorrow through Dec. 2, Tulipe in West Hollywood highlights  the foods and wines of France's Lyonnaise region, in addition to serving its  regular dishes. A five-course menu is offered at $40 for food only, $50  including three glasses of wine -- and the Lyonnaise specialties are also  available a la carte. . . . The former Central Park Cafe in Brentwood has been  bought by the executive chef at the Los Angeles Hilton, Reto Ryffel, and become  the Central Park West Wine Bar and Grill. L.I.F.E. (Love Is Feeding Everyone)  takes over the restaurant Thursday for a benefit "Evening of the Senses,"  featuring items from the Central Park menu, a silent auction, an exhibition of  art by Marquis de Jadraque and music by jazz vocalist Ruth Price. Tickets are  $75. . . . And also on Thursday, in honor of Carol Fields' newly released  "Celebrating Italy" -- Campanile hosts a four-course dinner made from the  festival recipes in Fields' book. Santa Lucia's Christmas goose and and Alba's  herb-flavored custard, served during the Palio of Donkeys, are some of the  offerings. The dinner is $48 per person.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO SHOULD BEAR BURDEN WHEN L.A. EXPORTS SMOG?  </P> <P> When residents of San Diego County found themselves under siege from heavy smog  55 days last year, they had more than themselves to blame.  </P> <P> A report released this week by the San Diego County Air Pollution Control  District blamed smog blown down from Los Angeles for three out of every four  days that San Diego exceeded the federal clean air standard for ozone, a  health-threatening air pollutant.  </P> <P> "This is not smog that kind of comes in and mixes with San Diego smog and the  two add and go over the health standard," said R.J. Sommerville, San Diego  County's air pollution control officer. "This is a . . . smog cloud that rolls  into San Diego (from Los Angeles). It's characteristically quite intense. You  can watch the monitoring stations in Del Mar and along the coast. They'll just  go up in a very short period of time."  </P> <P> Trans-boundary pollution -- the tainted air that travels from one region to  another -- is not a new phenomenon.  </P> <P> But the worsening impact of the traveling pollution underscores the dilemma  many air pollution authorities are facing in trying to clean up their skies.  Local and regional plans to return blue skies to smoggy areas may not be enough  to fight someone else's pollution.  </P> <P> The problem goes far beyond San Diego.  </P> <P> San Bernardino, Riverside and Palm Springs all have been victims of pollution  generated along the Los Angeles County coast.  </P> <P> To the north, the Air Force has long complained that space shuttle landings and  flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base may be jeopardized by reduced  visibility brought on by Los Angeles smog.  </P> <P> In western Colorado, 15% of reduced visibility was attributed by one study to  pollution from California.  </P> <P> Los Angeles smog has even been measured by scientists at Death Valley and the  Grand Canyon, two of America's premier natural wonders.  </P> <P> Using sensitive instruments, scientists proved that air pollution in Los  Angeles and the Grand Canyon were linked by releasing trace gases in Los  Angeles that subsequently were detected in the national park. In the case of  areas such as San Diego, scientists know the origin of the pollution because of  well-documented wind current patterns.  </P> <P> As the trans-boundary pollution problem spreads, individual air pollution  control districts -- which are mandating increasingly stringent and costly  emission controls in their areas -- are finding that even their most energetic  efforts are not enough.  </P> <P> The issues are complex and not easily solved. Congress is finding that  trans-boundary pollution is among the stickier problems it confronts in  attempting to come up with amendments to the federal Clean Air Act.  </P> <P> Who is to blame for air pollution in a given area? Who is to pay for the  cleanup? Should residents and businesses in an area burdened by imported smog  be required to pay for even tougher controls to hold the line? Should  smog-producing regions such as the Los Angeles Basin be required to take  tougher steps to reduce how much of their smog goes elsewhere?  </P> <P> Officials with the South Coast Air Basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange,  Riverside and San Bernardino counties, are quick to acknowledge that the  region's smog does not honor boundary lines drawn on a map.  </P> <P> "I think we would concur that there are meteorological conditions where we  contribute unhealthy air to San Diego County," concedes James M. Lents,  executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> But San Diego also gets some smog from Mexico. And smog originating in San  Diego winds up in Imperial County. There are even times -- few to be sure --  when San Diego's smog blows north into the Los Angeles Basin, the state Air  Resources Board said.  </P> <P> For the most part, however, the direction smog takes between Los Angeles and  San Diego is one way -- headed south.  </P> <P> Typically, Santa Ana winds carry the smog to sea where it stagnates for a day  or two. More often than not, it blows right back into Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But there are times when the pollutants blow out to sea and are picked up by  prevailing onshore winds that carry them into San Diego County, coming ashore  at Del Mar, San Diego and Chula Vista, according to Chung Liu, planning manager  with the AQMD.  </P> <P> "When the San Diego area generates enough pollution to come very close to the  health standards, then emissions from the South Coast Air Basin are enough to  push it over the top," said state Air Resources Board spokesman Bill Sessa.  </P> <P> But Sommerville, the San Diego air pollution control officer, insists that most  of the time Los Angeles smog is solely to blame for incidents of excessive smog  in San Diego.  </P> <P> The federal health standard is exceeded when ozone concentrations exceed the  federal standard of 0.12 parts of ozone per million parts of air for one hour.  </P> <P> Ozone is a major health threat that can cause respiratory illness, reduce lung  capacity in even healthy adults during exercise, and weaken the body's immune  system. It also can damage crops, trees and building materials. Ozone is formed  when hydrocarbons, such as gasoline fumes, react with oxides of nitrogen, such  as tailpipe emissions, in the presence of sunlight. Ozone makes up about 95% of  what is commonly called smog.  </P> <P> There is little doubt that growth and development in San Diego County is a  major contributor to the city's worsening air pollution. Gains made against air  pollution during the past five years in San Diego are being offset by  population increases, which bring more cars and increased development.  </P> <P> A little more than 10 years ago, all of the high ozone days in San Diego were  laid at the door of Los Angeles. A more recent study examining 158 days in 1985  and 1986 when maximum ozone concentrations equaled or exceeded the federal  standard showed that was no longer the case.  </P> <P> "About half the time (49%), ozone or precursor emissions were transported from  the South Coast Air Basin, and a little over a quarter of the time (28%) no  transport was found to impact San Diego," a study by the state Air Resources  Board found. It could not be determined where the remaining 23% originated.  </P> <P> The same study indicated that Mexico also may contribute to San Diego's  pollution problem. During 31 of the 158 days when ozone levels exceeded the  federal standard in San Diego, researchers said pollution from Tijuana may have  been a contributing factor.  </P> <P> All of this raises questions about how effective regional air pollution control  plans are and whether they should be merged to fight the problem.  </P> <P> Lents, of the AQMD, and Sommerville, of the San Diego district, think not.  Sommerville agreed with AQMD officials, saying San Diego will benefit as the  Los Angeles Basin implements its tough new air pollution control plan.  </P> <P> "There's really no good purpose served by having one huge agency," Sommerville  said, adding that the tough regulations needed in Los Angeles are not necessary  in San Diego.  </P> <P> But the California Clean Air Act nonetheless requires one region to take  another region into consideration when implementing smog-reducing regulations.  The regional districts are asked to be good neighbors and impose extra  controls, if necessary, to keep their pollution out of someone else's back  yard.  </P> <P> In fact, Tom Eichhorn, an AQMD spokesman, said the district's new 20-year plan  to reduce air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin by 80% to 90% "will  significantly reduce our contribution to San Diego."  </P> <P> In San Diego and other spots where smog imports are of concern, residents and  businesses have argued against stricter local air pollution controls on the  grounds that the biggest share of pollution comes from outside the area.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District, for instance, is urging  Congress to amend the federal Clean Air Act to take San Diego's situation into  account. If the federal government does not give San Diego credit for the fact  that some of its air pollution originates in Los Angeles, San Diego will be  forced to impose far more stringent local controls. "If we have to do more  because of things we can't control, it doesn't seem quite fair," said Bob  Goggin, spokesman for the San Diego district.  </P> <P> The argument is familiar to federal authorities, who hear the same from states  affected by trans-boundary pollution.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of doubt how one might try to force a state to do something,"  Brock Nicholson, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ozone and  carbon monoxide policy development, said in a telephone interview from North  Carolina. "There's always a tendency of a downwind state to say don't make me  do as much. Upwind states say, wait a minute, it's not all me."  </P> <P> California is not alone in having an impact outside its boundaries. In the  Northeast, air pollutants from Virginia to Rhode Island are finding their way  to New Hampshire and Maine, including President Bush's retreat at  Kennebunkport.  </P> <P> An amendment proposed for the federal Clean Air Act calls for creating an  "interstate (air pollution) transport commission" to study the scientific and  technical aspects of the problem and then make recommendations to affected  states.  </P> <P> Whatever the result of the clean air negotiations, California authorities say  that trans-boundary pollution should not become an excuse to ease up on local  controls.  </P> <P> "What our studies show is that all air basins inherit some pollution from some  other region and also contribute pollution to other regions. But, by and large,  the pollution in any given region is locally generated," said Sessa.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Amy Wallace in San Diego contributed to this story.  </P></p>

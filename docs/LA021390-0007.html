			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD DROPS NO-FAIL POLICY  </P> <P> Let me cast one vote for board member Julie Korenstein for allowing one  failure. In my senior year in high school, I took a host of electives in  addition to my courses in physics, trigonometry, French, etc.  </P> <P> However, I flunked typing, an elective, which put me on the failure list, even  though I got A's in all of my other courses. Board member Rita Walters' rules  would have made me drop out of the 12A play, despite my other high grades.  Punishment would not have helped. I really tried to pass but my fingers  wouldn't behave. Fortunately, I was allowed to go to college, despite my  failure and in due time was awarded a Ph.D. A satisfying career in chemical  research followed. So relax these rules. Nobody is perfect.  </P> <P> E.A. LAWTON  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

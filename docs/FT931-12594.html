			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: UK cut brings down punt STERLING FELL about 4 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, bottoming out at DM2.3880, in the face of strong selling pressure from bank traders and institutional investors, writes James Blitz. Foreign exchange dealers remained bearish about the pound in the wake of Tuesday's 100 basis-point cut in UK base rates to 6 per cent. New signs that the Bundesbank will not ease policy as quickly as had been expected continued to depress the UK currency. Sterling came under strong pressure in the early morning in London, and fell below the psychologically important level of DM2.40 at the start of US trading. It later closed in London at DM2.3975, down nearly 3 pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar, it ended almost 2 1/2 cents lower at Dollars 1.5145, and in New York fell to Dollars 1.5105. A small consolation for the UK authorities may have been the slower deterioration in sterling's trade weighted index, a measure which the UK chancellor has said he watches attentively. It fell yesterday from 78.9 to 78.6. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said there was no reason to believe that the currency would fall below the historic low of DM2.3693 set on October 5 last year. In his view, 6 per cent base rates had already been priced into the market and the conditions for a modest recovery which could underpin the pound have been set in place. Mr Hannah believes that sterling remains fundamentally undervalued from its purchasing power parity of around DM2.55 to DM2.60. Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank, believes the pound is far more vulnerable in the short term. 'We are quite likely to test the historic lows and fall through them,' he said. He added that the market felt there was a growing willingness in the UK to ease policy, but that this was not triggering an economic upturn. The cut in UK interest rates led to a dramatic fall for the Irish punt, because sterling's drop weakened Ireland's trade position against the UK, one of its biggest trading partners. Speculation that the Irish currency must now be devalued pushed the punt below its ERM floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder, forcing a rise in the overnight rate for lending punts to 100 per cent. Dealers wondered whether a devaluation of the Irish punt might renew pressure on other ERM currencies. Denmark's high interest rates seemed particularly punishing yesterday, given the 11.7 per cent rise in unemployment in the year to December. The French franc eased slightly to FFr3.383 to the D-Mark. The D-Mark yesterday rose against most European currencies, helped by bearish comments on rates from a Bundesbank council member. But the German unit weakened against the dollar, which closed at DM1.5835 compared with Tuesday's DM1.5770, and in New York ended at DM1.5863.</p>

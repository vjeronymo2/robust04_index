			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Syndicated Loans: Potential offered by social housing shift THE TRANSFER of houses owned by local government authorities in the UK to housing associations over the next decade could be bigger than any of the high-profile industrial privatisations of the 1980s - and it would be financed entirely in the loans market. Tunbridge Wells &amp; District Housing Association recently signed a Pounds 105m funding package, comprising a syndicated bank facility provided by National Westminster Bank and the Halifax Building Society, and additional funding from Bank of Scotland and the Nationwide Building Society Co-ordinated by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the deal brings the number of block transfers of housing from local authority control to 17. The amount raised from banks now stands at Pounds 1.1bn. But this is only a small proportion of the potential market. If the Conservatives win the next election, between 150 and 250 councils may sell their council houses to housing associations. The associations would need to raise around Pounds 2bn debt finance every year. Lending margins in this area are healthy. The core 25-year term loan for Tunbridge Wells carries a margin of 130 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. Also, the loans are secured on residential property bought at a discount to open market value. The average price in Tunbridge Wells was Pounds 10,000 per property, a fraction of the open market price. This contrasts with 95 per cent mortgage loans made to individuals. Also, the loans carry a 50 per cent risk weighting, which means banks have to set aside only half the capital needed for a normal commercial loan. However, the four institutions which backed the Tunbridge Wells deal are the only regular providers of large-scale primary funding. Other banks participate in the syndicated loans, but the number of big, primary lenders is limited. One problem is that housing associations require complex, long-term finance. For example, a housing association's rental income is low in the early years after transfer and maintenance costs can be high. The Tunbridge Wells transaction comprises a 25-year Pounds 55m term loan backed by shorter-dated revolving credit facilities. These cover the shortfall between rental income and interest payments in the early years. The debt will roll up to a maximum of Pounds 105m after 15 years, only then starting to decline. An additional problem is that building societies cannot syndicate their loan commitments. To satisfy British law, building societies require separate security and are bound to the deal by a web of floating and second charges over the housing stock as a whole. There are substantial legal expenses involved in setting up such a structure. The Building Societies Commission, the regulator, may loosen these restrictions and encourage more societies to participate in transfer deals. But existing lenders and associations agree that more bank lenders are needed if the 'privatisation' of social housing in the UK is to proceed.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Good second quarter for Gold Fields companies Gold Fields of South Africa has reported a dip in after-tax profit to R387.7m (Dollars 76.5m) in the second quarter to December from R396.7m in the September quarter, after higher gold output was offset by a lower gold price received. The weaker gold price, down to R39,758 a kilogram from R41,640 a kilogram, masked a good operating performance from the group's four mining companies. Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said yesterday that the quarter was 'satisfactory' as management successfully 'kept the lid on costs'. He noted that despite the more or less flat quarter-on-quarter performance, results for the half year showed after-tax profit improved to R784.3m from R497m in the same period in 1992. The after-tax profit in the second quarter a year ago was R270.2m. Overall gold production for the second quarter rose to 30,713 kilograms from 29,259 kilograms, reflecting an increase in tonnes of ore milled and better grades. Working profit increased marginally to R491.7m from R491.3m, but a decline in the group's tax provisions to R142.5m from R148.6m was outweighed by a fall in sundry revenue to R38.5m from R53.9m. Driefontein, South Africa's most profitable gold mine, had a strong quarter. Its east division hit patches of unexpectedly good ground, lifting its grade by more than 10 per cent to a four-year high of 10.5 grams a tonne. After-tax profit rose to R194.4m against R185m. Mr Munro praised the results from Kloof, the other large producer in the group, which showed no ill effects from the accident in October which badly damaged one of its shafts and trapped 150 miners underground for several days. He said the mine had enough ore reserves stored above ground to ensure it maintained its gold output for as long as it took to repair the damaged shaft. With better performances from its Leeudorn and Libanon divisions, Kloof's results were dented only by weaker gold price. After-tax profit fell to R174m from R187.5m. Doornfontien, under threat of closure for some time, was able to maintain its recent profitability by mining more underground ore, turning in almost unchanged after-tax profit of R4.33m compared with R4.57m. Mr Munro said the mine's future was dependent on improved gold prices and the development of more underground ore reserves. The group's other producer Deelkraal struggled to meet production targets, but made an after-tax profit of R14.9m.</p>

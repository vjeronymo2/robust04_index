			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Norville's News: Deborah Norville had a scoop for "Today" show viewers Tuesday  morning: She's pregnant.  </P> <P> Norville and her husband, art dealer Karl Wellner, are expecting their first  child on March 6. Weatherman Willard Scott greeted the news by singing a  lullaby and saying, "March 6 -- do you know what famous American has a birthday  on March 7?" Norville correctly guessed that it was Scott. Norville, 32, didn't  say how long she planned to continue working, or how much time she might take  away from the show after her child is born. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

The trip coincides with growing worry in Western capitals  that resurgent Russian nationalism is pushing Moscow into a more  confrontational attitude towards the West.    The mission comprises the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Robert  Hunter, and his counterparts from Britain, Sir John Weston, and  Spain, Carlos Miranda.    A U.S. spokesman at NATO said the trip "explains and seeks  to  encourage membership" by Russia in a Partnership for Peace  initiative between the trans-Atlantic alliance and countries of  the former Soviet bloc.    The initiative involves East-West cooperation in a wide  range  of military and political activities ranging from joint military  manoeuvres to peace-keeping.    A NATO source, speaking on condition that he not be named,  said the alliance was anxious to get Russia to join. "We want  to get the message across clearly that NATO is not trying to  isolate Russia."    He added: "We are at a very delicate stage of our relations  with Russia. We want a harmonious relationship of cooperation  with it.... It is clear we must work doubly hard in  establishing (military) relations with Russia." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Sighs of relief as Rome pension deal stops strike: Silvio Berlusconi's U-turn The Berlusconi government yesterday got away with a remarkably benign press after making big concessions to the unions over pension reform on Thursday. Only one newspaper headline trumpeted a union victory - L'Unita, the influential daily of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left. The rest concentrated on the peaceful end to the 'war of the pensions', allowing the government ample space to demonstrate that the deal was a triumph of common sense. Such a reaction was not surprising because the immediate consequence of Thursday's wide-ranging agreement between the government and the unions was to call off yesterday's planned eight-hour general strike, allowing everyone a sigh of relief. An increasingly weak premier Silvio Berlusconi could scarce afford to heighten political tension by being seen as the cause of social unrest. The union leadership worried that strike action against the government could backfire and that they would be unable to control the growing militancy of grass-roots members. But averting a general strike cannot easily conceal the extent of the government's retreat or the degree to which the original calculations for the 1995 budget have been thrown into question. Mr Berlusconi said on October 14 at the time of the first general strike against pension reform and cost-cutting measures in the 1995 budget: 'Not one, nor 10 nor 100 general strikes will alter the budget.' The unions demanded that cuts in pensions benefits should not be linked to the budget but treated separately as part of a broader reform of the costly state pensions system. They also wanted the budget altered to be 'socially just', with more funds devoted to job creation in the south, professional training and needy families as well more attention to research and development. After two months' argument and protest, Mr Berlusconi has been obliged to accept these sets of demands - almost in their entirety. Pension reform will be treated separately from the current 1995 budget law in parliament and the government has agreed to allow up to June 30 next year to formulate pension proposals. The turn-round is all the more extraordinary because the budget has already been approved by the chamber of deputies. This means the unions have imposed change even when legislation has been endorsed by one chamber of parliament, and reinforced their role as interlocutors where reforms are concerned. The unions are committed to overhauling the pay-as-you-go pensions system which this year will run a deficit of L84,000bn (Pounds 33bn) - equivalent to 60 per cent of the total budget deficit. But their views are bound to be partial and they are likely to resist the two main structural changes which until this week were part of the budget: penalising early retirement through reduced benefits and cutting the rate at which pensions accrue annually, from 2 to 1.75 per cent. Among the main burdens on Italy's pensions system - and therefore the budget  -are easy early retirement terms and the exceptionally high rate at which pensions benefits accrue. Until the reform is clarified, uncertainty will surround any calculation of future budget deficits and the consequent borrowing requirements. The uncertainty is the greater because of the weak state of the right-wing coalition and the fractious nature of parliament. In the meantime the government has to present a convincing explanation of how it will fund the estimated L4,000bn extra cost of the unions deal without affecting the 1995 budget objectives. The objective of holding the deficit down to L138,000bn (8 per cent of GDP) looks ever more questionable without additional measures. At present the budget makes no provision for at least L7,000bn in additional interest payments on the debt stock because of the 0.5 percentage point rise in the discount rate in August. Nor does it take account of the L5,000bn-L10,000bn needed to treat recent flood damage in the north; or more seriously the L32,000bn cost of a constitutional court sentence ordering the payment of arrears on certain minimum pensions.</p>

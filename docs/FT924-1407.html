			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Railtrack gains a board champion THE government yesterday moved to shake up the board of British Rail in the run-up to privatisation by appointing Mr Robert Horton, one of Britain's most forceful business executives, as its non-executive vice-chairman. Mr Horton, 53, is the former chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum. He was ousted in a boardroom coup in June after his abrasive management style caused friction with fellow directors. The Department of Transport said Mr Horton would take a particular interest in Railtrack, the state-owned body which is due to take responsibility for BR's track infrastructure under the government's privatisation proposals. The implication is that he has been appointed to set up and head Railtrack, using his private-sector management skills to develop it as a market-responsive organisation rather than an inefficient bureaucracy. The move will go some way towards countering fears among would-be private-sector train operators that Railtrack's charges will be too high to enable them to offer a competitive service. Mr Horton's appointment is likely to be greeted with trepidation within BR, where management and staff will fear the consequences of his management style on working practices and jobs. BR said yesterday: 'It is not appropriate for us to comment: appointments are made by the department.' Mr Horton, whose appointment takes effect from January 1, will work two days a week at his new job. Based on the present rate of Pounds 7,000 a half-day for existing part-time board members, he will collect Pounds 28,000 a year. Two other part-time members have been appointed to work half a day a week on the board. They are Mr Archibald Norman, 38, chief executive of Asda, the stores group, and Ms Jennifer Page, 48, chief executive of English Heritage. Other changes announced yesterday are the re-appointment of Ms Kazimiera Kantor, finance director of Central Independent Television, and the stepping down of Ms Adele Biss, a former director of Aegis Group, a media buying company.</p>

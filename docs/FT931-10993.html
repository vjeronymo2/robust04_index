			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UN chief's trip to Cambodia off MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has cancelled a visit to Cambodia that he was due to begin next week, apparently because of the continuing conflict there, officials disclosed last night. However, his plan to make an official trip to Japan remains unchanged, Michael Littlejohns writes from the United Nations in New York. In a report to the UN Security Council on January 25, the secretary-general announced his intention to go to Phnom Penh 'to review the situation personally and study what further measures might be taken usefully to reinforce the peace process.' Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN operation in Cambodia, now may be expected to go to Tokyo next week to brief Mr Boutros Ghali on the situation, following widespread ceasefire violations. Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to be sounded out by the Japanese government on its prospects of a permanent seat in the Security Council, an idea that has been greeted with considerable coolness by Britain and France, although it appears to have the support of the US.</p>

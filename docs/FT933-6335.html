			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Heineken's bottle recall touches previously unreached parts HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewer, yesterday added the Canary Islands to a list of eight export markets where it is recalling beer bottles, but it removed Prince Edward Island in Canada, saying the suspect bottles had not been shipped there. The brewer announced on Thursday night that it was recalling more than 3m of its famous green beer bottles from a small number of export markets, including Britain, because of fears that a fault in the neck of the bottles could cause small glass chips to fall into the beer. Other affected countries are Austria, Finland, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel and Sweden. Heineken, which exports to 150 countries, said the 3m bottles were part of a 17m batch of potentially flawed 33cl bottles produced by Dutch bottle maker Vereenigde Glasfabrieken, majority-owned by the French food group BSN. It said some of the bottles might have already been bought by customers. A second Dutch brewer, United Dutch Breweries, said yesterday it was also recalling 200,000 bottles of beer after reports of splinters in some batches. It said all stocks of Royal Dutch Post Horn imported lager in 25-ml bottles were being withdrawn in Britain, the only country where it is sold. The company's bottles are also made by Vereenigde Glasfabrieken, which said it had warned one other customer of the risk of defects. Heineken said it held the bottle maker responsible for the problem and would seek damages to cover the costs of the recall operation. A Heineken spokeswoman said the extent of the damages claim was not yet known: 'Our priority now is warning consumers in the countries to which the beer was shipped.' Heineken said tests showed that the problem of glass slivers could arise in roughly 1 per cent of the bottles produced in the batch of 17m bottles over the past two weeks. Heineken's shares dropped by 3 per cent when trading began in Amsterdam yesterday but closed slightly higher.</p>

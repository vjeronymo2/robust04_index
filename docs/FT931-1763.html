			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Jobs: Moving tale of a fair day's work - The issue of pay equity at the workplace and the pressures that may decrease productivity Odd things sometimes happen during office moving. Recently members of a group of American life assurance underwriters of varying degrees of seniority (ranging from trainees to associate underwriters to underwriters) were assigned for a fortnight to the offices of their co-workers while their offices were refurbished. Some were assigned to the offices of a higher status person; others were assigned to the offices of lower status people; still others were assigned to the offices of equal status people. In addition, one group continued working in their own offices throughout the period. During this fortnight, productivity was measured, taking into account the number of hours worked and the difficulty of the cases reviewed. The result was curious. Although all the underwriters performed equally well before the office moves began, these office re-assignments had a profound effect on productivity. Those assigned to higher status offices dramatically improved their performance; those assigned to lower status offices dramatically lowered theirs. Employees whose workspace rewards were unchanged had performance levels that remained much the same during the study. As soon as the underwriters returned to their own offices, their performance returned to its original level. Why did their productivity change? One answer is that people respond to, and 'correct', inequities created not only by the money they receive but also other rewards such as the status value of their offices. Therefore if people in a state of equity get more they work harder; take things away and they produce less. But what is equity? Consider the example of a group of friends going out for a meal who agree to share the cost. They usually divide the bill (plus tip) by the number of people present. Everybody pays the same despite the fact that they have eaten differently priced dishes. This means, of course, that those who choose modestly priced food and drink tap water subsidise those who have more expensive tastes and drink alcohol. The anorectics as it were pay for the gluttons. As a consequence, people who dine together tend to choose dishes of similar cost. They either all do or do not have a starter, a drink or dessert so that no-one in the group eats more than the others. If, however, somebody wants an expensive item and the others do not, it is frequently agreed that he or she pays for it separately. The principle of equality - people all pay equally irrespective of what they eat - is replaced by one of equity, where people pay differently depending on what they eat. There is one other option: the richest in the group pays proportionally more. This principle, taxation, is the least popular. Nearly everyone faced with the choice argues for equity, certainly in the world of work, and particularly when it comes to pay nearly everybody favours equity over equality because they feel it is the fairest system. Climate surveys, which are snapshots of a company's health, frequently show people are most unhappy with the pay system because appraisal is not directly linked to pay. Strikes, walk-outs and go-slows are often the result not of complaints about absolute pay but comparative pay. One person discovers that he or she is paid less for work of equal skill or responsibility than a colleague and all hell is let loose. Where people feel unfairly dealt with and inequitably rewarded - nearly always undervalued in the sense that they feel they give more than they get  -they nearly always attempt to rectify the position. There are two ways working people bring about a sense of pay equity: they seek to increase their rewards or decrease their effort (or both). The first aims to get more reward for one's work in term of pay or benefits, sometimes called a package. That is neither easy nor even feasible in poorly performing companies or during a recession. There are, however, other things people can take. For instance, shoplifting (politely called shrinkage) is more often carried out by employees rather than by customers, partly because it is easier. Certainly stealing goods is one way of increasing rewards - if one's organisation produces or has something worth stealing. On the other hand, one can steal time by coming late, going early or simply going absent frequently. Time is money as the adage has it and can be relatively easily stolen, as national absenteeism figures (especially those for local authorities) show. The easiest way of increasing one's pay is to work fewer days for the same money. It is frequently difficult, dangerous, or even impossible to increase rewards, and consequently it is much more common to find employees reducing their input: their enthusiasm for the job; the amount of effort they put into their work; their willingness to do (unpaid) overtime; and their attitudes to customers. In the last resort, the worker convinced he or she is unfairly dealt with might leave the organisation. The most common reaction, however, is the alienated, uncommitted, unhelpful worker; the sort we have all encountered, even in customer service industries. Sometimes a feeling of inequity comes after promotion because, although promotion usually means an increase in salary, status and benefits, it also means an increase in responsibility and workload, and the two might not increase proportionally. I know many people in the academic world who refuse promotion because, although they feel equitably dealt with at their level, on the next level increased responsibilities simply outweigh rewards; hence the fact that in some jobs people frequently eschew promotion until the equity balance is re-instated. Most frequently, the feeling of inequity and unfairness occurs when we compare ourselves to others doing almost the same job but in different organisations in different countries. People at work need to feel fairly, equitably rewarded. Their perception of fairness may differ from that of their employers because the value attached to rewards or outputs such as free meals, sports/fitness facilities, company cars and inputs such as hours of work, attention to detail and customer responses may not be shared by employer and employee. If people feel unfairly dealt with, they will do something about it. Not everybody in a state of inequity feels it because they are under-benefited; some, the theory goes, feel it because they are over-benefited. To overcome this imbalance, the fortunate over-rewarded individuals can either not take their full benefits or they can work harder. Lady Thatcher, when prime minister, did both; she did not take her full prime ministerial salary (taking only that of a minister) and worked preposterously long hours. What, one wonders, did she feel guilty about? Adrian Furnham is a professor of psychology at University College London.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Japan 'widens lead in motor industry' Japanese carmakers and component suppliers are improving productivity and quality at a faster rate than their European and US rivals despite the recession in Japan, researchers said yesterday at the end of a 12-month study of manufacturing competitiveness in the motor components sector. Professor Dan Jones, one of the research leaders, also warned yesterday that Japanese motor manufacturers were losing patience with many under-performing European - and particularly British - component suppliers to their UK car-producing operations. He said Japanese manufacturers expected to achieve further cost-savings of 20-30 per cent over the next two to three years. Unless UK suppliers improved, Toyota, Honda and Nissan would consider they had no choice but to start bringing their own suppliers to the UK from Japan, said Prof Jones, of Cardiff Business School's Lean Enterprise Research Centre. The Cardiff centre joined with Andersen Consulting and Cambridge University to undertake the study, which compared the productivity and quality performance of 71 component producers in Japan, Europe, the US, Canada and Mexico. It found that the Japanese manufacturers had improved productivity by 38 per cent since a previous study by the team two years ago despite a 16 per cent fall in production volumes. 'The signs are that the Japanese carmakers will emerge from the current recession even stronger than before,' the study concludes. The study showed the US industry to be well ahead of Europe on quality, but still 30 per cent behind Japan. The highly-detailed research found German quality to be only slightly above average. Productivity remained low. Of the 13 plants found to be 'world class' in terms of productivity and quality, five were in Japan, three in the US, three in France and two in Spain. In terms of productivity, typical UK plants would need to double output with the same labour force to reach the 'world class' level. Streets ahead, Page 11</p>

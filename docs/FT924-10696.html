			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Standards now more complex - The new profit and loss account requirements THE NEW financial reporting standard on the profit and loss account unveiled yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board may come as little surprise to the cognoscenti, but it will make considerable extra demands on both preparers and users. Those who have been following the development of FRS 3 will not be surprised by the new document. In many ways it reflects FRED 1, the consultation exposure draft issued at the end of last year. FRS 3 is the culmination of two years work, and is likely to stand for two years before being revised. It is the ASB's first fully home-grown standard, since FRS 1 on cash flows was a remnant from its predecessor body, and FRS 2 on consolidated accounts was driven by company legislation. A number of significant changes have been introduced as a result of the public consultation - and notably comments from companies. The principal ones are: dropping the requirement for disclosure of 'revenue investment' such as advertising and training expenses a statement reconciling movements in shareholders' funds, derived from profit, dividends, other gains and losses, new share capital and goodwill removing a specific 'exceptional item' category for most elements in favour of including material, unusual profits or losses in the income or expense heading to which they relate retaining as separately disclosed exceptional three items: the costs of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring, and profits or losses on disposal of fixed assets or a business Meanwhile, many of the changes already mooted in FRED 1 represent important advances. These include a new financial statement of total recognised gains and losses, which Tweedie calls a 'world first' which he expects other accounting standards-setters overseas to follow. It includes an item on foreign currency translations, the significance of which many failed to spot in the accounts of Polly Peck International. It will also be possible to see the effect of property and other asset revaluations compared with their historic cost with a new note to the accounts. Prior knowledge of what was coming does not mean users will be ready for the changes and able to easily cope with the newly-constituted accounts. That is part of the ASB's intention. Mr David Tweedie, the ASB's chairman, is convinced that accounts users are obsessed with a single number - earnings per share. By extension - as well as by virtue of the common link between performance-related pay and earnings - company managements come under pressure to manipulate that figure. The thrust of FRS 3 is to replace this 'headline number' with the so-called 'information-set' approach. Readers kept on their toes because they are forced to pick and choose numbers to find the data on corporate performance that they seek. By bringing everything above the line into pre-tax profits, the new earnings figure will become less stable, predictable or comparable - either between companies or over time. That will force analysts and others to rely less on the bottom line figure and come up with their own - different - methods. 'We're saying that if you don't like the way the figures are presented, all you've got to do is take your pencil out and recalculate,' says Tweedie. FRS 3 does include some information which was not previously in accounts, notably splitting out the contribution to results from acquisitions, continuing and discontinued operations. Most is already available, but often buried in the notes. The introduction of the new format should put an end to companies hiding behind 'reserve accounting' in which changes are concealed to all but the most meticulous. But that raises a paradox. The new standard is making accounts far more complex, introducing new notes and statements, and adding additional figures to the face of the profit and loss account. Tweedie admits that FRS 3 will not be easy for the 'ordinary user' of accounts to digest. Yet arguably those who are more qualified are already able to hunt for concealed numbers; others will be more confused than ever. An unusual aspect of FRS 3 is the inclusion of a dissenting statement from one of the nine ASB members, Mr Bob Bradfield of Cazenove, the securities house. He says disposals should not be above the line because gain or loss on sale is based on historic case not comparable with trading profits.</p>

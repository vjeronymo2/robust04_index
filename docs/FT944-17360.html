			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Prices of black and white pepper reached record highs this week, although the market activity was less active, reports Man Producten. Most buyers who had no immediate need to replenish stocks adopted a 'wait-and-see' attitude. That was quite logical after the breathtaking price rise of some 30 to 35 per cent during September for most grades of black pepper. The price of black ASTA reached US3,100 a tonne in the US market, while in the European market the 'faq' grade reached Dollars 2,600. White pepper prices in Indonesia were firmer, mainly because of the expected negative influence of very dry weather there. Spot Muntok white was at Dollars 3,500 a tonne. A period of consolidation or even correction may now be on the cards, after which we expect prices to continue the uptrend.</p>

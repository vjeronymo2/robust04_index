			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Foreign Minister Kim  Yong-nam sent a message of greetings to the 20th Caricom  [Caribbean Common Market] conference of foreign ministers.    Noting that over the past 20 years, the Caricom conference  of  foreign ministers has made a great contribution to further  strengthening solidarity and cooperation among the Caribbean  nations and building a Caribbean Community Free, peaceful and  prospering, the message said:    Today the United States and other dominationist forces are  obstructing the independent development of developing countries  and small nations. This requires the tightening of the bonds of  solidarity and cooperation among the Caribbean nations.    We express firm solidarity with the efforts of the Caribbean  countries for countering a new international challenge and  building an independent and prospering community.    As you know, the situation of the Korean peninsula has  become  strained due to outcries of the United States and some other  quarters over "nuclear suspicion."    Availing myself of this opportunity, in the belief that you,  in discussing major international issues, will pay due attention  to the acute situation of the Korean peninsula, too, I am  sending the recently published memorandum of the DPRK Foreign  Ministry in the hope of promoting your understanding of the  nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula.    The message sincerely hopes that the conference will  successfully discuss all the items on the agenda and score a  fine fruition.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Interstate Council for Space, which incorporates  the countries of the former USSR, accepted the program on  cooperation in space research and use for 1994 when it met in  Moscow from June 2-3.    The meeting was attended by representatives of Russia,  Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and  Georgia, which was admitted to the Council at the current  session.    The cooperation program involves joint efforts in 12 areas  of  space activity, including space communications, remote earth  exploration, manned flights, new scientific space systems and  the creation of new rocket-launch vehicles.    The program's overall cost is estimated at 1.2 trillion  rubles (in January 1994 prices), the "minimum sum", to quote  Russian Space Agency officials, needed to carry the program out.    Each party to the program will decide how to finance the  program on an individual basis, taking their government's real  contribution into account. The countries also agreed to become  involved in financing vital facilities, such as the Baykonur  (Kazakhstan) and Plesetsk (North Russia) launch sites.    The program must be submitted to the Intergovernmental CIS  Council for consideration.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stega to seek funds via London quotation Stega Pharmaceuticals, the Austrian biotechnology company, is to seek a London listing to raise funds for the development of a 'revolutionary' immune system stimulant. The Linz-based group is moving its operations to Britain, where it plans to develop and market its cytokine releasing agent vaccine, known as Cravac. It claims the product could prove 10 times more effective than existing treatments in stimulating the immune system to fight off infections. 'There is an enormous range of disease states that could theoretically be treated with the aid of the product,' according to the company. Pharmaceutical experts, however, reacted with scepticism and warned that the release of cytokines - natural proteins contained in the immune system - did not always prove effective. 'If all they're doing is stimulating the immune system, I cannot imagine it would have a long-term effect,' said Dr Ian Hutchinson, professor of immunology at the University of Manchester. His concern was echoed by Mr Alan Munro, scientific director at Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the leading UK biotechnology company, who warned that cytokines could hamper the immune system in some cases. Nevertheless, Stega said it would press ahead with plans to raise Pounds 7m through a subscription offer, which would fund inital development of Cravac. Dr Bernhard Lischka, Stega chief executive, said: 'This concept could revolutionise medicine. We believe it will be effective in treating herpes infection, some cancers and chronic skin disorders.' He estimated that the potential world market for treatments for these ailments would grow to Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.4bn) a year by the end of the decade.</p>

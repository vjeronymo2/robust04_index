			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Forowicz: "The Sejm on Partnership for </F> Peace"]    [Text] Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski have held talks with the Sejm  Committee for National Defense and the Sejm Committee for  Foreign Affairs in order to discuss tasks stemming from Poland's  participation in the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program and the  significance of this program for Polish security. Needless to  say, one conlusion from this meeting is that it is "too early to  turn our swords into ploughshares," as Minister Olechowski put  it.    The meeting was chaired by Bronislaw Geremek, who said that  the country was now entering the stage of actually implementing  the PFP program that was signed by Prime Minister Pawlak. That,  he explained, was the purpose of inviting both ministers to the  meeting, so that they could report on preparations to implement  it. Minister Olechowski briefly described the benefits of the  PFP program and reported that a special Foreign Ministry-Defense  Ministry team had prepared a plan of technical military  cooperation with other PFP partners, and that a plenipotentiary  has been chosen to coordinate undertakings and negotiate  preliminary agreements with PFP partners.    Minister Kolodziejczyk said that, since Poland's acceptance  of the PFP, NATO countries have made Poland numerous offers of  cooperation. He also noted that this cooperation would  inevitably involve costs. If the West cooperates with us, will  we have enough funds? he asked. After all, changing the  parameters of communications, command, and reconnaissance  systems to NATO standards costs money.    Eleven deputies asked questions. Deputy Janusz Onyszkiewicz  [Democratic Union) wanted to know what Russia's attitude toward  the PFP was and what difference it would make to Polish politics  if Russia joins or fails to join the PFP. He expressed the fear  that the emergent rivalry among the Visegrad Group countries to  be the first to join the PFP might upset our own PFP objective.  Deputy J. Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left Alliance) asked whether  this Defense-Interior Ministry team contained room for  representatives of the Industry Ministry interested in producing  suitable weapons. Tomasz Nalecz (Union of Labor) feared that  the cost of joining the PFP this year would be too high, while  Bronislaw Komorowski (Democratic Union) asked how much other  Visegrad countries would be spending. Aleksandra Malachowska  (Polish Peasant Party) suspected that the Polish Government was  overtly optimistic and had exaggerated the meaning of the  gestures made by various Western partners following Poland's  acceptance of the PFP.    The ministers tried to dispel fears as calmly as they could,  without underplaying various complications and without  attempting to conceal various uncertainties concerning the  implementation of the the PFP with Poland's participation. They  expressed a cautious hope that Russia would ultimately join the  PFP, naturally in a role that suits its power status.    They also spoke about the indivisibility of European  security  and the parallel nature of various measures intended to increase  security guarantees. Minister Kolodziejczyk said that the  Polish aim to join NATO is expressed in many other undertakings,  some of which have already been completed, such as the  conclusion of treaties with neighboring countries. Minister  Kolodziejczyk recalled that our emergent links to the Western  European Union are seen not as an alternative to the PFP, but as  a complement and addition to it. Joint military exercises that  have been suggested recently, such as a possible  German-Polish-Dutch one or a joint Visegrad Group exercise in  Ustka in June, already suggested a long time ago, could play a  similar role.    The defense minister also indicated a reform of NATO. It is  necessary for Poland to present opinions on this subject because  this would help establish a path to this reform. He added that  Poland should have representations at NATO facilities in  Brussels. Some 100 officers should be employed there, capable  of maintaining contacts with approximately 300 NATO institutions  and agencies. Over a dozen such people should leave for  Brussels in 1994. Kolodziejczyk once again mentioned the issue  of unexpected budget expenditure. The government, he said, had  not decided on a budget amendment that would permit a more  convenient financing of Polish representations to NATO.</p>

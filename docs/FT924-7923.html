			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Plysu managing director quits MR RICHARD Gordon, managing director of Plysu, the manufacturer of plastic bottles, resigned yesterday after a boardroom coup led by non-executive directors. Mr Stephen Nobbs, the finance director, said that following the group's June expansion into Europe with the acquisition of SEP Group, there was a need for greater delegation of decision-making. 'The centralised management style led to bottlenecks with the one person having to take every single decision at the top,' Mr Nobbs said. Mr Gordon had recognised the need for changes but had been unable to put them in place, said Mr Alan Brooker, a non-executive director. The problem had been looming since the SEP acquisition. Plysu was developing into a company with sales of Pounds 100m from eight production sites and was no longer suitable for management style centred around one person. Plysu's shares fell 22p to 243p. Mr Gordon had agreed to limit his public reaction to a statement that there had been 'a serious disagreement with the chairman (Mr James Summerlin)'. Mr Gordon and Mr Summerlin are both substantial shareholders and jointly helped develop Plysu over the past two decades. Plysu brought forward the announcement of its interim results by three weeks as a result of Mr Gordon's resignation. Pre-tax profits in the period to October 9 rose 21 per cent to Pounds 5.81m on sales up by 19 per cent at Pounds 42.45m. Earnings per share rose 17 per cent to 8.4p and the interim dividend is increased from 1.65p to 2p. Mr Malcolm Macintyre, production director, has been appointed acting managing director while a successor to Mr Gordon is found. COMMENT Before yesterday Plysu was successfully following a well-thought out strategy. It was developing new products and pushing into continental Europe. Steady profits and earnings increases had given the company a deserved premium rating. Maybe none of this has changed. But the resignation has been accompanied by the suppression of Mr Gordon's side of what happened which does few shareholders any service. If neither the profit and loss account nor the balance sheet nor the European expansion strategy are off-track, then why such a precipitate departure? At best it is a graceless parting of the ways; at worse something darker lurks. Shareholders who have enjoyed a good ride may decide to get off and watch for a while, even though forecasts for the year give profits of Pounds 12m and earnings of 6.75p.</p>

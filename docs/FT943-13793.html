			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Pension funds With a statutory solvency standard around the corner, pension funds are asking whether their assets are a fair match for their liabilities. Under the detailed rules being drafted by the actuarial profession, liabilities relating to younger members will continue to be matched with equities. Older liabilities will be measured against - and therefore best matched by - gilts. But given the reluctance of fund managers to lend the government more than is absolutely necessary, the search is on for alternatives. Options contracts which guarantee funds the better of equity or gilt market returns are one possibility. Such contracts would match older liabilities for the purposes of solvency but leave open the prospect of equity-style returns. Yet even though derivatives markets are expanding, there is not nearly enough liquidity to allow all funds to cover themselves in this way. Investment banks also charge high premiums for such protection. Assets which share some of the characteristics of equities and bonds could also attract interest. With their income linked to retail prices, for example, utility shares in theory bear some resemblance to index-linked bonds. But though utility shares tend to track gilts over short periods, the similarities are unlikely to be sufficient to impress the actuaries. Apart for the regulatory risks, many utilities are trying hard to look more like equities by diversifying away from their regulated businesses. Most funds will find that the solvency regime leaves no palatable alternative to buying additional gilts.</p>

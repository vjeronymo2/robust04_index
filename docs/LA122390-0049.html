			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: ENVELOPES, PLEASE: SOME TRAVEL AWARDS FOR 1990  </P> <P> To say that it has been a traumatic, tumultuous year in travel would surely be  an understatement, what with rising airline ticket prices due to fuel costs and  bankruptcies, plus cruise line mergers and numerous hotels flirting with  Chapter 11.  </P> <P> For many of us, the art of travel has often been transformed into an endurance  contest. Getting there is no longer even half the fun.  </P> <P> But 1990 was not without its unsung heroes of travel -- hotels, airlines and  people who went above and beyond to remind us that the act of travel can still  be an art. Here, a few who deserve a few kudos:  </P> <P> Airline Service Award:  </P> <P>  -- To Diane Rothberg, first officer, Air Canada. As Rothberg was leaving the  Toronto airport after completing a flight, she noticed a panicked passenger  running into the terminal. It was clearly not this man's day. He had been stuck  in traffic, then his car had a flat tire right in front of the terminal. He was  on the verge of missing his flight, and was pleading at the counter with an Air  Canada ticket agent to help him. Rothberg raced over to the passenger and  jotted down his name and address. She took his car keys and told him to catch  his flight. And what did Rothberg do? She rolled up her sleeves, changed the  tire, parked the passenger's car and arranged for him to pick up his keys.  </P> <P>  -- Phil Winsor, supervisor, Midway Airlines, Washington, D.C. Winsor learned  that a passenger aboard Flight 164 from Chicago had not checked his bags in  time to make his flight. On top of that, the passenger was scheduled to make an  important presentation the next morning at 8 a.m. There was no way his bags  would catch up with him in time. When the passenger landed at 10 p.m., Winsor  met him and found out his shirt size and where he was staying. On his own,  Winsor found a new white shirt and silk tie and had it delivered at 6:30 a.m.  the next morning to the passenger's hotel, compliments of Midway.  </P> <P>  -- Lydia Ortiz, American Airlines. There are those who are convinced that  American Airlines special services rep Lydia Ortiz never sleeps. Ortiz, based  in Puerto Rico, is always at the airport, running between terminals, counters  and gates. She is American's Ms. Fix-it, Puerto Rico's problem solver. And,  with San Juan serving as a major Caribbean hub, there are plenty of passenger  problems.  </P> <P>  -- Richard Branson, owner, Virgin Atlantic Airways. Starting in September,  Branson organized 10 special relief flights to the Persian Gulf area. Each  time, he flew in supplies -- more than 450 tons of food and medicine. And each  time, he flew out with returning hostages.  </P> <P>  -- MGM Grand Air. Last week, the Los Angeles-based luxury airline converted  one of its DC-8s into a cargo plane loaded with everything from 20,000 Mrs.  Fields cookies to Kodak cameras -- holiday gifts to be given to U.S. troops  stationed in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P>  -- Penny Carter, flight attendant, American Airlines. On every flight, Carter  carries with her an additional bag. Inside is her special bathroom kit. She  outfits the tiny lavatory closest to her station with a fabric toilet-top  cover, reading material, flowers, air freshener, a small collection of  seashells, pencils, toothbrushes and toothpaste, doily-wrapped soap dishes and  a sense of humor -- there's even a two-inch globe on a stand "to help you  navigate while you're in there." It goes without saying that most airline  lavatories are a disgrace. It also goes without saying that Carter has  recognized this problem and single-handedly tried to do something about it.  </P> <P> And speaking of bathrooms, an honorable mention goes to John Munro, vice  president of Greyhound. Munro has been dropping into bus stations across North  America and insisting on lunch with the managers of those terminals . . . in  their restrooms. It's a bizarre idea, but Munro has gotten the message across  to bus terminal managers to clean up their act.  </P> <P> Hotel Service Award:  </P> <P>  -- To The Mark, in New York City. It's one thing to get easily seduced by a  hotel when it first opens. After all, the incentive is there for managers as  well as employees to attract business. It's another thing to look at the same  hotel a year later to see if it has lost any of its shine. The answer in The  Mark's case: It hasn't. About the only thing that has happened in the last year  is that positive word-of-mouth among hotel guests has made getting a room there  much harder.  </P> <P>  -- Stouffer hotels. In 1989, the company announced that it would begin  eliminating those nickel-and-dime "extra charges" -- everything from charging  guests for receiving faxes to dialing toll-free calls. Stouffer not only did  it, they've maintained the program.  </P> <P>  -- Sylvia Gabe and the staff of the Sheraton Crossroads Hotel in Mahwah, N.J.  Gabe was scheduled to get married at the hotel in April. She had already put  down a substantial deposit for her reception at the Sheraton. But at the last  minute, the husband-to-be jilted her. So what did Gabe do? Together with the  staff of the hotel, she threw a party for 50 abused and emotionally disturbed  children.  </P> <P> Domestic Airline Food Award:  </P> <P>  -- To Alaska Airlines. Most of the time airline food is an oxymoron. Not on  Alaska. If you've flown the airline, you know what I'm talking about. If you  haven't, you should.  </P> <P> International Airline Food Award:  </P> <P>  -- To Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa (tie). Both airlines have mastered the  art of understanding what food works -- and what doesn't -- at 35,000 feet. And  a special nod of appreciation to Lufthansa for realizing that on short flights  within Europe, a good sandwich and a piece of fresh fruit is precisely what  should be served.  </P> <P> Most Improved Airline Award:  </P> <P>  -- To Northwest. Traditionally, Northwest looked at passenger service as an  afterthought. New ownership and a new philosophy has boosted company morale  and, in turn, passenger satisfaction. Even the food is improved.  </P> <P> Best Airline to Europe Award:  </P> <P>  -- To Virgin Atlantic. For the second year in a row, this airline continues to  do a great job. Disembarking passengers have actually been known to have smiles  on their faces. And while Virgin's business-class service is terrific, most of  the kudos go to the airline's coach service.  </P> <P> Best Airline to Asia Award:  </P> <P>  -- To Cathay Pacific. Its new nonstop service between Los Angeles and Hong  Kong makes a 15-hour journey manageable. The Compassionate Travel Award:  </P> <P>  -- To American Airlines and its Miles for Kids program. Members of American's  frequent-flier advantage program are encouraged to donate a portion of their  accumulated mileage, in increments of 10,000 miles, to help many worthwhile  organizations provide transport for children with special needs.  </P></p>

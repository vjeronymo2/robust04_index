			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / International Press Review: Sunshine journalism - all news is good news / South Africa Since President Mandela's inauguration, most of South Africa's mainstream newspapers have become skilled practioners of 'sunshine journalism.' This is a resolute determination to focus on good news - the ongoing spirit of reconciliation between blacks and whites and South Africa's new international respectability coming top of the list - while ignoring or playing down political and economic problems. Last week, the local press was girding itself for just such a bout of self-congratulation as UK prime minister John Major arrived for a short visit, the first such trip by a British leader since Harold Macmillan clashed with his Afrikaner hosts in 1960. Journalists and editors were quite unprepared for the announcement by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini that he was cancelling Shaka Day, the most important Zulu national holiday, and breaking off relations with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who as well as being home affairs minister and leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, is the king's uncle. Caught between the obligation to report on the monarch's apparent political swing towards the ruling African National Congress and the desire to highlight Mr Major's message of fraternal fellowship, newspapers seemed to weight their stories according to geographic distance from the Zulu heartland. Thus, in relatively insulated Cape Town the Cape Times, a slender but respectable publication, noted the onset of the Zulu rift, but restricted its editorial comment to praising Mr Major's parliamentary address and examining its implications for South Africa. Similarly, in Johannesburg both Business Day and the Star, the country's two most influential dailies, provided detailed analyses of the origins of the Buthelezi-Goodwill feud but offered little serious comment other than to express hope that a resolution could be reached without bloodshed. 'South Africa has not yet sufficiently recovered from the conflict of the past 10 years to make light of the politics of ethnicity,' warned the former. The KwaZulu/Natal newspapers by contrast reported liberally on the affair, but diplomatically refused to take sides. Instead both the Natal Witness and Natal Mercury called for speedy negotiations to resolve the monarch's constitutional position once and for all. Even following Saturday's Shaka Day celebrations, which Chief Buthelezi went ahead with despite the king's non-participation, the Sunday Times, the country's biggest newspaper, chose to focus on Prince Edward's flying meeting with Mr Mandela and the government's planned reconstruction and development plans rather than wading too deeply into the Zulu morass. Meanwhile, Rapport, the most prominent Afrikaans-language paper, seemed of the opinion that the election of the second consecutive black Miss South Africa was of far more import than the labyrinthine world of Zulu royal politics. But while the establishment press has been slow to tackle the Zulu issue, the small but rapidly growing group of black newspapers, whose readership has been more affected by the violence that IFP-ANC faction fighting has caused, showed no such restraint. Reflecting its relatively mainstream politics, The Sowetan, the country's biggest daily, set the tone, lambasting Chief Buthelezi as an irascible, thin-skinned man who sees slights to his character where none exist. Indeed, the only voice raised in the minister's defence was that of the bi-weekly Umafrika, which accused the ANC of 'degrading the monarchy.' Meanwhile the previously anti-royalist City Press, the biggest black Sunday paper, was even more vituperative, charging: 'When we now stone our kings and force them to flee their homes, we are not only blemishing our history, rotten as it is already, we advance the process of dehumanising ourselves.' Having rediscovered a common humanity so recently, however, most South Africans could be forgiven for hoping that the current crisis will soon be resolved. After so many years of misery, more sunshine journalism would not go seriously amiss.</p>

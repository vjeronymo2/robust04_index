			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Observer: Art of survival John Tusa does have the knack of bouncing back. Never given sufficient credit for how he ran the BBC World Service, he was then denied the chance to apply for the director-generalship of the BBC. Now he has quit as Master of Wolfson College after less than a year. But the academic spat at Cambridge University was last week. This week Tusa becomes chairman of the advisory committee for the government art collection. His new influence extends, therefore, to all 15,000 works of mainly British art which adorn the walls of government offices and British embassies. At nearly-new Wolfson College, one of Tusa's many frustrations was the fact that there was no room for modern art in the master's dining room and elsewhere, because of all that space devoted to portraits of ancient academics. Described by one friend as 'pathologically decisive', Tusa would have had exceptionally little patience with academic dithering. Watch out for some fast thinking, though, on how to enliven the walls of Whitehall.</p>

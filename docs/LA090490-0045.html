			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY MAY TIGHTEN LANDSCAPING RULES  </P> <P> Because of the drought, the county's planning staff may tighten landscape  guidelines for new developments in the unincorporated areas to encourage water  conservation.  </P> <P> The staff will ask the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to approve  revisions in the guidelines followed for commercial, industrial and residential  developments that include common open space areas.  </P> <P> Possible changes include restricting the use of water-thirsty grass, requiring  more efficient irrigation equipment and practices, and checking to make sure  landscaping was installed as called for in the plan.  </P> <P> Any changes would be permanent. The staff met with the county's landscape  architect consultants and members of the Water Conservation Landscape Task  Force and recommended against tougher temporary restrictions designed to be in  force until the end of the drought.  </P> <P> If given the go-ahead, the staff would return to the supervisors in February  with the proposed revisions for their final approval or denial.

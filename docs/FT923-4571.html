			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Books: Stranger than truth JANICE Elliott's City of Gates (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 14.99) operates on the simple but often neglected principle that fiction is stranger than truth. The story of Daisy Herbert's adventures in Jerusalem appears at first to be an English-gentlewoman-abroad novel descended from Henry James and EM Forster, all high sensibility and comic asides. Then we meet Eugenia Muna, who keeps the guest-house by the Jaffa Gate and is reputed to have been there 'forever.' This is no simple over-statement, although it takes some time to realise what a strange turn things are taking. Elliott freely mixes comic realism and something which I hesitate to call fantasy because its effect is so convincing, and lacking so completely in feyness. When first we are told that 'Eugenia only had to squint a little and she could see David, weeping, barefoot, in flight from Jerusalem,' we assume that this is poetic licence. But, as the momentum builds, we realise that something altogether other is happening, an intertwining of the marvellous and the everyday in which anything is possible. Elliott gives several clues to the level on which she is working, stating clearly at the end of the first chapter that ' . . .in Jerusalem, it is forever one time and all times: past, present and to come.' Muna knows that 'history is not a train, but water in a bucket. Slosh it around and anything might slop over.' She also knows that the Gnostics hold intuition to be higher than reason; and it is in this sense that City of Gates is a Gnostic novel, neither mystic nor fantastic but obeying its own rules. The result is an unusual combination of the universal and the intimate, conveyed through a succession of scenes which are almost as funny as they are touching. This is a most unusual and deeply-felt novel but it is never daunting, thanks to the lightness of its humour. Another superb but very different achievement is that of Eugene McCabe in Death and Nightingales (Secker &amp; Warburg. Pounds 13.99). This is an archetypal tale of love and betrayal and the brute latent in us all, set in rural Ireland in 1883. Beth Winters, the Catholic step-daughter of Protestant landowner Billy, is pregnant by one of his Catholic tenants, Liam Ward, and plans to steal Billy's gold and run away with her man. Her mother, who died in a farmyard accident, was already pregnant (although she never said by whom) when she married Billy - hence Beth's ambiguous position in his household. He exploits her both as free labour and as an object for his drunken lust; yet, there is still some remnant of affection between them. Beth suspects that Ward is only interested in her for the gold, but even the reader is shocked when his real plans are revealed. McCabe is also well-known as a dramatist, and one of the many remarkable things about this novel is the way that everything, from the cattle of the misty Fermanagh landscape to the birds that sing or keep silent, contributes to the drama. As Beth notes at her lowest point: 'How extraordinarily beautiful the world could be and all the creatures in it, excepting mankind.' Anyone looking for an explanation of the roots of sectarian hatred will find it here. Death and Nightingales is the best Irish novel to appear for a long time. Remembering Light and Stone, the second novel by a younger Irish writer, Deirdre Madden (Faber, Pounds 14.99), is also full of good things but has a narrower focus. 'I hate convenient, empty words,' Aisling, the narrator, tells us right at the beginning; and, as we get to know her, we find that she is not the sort of person to accept any kind of cliche, whether it be about emigration, exile, national identity, youth, art, politics, nostalgia or love. To say that the novel is about a young Irishwoman living and working in a small Italian hill village while trying to sort herself out gives no indication of the originality and vigour of Madden's approach to this commonplace theme, nor of her unusual sensitivity. I read it on a long train journey and felt as if I had made a new friend, passing the the time listening to an intelligent, honest and original contemporary. While I might not always agree with her opinions, she has a wonderful way of expressing them and has produced that most rare of artifices: a novel which is at once highly literary and, yet, immensely readable. The latter is a quality associated closely with Maeve Binchy, along with a warm heart. She is on grand form in The Copper Beech (Orion Pounds 14.99), an expansive village saga which follows the lives of a primary school class in the small town of Shancarrig from 1950 to the present day. She has a fondness for tear-jerking sudden deaths but, that apart, she is a far sharper and funnier observer of changing times and morals than the saccharine TV adaptations of her works would suggest.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike hits Australian nickel mine WESTERN MINING Corporation, the Australian resources group, yesterday refused to comment on a further outbreak of industrial action at its troubled Kambalda nickel mining site in Western Australia, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. However, the Australian Workers Union said workers were on indefinite strike over a claim for higher piece work rates for transporting ore to the surface. Mr Ray Delbridge, president of the union's mining division, said there was a 'stalemate' between the union and the company. He said no meetings had been scheduled with WMC management. 'The guys have simply lost all confidence in management (and) there has been a complete breakdown in communication. This issue has been bubbling along since September,' Mr Delbridge said. The strike is understood to have affected supplies of ore for smelting, but both Kambalda mills were said to be working. The smelter is also fed by other WMC mines in the area. WMC shares fell 12 cents to ADollars 4.73 (Pounds 2.08) on the Australian Stock Exchange as news of the strike filtered through. The group lost 14 days nickel production in the December quarter because of industrial action over proposals to replace five-day working with continuous mining in shifts over seven days. WMC announced in November that it intended to abandon plans for a ADollars 105m expansion of nickel production at Kambalda because of opposition from the union, which it said had 'reneged' on an earlier deal. The proposed expansion would have increased deep mining at several mines in the Kambalda area, where WMC produces about 35,000 tonnes of nickel a year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik by </F> Frits Schaling in Bratislava on 17 May: "Moravcik: A Race  Against Time"]    [Text] The silence in the reception room of Slovak Prime  Minister Moravcik is broken only by the insistent noise of a  large, standing 19th-century clock, whose pendulum slowly and  provocatively ticks the seconds away. Every half-hour, the  mechanism makes a grinding noise, reminding everyone that the  time is slipping by for Moravcik and his coalition government.  Installed in mid-March, the government now has just a few  months until the early elections on 30 September and 1 October.    It is not an enviable position to be in. Moravcik and his  government, which comprises three politically very heterogeneous  parties, must create some order in the economic, administrative,  and political mess left behind by Vladimir Meciar, the populist  and just as popular leader of the HZDS (Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia), which, following a frontal assault on his  politics by Slovak President Michal Kovac, had to leave the  field.    True, the new prime minister knows how to get nice figures  in  the popularity polls (about 25 percent), but that is still 9  percent less that his HZDS rival, who has long been busy with  his election campaign, in which, as is customary, he tackle not  so much the issues as the people.    Jozef Moravcik, who in 1992 was the last Czech foreign  minister and the Slovak foreign minister in Meciar's Cabinet,  remains confident. He still has no time to conduct a campaign.  He leads his Cabinet and does it conscientiously, soundly, and  even a bit dully.    He feels that his most important task is to quickly mend  Slovakia's dilapidated image. The biggest obstacle to this is  the time factor. So how big are the chances of the Slovak  Government's winning this race against time?    Moravcik answered the question with apparent reluctance. "It  is indeed a race for which we have little time. There is only  one way to win this race: Be consistent and systematic. First,  the problems must be solved. These decisions were always  postponed by the last government. The most important thing in  this respect is privatization. We have to solve the problem of  coupon privatization. We have already approved the time frame  for this: The voucher booklets will be sold to the people in  early September. Another problem is the budget. We are trying to  maintain the deficit at 4 percent of the GNP. We want more  favorable conditions for loans from businesses. The situation  is not at all rosy as regards the financing of education and  health care."    Later this month, an IMF delegation will investigate the  possibility of giving Slovakia a stand-by loan of $230 million.  The condition for this loan is that Slovakia bring its budget  deficit down from 23 to 6 billion krone (1.3 billion guilders  [G] to G360 million). That will seem daring to a great many  Slovak voters.    Moravcik said: "The only way is to convince them that these  resources are needed to stabilize the country's financial  situation. Everyone feels the problems in this area very  acutely."    One of the government's most important goals is to restore  international confidence in Slovakia and to attract foreign  capital and investment. "We feel that people accept us and that  we are successfully creating a positive attitude about  ourselves. However, there is one problem: On the one hand,  people are showing understanding, but, on the other, they are  playing a waiting game. The crucial moment will come at the end  of June, when the IMF makes a decision on the standby loan."    "For Slovakia, it is not just a question of the standby  loan," Moravcik said, "but also of the IMF's approval of its  entire economic policy."    During Vladimir Meciar's government, the impression was  often  given that Slovakia was a besieged fortress surrounded by  enemies. What has Moravcik done to change this?    "We do not at all have the feeling that we are enemies or  that we have enemies. Our goal is to bring peace to the  situation and not to get embroiled in counterproductive  controversies. We are going to convince the voters that  antagonistic politics does not offer any prospects for this  country."    One of the most controversial problems in Slovak domestic  and  foreign policy is the position of the Hungarian minority (11.5  percent of the population) and relations with Hungary. The last  government tried to limit minority rights and took a tough  confrontational stance vis-a-vis Budapest. The new government  has taken a completely different tack: Not only was Moravcik's  coalition government set up with support from the Hungarian  minority party, but it also immediately began to improve the  climate between Bratislava and Budapest. After much to-ing and  fro-ing, this resulted in a talk between Moravcik and Hungarian  Prime Minister Boross. "We wanted a meeting on a higher,  official level, but we could not agree on the content of the  communique, so we sought out another forum and decided on an  informal meeting. In this way, we wanted to demonstrate that,  although we are not currently in a position to resolve a number  of open questions, such as the immutability of borders, the  political will is there to seek out solutions in a friendly  atmosphere."</p>

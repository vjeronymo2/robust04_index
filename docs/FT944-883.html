			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Ministers back reform of EU cash transfers The government has given broad support for a European Commission plan to make it cheaper and quicker for small businesses to transfer money across borders. The proposed legislation has been vigorously opposed by European banking organisations, which argue that legislation could disrupt efforts by larger banks to improve transfer arrangements and mean that smaller banks would no longer offer transfer services. Apacs, the UK organisation which represents payment clearing services, said yesterday that it would now try to ensure that the commission's directive would be flexible enough not to inhibit competition. Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister, said that while British banks generally did well compared with other European banking sectors in terms of providing transfer services in good time, they were ranked much lower in terms of expense. He said: 'We need higher standards and much more observance of standards. The average time taken to transfer a payment - which a study for the commission showed had increased to 4.8 days in 1994 - is wholly unsatisfactory in the single market.' The French government has indicated that pursuing the proposals would be a priority for its presidency, although the UK government believes that the target of reaching a common position on the proposals by April is 'very optimistic'. The measures put forward by the commission would ban double-charging - where banks charge customers for receiving cash as well as for sending it. It would mean that banks would have to refund the charge where the transfer was not completed, unless another organisation accepted responsibility. They would also have to ensure that money should be credited to the recipient's account within six working days, unless the customer and originating bank agreed it could take longer. The government will be looking in detail at elements which include the proposals for refunds if the transfer is not completed; that interest should be paid if a transfer is completed late; and that administrative charges should be limited to those that would apply in a domestic credit transfer. Apacs expressed some concern that the draft directive appeared to apply to high-value as well as to low-value payments. The original intention had been to limit the plans to transfers of under Ecu10,000 (Pounds 7,894).</p>

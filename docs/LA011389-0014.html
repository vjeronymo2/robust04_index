			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINDS BLASTING TO 100 M.P.H. RIP SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Hurricane-force winds battered Southern California on Thursday morning,  shredding a blimp and closing the runways at Ontario International Airport,  ripping parts of the roofs from two buildings, knocking over trucks, toppling  trees and power poles and fanning two brush fires.  </P> <P> At least 29,000 customers lost electrical power as the cool, dry, Santa Ana  winds blasted through areas below mountain canyons and passes at speeds as high  as 100 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Police donned goggles to direct traffic as the down-slope winds whipped sand  and dust into an opaque, tornado-like cloud between Ontario and San Bernardino,  prompting a series of Sigalerts on Interstates 10 and 15 to warn of hazardous  driving conditions.  </P> <P> The winds began to ease Thursday afternoon as a new weather system started  pushing toward Southern California from the north.  </P> <P> And forecasters said at nightfall that "the Santa Anas are essentially over."  They said today should be mostly clear and rather on the cool side, with winds  gusting to no more than 25 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. in the most exposed areas.  </P> <P> The gusts peaked shortly before dawn Thursday, hammering hardest at the  foothill communities in western San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> The $6 million Airships Inc. craft, used by the Pepsi Cola Co. to advertise its  Pepsi and Slice soft drinks, was "literally blown to bits" at its moorings at  the Ontario airport.  </P> <P> "Large pieces of it took off in the wind and proceeded to head toward Chino,"  airport manager Michael DiGirolamo said.  </P> <P> Little more than the nose cone of the airship remained attached to the mooring  pole. The fabric of the craft was reduced to ribbons and the gondola was dumped  about 30 yards from the pole.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Airships Inc. said the gondola and engines were saved. But the  polyester fabric skin, designed to hold 233,100 cubic feet of helium, was a  total loss. The spokesman said the skin could be rebuilt within six weeks, but  too late for the craft's next scheduled duty -- the Super Bowl in Miami on Jan.  22.  </P> <P> Ontario Airport spokeswoman Angie Summers said winds gusting between 80 m.p.h.  and 100 m.p.h., blowing dust and debris from the shredded airship onto the main  runways combined to close the airport from 9 p.m. Wednesday until about 7:45  a.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> She said that at least 45 flights were delayed, canceled, or diverted to other  airfields, including Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> An air cargo container pushed by the winds slammed into the side of a Southwest  Airlines jetliner parked at Ontario. Southwest spokesman Ron Todd said the  impact dented the Boeing 737 and punched a small hole in the fuselage.  </P> <P> A section of roof was torn from an Ontario Airport building that houses a  kitchen providing food for up to 100 flights a day. David McMichael, shift  manager at the Marriott In-Flite Services plant, said a 300-square-foot slab  was torn from the building's roof at about 2 a.m.  </P> <P> In nearby Rancho Cucamonga, the winds tore away a patch of roof at a San  Bernardino County sheriff's substation, scattering paper work and personal  effects around a briefing room and locker area. Several deputies said their  personal cars in the parking lot were damaged by airborne debris.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief Jerry Hunter of the Orange County Fire Department said a  100-acre blaze in Trabuco Canyon was started by two arcing electrical wires at  about 8:20 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> He said it took about 220 firefighters from throughout the county more than  three hours to control the blaze, which briefly threatened about 50 homes in  the Rose Canyon area.  </P> <P> "It burned up quite a few back yards, but the houses were saved," said fire  spokeswoman Kathleen Cha.  </P> <P> There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries in the storm.  </P> <P> Late Thursday, a brush fire fanned by gusts of up to 60 m.p.h. spread rapidly  in the Ramona area of San Diego County, blackening about 160 acres.  </P> <P> No homes were threatened and California Department of Forestry officials  expected full control by this morning. Officials said a downed power line  ignited the thick grass and brush in the area.  </P> <P> Southern California Edison Co. said power was restored by late Thursday morning  to most of the 29,000 customers blacked out in Los Angeles, Orange and San  Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said only about 100 of its  customers, in the Canoga Park and Sun Valley areas, lost electricity and in  most cases, power was restored promptly.  </P> <P> Interstates 10 and 15 remained open Thursday, but California Highway Patrol  Officer James O'Brien said there were overturned trucks "everywhere."  </P> <P> "The most spectacular blow-over was where Interstates 10 and 15 meet in  Ontario," said CHP Officer Vivian Firlien. "It left part of a truck hanging  over the edge of one of those high transition roads, dangling over the  motorists below."  </P> <P> Lance Davis, general manager of a large truck stop in Ontario, said at least  700 big rigs were parked there at one point early Thursday, waiting for the  winds to ease.  </P> <P> Because of the blowing dust and sand, traffic in some areas of western San  Bernardino County was still moving at less than 5 m.p.h. at midday.  </P> <P> "Visibility was down to 10 feet in some places," Firlien said.  </P> <P> Dave Beusterien, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides  forecasts for The Times, said the high winds were generated by a large area of  high pressure stationed over the Great Basin late Wednesday and early Thursday.  </P> <P> He said the high pressure began to weaken late Thursday as a moderate,  low-pressure storm system started to move south along the coast toward Southern  California. The storm system will bring increasing clouds, and a "slight  chance" of showers, to Southern California early Saturday, Beusterien said.  </P> <P> It should be mostly sunny and clear on Sunday, he said, with increasing clouds  on Monday and Tuesday.  </P> <P> The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Thursday was 61  degrees. Relative humidity ranged from 41% to 14%.  </P> <P> Eric Malnic reported from Los Angeles, Louis Sahagun reported from the Ontario  area.

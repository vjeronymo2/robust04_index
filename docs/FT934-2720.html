			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Private View: The last miner in the county It will be a black Christmas for some. 'The lads finish work at dinnertime,' the lodge secretary said, 'and we'll be away down the road to the pubs havin' a few pints and reminiscin' about what was and what could have been. Aye, it'll certainly not be any celebration.' That was yesterday, when 650 men took their leave of Wearmouth colliery, Sunderland, one of the oldest pits in Britain and the last in the once-great Durham coalfield. When Alan Mardghum (pronounced 'Marjam') was born in 1955 there were 700,000 miners working in 850 British coalmines. When he went to work there were still a quarter of a million. Today there are just 16,500. Coal, which fired the Industrial Revolution and powered the British Empire, has become a cottage industry. In the 14 months since the Government caused a public outcry by announcing that 31 pits were to close, 23,000 men have left the industry. Wearmouth was one of 12 mines reprieved for 'market testing'; but like seven others of the dozen so far, and in spite of high productivity on its remaining face seven and a half miles out under the North Sea, it failed the test. Alan Mardghum is so upset, he cannot admit that it is the end. He clings to the hope that a private buyer will be found for Wearmouth's 140m tonnes of proven reserves, and that one day British mining will be resurrected by a repentant public and government. As lodge secretary of the miners' union, he has mastered the language of political indictment: he blames government for the lack of a proper energy policy, the 'dash for gas', massive subsidies for nuclear power, the electricity link from France, coal imports - all, he said, part of the vendetta against miners and their union. I take it you're not a Tory voter, I said. 'Certainly not.' He laughed. 'It's not that apparent, is it?' It is apparent enough from the campaign posters and rude cartoons adorning the lodge secretary's office. This is Scargill territory, a left-wing pit where the men have always responded to the call. Mardghum, a member of the Labour Party since 23, grew up in the nearby village of Southwick a mile along the bank of the River Wear. He described it as a hard area of high unemployment where children kept time by the hooter of the former Wear Dock shipyard. Southwick is famous: here the late John Adie, the adoptive father of TV reporter Kate, had his chemist's shop - now a grunge fashion boutique. Alan and his brother were the first miners in the immediate family. Their father worked on the buses. I mentioned all those mothers who for generations had tried to prevent their sons going down the pit. Wasn't it a good thing they did not have to do that any more? 'No, I don't think it's a good thing. Not for any sentimental reasons . . . People tend to get a bit misty-eyed about the coal industry. It's a dirty, filthy, horrible job at the end of the day. Nobody who tells the truth would pretend any different. But the way you've got to look at it is: is there an alternative energy source?' Let us suppose, I said, that the alternative sources are forever cheaper. Is it necessarily a disaster to lose coalmining? 'I think it is. I think the city council would agree with that. I think you'll see a rapid rise in crime, because there isn't any alternative employment. 'You talk about mothers not wanting their son to go down the pit. But I'm certain if they had the choice between the son joyriding stolen cars or burgling people's houses or going down the pit, they would take the opportunity for them to earn a decent wage and be supported by a union that is fighting for decent conditions.' Like other smokestack areas, Wearside presents a surreal picture. Scenes of dereliction where coal, shipbuilding and heavy engineering once prospered are patched over with new motorways, shopping centres, light industrial parks. In one stands a group of 'units' mockingly designed like Greek temples with brick columns and concrete pediments. There might be new jobs, said Mardghum, but they were too few and too low-paid. He cannot accept that heavy industry is finished. How could an island trading nation not have its own merchant shipbuilding industry? There's no God's law which says we have to build our own ships, I said, if we can buy them cheaper from Koreans. 'Well, I think there's a moral argument when they're losing, I think, 100 a year killed in Korean shipyards. There's certainly a moral argument against importing coal that's produced by black slave labour in South Africa or child labour in Colombia.' Mardghum may have more excuse than reason for his gloomy refusal to foresee a decent future for the area. The man himself is ebullient: it is the NUM official who is pessimistic. 'If there's an upturn we'll have another boom and another slump. That's the way the capitalist system works. It's always jam tomorrow. They've promised us that for years and years and years. 'Take less now and you get more tomorrow'. It never materialises.' What will you do now? I asked. 'The first thing is to get over the shock of losing a job. It's the first time ever I've been unemployed.' For his 17 years work he will collect a redundancy cheque for Pounds 25,000. But the chances of a union activist finding work were slim. 'So what I'll probably do, what I should have done when I was 17 or 18, is go to university and study for a degree. 'I've thought about social work. Through mixing with lads at the pit I would have an aptitude to do something like working with teenagers with behavioural problems. I'm a bit of a softie, so I don't think I would work with babies or young kids who have been abused. I don't think I could stand that.' Would you work for a capitalist organisation? 'If you rule out working for a capitalist organisation you'd be on the dole the rest of your life,' he laughed. 'I've got political principles but I drink scotch and Newcastle beer that make a massive contribution to the Tory Party. I mean, I'm not stupid. I'll be delighted to get a job in whatever.' It could be the last Christmas with money for a long time. 'I'll certainly not go crackers with money just because I'll have a few bob in the bank from redundancy payments. We'll spend no more this year than we did last year: you're talking about 1,500 quid, 2,000 quid. That's what we normally spend.' He will improve the council house and buy a better second-hand car, perhaps a Sierra. 'If the money's run out and if I haven't got a job, we've got a decent house to live in. So long as it's a roof over your head and its warm and comfortable, its something.' The Wearmouth pensioners will have their usual Christmas dinner (in summer there is a coach trip to Blackpool or Scarborough). Marghum hopes the Durham miners' gala, the day of bands and political speeches, will survive into its 110th year. Do you think Britain is losing something apart from its coal? 'I think it loses the culture that miners have brought to the country, like the brass bands, the miners' welfares and things. I canna think of any other group of workers that built a community around one industry as such. 'When you look at the artists, the Sidney Chaplins of this world, the politicians the union and industry's thrown up, I think it will be a terrible miss.' Miners had a special place in everybody's heart, he said. 'I mean, even Thatcher's got a regard for miners - she said she was terrified to be beat by the miners in 84-85.' But the popular view was often distorted. 'Particularly in the south of England they still view coalmining as a little lad of 12 gettin' down the pit with his pony and pushing tubs of coal around. You've got a bit of how-green-was-my-valley attitude. There's a lot of nostalgia about coalminin', more and more now its in a rapid state of decline.' An ignorant nostalgia? 'In some respects, yes. And I mean that with the best respect to everybody who supported us, because we've had tremendous support from across the country. People need to be made aware that it's a high-tech, highly-competitive industry that's been butchered.' What will you regret most - apart from losing your job, I mean? 'I'll certainly miss the camaraderie, the sense of being part of a collective - that's very, very important in me life - where one man looks out for another. When you're working underground you're fighting Mother Nature. To do that you've got to be very vigilant.' What have you learned from it? 'I think I'm a better person for having worked there and mixing with the lads whom I represent. They've been absolutely tremendous.' His eyes were blinking now. 'And I would like to think that, you know, I've done me best. Warn't always right, but I think I have always done me best to represent the lads. 'And I learnt that from working with them, being honest with them, having arguments with them. Hasn't always been easy. I couldn't wish, I cannot imagine working that length of time anywhere else other than with these. I mean, they've been absolutely brilliant. 'We've lost this battle. This was one of the most important for us. But we'll be back again in some form.' He paused a while. 'So, yes. Very, very sad.'</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DEYOE RETURNS TO LEAD TAFT TO 60-41 WIN  </P> <P> Senior forward Jason Deyoe showed no ill effects from a recent wrist injury  when he scored 14 points, grabbed nine rebounds and blocked six shots to lead  visiting Taft High to a 60-41 win over Van Nuys in a nonleague game Friday  night.  </P> <P> Deyoe left a game Monday in the Simi Valley tournament after being hurt and sat  out Taft's loss to Kennedy on Wednesday. But his return to the lineup allayed  the fears of Coach Jim Woodard.  </P> <P> "He told me at Tuesday's practice that he couldn't turn the key in the ignition  of his car," Woodard said. "I was scared to death we had lost him for the  season."  </P> <P> X-rays showed no break, and Deyoe returned to action wearing a brace above his  shooting hand.  </P> <P> James Yoakum added 16 points and Cornell Hill scored 10 for Taft (3-2).

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS TRADE BAIT, FERRY RANKS HIGH;  </P> <P> CLIPPERS ARE LISTENING TO OFFERS FOR THEIR TOP DRAFT PICK  </P> <P> Round and round they go, trade rumors nonstop for a player who's 'round the  world.  </P> <P> Danny Ferry isn't in the National Basketball Assn.? Wrong. Danny Ferry is very  much a part of the league, even as his season began in Italy. Mr. Popular, in  absentia.  </P> <P> The Clippers have talked trade, if only on a peripheral level, ever since they  made the 6-foot-10 All-American forward the No. 2 pick in the June 27 draft.  And the talks continued until the day Ferry signed with Il Messaggero in Rome.  And even now, with Ferry playing in Italy, the talks have kept going.  </P> <P> Why? It's partly because of the gathering of most front-office personnel and  coaches at the recent league meeting that has made the ferry-go-round the most  popular ride in the NBA.  </P> <P> Let's take a spin down the rumor mill:  </P> <P>  -- From Charlotte, two No. 1 draft choices and a player, perhaps Dell Curry.  </P> <P>  -- From Golden State, Ralph Sampson and a No. 1, at least before the Warriors  traded Sampson to Sacramento.  </P> <P>  -- From Miami, Kevin Edwards and a No. 1.  </P> <P>  -- From San Antonio, Willie Anderson and a No. 1, although Spur Chairman Red  McCombs does not want to part with Anderson, despite the cool relations between  last season's rookie-of-the-year runner-up and Coach Larry Brown. Or, Frank  Brickowski and a No. 1 and a No. 2.  </P> <P>  -- From Philadelphia, Hersey Hawkins and a No. 1.  </P> <P>  -- From Cleveland, Ron Harper and a No. 1.  </P> <P> Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said he has talked with "10 or 11 teams"  since Ferry was drafted but would not discuss details, except to say that talks  never reached the serious stage. That is not a surprise, considering that other  teams would naturally look to take advantage of the Clippers' misfortune of  losing their No. 1 pick.  </P> <P> "It came out . . . that we would listen to offers for Danny Ferry," Baylor  said. "Many teams have called us about him, but some of the trade rumors have  started before we had even talked to some teams.  </P> <P> "I won't deny that we've talked to several clubs, but I won't comment on what  we've discussed."  </P> <P> Owner Donald T. Sterling would prefer to keep Ferry, at least until the spring,  when the matter can be reassessed after the Italian season. But he also  understands the offers are coming.  </P> <P> "If it's a reasonable and an equitable offer, we might make a trade," he said.  "Are we soliciting offers? No. But are we getting calls? Yes. There have been a  number of offers. Most have been for multiple draft choices, and we probably,  if we were to make a trade, would expect players first and draft choices  second."  </P> <P> Most trade talk seems to be about both, probably so the Clippers could get a  player they want and the other team would not lose too many bodies until Ferry  could return next season. Most of all, though, it's because of a growing  feeling within the organization that the time has come to let an already young  team grow without the worry of adding three rookies every year. Do they really  need two more first-round draft choices coming in next season?  </P> <P> Sterling, as Baylor and director of scouting Barry Hecker have said, insists  that the Clippers had no indication Ferry would balk at coming to a team loaded  with forwards and stories of ineptness. And Ferry himself has said it was not a  Clipper-motivated move.  </P> <P> So why are there so many disbelievers?  </P> <P> Or are some people talking trade with the Clippers expecting a fire sale to try  and recoup some of the losses from Ferry's departure?  </P> <P> That thinking, Sterling said, would be wrong.  </P> <P> "I don't think Danny Ferry's decision to go to Europe was bad," he said. "But I  also don't think it's his ultimate decision. As he explained it, the decision  is for one year and he intends to consider coming back to America to play in  the NBA. His rights are very valuable, and our organization is always looking  to improve. If we could trade those rights for equal value or better, we would  seriously consider making the trade. If not, we will retain them."  </P> <P> But as Orlando Magic General Manager Pat Williams told the Orlando Sentinel:  "Realistically, if Danny had been picked by any other team in the NBA, this  wouldn't have happened. This was just his way of making his unhappiness with  the Clippers clear to everyone."  </P> <P> Let the bidding continue.  </P> <P> The Clippers came to a contract agreement with guard Jeff Martin of Murray  State Friday.  </P> <P> The numbers for Martin, the 31st player selected in the draft, are similar to  those that Jay Edwards, the 33rd pick, agreed to the day before -- three years,  two of which are guaranteed. Martin, as the higher choice, will get a slight  boost from Edwards' estimated $200,000 rookie salary.  </P> <P> Martin, a 6-foot-6, 195-pound shooting guard, was the Ohio Valley Conference  player of the year last season at Murray State in Kentucky after averaging 25.6  points a game. He became the Clippers' No. 1 property from the draft when Ferry  signed to play in Italy.  </P></p>

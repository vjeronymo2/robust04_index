			<p>CSO     [Text] The Comptroller General's report describes a series  of irregularities and deficiencies discovered by that agency  during 1993. They were found in the central and the  decentralized administration, in governors' offices, legislative  assemblies, city halls, and municipal councils.    Cases of misapplication of funds (used for purposes other  than those intended) have been observed in the central  administration for more than 664 million bolivares; the  fractionalization of construction contracts to avoid prior  review, for 450 million bolivares; irregularities in the Daily  Care Homes program for 4.7 million bolivares; and a number of  irregularities in the rental of equipment for the 1992 elections  for 164 million bolivares plus $136,000. There was a diversion  to other purposes of funds allocated for the modernization of  the Treasury; a quantity of merchandise abandoned and with  evidence of pilferage, amounting to more than $9 million and  located in customs and warehouses; lack of accountability of  vehicles belonging to the state and the assignment of some of  them to retired military officers; and the blockage in  commercial banks of 287 million bolivares allotted to the Milk  Fund and Food Fund programs.    According to the report, 91 warnings were given during the  period for lack of documentation and wrongful payment for 37  million bolivares. Employees were fined 606,500 bolivares for  violating the regulations. Thirteen investigations were begun of  presumably irregular acts, and five accusations were sent to the  state prosecutor for civil and criminal charges.    With regard to tax receipts, the comptroller's report  describes delays and frequent requests for postponements, to the  extent that information on 1992's accounts is available. In  addition, the organization reports shortcomings in accounting  operations and defects in conducting collections. In the area of  customs, the report says that airport customs at Maiquetia has  not turned in its accounts for 1990, 1991, and 1992, while  customs' accounts at La Guaira and Puerto Cabello for 1992 are  still pending.    The Comptroller's Office says that, with regard to Tax Stamp  fees, none of the Finance Ministry's regional offices has turned  in its accounts.    As for the Value Added Tax, the office inspected the  customs'  posts to oversee compliance with requirements, the truthfulness  of declarations, the determination of the tax base, and billing  and payment of taxes, following which it concluded that existing  deficiencies have created the conditions for the commission of  irregularities and impede the proper oversight of billing and  collecting taxes.    With regard to liquor taxes, it was noted that 1.184 billion  bolivares that were declared were not paid within the legal time  limit and late fees were not collected.  <H5>  States and Municipalities </H5>   The report says that the Comptroller's Office conducted 19  inspections, of which the field work was concluded for nine, and  another three were still being conducted at the end of 1993. It  is noted that the inspection plan was suspended for a time due  to activities providing advice to new governors and mayors on  such matters as the changes in budget laws and ordinances, and  the role of municipal comptrollers.    The organization began 18 administrative investigations and  declared 66 regional and local officials to be responsible. In  addition, 32 charges were substantiated and forwarded to the  prosecutor, with evidence of civil and criminal responsibility.  <H5>  Decentralized Administration </H5>   The Comptroller's Office carried out its responsibilities  with the decentralized agencies by means of inspections,  financial and administrative audits, and supervision, for a  total of 512 actions. The majority of these dealt with oversight  of the Program Law for Financing the Investment Plan;  surveillance of the privatization process and use of funds from  the so-called social megaproject; and inspection of the  austerity program ordered by the government in 1992.    The organization confirmed the existence of attitudes  contrary to fiscal discipline and to the efficient management of  public services, and of disrespect for legal procedures "with no  sign of a desire to remedy the situation and to apply suitable  sanctions against the officials responsible, with the  aggravating circumstance of the high social and financial cost  which, in the country's current condition, the erratic and  inefficient performance of public institutions entails." The  report states that these situations were promptly brought to the  attention of the pertinent authorities so that they could take  the required corrective measures.    Decentralized organizations and activities investigated by  the comptroller included the indebtedness of the PDVSA  [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.], the situation in Pequiven  [Petrochemical Company of Venezuela, Inc.], construction  contracts of CVG [Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana], public  credit obligations of Bauxiven [Venezuelan Bauxite, Inc.],  payment of interest at Edelca [Caroni River Electrification  Project], the sale of products at less than international prices  at Fesilven [expansion not given], verification of the terms of  sale of Bandagro [Agricultural-Livestock Development Bank],  oversight of the austerity programs at the national  universities, evaluation of zero-coupon bond operations at the  Central Bank, review of obligations undertaken and use made of  funds received by the Workers Bank of Venezuela, analysis of the  financial situation of the Industrial Bank, evaluation of the  privatization program of the Investment Fund of Venezuela, study  of the restructuring process at Corpoindustria, inspections at  Cadafe [Electrical Administration and Development Corporation],  evaluation of the John Paul II program, of the Simon Bolivar  Center, analysis of losses at the National Institute of Race  Tracks, the financial situation of the Venezuelan Institute of  Social Security, and analysis of investments by INCE [National  Institute of Cooperative Education].</p>

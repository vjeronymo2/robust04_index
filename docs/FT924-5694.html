			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Macquarie confident after record first half MACQUARIE Bank, the privately-owned Australian banking and corporate advisory group, yesterday announced a 13.6 per cent increase in interim net profits to a record ADollars 26.6m (USDollars 18.2m) for the six months to the end of September. The result contrasts sharply with big full-year losses announced last week by Westpac Banking Corporation and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, two of Australia's biggest banks. Macquarie said the improved result reflected better trading conditions, innovative products, and a reduction in write-offs against bad and doubtful debts to ADollars 1.5m from ADollars 2.7m in the comparable period of the previous year. Mr Tony Berg, managing director, said the bank was confident the improved result would be repeated in the second half. 'I am confident the economy is going through a slow recovery,' he said. Macquarie said total assets increased by 28.6 per cent to ADollars 3.04bn, while group shareholders' funds rose to ADollars 299m from ADollars 272m at the end of the last full year in March. The bank said its emphasis on service and tailored banking products helped expand the branch-banking business. The property, capital markets, money market and corporate services divisions also performed well, although fixed interest profits were hit by difficult conditions in the government and semi-government bond market.</p>

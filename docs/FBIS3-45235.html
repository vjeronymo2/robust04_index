The meeting was presided over by Vice  Governor Liu Guanghe. Provincial party committee Secretary Yin  Kesheng and other leading comrades from other sectors concerned,  including Doba, Ma Yougong, and Zhang Jimin, attended the  meeting.    According to the plan formulated at the meeting, the  provincial party committee and provincial government will  dispatch 10 inspection groups to carry out an inspection of the  performance of some autonomous prefectures, prefectures, cities,  and some organs directly under the provincial authorities in the  three stages of the anticorruption operation.    During the meeting, Secretary Yin Kesheng presented his  opinions on how to make this forthcoming inspection a success.  He first demanded that all comrades accurately estimate the  current situation in the anticorruption operation. He noted:  Since the start of the anticorruption operation last August,  all localities and departments have taken action to launch the  operation in light of local circumstances. Initial success has  been achieved in those localities and departments which have  performed well. Generally speaking, the operation is following  a good line. Cadres at and above the county and office level in  party and government organs have made self-assessments against  the five requirements of honesty and self-discipline, and have  begun to correct their mistakes on their own. In light of the  present state that our leading cadres are taking the initiative  in practicing honesty and self-discipline, 10 stipulations and a  series of rules have been adopted, banning cadres from accepting  cash rewards and demanding that leading cadres minimize social  appointments. Now it is found that most cadres in this province  have been devoted to public duty and exerted themselves to meet  the requirements. However, we also must be clearly aware that  we have only achieved initial success in the ongoing  anticorruption operation, which is still much short of the  public's expectation. And the performance varies from locality  to locality and from department to department. Some localities  and departments have not been firm enough in their attitude and  down-to-earth enough in their work, and what they have done  still is quite superficial, while other localities and  departments, being afraid of exposing real problems, have tried  to play down some key issues, practice favoritism, and cover up  some major important cases. Their wrong attitude and practices  which have directly affected the progress of the anticorruption  operation must be resolutely corrected. In the anticorruption  operation in the future, all localities and departments must  further strengthen leadership, try very hard to perform their  duties, and make sustained efforts to carry out the  anticorruption operation in depth.    Yin Kesheng expressed his hope that all the major leading  bodies at the provincial level would set store by the  forthcoming inspection and appoint comrades of good quality with  strong senses of responsibility to fill the inspection groups.  All the inspection groups must pursue the principle of seeking  truth from facts, going deep into the grass-roots level, being  adept at soliciting opinions from among the public, and daring  to deal with knotty problems and to expose real problems; never  should they render the inspection a mere show.    Yin Kesheng asserted: The most important points that one  must  bear in mind in the anticorruption operation are that one must  do it in real earnest and in a persistent spirit. Party and  government departments at all levels definitely must do the work  in a down-to-earth and effective manner so as to win the  public's trust.</p>

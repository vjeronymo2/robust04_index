			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Region claims extra rights: Instability grows in former Soviet Union as Ukraine, Georgia, Estonia and the Urals clash with Moscow ONE of the richest and most highly industrialised regions in Russia has declared itself a republic. The Sverdlovsk region voted on Thursday to rename itself the 'Urals Republic' - thus claiming the enhanced rights which a draft constitution being thrashed out by a constitutional assembly would give to republics over mere regions. The move is a sharp warning to Russian President Boris Yeltsin that his efforts to introduce a constitution and federal treaty capable of holding together the vast and diverse Russian land mass face increasing difficulties. Sverdlovsk council controls a relatively rich region the size of France, with a population of only 5m. The main city, Ekaterinburg, formerly Sverdlovsk and the fief of Mr Yeltsin when he was a regional Communist party secretary, is the fourth largest city in Russia and one of the most go-ahead in embracing the market. Mr Anatoly Grebenkin, the regional council chairman, said yesterday: 'We hope this step will give a new impulse to the process (of developing a constitution) and will put pressure on the assembly to finally find a solution.' The move, accompanied by assurances that they were not claiming the primacy of their law over federal legislation, will upset the fragile balance between the 20 republics and the regions. Many of the latter are larger and richer than republics, which are often sparsely populated and dependent on central subsidies. Under the draft constitution, republics have larger powers in the proposed two-chamber parliament and greater rights of self-government. Since much of the politicking now concerns the amount of its own resources each administrative area can keep and how little it can pass on to Moscow, the question of status becomes an urgent one. The next meeting of the constitutional assembly, largely made up of regional and republican leaders, is set for July 12 and is supposed to produce the final draft of the constitution.</p>

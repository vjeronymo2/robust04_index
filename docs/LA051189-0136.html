			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A REAL WARRIOR;  </P> <P> BOL HAS BECOME A TOWER OF POWER IN OAKLAND SKYLINE  </P> <P> Manute Bol, then a Dinka tribesman in the African nation of Sudan, visited a  city for the first time in 1979, traveling to the southern town of Waw. When  gawkers teased him about his height, Bol threw rocks at them.  </P> <P> Two years later, he arrived, all 7 feet 7 inches of him, in the capital city of  Khartoum, carrying a tree limb, just in case anyone there wanted to taunt him.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, some did. He got in fights in market areas, on buses, in movie  theaters, and once even brawled while watching a handball tournament. That  time, he supposedly hit a female bystander over the head with a chair.  </P> <P> The moral of the story? Do not make Manute Bol feel like a freak because of his  size. Or else, be able to run fast.  </P> <P> Now, four years into his National Basketball Assn. career, others have learned  that lesson as well. This man, though he looks like a human exclamation point,  is not some side-show spectacle. He is an important player with the Golden  State Warriors, who will meet the Phoenix Suns in Game 3 of the Western  Conference semifinals tonight at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.  </P> <P> Bol may not be a finished player, but he is an intimidating presence on  defense. His flat-footed, arm-extended reach has been measured at 10-3, and NBA  players have learned that, against him, they had better be able to put lots of  arch on their shots.  </P> <P> "When I left college, a lot of people said, 'You can't play in the NBA a long  time,' " Bol recalled. " 'How will you guard Moses Malone? How will you guard  (Patrick) Ewing?' I thought I did good the first year. I did a lot of things.  </P> <P> "I'm learning a lot. I'm learning about the game, too. A lot of things. Signing  autographs. When to do it, when not to do it. People want me to sign at 5  o'clock, 6 o'clock in the morning. I don't want to sign then. I don't know why  people want me to that early. I don't get it yet."  </P> <P> Bol obviously is the stuff legends are made of -- while he was attending the  University of Bridgeport, fans from a rival school were so taken with him that  they threw a party for him -- and his legend grows almost daily.  </P> <P> Bol, for instance, is the only player in NBA history to have recorded more  blocked shots than points in a season, and he has done it all four years in the  NBA, the first three with the Washington Bullets.  </P> <P> He has led the league in blocked shots twice, including 1988-89, when he easily  outdistanced runner-up Mark Eaton of Utah, 4.31 per game to 3.84.  </P> <P> He set a playoff record in the first round against the Jazz with 18 blocks in a  three-game series.  </P> <P> But those, of course, are defensive accomplishments. What of offense? Surprise!  There is a three-point shooter heating up in the Bol pen.  </P> <P> With a 22% success rate -- Miami's Jon Sundvold led the league at 52.2% and  eight others were higher than 40% -- Bol is not yet a long-range sharpshooter.  </P> <P> Still, Warrior Coach Don Nelson not only allows Bol to shoot the three, he  encourages it.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think it's crazy to let Manute shoot those, but it lets him  make a statement," Nelson said. "It lets him become part of the offense.  </P> <P> "The crowd gets a kick out of it, and the team does, too. It makes everybody  surge a little more. It gives Manute some confidence, allows him to play freer.  It definitely puts a better stride into his steps, too."  </P> <P> Nelson, also the Warriors' general manager, traded for Bol last June, sending  center Dave Feitl and a 1989 second-round draft choice to the Bullets.  </P> <P> "I had been trying to acquire him ever since I made the mistake of not drafting  him at Milwaukee," the former Buck coach said.  </P> <P> Together, they have prospered.  </P> <P> Bol took 674 shots in his three years with the Bullets, including only three  three-pointers. But in his one season with the Warriors, the numbers soared to  344 and 91, respectively. That's about half as many three-pointers as some of  the league's best shooters, and Bol averaged only 22.1 minutes a game.  </P> <P> A jump shot? Not really. For Bol, who has three slightly clawed fingers on his  right hand, an inherited disability common in his family, it's more like a  heave. He puts ball in palm, left hand on top for balance, and then cocks the  shot just past the right ear, looking something like a construction worker  tossing a bag of cement over his shoulder. Then he fires. "Some friends told me  that when we play the Lakers, the announcer for L.A. said, 'Doesn't Nellie know  he shouldn't shoot that? He has no business shooting from out there,' " said  Bol, in his ninth year of playing competitive basketball. "But I don't take too  many shots. (Nelson) said, 'If you think it's a good shot, take it.' "  </P> <P> So Bol does, much to the delight of the fans, here and around the league.  </P> <P> Nelson, meanwhile, has a unique weapon, and, on defense, a high-impact player  to bring off the bench.  </P> <P> "He's the most dominating non-starter in the game," Nelson said. "I'm not  saying he's the best sixth man in the league or whatever, but nobody can alter  what the other team is doing better than Manute when he comes off the bench."  </P> <P> So why not start him?  </P> <P> "I like to have that weapon in my back pocket, to have that fellow on the bench  who can come in and change the course of the game," Nelson said.  </P> <P> Bol apparently recognizes his impact, too, whether it is as a shot blocker or  his personality.  </P> <P> "He's got a captivating personality," said Bruce Webster, his coach at  Bridgeport. "To walk clear across our campus, it takes about 10 minutes. You  couldn't get across campus in 45 minutes if you were with Manute. Everybody  would have something to say to him, and he'd usually stop and talk.  </P> <P> " Hiya, Texas,' he would say to some guy. I asked, 'Why do you call him Texas?'  'He has a girlfriend from Texas.' Oh. They loved him. He had high fives and low  fives all over campus."  </P> <P> The gregarious habits carry over to the court, where he sometimes engages in  glib conversation with opponents. Not bad for someone who at 18 couldn't write  his name, who comes from a culture that uses the smoke of dung fires to keep  malaria mosquitoes away, someone who threw rocks at people who teased him.  </P> <P> "He always leans over and starts kidding about blocking our shots," Clipper  Coach Don Casey said. "He said to me one game, 'How come you're not throwing  the ball into Benoit (Benjamin) more?'  </P> <P> "I said, 'OK, we're coming right at you next time. Right at you.' He said, in  his accent, 'Goooood, then I have NBA-record 15 blocked shots. Bring it right  in, coooch.' "  </P> <P> Inevitably, teams do. Some people just don't learn.  </P></p>

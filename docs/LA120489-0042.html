			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CALARTS PLAYERS OPEN AMERICAN CHAMBER SERIES  </P> <P> Friday evening, the New CalArts Twentieth Century Players launched an odd  little weekend concert series in the odd little off-campus location of the  Santa Monica Museum of Art. The series promised Masterworks of American Chamber  Music, with the first installment subtitled Grass Roots.  </P> <P> What we heard was an amiable gathering of neoclassic motley, with the craggy,  crabby exception of Roger Sessions' Five Pieces for Piano. The  Copland-Piston-Porter-Harris balance could arguably be taken to represent a  sort of musical Populism, but masterworks is a rather strong term for the lot.  </P> <P> The ever formidably focused Bryan Pezzone played Sessions' pungent, pointed  pieces with interpretive vigor and technical assurance. He made the rafters of  the boomy warehouse structure ring, while indicating interrelationships and  illuminating structural detail.  </P> <P> From there the concert took a slack turn through Walter Piston's early,  innocently jazzy Three Pieces for Flute, Clarinet and Bassoon, and Quincy  Porter's rambling, folk-music reminiscent Duo for Viola and Harp. The fluent  performances could not ennoble the facile music.  </P> <P> Roy Harris' Concerto for Piano, Clarinet and String Quartet may just be a  masterwork, albeit a minor and generally ignored one. Soloist Pezzone and  William Powell and a capable quartet projected its Romantic strengths clearly,  except in the fugal finale, where the dense, awkwardly voiced textures thwarted  them. There is power in this four-movement piece, and individuality if not  originality.  </P> <P> Copland's two Threnodies opened the program, in elegant, austere performances  headed by flutist Rachel Rudich.

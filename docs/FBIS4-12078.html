			<p>BFN     [Text] The efforts to solve Yemen's political crisis have  suffered a serious setback. Oman has announced that the talks  that Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id sponsored between Yemeni President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his vice president 'Ali Salim al-Bid  have failed to end their differences. As a result, Oman  threatened to withdraw from the multinational disengagement  committee that is supposed to oversee the disengagement of the  opposing Yemeni military units.    The failure of the talks in Salalah raised immediate fears  in  Sanaa that a Yemeni civil war might erupt.    Both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Sultan Qabus  Bin-Sa'id, who saw him off, looked somber when he departed  Salalah Airport at noon today.    Sources of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, said that when President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih left his meeting with al-Bid today, he  threatened to use force against the leaders of south Yemen, whom  he accused of dragging the country toward partition.    YSP sources denied this accusation and declared that Sanaa's  policy of oppression and its attempt to exercise hegemony over  the south, as the sources put it, is the real threat to the  country's unity.    Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi  Bin- 'Abdallah stated that President Salih and Vice President  al-Bid failed to solve their differences during a second meeting  in Salalah today. He explained that they could not agree on the  wording of a statement calling for calm in the country,  particularly where military matters are concerned. The Omani  minister announced that his country will consult with Jordan  over its wish to end its participation in the joint military  committee charged with the task of disengaging hostile Yemeni  forces unless there is political progress among Yemen's major  political parties.    Following the meeting in Salalah, al-Bid returned to Aden.  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih made a brief visit to Qatar,  during which he met with the amir, Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al  Thani, and senior Qatari officials.    Meanwhile, about 40 Yemeni deputies began a sit-in at the  House of Representatives in Sanaa' to protest the country's  7-month political crisis and the failure of the Oman-sponsored  talks.</p>

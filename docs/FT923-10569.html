			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin America Debt Crisis: 'I didn't count on it taking so long' - Paul Volcker / The Key International Personalities / Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? 'I DIDN'T think it would be cured overnight, but I didn't count on it taking as long as it has to resolve. You squirm because it took 10 years,' says Paul Volcker. As chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 1979 to 1987, he had a central role in dealing with the debt crisis from the outset, writes Stephen Fidler. He believes the agreement in principle recently signed by Brazil and its bank creditors signals an end to the debt crisis. 'Latin American debt is no longer a threat to the financial system, nor are the problems of most Latin American countries caused by their foreign debt. Brazil has lots of problems but they don't stem from its foreign debt.' Did industrialised countries share the blame for the crisis, because they encouraged private banks to 'recycle' Opec oil surpluses during the 1970s? 'I think it's fair to say that the (recycling) was looked upon benignly for a while. But, once momentum of this sort starts, it's very hard to slow it down. One cannot cut it off and it's very hard to modulate it.' However, Mr Volcker - now chairman of James D. Wolfensohn, a New York investment bank - does not believe that the euphoria about Latin America, recently developed in international financial markets, is yet a cause for concern. 'I still have something of a central banker's mentality, which is the mentality of a puritan - they have a haunting feeling that somebody, some place, might be happy. But I don't think there is an imminent danger.'</p>

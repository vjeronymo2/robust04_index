			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China admits defeat in bid for early Gatt entry China yesterday conceded defeat in its bid for early membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation. China said it was prepared to continue negotiations next year. In an angry statement yesterday to the Gatt working party on China's membership terms, Mr Gu Yongjiang, the deputy trade minister, repeated accusations that the negotiations were being blocked by the 'excessive demands' of a few Gatt members, a reference to the US and the European Union in particular. Mr Gu did not maintain previous threats by Beijing to withdraw trade concessions already offered and even to restrict western exports if 'substantive agreement' on entry terms was not reached by the end of the year. He said China's offers to open markets for foreign goods and services and on implementation of fair trade rules would remain on the table. However, they would not be improved. 'The current concessions represent the maximum efforts China can make at its economic development levels as a developing country,' Mr Gu argued. China would not 'initiate' further membership negotiations but it would take part in the next working party meeting scheduled for February. 'China has no intention to close the door of negotiation,' Mr Gu said. Beijing has attached great importance to joining the WTO, which begins work on January 1, as a founder member. An original member of Gatt in 1948, China left the organisation in 1950 after the communists came to power. Both the US and the EU have offered to grant China founder-member status provided the negotiations are concluded speedily next year. Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the Swiss chairman of the Gatt working party, said yesterday with an eye to Chinese sensitivities that all the members wanted to reach a 'balanced substantive agreement' as soon as possible and that 'very substantive progress' had been made in the past few days. However, trade diplomats said after the working party meeting that many difficult issues had still to be resolved and that China's market-opening offers remained unsatisfactory. Though Beijing continues to castigate Washington as the principal obstacle to speedy Gatt entry, it is clear that US concerns about Chinese membership terms are widely shared by developing as well as industrialised countries. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, is to be asked to stay on as head of the WTO until March 15, to allow more time for his successor to be chosen. Trade diplomats said a formal decision by Gatt members to that effect would be taken today. The EU, whose candidate, Mr Renato Ruggiero, has a commanding lead in the three-way contest, had wanted a shorter extension for Mr Sutherland, who earlier this year announced his intention to leave at the end of December. But the US, which is backing Mr Carlos Salinas, the former Mexican president, wanted longer to allow Mr Salinas time to campaign after leaving office this month.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Demand for loans remains strong DEMAND FOR consumer loans fell slightly in July, but remained at just below its strongest level for two years. Central Statistical Office credit figures show that consumers borrowed a net Pounds 204m in July compared with Pounds 213m in June. The strength of consumer borrowing supports evidence of rising consumer confidence even though the figures do not include mortgages and account for only about 15 per cent of consumer debt. Consumer lending started to revive 10 months ago, suggesting that people have become more confident about the economic upturn and their personal financial circumstances. The latest figures show that increases in loans by building societies and finance houses were offset by a fall in net lending on bank credit cards. Consumers borrowed only Pounds 9m more than they paid back on credit cards in July. This was down from net borrowings of Pounds 64m in June. Credit-card borrowing has been hesitant since the start of the year indicating lingering reluctance among consumers to run up big debts. Net lending by finance houses - mainly hire purchase and loans by retailers  -was Pounds 189m in July compared with Pounds 150m in the previous month. Building societies lent a net Pounds 6m compared with a net repayment of Pounds 1m in the previous month. The amount of new credit advanced to consumers also fell slightly in July to Pounds 4.46bn. This was down from Pounds 4.69bn in June. The CSO said the fall mainly reflected lower advances on credit cards. But the underlying trend in overall lending remains upwards. In the three months to July net lending rose to Pounds 535m from Pounds 444m in the previous quarter. A separate survey published yesterday by Infolink, the credit information organisation, reported that consumer confidence was strengthening, with upturns in July for loans to buy new cars, houses and shop goods. Meanwhile, the Finance and Leasing Association said consumer confidence was continuing to rise, with year-on-year gains in all sectors of consumer credit except those associated with the housing market. It said, however, that for the first time since the rush to beat the re-imposition of stamp duty in autumn last year mortgage finance had increased for two consecutive months.</p>

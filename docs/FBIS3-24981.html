			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Idriss Deby has just ended a 48-hour tour  of Abeche and Ouaddai following the unfortunate events of last  August and the recent incidents in Abeche last January. He went  to the region to appease the local people and to extend the  government's sympathy to the bereaved families. He also  pardoned some people who had been detained for their role in the  23 January attack on Abeche. Furthermore, members of the Chadian  National Front will be dispatched to Moussoro where they will be  trained and integrated in the Chadian National Army. Deby urged  sultans and other village chiefs to leave no stone unturned to  bring back those who deserted their families. Let us listen to  the head of state:    [Begin Deby recording] We must find a solution that will  restore tranquility and calm in Ouaddai and ensure that the  people live in concord. This cannot be achieved without the  assistance of canton chiefs. We cannot solve your many problems  unless we all do away once and for all with a number of evils  that have undermined the region. I therefore urge you --  administrative authorities, sultans, and canton heads who wield  considerable moral influence -- to help me as head of state and  son of the region to safeguard peace and unity in this part of  Chad and to restore the former luster of Ouaddai. I must stress  that any conflicts in the region prompted by material  considerations should stop. Let the traditional rulers assume  their responsibilities and fully play their role as assistants  to administrative authorities. The sultan must fully assume his  historic responsibility and run Ouaddai Region in line with the  tradition. [applause]    Through you, paramount chiefs and canton heads, I extend a  hand to our brothers who fled the region on 23 January. I urge  them to see reason. We are prepared to receive them; we are  prepared to hold talks with them; the government is prepared to  hold sincere talks with them in the supreme interest of both our  region and our country.

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Economic zone status for Lhasa CHINA is planning to set up a special economic zone in Lhasa, the troubled capital of Tibet, Reuter reports from Beijing. The zone will imitate those operating in China's flourishing coastal regions, the official China Daily said yesterday. It quoted Tibet's vice governor Gyamtso as saying lack of open-mindedness had impeded the region's development in the past. Tibet has been rocked by sporadic riots since Buddhist monks demonstrated against Chinese rule in late 1987, prompting police to open fire on protesters. The region's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, says more than 1m Tibetans have been killed since China took control of his country, now called the Tibet Autonomous Region, in 1950. He said on Monday that youngsters in the region were becoming impatient with his message of non-violence. China Daily said Tibet's local government is drawing up preferential investment policies for the Lhasa special economic zone, including tax breaks and low land-use fees. The isolated region plans to open several new border trading ports, it said without giving details. Currently Tibet's sole air link is with Chengdu, in neighbouring Sichuan province. 'The action is part of Tibet's efforts to open its door wider to the outside world and step up economic development, in the wake of (senior leader) Deng Xiaoping's urge for bolder reform,' Gyamtso told the newspaper. He said the region was considering a second economic zone in Jiangzi county, 200km (125 miles) from the Indian border.</p>

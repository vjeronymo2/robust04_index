			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHRYSLER, RENAULT ABANDON JOINT VENTURE FOR SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLE  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. and the French auto maker Renault announced today that they have  abandoned their joint venture in developing and building a new sport-utility  vehicle.  </P> <P> The ARCAD joint venture, formed in February, 1989, "is no longer economically  attractive," the auto makers said in a written statement.  </P> <P> Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> ARCAD was to begin producing a vehicle code-named "JJ" in the second half of  1992 at a Valladolid, Spain, plant leased from Renault's Spanish subsidiary.  The four-wheel-drive vehicles were to be marketed worldwide except in North  America, where ARCAD planned to build them at an existing Chrysler facility.  </P> <P> Chrysler intends to develop the JJ project on its own, but a North American  plant still has not been selected, Houston said.  </P> <P> Renault will continue distributing Chrysler's Jeep vehicles in Europe, the  statement said.  </P></p>

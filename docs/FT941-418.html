			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Out of town, out of favour: UK guidelines on shopping centres are causing confusion It has 19 car parks with space for 10,000 cars, shops covering the area of 20 football pitches, and an annual turnover of Pounds 300m. A high-tech monorail whisks people between the glass-vaulted shopping centre and the retail 'sheds' surrounding it. Merry Hill in the West Midlands is typical of the large out-of-town shopping centres that sprang up in the 1980s. It has devastated the retail trade of nearby Dudley. A government-sponsored survey last year found Dudley town centre had lost 70 per cent of its trade since Merry Hill was completed in 1989, and 11 other town centres had suffered at least limited impact. Merry Hill is not an isolated example of such a development in the UK. Five shopping centres of a similar size, together with 28m sq ft of superstores and retail sheds, have been built since 1980, in a swing to edge-of-town and out-of-town retailing that has changed the UK landscape. In that time, out-of-town retailing's share of retail sales has risen from 5 per cent to 25 per cent. This trend has shown little sign of abating. For the first time, out-of-town shopping centre space proposed by developers - at 7m sq ft  - now exceeds that proposed for town centres, according to chartered surveyors Hillier Parker. But much of that may not be built. In two sets of planning guidelines for local authorities and a series of speeches, environment secretary Mr John Gummer has signalled tougher restrictions on 'sheds on the by-passes'. He says he wants to revive and rebuild the UK's decaying town centres. That could have important implications for retailers, many of which have strategies concentrating on out-of-town expansion, and the construction industry, for which continuing retail development has been one of the few lifelines during the recession. Mr Gummer's philosophy is simple: 'I want to see us improve the quality of our towns so that we can reduce pressures of urban sprawl and the development of green-field sites,' he told the Town and Country Planning Association in January. Out-of-town development 'echoes the drive-in philosophy we see across the Atlantic, where people mourn the loss of Main Street'. Yet there remains widespread confusion among retailers, developers and local authorities about the Department of the Environment's real aims. The British Property Federation, a body representing landlords, says Mr Gummer's recent statements run counter to the government's attempts to introduce greater certainty into the planning process. The reason for this confusion is the difference in tone between the government's guidance notes, which are designed to direct local authorities in making planning decisions, and Mr Gummer's speeches. Retail planning guidelines - PPG6 - published last July were relatively mild. They called for 'a suitable balance in providing for retail development between town centre and out-of-centre retail facilities'. Developments should be vetoed only if there was 'clear evidence to suggest that the result would be to undermine the vitality and viability of (the) town centre'. The second set of guidelines, PPG13, published this month dealt mainly with transport policy, and the need to reduce car journeys and encourage alternative means of travel. Only two of the 132 paragraphs specifically covered retailing, and they suggested the July note gave definitive guidance. Nevertheless, Mr Gummer has repeatedly emphasised his determination to bring lasting changes to the UK's retailing and urban landscape, often going beyond PPG6. He has promised a series of initiatives on improving town centres, and told the Town and Country Planning Association that he had asked the DoE to alert him personally to any developments threatening urban centres. If the July guidance was not effective, he suggested, 'I will have to consider whether a revision to that guidance is necessary'. As if to demonstrate his resolve, Mr Gummer recently vetoed two out-of-town projects - a shopping centre at Duxford, and an edge-of-town supermarket at Ludlow, Shropshire - although several other developments have been approved without problems. How strong his commitment is to curtailing out-of-town development may become clearer through the outcome of forthcoming planning appeals. But retailers and developers believe they can deploy strong arguments to persuade him to soften his position. They may get their chance through the Commons environment select committee, which begins an inquiry next month into shopping centres and retail development. One argument likely to be presented is that the swing to out-of-town shopping has not been a whim of shops and property companies, but a response to customer demand - which will not evaporate. 'A policy that does not recognise commercial realities is not sustainable,' says Mr John Bullough of Grosvenor Estates, which spent five years on proposals for the Duxford scheme rejected by Mr Gummer. Ending out-of-town development will not in itself stop the deterioration of town centres, say Mr Gummer's critics. 'We cannot turn the clock back,' says Mr Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'If retail parks on the edge of particular towns are denied permission, then the customer will simply drive to an adjoining town and take away business from the first under-supplied town.' Retailers such as Boots and Marks and Spencer, moreover, argue that, in addition to developing out-of-town sites, they have helped fund town centre management schemes, in which the local authority appoints a manager to promote the centre. In Oxford and Liverpool, for instance, Marks and Spencer have seconded store managers to such posts, and is spending Pounds  1/2 m a year on town-centre projects. Revitalising town centres needs investment, but often it has taken the development of a competing out-of-town retail centre to spur authorities into taking action, says Mr Geoffrey Smith, managing director of planning consultants Nathaniel Lichfield &amp; Partners. Retailers may also argue that out-of-town retailing can be more environmentally friendly than town-centre shopping. One trip a week - or less - to an edge-of-town superstore may involve a customer driving fewer miles than several trips to a local supermarket would. Taking account of the force of these arguments, and after scrutinising the government's guidelines, the consensus among planning experts is that the impact of Mr Gummer's initiative may be less than some observers have predicted. They say the Department of Environment is likely to end further development of large retail shopping centres such as Merry Hill, or Lakeside in Essex, as they can be shown to have a damaging effect on nearby town centres. But Bluewater Park, a proposed Pounds 300m scheme at Dartford, and Trafford Park, a Pounds 200m development near Manchester, may squeeze through. Bluewater is seeking a funding partner; Trafford Park's fight for planning permission goes to the Court of Appeal on May 16. Observers also suggest that getting permission may become more difficult for smaller shopping centres and groups of stores in retail parks: extending existing out-of-town developments is likely to be easier than building new ones. Superstores and warehouses selling groceries and bulky goods, however, are less likely to be affected, as good reasons can be given for siting these next to car parks, out of town. Another consequence could be that retailers and developers are pushed towards reclaiming derelict land, where the potential benefits would make it difficult for local authorities to refuse planning permission. But even if the pace of out-of-town retail development slows for a few years, planning experts believe the rise of the retail shed and the green-field mall is not over for ever. 'My view is that planning policy revolves rather than evolves,' Mr Smith, of Nathaniel Lichfield, told a Retail Week conference last week. 'The pendulum is clearly swinging towards town centres, but it will swing back towards out-of-town in five years.'</p>

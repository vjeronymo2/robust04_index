			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (8): Victims of the deepening recession  -Stockholders THERE ARE a lot of low prices out there and it's pretty tough. That is the view of Mr Colin Dawe, chairman of the UK Aluminium Stockholders Association, who is predicting another year of tough economic climate and low metal prices, writes David Blackwell. Twelve months ago the ASA - along with every other industry - was hoping that the recession was coming to an end. 'The stockists were the first in and they should be the first to feel an upturn,' says Mr Dawe. But while a couple of months early this year did appear to indicate better times ahead, May and August were the worst months on record for aluminium sales. 'Since the (UK general) election in April things have got even more desperate and competitive,' says Mr Dawe. 'Clearly we are not getting out of recession. The building, construction and transportation industries remain deeply depressed, and there is no real sign of recovery.' He especially cites the aircraft industry, which used to be the ASA's glamour sector. After five or six years of heady growth, the industry's aluminium consumption is down 35 per cent on last year as defence demand has fallen and airline orders have been delayed. Last year the ASA was worried that it was stuck with sales at the 1984 volumes but costs at 1991 levels. This year sales by volume are expected to fall to a total of 94,000 tonnes of rolled and extruded aluminium, compared with 103,000 tonnes worth about Pounds 235m in 1991. In the boom year of 1988, the association's members sold 120,000 tonnes of aluminium worth Pounds 266m. Consumption in the rolled sector, which sells to a wide range of engineering companies, is expected to be down this year to 70,000 tonnes from 73,000 tonnes in 1991. Demand in the extrusion sector, which makes sections for the building and transport industries, is predicted to fall to 24,000 tonnes this year from 1991's 30,000 tonnes. ASA members have been forced both to rationalise their industry and to continue moving towards added value products. 'Some 10 per cent of the warehouses we had in 1988-89 have been closed through rationalisation in a bid to cut costs and improve efficiency and assist in the task of driving down working capital,' says Mr Dawe. Inevitably jobs have also been shed, and Mr Dawe estimates the number of people now employed in the industry at just 2,000, down from 2,600 in 1990. Even so, it has remained hard to make acceptable profits. Distribution costs have risen as the number of deliveries made has remained static but the quantities and values are much smaller than they used to be. 'Our major task is to generate sufficient cash to keep our businesses solvent,' says Mr Dawe. The association, which now numbers 25 companies, is trying to build closer links with its suppliers, and has recruited 11 of them as associate members. It is also trying to force the pace of standardising to the metric system. Although metrication has been under way in the UK for years, a great deal of industry is still entrenched in the imperial system, according to Mr Dawe. The ASA and its associate members are forming a study group to decide on common metric standards. It believes that suppliers will find significant advantages in settling for common standards and specifications across Europe. But the benefits should spread all down the line to the customer, Mr Dawe believes. Stocks will be reduced, administration made simpler, and overheads cut, and UK industry will be offered a product range equal to their European competition. The stockholders see themselves as metal bashers, a role they began to take on in the boom years of 1987 and 1988. Investment in processing aluminium has continued, says Mr Dawe, and 65 per cent of the aluminium which goes through the stockholders is now processed before it is goes to their customers. 'We are taking away from our customers what they often regard as simple processes. We are often preparing component parts which will go straight to their more complex machinery.' Just-in-time delivery has also become more important and stockholders have sharply reduced their own stocks, which were worth Pounds 70m in the late 1980s, but are now down to Pounds 45m, equivalent to 10 weeks' sales. Mr Dawe feels there is room for further improvement. 'I still regard this as too high. We have to work more closely with supply mills to reduce lead times. We have set ourselves a target of having only two months' inventory.' By the time the recession ends, aluminium stockholders will be leaner, fitter and ready to respond quickly. Mr Dawe says: 'We have all learned a hard lesson from the excesses of 1988-89. We will never again have high stocks in a falling market.'</p>

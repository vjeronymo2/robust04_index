			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MCKENNA DRAWS FIRE, BUT MOST OF HIS SCHOOL STAFF CHANGES GET OK  </P> <P> The Inglewood school board Wednesday night approved all but three of the  staffing changes proposed by Supt. George McKenna for the fall, although some  of the appointments generated intense criticism from parents and community  leaders.  </P> <P> Residents strongly criticized some of McKenna's appointments of principals and  assistant principals, arguing that the new superintendent shuffled some  incompetent administrators from one school to another and took no significant  steps to improve school leadership.  </P> <P> But McKenna, previously principal of Washington Preparatory High School in Los  Angeles, stood firm on his recommendations, and a majority of the five-member  school board concurred. Only three personnel decisions were struck down out of  several dozen that came before the board.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Killing Morale'  </P> <P> "If I cannot make the district function, you can with three votes find yourself  another superintendent," McKenna said. "I am confident that the candidates  before us are the best possible, available, qualified candidates, and I will  stand on those."  </P> <P> Board member Zyra McCloud, who joined parents in opposing many of McKenna's  choices, told the new superintendent during one heated exchange: "I'm sick of  this rhetoric. This is wrong, McKenna. . . . You're killing the morale of this  district."  </P> <P> But board Vice President Joseph Rouzan urged his colleagues to adopt the  recommendations so that the school year could begin smoothly.  </P> <P> Among the controversial recommendations were the transfers of Principal Gladys  Phillips-Evans from Monroe Junior High School to Warren Lane Elementary School,  Principal Lacy Alexander from Woodworth Elementary School to Monroe and  Principal Ruby Nelson from Oak Street Elementary School to Woodworth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transfers Approved  </P> <P> Critics said the administrators, none of whom could be reached for comment, had  not proved themselves in their current posts. But the school board approved all  three transfers.  </P> <P> Joice Lewis, who works in special education for Los Angeles County, was  rejected as the district's director of pupil personnel services because board  members said there were qualified people from within the district who should  have received the job. Later in the meeting, McKenna called Lewis "eminently  qualified" for the cabinet-level post and asked the board to reconsider, but  his request was turned down.  </P> <P> The board also overturned McKenna's recommendation to transfer two bilingual  teachers, Salud Salinda and Maria Vega, out of Oak Street Elementary after a  parent presented a petition protesting the move and two students spoke out  against it.  </P> <P> The transfer was part of a dispute between several teachers and Nelson, the Oak  Street principal, that began before McKenna arrived. Four teachers went on  stress leave last year, charging that Nelson was a poor administrator who made  their jobs unbearable. One group of parents sided with the teachers; another  group sided with Nelson.  </P> <P> School officials say McKenna decided to transfer Nelson to the principal's post  at Woodworth and the two teachers to new assignments in other schools in order  to defuse the situation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Additional Moves  </P> <P> Other appointments approved Wednesday include: Art Murray, a high school  principal in Bakersfield, to Morningside High School; Edward Brownlee, dean of  students at Inglewood High School, to assistant principal of Morningside; Joe  Steele, a teacher, to acting assistant principal of Morningside; Anthony Vega,  a teacher, to dean of students at Inglewood; Marlene Felix, a teacher, to  assistant principal of Monroe; Havon McLeod, assistant principal at La Tijera  Elementary School, to Warren Lane; Gilman Gebo, acting assistant principal at  Morningside, to assistant principal at La Tijera; and Jeraldine Martin,  principal of Morningside, to assistant principal of adult education.  </P> <P> When McKenna took office last October, many school employees and community  leaders said the real test of his strength would be his ability to evaluate the  staff, some of whom have political connections to past board members or city  leaders, and put together a team that can turn around the low morale and low  test scores that have become synonymous with education in Inglewood.  </P> <P> Terry Coleman, the Inglewood PTA Council's liaison to the school board, accused  McKenna of "playing musical chairs" at the expense of 15,000 children.  </P> <P> "The honeymoon is over. . . . As much as I respect McKenna, he's making a grave  mistake," Coleman said in an interview. "It's a gray day for the children of  Inglewood."  </P> <P> Norma Smith, president of the PTA Council, said McKenna's staffing choices  disappointed her, but she is willing to give him more time before she passes  final judgment.  </P> <P> "He's still doing some casting," Smith said. "This is a big play, and he's  still deciding who's going to play the parts. I don't believe in jumping on a  person before they have a chance to try."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nationwide Praise  </P> <P> McKenna, whose efforts in inner-city education won him nationwide praise and a  television movie on his leadership style, has faced such staffing controversies  before. More than 100 teachers left Washington Prep while he was at the helm.  </P> <P> "I have no intention of failing," McKenna said at Wednesday's meeting. "I have  no intention of abdicating. I will continue to go forward."  </P> <P> He added: "I do not speak to you as a novice as to what it takes to be a  principal."  </P> <P> Under state law, a school district must notify administrators by Dec. 1 before  beginning proceedings to demote or fire them in order to give them time to  improve their performances. McKenna, who began as superintendent last Oct. 1,  said he did not have adequate time to monitor school administrators before the  deadline passed. He pledged to put all of Inglewood's administrators on notice  this year that their performance is being watched.  </P> <P> "George McKenna won tonight," one school employee who did not want to be  identified said after the meeting. "He got his picks in. But watch those  appointments. If they fail, he fails."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community Meetings  </P> <P> McKenna also came under criticism for a series of community meetings he held  this summer at several Inglewood schools in which he asked parents what  qualities they wanted in a new school administrator. Critics are now calling  those meetings an effort to pacify the community in anticipation of the current  appointments.  </P> <P> "I was one of the main supporters who brought McKenna in," McCloud said before  the meeting. "If I made a mistake, I'm the first one to admit it to the  parents. How can you call community forums, interview people and then transfer  ineffective people around?"  </P> <P> Board President Larry Aubry said the district will suffer unless board members  work together with the superintendent and staff.  </P> <P> "We are trying like hell to make this an exemplary district, but it takes one  step at a time," Aubry said. "We have to put a small amount of faith in each  other."  </P></p>

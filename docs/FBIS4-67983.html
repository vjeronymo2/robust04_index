			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>   [Text] The agreement between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] in Gaza contains a secret clause in which  Hamas pledges not to attack the Qatif Bloc settlements, our  correspondent has learned from Fatah sources in the territories.  According to the sources, this reflects the most recent Hamas  line -- namely, that the organization will not obstruct  Palestinian rule in Gaza and Jericho. The sources claim that  this clause has created tension between the Islamic Jihad and  Hamas, as well as between two Hamas branches: the pro-peace  Ahmad Yasin branch and the branch comprising the 10 rejectionist  organizations that oppose the agreement.    [A related report by Dan Avidan on page 2 of Tel Aviv DAVAR  in Hebrew on 26 April cites "Arab sources" as saying that "PLO  and Hamas delegations are conducting secret negotiations in  Cairo in an attempt to conceptualize the ties between the two  movements on the eve of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho" and that "the PLO-Hamas  encounter was arranged through the mediation of Hamad  Abu-al-Nasr and Sayf al-Din al-Banna, leaders of the Muslim  Brotherhood movement in Egypt."]</p>

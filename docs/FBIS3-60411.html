			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, December 13 (CNS) -- There are now an  estimated 250,000 drug addicts in China with the trend spreading  from Yunnan Province to other areas in Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu,  Shaanxi and Guangxi, affecting some 700 counties in 17  provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in all, the  Minister of Public Health, Mr Chen Minzhang, said.    Speaking at a inaugural meeting on the prevention of drug  abuse, Mr Chen said that most drug addicts were teenagers with  the drugs used ranging from opium to refined heroin. Crimes  resulting from drug addiction are now on the rise and include  burglary and robbery, murder, fraud and the kidnapping of women  and children for sale.    About 60 percent of AIDS cases in China were due to  intravenous heroin injection.    As publicity on the dangers of drugs is still inadequate,  drug abuse is now quite serious in the country.    Mr Chen said he believed that with economic prosperity, the  pharmaceutical industry had mushroomed with the appearance of  serious drug abuse and the administration of drugs had become an  arduous task.    The ministry had adopted a number of measures to strengthen  drug administration and guide the production and marketing of  drugs. As drug abuse is a complicated social problem, it  requires a massive input from various sectors to deal with it.  An association whose aim is to prevent drug abuse was formally  set up today with the approval of the Ministry of Public Health  and the Ministry of Civil Affairs with the Vice Chairman of the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Mr Fei  Xiaotong, as its honorary president and Mr Chen as its president.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Market Report: Metals fall back after early surge Copper and aluminium looked set to sail through technical resistance levels and on to their next price targets in early trading on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, but they failed to follow through this early show of strength. Copper broke above resistance near Dollars 2,520 a tonne and then burst up to Dollars 2,533 - a move which traders thought would carry it up to this year's high of Dollars 2,557. But caution set in and the last kerb (after hours) business was at Dollars 2,512, the day's low and Dollars 4 down from Monday. Aluminium, despite an 11,800-tonne fall in LME stocks, failed to test Dollars 1,600 a tonne. Business was seen down to Dollars 1,583 before last trading at Dollars 1,586, down Dollars 6.

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Marston improves 16% in spite of flat second half Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based regional brewer, lifted pre-tax profits by 16 per cent to Pounds 23.3m in the year to March 26. However, second half profits were flat as a result of sharply increased marketing costs on its Pedigree brand. Volume sales of beer rose by 4.9 per cent in the year, compared with a claimed fall of 2 per cent across the industry. Sales of Pedigree bitter rose by 7 per cent, while the Low 'C brand of low-calorie bottled beer was ahead by 12 per cent. Food sales in the group's pubs were up by 28 per cent. Mr David Gordon, managing director, said the rise in underlying trading profit had been fairly level throughout the year. However, Pedigree and Low 'C had been heavily advertised outside Marston's native Central TV region in the second half, with the annual advertising bill up 87 per cent at Pounds 2.9m, of which Pounds 2m was spent on Pedigree. The rise in group beer volume was attributable to sales to other brewers and the free trade, Mr Gordon said. Beer sales to Marston's own pubs were slightly down, with a rise in managed pubs more than offset by a fall in the tenanted estate. Capital expenditure for the year was Pounds 36m, compared with Pounds 19m. Balance sheet gearing rose from 7.2 per cent to 8.8 per cent. A total of 53 new pubs were bought, 46 of them managed, while 22 pubs were sold. Marston said that in its tenanted estate, there was 'an increasing divide between houses which clearly have a profitable future and those which may not.' Volume sales of beer to tenanted houses fell by 7 per cent in the year. On group sales of Pounds 142.8m, against Pounds 127.7m, operating profits were up 10.5 per cent at Pounds 24.9m. Interest payments doubled to Pounds 1.1m. After tax of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 5.4m), earnings per share were up 16 per cent at 19.21p (16.55p). The dividend is raised 10.4 per cent to 5.96p, via a final of 4.36p. Marston's shares were unchanged at 270p. Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said that while market conditions were likely to remain difficult, further growth was expected this year. COMMENT Assuming a similar rise in profits this year to about Pounds 26m, the shares are on about 13 times earnings. Despite the unfashionable status of the brewers, this could be a bargain. Marston has an asset which bigger rivals would pay dearly for: its Pedigree bitter brand, which has long since broken its regional boundaries. It has also stitched up a series of deals with the big brewers which gives the brand national distribution. It is encouraging to note that Whitbread's disposal of a large block of shares in March has been easily digested, with the shares slightly outperforming the market since then.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: SCHLESINGER: AN ENGLISHMAN ABROAD;  </P> <P> FILM: HIS LATEST PECULIARLY AMERICAN DRAMA IS 'PACIFIC HEIGHTS,' A 'YUPPIE  NIGHTMARE.'  </P> <P> John Schlesinger came out of documentary making and acting to direct a string  of films, commencing with "A Kind of Loving," "Billy Liar" and "Darling," that  rank high in the estimations of film history and stand as important witness to  20th-Century life in England. His "Midnight Cowboy," from a terrific script by  Waldo Salt, became the first, and thus far the only, X-rated film to win an  Academy Award. In it, Schlesinger cast an unblinking eye on the downside of  urban American life.  </P> <P> In "Pacific Heights" (opening Friday), Schlesinger again casts an eye, still  unblinking but rather more amused, on urban American life. It's a thriller,  Schlesinger said the other afternoon, "a yuppie nightmare."  </P> <P> Michael Keaton, Batman on a radically different flight, is an unpaying and  sociopathic tenant out to destroy Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith's  American dream, embodied in a San Francisco Victorian.  </P> <P> "It was a bold move for Michael to do it," Schlesinger says, "but when I saw  him in 'Clean and Sober,' I realized what a really good actor he is. The trick  here was to avoid going over the top. We tried going way over the top and way  below the top, and I hope we found a middle road that works. His experience as  a comedian has stood him well."  </P> <P> The premise of the film was inspired by the actual experiences (slightly less  melodramatic) scriptwriter Dan Pine and his wife had when they bought a house  in San Francisco a few years ago.  </P> <P> "The nightmare," Schlesinger says, "will be familiar to anyone who aspires to  have a house -- especially one they can't really afford to keep. My house in  London stretched me beyond measure.  </P> <P> "I was offered a documentary series. I was to be paid 50 pounds a week, not  much even back then. But I didn't want to be tied up with a series. My father,  who was a doctor and a very kind man, thought I was out of my mind. 'Look at  all the wonderful people you'll meet,' he said, and I realized he was right. I  also needed the money, such as it was. The series was 'The Valiant Years,' and  I met Montgomery and all the others, although not Winston Churchill, who was  too ill to participate. But I always thought of the fittings in my house as the  Churchill curtains and cupboards."  </P> <P> Good scripts are never in long supply, and Schlesinger has in recent years  turned some of his attention to directing opera. He directed a well-remarked  production of "Tales of Hoffmann" in 1980. At the urging of conductor Herbert  von Karajan, Schlesinger mounted a production of "Un Ballo in Maschera" at  Salzburg. The conductor died only a week before the initial performance.  Schlesinger has now been asked to return to Salzburg to revive the production  and direct it for television.  </P> <P> With opera schedules requiring as much lead time as they do, Schlesinger  already knows that in 1994 he will do his first production at the Metropolitan  Opera, a 25th-anniversary performance by Placido Domingo in Verdi's "Otello,"  with James Levine conducting.  </P> <P> Schlesinger had made films in 9.5mm as a child, graduating to 16 when he  returned to Oxford after army service. One of his films earned a rave review  from critic Dilys Powell. But after Oxford he could find no regular work as a  filmmaker, and so spent eight years as an actor. That period included a tour of  New Zealand with the British Commonwealth Theatre Company, which had been  assembled by the well-known mystery writer Ngaio Marsh. The tour, intended to  circle the Commonwealth, died in New Zealand.  </P> <P> Eventually Schlesinger got back into documentaries, and one, about a Gypsy  Italian opera company performing in east London, caught the eye of producer  Joseph Yanni. It was for Yanni that Schlesinger did the remarkable string of  features from "A Kind of Loving" through "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Yanks."  </P> <P> He remembers nostalgically and regretfully that "A Kind of Loving" had an  11-week shooting schedule but only cost 180,000 pounds and earned back the cost  in Britain alone. Such good, small, cheap films that still get made in England,  "My Beautiful Laundrette," for example, tend to get fine reviews and small  audiences.  </P> <P> Schlesinger's hourlong television film, "An Englishman Abroad," about the  English traitor Guy Burgess in exile in Moscow, became part of an evening of  two one-act plays by Alan Bennett and Simon Callow. The other, about Sir  Anthony Blunt, the curator of the Queen's Pictures, who proved to be himself a  traitor, has now been scripted as a film, which Schlesinger may direct, and  would love to.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at the urging of his friends Vincent Price and Coral Brown, he will  take a restorative cruise up the New England coast, having seen to the final  prints and launching of his yuppie nightmare.  </P></p>

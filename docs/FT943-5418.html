			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Sport: The golden oldies - Golf It was called the sporting success story of the 1980s, but that was nothing compared to what senior golf has achieved in the 1990s. In 1994, the US Senior tour has expanded to the point where there are no longer enough weeks in the year to cope with all the companies queuing up to endorse tournaments. Consequently, while every other tour in the world worries about keeping hold of what it has, the seniors worry about how long they can keep sponsors on their waiting list. When it began life on December 16 1980, there were two tournaments offering total prize money of Pounds 140,000. Today, there are 44 events worth Pounds 25m. 'I always thought the senior tour would do well but it has gone way beyond my comprehension now,' said Gary Player. This is the world that Tony Jacklin has joined and already he has touched gold, winning a tournament within five weeks of reaching 50, the age of eligibility. On the regular tour, the players are always complaining about bad backs and bad wrists or some such ailment. On the senior tour, they are walking models of fitness, too busy making money to worry about a bad back, too tied up hitting balls on the practice ground in case the magic suddenly disappears. The senior tour has predictably made millions for people who were not exactly short of cash anyway, golfers such as Lee Trevino, Raymond Floyd and Jack Nicklaus. But there are some lovely stories too. Bob Murphy gave up playing on the regular tour in 1987 owing to arthritis. Murphy's hands were so swollen with the disease that it became too painful to grip a club. Now Murphy is back playing. His motivation was the senior tour. So far he has won Pounds 1m and counting. Then there's Jay Sigel, a name that will be familiar to those who follow amateur golf. Indeed Sigel was America's greatest amateur since Bobby Jones, but having done all he could in that branch of the sport, he finally decided, at the age of 50, to turn professional. Sigel has not yet been a pro for 12 months but he has already won Pounds 300,000. Jim Albus may be the most remarkable story of all. He played for a couple of years on the regular tour in the 1960s and made precisely Pounds 2,000. He packed up and became a club professional. There he stayed for 25 years before those old yearnings for tour life and travel started getting to him once more and in 1991 he packed his belongings and headed for the senior tour's qualifying school. He got his card, and enjoyed his new life so much in 1992 that he played in every event. He has been rather more successful this time, too. He has made more than Pounds 1.5m to date. Given the length of Albus's lay-off, perhaps it was not that extraordinary that Jacklin could rid himself so quickly of 10 years of rust. But do all these stories indicate a lack of quality in the golf played? Far from it. I attended the recent Ford Senior Player's Championship in Detroit, where the course on which the tournament was played measured just under 6,900 yards. Admittedly, it was nowhere near as stringent as that upon which the US Open at Oakmont was played, however. 'The fairways at Oakmont were faster than these greens,' said Jack Nicklaus. Even so, it was set up in such a way that I, an eight handicapper, would have been delighted to have gone round in anything under 83 (at Oakmont, I would have been thrilled to have broken 100). On the first day, a third of the field broke 70. Jacklin's preparation for senior life perhaps provides an answer as to why the standard is so high. Six months before joining the tour, he gave up his handsome mansion in the Scottish Highlands to go and live in Florida - where he could practise every day, and play in some satellite tour events. It was just as well he prepared so thoroughly because the senior tour fields are restricted to 78 players each week. When the exempt players are taken into account and the four invitation spots (which is how Jacklin has been getting in) there are usually only about four places left and these scraps are fed to the 100 or so hungry scavengers who take part in open qualifying every Monday. None of this explains why the senior tour is so successful. There are a number of reasons. The first is that the tour offers not one, but two pro-ams every week, so that the sponsors can invite twice as many clients to play with a top name. Secondly, just look at some of the names who are over 50 and still playing: Player, Nicklaus, Trevino, Floyd, Arnold Palmer, Chi Chi Rodriguez. How could any tour fail to attract sponsors and spectators when offering such riches? Outside the professional ranks, golf is a game largely played by the over 50s, and the decision makers in the boardrooms are invariably a similar age to the players on the senior tour. They have grown up with sporting icons such as Palmer and Nicklaus. But there is something else as well. These players know how to work a crowd. Here is an example: on the opening day in Detroit, golf's original big three, Player, Palmer and Nicklaus, had been drawn together for the first time on the senior tour. The par four 11th hole offered the chance to play safe down the left and have a longish approach shot, or drive riskily over a ravine to the right but have a short iron to the green. Player took out his driver. Palmer, summing up a career, went with the driver too, but Nicklaus, again true to form, played safe. Uncharacteristically, he pulled his long-iron tee-shot into the rough. There was silence. Nicklaus shook his head. 'That was a darn bad shot,' he said. It was too much for Player. He said: 'You're right, of course, Jack, but it was a crap decision to go with the iron in the first place and it deservedly resulted in a crap shot.' Everyone started laughing. Nicklaus did too. It was something one could relate to. They may have been three superstars but they were also three golfers who were enjoying a laugh and a joke. The senior tour is the only tour where you will find that camaraderie that is so much the heart and soul of what golf is about for most people.</p>

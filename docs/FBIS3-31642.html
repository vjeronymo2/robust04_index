Baudys' solution suggested "the transfer of power to the  occupational powers," and "the establishment of a protectorate."  It is unbelievable, Ortman said, that such a significant state  leader should not consult with the Foreign Ministry, the  government or the president before making such statements.    His approach shows the level of communication between the  coalition parties on foreign policy, Ortman said.    The basis of Baudys' proposal is that "the war can be  stopped  if the guarantors of future development and the search for a  solution will be those states whose state identity is  indubitably connected with the religious values of the  participants in the conflict."    He suggested that within the UN there should be founded  "some  sort of executive council of good will consisting of seven UN  states, who would be entrusted with direct supervision and  protection of this territory." The states should be ones which  are "connected by their religious and cultural values with those  religious ethnic groups in the area."    Baudys told journalists about his idea at a special press  conference on Saturday [19 February].</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: The Fed rides in When the Federal Reserve decides to tighten monetary conditions for the first time since 1989, the immediate thought is that the long bull phase in financial markets must have come to an end. Certainly US equities took fright at the news, and the bond market was weaker. Look behind the unusual fanfare with which yesterday's announcement was delivered, though, and Mr Alan Greenspan appears like a man who, to parody President Theodore Roosevelt, speaks loudly and carries a small stick. All that has actually happened is that the Federal Reserve has signalled a move in the federal funds rate from 3 to 3.25 per cent. That should not turn the world upside down. Mr Greenspan's task was delicate. The federal funds rate was originally set at 3 per cent to protect the US economy and financial system from a deflationary credit crunch. The banking system is healthy again, while the economy has recovered to the point where capacity shortages start to loom on the albeit still distant horizon. But inflationary pressures are not yet visible and the recovery remains patchy. Yesterday's tightening appeared aimed at pre-empting future inflation without stopping growth. Mr Greenspan's willingness to act so early, and when he still faces important congressional testimony within the next few weeks, is a powerful demonstration of intent to keep the lid on inflation. That may just be sufficient to convince the bond market. If so, the risk of further tightening is small and other markets can return, more or less, to business as normal. A wholesale repatriation of the US investment funds from Europe and emerging markets in Asia would be unlikely. But it is a close call. A half point on the federal funds rate would have been a greater initial shock but would also have had more of the flavour of a one-off move. Expectation of more tightening to come could keep financial markets under pressure. When they are falling, cash is worth holding even if money market rates are still low. If the dollar continues to rise sharply on anticipation of higher US rates, the attraction of overseas markets to US investors may also diminish. Its rise over DM1.76 last night, which incidentally will make German rate cuts harder to deliver, is not immediately auspicious. Here again, though, much depends on whether a quarter point is deemed convincing when the immediate dust has settled. Even if it is, there is little prospect of another sharp fall in US bond yields. The upside for equity markets, in the UK as well as in the US, must also be limited. UK equities in particular have spent a long time piggy-backing bonds. Now they will have to depend more on corporate earnings for momentum.</p>

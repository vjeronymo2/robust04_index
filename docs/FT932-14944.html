			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: East Europe calls EC's bluff over free trade - Community proposals are short on specifics where it matters DURING this week's international conference in Copenhagen on economic development in central and eastern Europe, ministers from the former communist bloc served notice on the EC that it was time to put up or shut up. Dropping diplomatic niceties, the east Europeans pressed hard for further trade liberalisation with the EC and early membership of the Community. Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungary's foreign minister, compared their struggle to that of ancient gladiators fighting wild beasts in the Circus Maximus in front of an indifferent (western) Caesar. The Community's response was less dramatic. Looking sheepish, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, trotted out the standard EC line that there was no point in setting a firm date on membership. Other free trade-minded delegations pledged to dismantle trade barriers, but were short on specifics where it matters most: agriculture, fertilisers, steel and textiles. It was left to Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, to raise the free trade flag. He warned western ministers not to use the recession as an excuse for delaying trade concessions, saying the EC enjoyed a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 861m) trade surplus with the chief east and central European economies of the former Soviet bloc. Sir Leon is eastern Europe's standard-bearer in the battle for accelerated trade liberalisation to be considered at the EC summit in Copenhagen in June. Political steam for a more generous approach is building - if only because at some point the EC will have to confront the contradiction between its political desire to help the former communist countries and the economic reality that so far its concessions on market access have been niggardly. There are signs of a new approach. In Copenhagen, several western delegations said it was time for the eastern Europeans to rebuild commercial ties among themselves and with the former Soviet republics as part of a grand design to strengthen trade liberalisation across the continent, including eventually Russia. Mr Alain Lamassoure, the new French minister for European affairs, said greater commercial integration in the east would offset the loss of markets caused by the collapse of the Soviet bloc, but it would also serve a broader aim: to teach the east Europeans 'la vie communautaire', just as France and Germany learnt to overcome their old enmities after the second world war. More bluntly, Mr Lamassoure spoke of the 'absurd paradox' that east Europeans were demanding free trade with the west while continuing to put barriers to trade with their eastern neighbours. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, British foreign minister, was more cautious. Regional co-operation was no substitute for market access to the EC, but it made sense to forge closer trade links between the Visegrad Four  - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia - and Romania and Bulgaria. 'Ways too should be found to revitalise trade with neighbouring states in the former Soviet Union.' Yet all the east European countries are wary of being pushed back into the orbit of the former Soviet Union. Their fears are not only political. Mr Jeszenszky, colourful as ever, recalled that Lada car models built with Fiat spare parts in the east bloc never worked properly. East-west trade was simply superior to east-east trade, he said. Nor is it clear how Mr Lamassoure's ideas fit into the new patterns of trade which have sprung up since the fall of the Berlin Wall: the EC's single market, the European Economic Area (between the EC and Efta countries); free trade agreements between Efta and the Visegrad Four, between the Visegrads themselves, and between the EC and the six 'associate' EC countries (Bulgaria, Romania, and the Visegrad Four). Confusing the picture still further, the Baltic states have free trade agreements with Norway, Sweden, and Finland but not with the EC - a tricky subject which remains to be tackled during the Nordic countries' accession negotiations to the EC this year. The eastern European queue for membership is equally tangled. By extending association agreements to Bulgaria and Romania, the EC has offered the same privileges to the Visegrad Four and undermined its claim to be a privileged club. At the same time, the aggressively free-market Czech republic is sprinting ahead; Slovenia, the former Yugoslav republic, is also making rapid progress. Germany is quietly pushing both countries' cause. EC leaders will soon have to offer clearer priorities, even if this conflicts with the ad-hoc approach favoured by the Community. In the meantime, it is clear that the east Europeans are less willing to play a supplicant role toward their rich western neighbours. The EC's temporary ban on meat and dairy products because of suspected foot and mouth disease in the region unleashed prompt retaliation and howls of rage in Copenhagen. Mr Pavel Bratinka, Czech foreign minister, noting that there had been no foot and mouth disease in his country since 1974, uttered what could be a prophetic warning: 'From now on, the almost automatic support given hitherto by the Czech republic to anything bearing the label EC will exist no more.'</p>

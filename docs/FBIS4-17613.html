			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy </F> Trubetskoy, and others; from the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature]    [Text] Russia is interested in regular contacts with the  West-European Union (WEU). The meeting between Russia's Foreign  Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and the WEU Secretary General, Willem  van Ekkelen, planned for Monday should be viewed in precisely  this context, the director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's  Department for European Cooperation, Yuriy Ushakov, told  Interfax.    According to him, the WEU is beginning to play a more active  role in European affairs. "We would like to synchronize the pace  of our cooperation with the WEU with the development of our  interaction with the European Union in the economic and  political areas," the diplomat said.    Until recently the WEU did not play a noticeable role in  European affairs, "because it was on the brink of death", he  said. "The European Union reanimated that organization, when it  took its decision on greater interaction with the WEU in  Maastricht. So life itself has forced us to raise the level of  relations with the WEU and develop them more extensively,"  Ushakov concluded.</p>

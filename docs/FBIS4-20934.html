			<p>BFN     [Text] Military sources close to Yemeni Defense Minister  Haytham Qasim have said in Aden that the north Yemenis have  imported various types of chemical weapons and ammunition from  East European states through a Jewish arms dealer known for his  close ties with Zionist circles that are very active in these  states.    Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa categorically denied this.  They said such claims tarnish the image of Yemen and obstruct  the implementation of the pledge and accord document signed in  Amman to achieve Yemeni reconciliation. Defense Ministry  sources in Sanaa said an officer called Col. 'Ali al-Hadi, a  member of the south Yemeni Socialist Party and armament director  at the Defense Ministry, is currently in an East European state  to make a deal to purchase long-range missiles against the will  of the Defense Ministry in Sanaa.    In another development, Yemeni newspapers spoke about a  recent clash between the northern and southern forces in the  Shabwah area in southern Yemen, in which five were killed. A  north Yemeni source, however, said it was a clash between tribes  and only two were killed.</p>

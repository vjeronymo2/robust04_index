			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Danone takes the Bolshevik biscuit with Russian deal Danone, France's largest food group, plans to add some sweetness to one of the most basic Russian foods as a result of its latest and most ambitious acquisition in eastern Europe announced yesterday. The food company best known for its yoghurts said it had acquired the majority shareholding in Bolshevik, Russia's largest biscuit maker. It aims to expand Bolshevik's range of dry biscuits, wafers and crackers with chocolate-coated, filled and other more luxurious varieties. Bolshevik, originally known as Sioux, was founded by a French entrepreneur who moved to Moscow and started operations in 1855. Danone said it had no intention of changing the Bolshevik brandname, even though in the former Eastern bloc many streets and products with communist associations have been renamed following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. It said the brandname was very powerful with 30 per cent of the Russian biscuit market. It cited the example of a successful Russian confectionery brand which is still called Red October. The company refused to provide details of the cost of the purchase. It bought most of the shares from Alfa, a Russian investment fund that acquired a number of shares after Bolshevik was privatised in 1992. On top of the purchase of existing shares, Danone will make a Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.0m) capital injection, bringing its total shareholding in the enlarged group to 82.6 per cent. The remaining shares will be retained by employees and Russian citizens. Bolshevik, which employs about 2,500, produces 60,000 tonnes of biscuits and last year reported turnover of Dollars 28m. The new money will be used to introduce packaging measures and enlarge the product range. Danone has been making acquisitions in eastern Europe since 1989, when it launched yoghurt joint ventures in the former eastern Germany, followed by similar operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria. Yesterday's acquisition is the company's first move away from joint ventures in the region and is only its second investment in Russia after a joint venture agreed in May for the manufacture of yoghurt.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BUS FARE TO RISE A NICKEL; TRANSFER FEE IMPOSED  </P> <P> It's soon going to cost a nickel more for most Orange County commuters to ride  the bus.  </P> <P> In an effort to boost revenue for a bus operation that recovers less than a  fourth of its costs from passengers, Orange County Transit District board  members voted 5 to 0 Monday to raise the current 80-cent fare to 85 cents on  July 1, except in certain cases involving seniors and the disabled.  </P> <P> The increase was approved after a public hearing at OCTD headquarters in Garden  Grove.  </P> <P> "The fare increase is needed to make sure that the district meets its minimum  fare box recovery, which has been a problem at OCTD in the past," said County  Supervisor and OCTD Board Chairman Roger R. Stanton.  </P> <P> Fare box return -- the percentage of OCTD expenses offset by passenger fares --  is projected to rise slightly above the current 22.8% to about 24% as a result  of the increase approved Monday. The rest of OCTD's revenue comes from local,  state and federal funds.  </P> <P> The last OCTD fare hike -- also a nickel -- took effect July 1, 1988.  </P> <P> As part of Monday's action, the OCTD board imposed it's first-ever transfer  fee, also a nickel. A transfer fee is charged whenever a rider changes buses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stated Their Cases  </P> <P> Two elderly and 2 disabled people testified during the public hearing,  contending that seniors and the handicapped already face economic hardships and  should not have to pay more for public transportation. Their comments helped  persuade OCTD board members to exempt the two groups from some increases,  district officials said.  </P> <P> Seniors will not have to pay the nickel fare increase for fixed-route OCTD  service, such as a scheduled run from South Coast Plaza to Disneyland.  </P> <P> Passengers on Dial-A-Ride, the district's door-to-door van service arranged by  appointment, will have to pay $1.70 compared to the current fare of $1.60. But  the elderly and handicapped are also exempt from that increase. Although the  van service was initiated to serve seniors and the disabled, the OCTD board  opened it to all riders in hopes that it would get more commuters in the habit  of using public transportation. However, the board now is considering again  limiting it to seniors and the disabled.  </P> <P> The fare hikes are expected to increase district revenues by about $1.4 million  annually.  </P> <P> The regular bus fare in Los Angeles is $1.10, according to a spokesman for the  Southern California Rapid Transit District, which recovers only about 13% of  its costs through fares. Seniors pay 55 cents. RTD does not provide Dial-A-Ride  service.  </P> <P> In addition to OCTD, Orange County has two other public transit systems:  </P> <P> Vans operated by the Consolidated Transportation Service Agency charge $1 for  first 10 miles and $1 for each additional 10 miles, for handicapped and the  "frail elderly" anywhere in county. (Dial-A-Ride is restricted to trips within  small zones).  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Municipal Transit operates three, fixed-route buses with fares at  50 cents. Seniors currently ride free, but they will soon be required to pay 25  cents, according to Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank.  </P> <P> Seniors and the disabled account for about 10% of OCTD's ridership, which  surpassed 35 million trips annually in 1987-88. The district's bus and  Dial-A-Ride van fleets total 582 vehicles.  </P> <P> Board members on Monday also agreed to ask the Orange County Transportation  Commission -- which coordinates all county transportation -- to re-evaluate  some of the rail service proposed in the commission's 20-year  transportation-improvement program. The board decided that the 20-year plan  will not provide sufficient funding to expand rail service along the Los  Angeles-San Diego corridor enough to significantly reduce automobile traffic.  </P></p>

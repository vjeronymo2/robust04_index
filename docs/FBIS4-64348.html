			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F> Klaus-Peter Siegloch on 1 May; in the Mainz studio -- recorded]    [Text] [Siegloch] This ruling [by the Constitutional  Court about making the use of small amounts of hashish and  marijuana not punishable by law] has been criticized by a  particularly great number of politicians from the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. So far, you have not  said anything. Do you agree with it?    [Kanther] One should comment on a ruling as soon as one has  read it in its entirety. I note that this debate is going on  without anybody having read it in its entirety, because the most  important item of the ruling is the confirmation that the use of  all drugs, including cannabis products, is punishable by law.  The motions brought by administrative courts against that have  been rejected by the Federal Constitutional Court.    Then there is the statement, which has not yet been  detailed,  that in individual cases, where the possession of small amounts  of drugs is involved, punishment can be ignored. This is  nothing new, this is already legal practice now.    This has led to a political debate about the question of  releasing hashish for general consumption. I think this debate  is disastrous. Hashish must not be generally available. The  Federal Government is completely clear on that. I will  certainly not say today the opposite of what I said last week.  The inhibition thresholds for drug consumption, in particular  among young people, must not be lowered but must be kept high.    [Siegloch] Mr. Kanther, this is your political view.  However, the ruling -- or at least that part which has been  published so far -- sounds as if this offense remains punishable  but is no longer prosecuted. This gives the message to the  public that now practically anyone can use hashish, one just  must not deal with hashish.    [Kanther] I think that this message is dangerous. I do not  criticize an individual ruling by the Constitutional Court here.  I say that this is not the policy of the Federal Government.  The Federal Government's policy is quite clear -- making any  kind of trafficking and possession of any kind of drugs  punishable by law, while knowing that, given the frequency of  drug abuse, it is impossible to punish every single case, and,  in particular in the case of possession for one's own  consumption, punishment need not be imposed because there are  other forms of education and help and social or educational  influence on the addicts. All this -- this social and  educational aspect -- is undisputed. However, in the end the  possession and dealing with drugs must remain punishable.</p>

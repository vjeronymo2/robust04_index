			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVIVOR RATE TIED TO CREW'S EXPERTISE;  </P> <P> HIGH PRAISE HEAPED ON PILOT FOR 'HEROISM'  </P> <P> United Airlines Capt. Alfred C. Haynes had planned to spend Thursday at home in  Seattle, umpiring the district Little League championships. Instead, he spent  the day resting in an Iowa hospital, being hailed as a hero for his piloting of  the crippled DC-10 jumbo jet that crash-landed in Sioux City Wednesday  afternoon.  </P> <P> Fellow pilots said that preliminary reports of the massive engine and hydraulic  malfunctions that afflicted the aircraft in flight have left them wondering how  Haynes was able to control the 15-year-old plane at all.  </P> <P> But, they said, the former Marine Corps aviator -- one of United Airline's most  senior pilots -- is among the best in his field.  </P> <P> "He was always top-notch," said retired United Capt. Dick Weisner, who served  as Haynes' supervisor for many years. "He's a very fine pilot," Weisner said.  "I can't recommend anybody any higher."  </P> <P> A surviving passenger put the matter more simply. "Our pilot was a hero," John  Transue told reporters. "He really saved our butts."  </P> <P> Friends and neighbors of Haynes in Seattle said that a hero label fits the  pilot, who was named the state's Little League Volunteer of the Year days  before he left on Flight 232.  </P> <P> "Just knowing him and the way he is, I would have wanted him to be the man  behind the controls," said Jim Chavez, who has worked closely with Haynes in  Little League for nine years.  </P> <P> Chavez said Haynes planned to umpire the district league championships on  Sunday, but it rained so he promised to be back on Thursday to call the  rescheduled games.  </P> <P> Instead, the veteran pilot was in a Sioux City hospital after the ordeal that  began Wednesday 1 1/2 hours after his plane, carrying 282 passengers, a  three-person cockpit crew and eight flight attendants, left Denver en route to  Chicago.  </P> <P> Speaking to air traffic controllers in Minneapolis, Haynes reported that the  plane had lost power in one of its three engines, was losing altitude and  becoming difficult to control. A minute later, he reported "complete hydraulic  failure" -- total loss of the systems that allow the pilot to control the  plane's rudder, ailerons, flaps and other vital equipment.  </P> <P> For the next 41 minutes, Haynes, First Officer W. R. Records and Second Officer  D. J. Dvorak, struggled to bring the giant plane safely to the ground from  31,000 feet as flight attendants drilled passengers in the procedure for a  crash landing.  </P> <P> Thursday, United officials were crediting the crew's work with the survival of  more than half the passengers aboard the jetliner, which rolled over repeatedly  and burst into flames after touching down just short of the runway.  </P> <P> United Airlines Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said after visiting crew members in  the Sioux City hospital that the fact that so many survived the crash of Flight  232 "is a remarkable tribute to the expertise and courage of the crew,  particularly the heroic flying skills of Capt. Haynes."  </P> <P> Moments before the plane touched down in Sioux City, Haynes warned passengers  that the landing would be difficult and flight attendants warned passengers to  brace themselves. A few feet from the ground, the plane pitched suddenly to the  right and the wing touched down, sending the craft into a fiery, cartwheel that  split the fuselage into several huge pieces. Rescuers using a forklift found  Haynes and his fellow crew members trapped in the cockpit, suffering  lacerations on their heads and arms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Attendant Missing  </P> <P> Among the flight attendants, United said that seven survived. One was still  reported missing Thursday evening.  </P> <P> The mother of one of the flight attendants recalled watching the disaster on  television, certain that her daughter was among the crew.  </P> <P> A few moments later, the phone rang, Jane Murray of Chester, S.C., recalled. It  was her daughter, Virginia Jane, "telling me she was all right."  </P> <P> "It was the sweetest news to my ears," Murray said. "We're just very grateful."  </P></p>

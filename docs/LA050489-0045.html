			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS' RAISE GAINS  </P> <P> The Senate Rules Committee unanimously approved a bill that would give members  of the Legislature a 10% pay raise, from $40,816 annually to $44,898. The  increase would take effect Dec. 3, 1990, a month after the next general  election. State lawmakers last voted themselves a salary boost two years ago.  Besides salary, legislators also receive a tax-free $88 daily allowance for  expenses, seven days a week, while the Legislature is in session. Senators  averaged $17,500 in tax-free per diem last year. They also receive leased  vehicles, free gasoline, telephone credit cards, generous pensions and life and  medical insurance. Under the state Constitution, legislative pay raises are  limited to a maximum of 5% a year. Most pay raise bills have covered a two-year  period since 1966, when the voters gave lawmakers the authority to increase  legislative salaries.  </P></p>

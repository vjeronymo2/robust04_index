			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / German GM plant to build new diesel engines GENERAL MOTORS is to invest DM500m (Dollars 290m) to build a new range of diesel engines at its main Adam Opel engine plant at Kaiserslautern, Germany, after winning agreement from trade unions on a package of far-reaching labour reforms at the plant. The US carmaker has chosen to build the range in Germany despite the burden of German labour costs, the highest in the world auto industry. Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said the group had decided on Kaiserslautern, because of progress it had made in introducing streamlined 'lean' production methods at the plant. It has won agreement for team working and the integration of production and maintenance work. The diesel engine plant will operate for 24 hours a day for five days a week and will continue running through rest periods. Shift changes will be achieved without any break of production, and preventive maintenance will be performed as part of normal working time on Saturdays without payment of any overtime premium. Opel is cutting the layers of management at the plant from five to four, and the works council has agreed to work to lower absenteeism to 'an internationally competitive level' of less than 5 per cent. Opel suffers absenteeism of around 9 per cent at its Bochum and Russelsheim plants in Germany. The company said it believed that with the new labour agreement 'competitive manufacturing will also continue to be possible in Germany'. The choice of Kaiserslautern was a commitment by Opel to Germany, said Mr Herman. The facility will have capacity to produce 250,000 engines a year with production starting at the end of 1995. It will employ 475 people at full capacity and will help to slow the fall in the Opel workforce at the site. GM urgently needs a modern diesel power unit for its European car range. It has fallen behind several of its main rivals, including Volkswagen and Peugeot, in the provision of competitive diesel engines at a time when diesels are rapidly growing in popularity. It was forced yesterday to cut the prices of its 1.7 litre Vectra and Astra diesel cars in Germany by DM1,000 per car to try to bolster sales. Diesel engines accounted for 17.1 per cent of new car sales in Europe last year compared with 14.7 per cent a year earlier, according to figures from Automotive Industry Data. The diesel market share in Germany jumped to 15 from 12 per cent.</p>

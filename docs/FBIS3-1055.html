He was speaking at a news conference outside Mmabatho  today.    [Begin Mangope recording] Freedom to participate in the  electoral process may not be granted to me given discussions  I've had with Mr. Botha and Mr. Maharaj, who informed me that my  participation at this stage would perhaps not be possible. [end  recording]    A short while ago a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman, who  was present when the ANC's [African National Congress] Mr. Mac  Maharaj and Foreign Minister Pik Botha held discussions with Mr.  Mangope, said this was not the case. He said the message  conveyed by both men to the former Bophuthatswana president was  that if he wished to contest the election he was perfectly  welcome to do so.</p>

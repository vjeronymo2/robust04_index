Antic: "Rugova Fights Back"] </F>   [Text] Pristina -- Recently, both the ethnic Albanian  press and some circles of the ethnic Albanian political  alternative in Kosovo have issued many controversial reports and  commentaries that openly call in question the results and  effects of the political and diplomatic efforts made so far by  Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the ethnic Albanian separatist  movement for the republic of Kosovo (or rather by his propaganda  team). Of course, most of those reports and commentaries were  published in the Serbian press as well. Yesterday the Kosovo  Information Center issued a commentary in an unusual way,  sending to Rugova's critics the message that they are on the  wrong track because the international positions of Kosovo and of  Rugova have definitely been improving. The Kosovo Information  Center, whose commentary was published by BULJKU yesterday,  alleges that the Belgrade regime accuses Rugova of pursuing a  radical policy and extremism, aimed at the strengthening of his  personal position abroad, while by such attacks, Rugova's  critics from the ethnic Albanian political circles want to  weaken his position at home and abroad, which he earned through  his endeavors to settle the ethnic Albanian national question.    The commentary, addressing in the first place the ethnic  Albanian critics of Rugova and the results of his policies,  reminds those same critics that they are focusing on the wrong  problems, because, instead of concentrating on the Serbian  terror and oppression on ethnic Albanians, which threatens to  result in the arrest of Rugova himself, they are accusing Rugova  that his policy is futile, and his resistance too passive.  "Those same critics," the commentary runs further, "do not  forbear to scandalously dramatize and extensively report on some  cases of misunderstanding among several ethnic Albanian  political groups in Kosovo and Macedonia, while hardly paying  attention to the arrest of the entire staff of the Defense  Ministry of the so-called republic of Kosovo. Some ethnic  Albanian media and certain individuals have openly expressed  their satisfaction at disagreements between Pristina and Tirana."    Since the entire commentary suggests that there are serious  breaches on the ethnic Albanian political stage in Kosovo, it  sends the message to the "heretics" to come to their senses and  concentrate on the Serbian occupation of Kosovo, rather than on  Rugova, who works for the ethnic Albanian national cause in the  best possible way. After this message the commentary specifies  the political efforts that Rugova has made this year, as well as  the effects and tributes paid to his policy abroad. Among other  things the commentary also says that after Rugova's tour in the  European Union member-countries late last year, Kosovo and  Rugova's peaceful policy have been continuously winning  recognition and support also this year as well. Then the  commentary recalls Rugova's January visit to the United States,  where President Clinton and State Secretary Warren Christopher  expressed full support to Rugova, promising also that the United  States will not tolerate the aggressive Serbian policy on  Kosovo. The next example is Rugova's February visit to the  United States, where Clinton and Al Gore expressed their  understanding for Rugova's peaceful policy, which aims at  finding a peaceful settlement to the situation in Kosovo.    The commentary further says that last week the question of  Kosovo was discussed by many international institutions, for  instance, at the meeting of the highest CSCE officials in  Prague, where the resolution was adopted by which it is demanded  that the CSCE mission be returned to Kosovo. The commentary  also points out the resolution adopted by the UN Commission for  Human Rights, which refers only to Kosovo, and also the  resolution on former Yugoslavia, which anticipates the  self-determination of Kosovo. It is also emphasized that the  Kosovo issue was discussed at the latest meeting of the EU  Council of Ministers, as well as at many other international  forums, where some concrete solutions for Kosovo have been  proposed.</p>

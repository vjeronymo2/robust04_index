			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lonrho The flotation of Ashanti Goldfields has won Lonrho new friends. US investors have increased their holding to around 20 per cent in recent months, apparently on the view that a net asset value of 187p per share  - when adjusted for the market value of its Ashanti stake - makes Lonrho shares at 134p look cheap. While there is some merit in this line of argument, the logic demands that Lonrho manages its assets more effectively than in the past. Yesterday's interim figures did not inspire confidence in this regard. The main disappointment came in manufacturing, which swung into loss due to problems in areas ranging from UK construction to textiles in Malawi. While progress in hotels and distribution is more encouraging, Lonrho's 2 per cent return on sales outside Africa is hardly adequate. The group's weak cash flow also limits its room for manoeuvre. Gearing of around 30 per cent is no longer a worry, but interest payments of Pounds 28m in the first half continue to soak up free cash flow. That may explain Lonrho's desire to float its African trading activities, which would open another avenue for raising funds as well as pleasing shareholders interested in net asset values. Yet the more conventional solution to the weak cash position - and the one most investors might prefer to see - would be to squeeze more profit out of the non-African interests. It can only be hoped that Lonrho finds a chairman capable of balancing the deal-making instincts of Messrs Rowland and Bock with the emphasis on line management of BTR or Hanson.</p>

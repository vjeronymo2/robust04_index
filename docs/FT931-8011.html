			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Expansionary budget planned for Romania ROMANIA'S minority government this week faces its biggest test to date when it presents an expansionary budget to parliament for 1993-1994. The left-wing Democratic National Salvation Front, which formed a government in November, plans to increase government investment by raising corporate taxation. Profit tax would rise to 40-60 per cent, from 30-45 per cent, although companies involved in exporting would be eligible for discounts of up to 50 per cent. The budget deficit would rise to 428bn lei (Pounds 568.6m), or 4 per cent of gross domestic product, up from 2 per cent last year. Despite a 15 per cent fall in Romania's GDP last year, the budget has been drawn up on the basis that GDP will remain stable this year and that annual inflation will drop from 200 per cent to 80 per cent. The trade deficit is forecast to reach Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.3bn, with external debt expected to double to Dollars 7bn this year. However, only Dollars 4bn of foreign credit would be drawn in 1993, according to Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister with responsibility for economic reform. Mr Negritoiu, an independent who is considered the cabinet's key reformer, said government spending would be aimed at privatisation and restructuring, infrastructure projects, agriculture and building up social welfare.</p>

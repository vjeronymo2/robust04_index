			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (6): Poised to stay the course - Emerging markets are heading for another important year If 1993 was the crucial year when emerging markets finally broke through into the big-time global investment scene, 1994 could prove to be another important year in which they will consolidate their position in much more difficult circumstances, and show they have staying power. Last year's huge net flows into emerging equity markets - some Dollars 55bn according to Baring Securities - are unlikely to be repeated this time, still less the average rate of return of some 70 per cent. But according to Barings a still very substantial Dollars 30bn-plus (the second-largest annual total) is likely to flow into the emerging markets this year. And after setbacks early in 1994 for many individual country markets the global emerging markets indices have recently moved back into positive territory. Earlier this month, for instance, the International Finance Corporation's Composite Index was showing a gain of some 2 per cent on the year so far, while Baring's World Index was up 10 per cent (expressed in dollars in both cases). Thus emerging market equities were rather less volatile than bonds, which have proved to be highly vulnerable to the jump in US Treasury bond yields. Last year US institutions were chasing so-called Brady bonds - paper resulting from country debt restructurings - to improve on the low yields on US Treasuries. This year, not only have Brady yields risen but the spreads over Treasuries have widened sharply. Hence the negative return of 15 per cent or so for the year to date, although there has been a modest recovery during the summer. Even in equities the picture has been variable, as is only to be expected in a risky area. For instance, the Turkish market has been very weak and China is going through a difficult time. But there have been profits to be made in parts of Latin America - notably Brazil, at least until the resignation of the finance minister earlier this month - and in India and Korea. In any case, definitions of emerging markets vary. Hong Kong is now an advanced economy but in some respects it serves as a proxy for China. Mexico is becoming progressively integrated into the north American economy. The real pioneers are looking further afield, to countries such as Morocco, Bangladesh and Vietnam. A search for higher returns lies behind the surge in investor interest in developing countries. The attitude of US investors has been pivotal. In the past they have been largely stay-at-homes but by 1993 Wall Street appeared to have reached rather high (and therefore unattractive levels) given the modest long-term economic growth prospects of the US economy. Coincidentally, political shifts altered the attitudes of many developing countries, including the former Soviet block. Privatisation programmes were introduced, often involving the sale of important state corporations including telephone and oil companies. Cross-border investment restrictions were relaxed. Bodies such as the Washington-based IFC, an equity-oriented affiliate of the World Bank, began to get much more involved in development programmes. New stock exch-anges were set up in many countries, including Russia. In 1993, according to the IFC, some 2,000 enterprises in the 25 emerging markets it regularly tracks raised some Dollars 38bn in new equity issues. These emerging markets have grown to represent 12 per cent of world equity market capitalisation on IFC definitions. In fact, the emerging markets, taken as a group, now add up in capitalisation terms to the world's third-biggest market, after the US and Japan. Often, indeed, investors regard them as forming a distinct asset class, offering high but risky returns. The high returns are based upon rapid economic growth. Whereas the G7 advanced countries have slowed down to average longer-term growth rates of perhaps between 2 and 3 per cent the developing countries are capable of 6 per cent or more. For several years China, for example, has grown at 13 or 14 per cent, and it still has vast potential, although it is now slowing down after signs of overheating (including a rise in the inflation rate to about 25 per cent). US investors have suddenly latched on to the potential of the emerging markets. Last year around Dollars 20bn flowed into US mutual funds specialising in emerging markets, and further large sums were channelled through more general global funds. US pension funds are also planning to raise their exposures to emerging markets substantially (from only about 0.5 per cent of their portfolios at present). Michael Howell, global strategist at Baring Securities, says in the five years since the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, which symbolised the political changes, flows of capital to emerging markets have jumped by 15 times. He reckons that emerging stock markets will account for some 40 per cent of the global market capitalisation by 2010. Already the markets are becoming broad enough for some investors to concentrate on particular sectors such as communications, infrastructure and the media. 'There's more interest outside the country angle and focused on industries,' he says. This flow of capital into less developed countries is now on a large enough scale to have important implications for the future shape of the global economy. Indeed, the scare over capital shortages earlier this year owed something to the fear that the draining of financial resources out of the US and Europe was forcing up the real cost of capital. If there is to continue to be a large-scale shift of investment capital to the emerging markets then western governments must accept at least two consequences. They must reduce their own borrowing levels, or rates of return will indeed be forced up. And the advanced economies must run current account surpluses to offset their deficits on capital account. Plainly, countries such as Germany and Japan, which are benefiting heavily from the capital investment boom in developing countries, will find it easier to fit into this framework than the US and the UK. The latter states have become big importers of consumer goods - but it is impossible for very long to combine high consumption with heavy investment. The main short-term risk for the emerging markets is therefore that US interest rates will rise substantially further to rebalance the US economy, and in the process the flow of investment dollars will be choked off. For the time being, however, buoyant exports and rising commodity prices are boosting activity in many third world economies. These are strongly positive trends, and serve to explain why share prices in many of the emerging markets have rallied strongly since the wave of profit-taking in the spring.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA SET TO VOTE ON NEW FIRE CHIEF  </P> <P> G. John Parker, fire chief in Peoria, Ill., for three years, has been offered  the job of chief of the Pomona Fire Department by City Administrator Julio  Fuentes.  </P> <P> Parker would be the first black in memory to head a Pomona public safety  department, according to city officials.  </P> <P> Fuentes said Parker, 48, must pass a physical examination, agree to a  compensation package and be confirmed by the City Council. The council has  interviewed him and is expected to act Jan. 3.  </P> <P> The Fire Department has been without a permanent chief since Tom Fee resigned  in July after 76 of the department's 119 firefighters petitioned for his  removal.  </P> <P> Fuentes described Parker as very bright and said he has a reputation as a  strong leader and good communicator.  </P> <P> Parker joined the Peoria Fire Department when he was 23, after serving in the  Marine Corps. Parker said he lived in California as a Marine and had always  planned to move back. "I like the climate. I like the style of living," he  said.  </P> <P> Peoria is geographically larger than Pomona, but slightly smaller in  population. The fire departments are of similar size.  </P> <P> Parker is married and has five children, the youngest 15.  </P></p>

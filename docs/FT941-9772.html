			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Power play For an academic, Professor Stephen Littlechild has a curious fondness for blunt engineering solutions. Faced with the complex but failing market in electricity generation, the regulator has finally settled for giving it a couple of healthy bangs with the hammer. Whether these will actually make the market function any more effectively is a moot point. The price cap applied for the next two years will have a marginal impact on National Power and PowerGen's profitability - shaving perhaps 5 per cent from earnings per share growth. But that will not disturb the companies' ability to increase dividends, so the current share price ratings look underpinned. The sale of power plant is also unlikely to damage the companies much, given that they only have to sell stations if they can get decent prices. More significantly, control of the price-setting mechanism is still likely to remain with the two big generators, as they will continue to own most of the relevant plant. The generating market is split between a large price-insensitive block of nuclear and gas stations and another block of price-sensitive coal plant. Marrying the two into some kind of single market will require the kind of fundamental reforms that have just been ducked. The generators will presumably split up their plant sales so that no one competitor has a significant market share. Demerging a package of plant as a separate stock market company would ensure that shareholders retained the value of these stations. National Power and PowerGen have bought themselves a couple of trouble-free years and the outcome is certainly better for them than a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. But similar issues will remain in 1996, leaving Prof Littlechild with a problem. As the market becomes more crowded, the vexed question of the independent producers' long-term contracts to buy expensive gas for their new stations will come back to haunt him too.</p>

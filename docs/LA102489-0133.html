			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL OKS $2.8 BILLION FOR QUAKE RELIEF  </P> <P> Congress on Monday took the first step toward approving federal aid for victims  of last week's Bay Area earthquake, but only after unexpected opposition  sidelined a package that had been put together by the California congressional  delegation.  </P> <P> The package approved by the House Appropriations Committee would provide $2.8  billion to rebuild bridges and highways and provide emergency aid -- fully $1  billion less than the California delegation had requested but close to the $2.5  billion proposed by the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> The package, still the largest ever approved for a single disaster, was passed  on a voice vote as part of a stopgap spending bill to be taken up by the full  House today. The California plan was killed earlier by a 27-7 vote.  </P> <P> Among the provisions defeated was one that would have allowed Bay Area  homeowners to receive disaster loans of up to $500,000 to rebuild their homes.  Under current law, those loans are limited to $100,000. California lawmakers,  who argued that the higher limit was needed because of the high cost of housing  in the Bay Area, may try to restore the provision as Congress works on the  emergency aid package this week.  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.), who sponsored the bill and led  the opposition to the more costly California request, called his proposal a  "starter" package and said more money could be allocated to California, once  its needs have been more carefully determined.  </P> <P> But Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), leader of the state's effort in the  committee, expressed disappointment that the lawmakers turned down his request  for $3.8 billion in relief funds now.  </P> <P> "We made our case. We didn't succeed in winning the support we need, but we  hope we can in the future," Fazio said.  </P> <P> Asked about Whitten's assurances that California will get more aid if it needs  it, Fazio said he "appreciated the chairman's intent" but feared that Congress  will be less disposed to help the victims of the quake once the initial shock  of the disaster passes and media attention turns elsewhere.  </P> <P> " 'Out of sight, out of mind' is what operates around here," Fazio said. "I  think it's going to be very difficult to get more money down the road after  other problems have intervened."  </P> <P> Asked if he had detected an anti-California bias, Fazio said: "California has  always had certain problems in presenting its problems to the rest of the  country. . . . We are the Golden State, and that leads to some jealousy."  </P> <P> The package approved by the committee would provide $1.1 billion in Federal  Emergency Management Agency disaster relief funds, $1 billion in federal  highway aid to reconstruct damaged bridges and roads, $500 million in Small  Business Administration loan funds that can be used to rebuild both businesses  and homes and $250 million to be used at President Bush's discretion to aid  victims.  </P> <P> The California delegation had proposed a total of $400 million in discretionary  funds for the President plus additional money for the SBA, in part to take into  account the proposed larger loan limit for home reconstruction. The delegation  plan also included $100 million in funds for the Economic Development  Administration.  </P> <P> With polls showing that voters are no longer concerned about the federal  deficit, neither the Administration nor the congressional leadership made even  a pretense of proposing a way to pay for the aid, conceding that the extra  spending will simply swell the existing deficit.  </P> <P> "It will add to the deficit," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. "Is  that preferable to a tax increase? Yes."  </P> <P> The new spending does not violate the increasingly irrelevant Gramm-Rudman law  that is supposed to control the deficit, because its mechanism only looks at  the deficit as of Oct. 15 of each year. Spending after that date does not count  -- thus creating one of a series of loopholes that both Congress and the  Administration have been taking advantage of with increasing abandon.  </P> <P> But although Gramm-Rudman no longer seems to have much ability to control  spending, congressional battles over turf still have the strength to slow  legislation. That fact was dramatically on display Monday as committee Chairman  Whitten stalled action on the California delegation's plan and then imposed his  own, smaller alternative.  </P> <P> While conceding that Whitten's package was better than the Administration's  proposal, Fazio and other California legislators said they were concerned about  the committee's refusal to waive all local matching requirements for highway  aid.  </P> <P> "Of course $2.8 billion is a lot of money, but what we really needed were some  of the waivers," one California legislative aide said.  </P> <P> The committee vote came after a somewhat contentious session in which other  lawmakers questioned California's need for so much money.  </P> <P> Saying he wanted to dramatize his concern that too much money was being spent,  Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) introduced and then withdrew an amendment that  would have allocated $5 billion to his state for damages suffered in hurricanes  going back to 1900.  </P> <P> Whitten denied the committee was showing an "anti-California" bias, saying  legislators just needed more time to consider the magnitude of the request and  the mechanisms by which California is proposing to use the money.  </P> <P> "There are at least 10 committees that have jurisdiction here," he said, adding  that it could take "a year and a half" to pass California's requests.  </P></p>

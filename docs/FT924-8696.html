			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Out of the shadows and back into the industrial limelight - A new respect for the views of the employers IF YOU listen carefully to the platform party at this year's CBI conference, you can almost hear the sound of purring. At long last the CBI is being taken seriously by the government. Cabinet ministers and civil servants have flocked to address the conference and seek its opinions. For an organisation which spent much of the 1980s in the shadows, the result is an unaccustomed glow of self-importance. The change is not difficult to account for. The government has been giving greater emphasis to stimulating growth than to combatting inflation. At the same time, ministers appear to be losing faith in a consumer-led economic revival. The only alternative is an investment-led recovery, and if the government cannot afford such investment itself, it is up to the CBI's membership to come to the rescue. Whether those members are in the mood to oblige is altogether another matter. The CBI's own surveys suggest that investment in plant and machinery next year will fall for the fourth consecutive year. The first report from its new National Manufacturing Council, produced with a flourish on the first day of the conference, set a target of doubled investment per employee by UK industry by the year 2000. From the government's viewpoint, that may appear to be a somewhat leisurely programme. In return, the CBI seeks help from the government in the form of lower rates of corporation tax and higher capital allowances. It also looks to the City for easier bank finance and the acceptance of lower dividend payments to shareholders. That last point was returned to repeatedly by speakers from the floor yesterday. The argument is familiar: that in competing nations such as Germany and Japan, a much larger proportion of profits is retained for investment rather than being paid out to shareholders. If that argument really takes hold, the Stock Market had better look to the consequences. There is however a further aspect of the debate which is causing the City anxiety. The more that companies cut dividends, the more the average company pension fund will find itself running short of income. Companies which enjoyed pension holidays in the 1980s may accordingly find their profits affected by the necessity to top up their funds. The more that costs, the less there is to invest in plant and machinery. There is a further reason the government should not feel overly sanguine about CBI members rushing to save the economy by investing. It is one thing for the organisation's leaders to be called in to talk to the prime minister or the chancellor, as has happened during the past weeks. The rank and file, some of whom will doubtless return from Harrogate only to lay off more workers, are not included in the general euphoria. In yesterday's debate on the UK economy, two calls most vociferously applauded were that the Bank of England should be granted independence and that the Treasury should be sacked en masse. It may well be a step forward that the government is taking the CBI seriously. A more important step would be for the CBI's members to return the compliment.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (3): New work opportunities for the young  -The EC connection YOUNG women watch assiduously as a chef prepares the pastry for a traditional Madeira cake - a heavier, richer and far nicer sweet than the bland imitation sold in British supermarkets under that name. The large kitchen is spotless with an array of modern ovens and working tables and a full range of cooking utensils. The students who listen so attentively are on a cookery course subsidised by the European Community. When the course is over they will take up a job in one of the island's hotels or restaurants. In the not-so-distant past they would probably have remained at home in a small village and done needlework at low rates of pay. Choices were limited, especially for women. But all that has changed. EC membership and a generous dose of EC funds have helped to create new opportunities for most of Madeira's young people as well as to help to transform the island. Still poor by European standards, the island's economy is growing rapidly. The scale of the change is striking. New roads, bridges, clinics and schools have been built or are under construction, new services and new jobs have helped to broaden choice for most Madeirans, especially for the young. Officials say emigration has stopped, and Madeiran society is slowly opening up. 'The European Community is perhaps the most important factor for our future. All our (new) infrastructures have been made with EC support. Without that support we could not have done it,' says Mr Miguel de Sousa, vice-president of the Madeiran regional government. Madeira is benefiting from so many different EC programmes that it is almost impossible to assess exactly the amounts involved, but according to Mr de Sousa, Madeira will receive about Esc50bn (Dollars 375m) in EC aid in the period 1990-93, an investment representing more than 10 per cent of its annual gross domestic product during the four years. This includes a special EC multi-fund programme - known as Pop-Madeira  - for the four-year period, under which Madeira will receive EC aid of Ecu219m (Dollars 276m) towards investments totalling Ecu313m. The programme is divided into eight sub-programmes with Community support ranging from 67 per cent to 75 per cent of total investments - the highest ratio of EC support in the Community due to Madeira's classification as a peripheral region with special development needs. Projects are aimed at developing infrastructures, tourism, energy resources, communications, transport, social and health services, modernising agriculture, fisheries and industry, providing training and protecting the environment. It does not include additional EC support for specific projects such as the necessary modernisation and expansion of the international airport which is expected to cost around Esc60bn at 1991 prices, with the EC providing 75 per cent of the finance. Mr de Sousa says the level of execution of EC-backed projects so far is close to 100 per cent. As the economy is being modernised, old traditional industries are giving way to new ones, and preparing a new workforce or retraining older workers takes on added urgency. This is an area where EC help is also playing an important role. Professional training is 100 per cent EC-funded, and this has encouraged some companies to set up in Madeira. Training is carried out either at the workplace or at the Centro Regional de Formacao Profissional (CRFP), set on a hill overlooking Funchal. Mr Carlos Estudante, director, says: 'We have low unemployment of around 4.8 per cent, but we have a very young population. Education and training are very important for us.' The centre has several workshops, classrooms, as well as the kitchen where students were learning how to bake cakes. Some students live in, others come daily, depending on their courses which can last three years. Twice a year, EC officials visit Madeira to check on the development of training programmes which have been allocated Esc6.1bn (Dollars 46m) from its social fund for the period 1990-93. The regional government will contribute close to Esc3bn bringing total planned expenditure on training to around Esc9bn for the period. Over 18,000 trainees representing almost 14 per cent of the present workforce of 130,000 will have benefited from EC-supported training programmes by the end of 1993. But the centre not only provides courses in a wide variety of subjects from cookery to industrial design and computing, it is also responsible for supervising in-house training programmes carried out by companies. Its inspectors check that EC funds given for training are properly used, and that apprentices and trainees are given an appropriate formation. Mr Estudante says: 'We want to make sure the training is of the right quality and that it creates real jobs for Madeirans, otherwise it would be wasted.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists believes the  Ukrainian president and Supreme Council should introduce  presidential rule in Crimea and repeal its autonomous status.  This was said in a statement the congress made regarding the  latest developments in Crimea. The document stresses that the  Crimean Supreme Council's decision to restore the autonomy's  constitution in its original version represents disregard for  the fundamental law of Ukraine and international agreements on  the inviolability of the borders and territorial integrity of  states. The statement's authors describe these actions as  criminal in respect of the Ukrainian people and state.    The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists also demands that the  registration in Crimea of political parties, which perform  anti-Ukrainian activity, should be discontinued, separatism  ended, and calm and peaceful work guaranteed for the peninsula's  citizens.</p>

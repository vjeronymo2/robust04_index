			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10, IRNA -- Oil Minister Gholam Reza  Aqazadeh said here Monday that Iran is working towards creating  an international consensus on energy based on economic growth,  preservation of the environment, stabilization of international  supply and demand, and a fair and reasonable crude oil price.  Aqazadeh who arrived here Monday made the remark in a meeting  with the Japanese corporate leaders.    Mentioning that Iran was the third crude oil supplier to  Japan, he called for a greater market share in that country.    Iran is the second highest crude oil producer among the 13  states who form the organization of petroleum exporting  countries (OPEC) and the second crude oil exporter in the world.    Iran is second in the world in terms of gas reserves, said  the Iranian minister, adding that in the coming decade the  country will become one of the major suppliers of gas and oil.    Aqazadeh said Iran attaches special priority to meet Japan's  needs in the oil and gas sector.    He welcomed investments from foreign companies including  Japanese for development of Iran's oil and gas fields in the  second 5-year development plan (1994-98).    Referring to Iran as an "important gateway" to the Central  Asian republics, he suggested that the Japanese corporate  manufacture their goods in Iran with the aim of exporting them  to the Central Asian and Persian Gulf states.    Aqazadeh voiced concern over the current situation of the  oil  market and said the price slump means a decline in the oil  producers' income, slow down in their development coupled with  more output to meet the world's growing energy demand, and  finally lesser trade with industrialized states.    The oil minister reminded that this would trigger an energy  crisis in the future.    The world today has no other way to put an end to its  current  economic malaise, except developing the economic interdependence  among various regions, producers and consumers of energy, he  stressed.    Aqazadeh is to leave Japan for Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday  on  a 4-day visit.</p>

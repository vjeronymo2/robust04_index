			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont hears Tory views on VAT MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, heard some support last night from Tory MPs for an extension of the value added tax base but at the same time was warned not to introduce measures in the March 16 Budget that would threaten economic recovery. At a meeting of the Conservative backbench finance committee there was also backing for Treasury plans to tackle the public sector borrowing requirment, starting as early as the December Budget. The meeting of about 40 MPs, at which Mr Lamont did not speak, heard calls for VAT to be extended, perhaps to newspapers, in order to boost Treasury revenues. But in a sombre atmopshere there was no consensus and other Tories would be unhappy with any tax rises. Last night's session marked the end of an extensive consultation exercise Mr Lamont has had with Tory MPs over Budget alternatives. Tory MPs remain jittery about the fragility of any recovery and were divided about whether interest rates should be cut further - or should have been cut as far as they have. Earlier, Mr John Major was forced on the defensive in the Commons over the Conservative party's election pledge not to extend the scope of VAT. The prime minister's repeated attempts to hold to the customary formula, that he could not comment on possible tax changes with the March 16 Budget just five weeks away, were brushed aside by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy Labour leader. Mrs Beckett recalled that during last year's general election campaign Mr Major said the government had no plans to extend VAT and that there was no need to do so. She demanded: 'Do you stand by those words?' Mr Major replied: 'You know we are near to the Budget. You must wait.' The Treasury's long-term spending review is already under way. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, has had preliminary meetings with colleagues at the departments of health and education and at the Home Office as part of his review of public spending.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / UK technology transfer to Saudi chemical complex Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic) and the British Offset Committee for the Al-Yamamah programme have agreed to license the building of an aromatics complex at Yanbu on the Red Sea. The complex will employ the Cyclar process developed by UOP of the US and British Petroleum. Aromatics are a key building block for the development of other downstream petrochemical industries. The Offset programme relates to the Al-Yamamah project, under which British Aerospace provides aircraft and support for the Saudi airforce and British companies have become involved in industrial developments. Construction of the plant, expected to cost Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m) according to independent industry sources, will start next year and be completed by early 1998. Owner and operator will be Arabian Industrial Fibres, known as Ibn Rushd, in which Sabic has 51.7 per cent share. Other Saudi private sector companies, including Dammam-based Arabian Industrial Development (NAMA), Jeddah-based Saudi Industrial Development and the Alujain group, hold the balance. Locally available liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will be used as feedstock to produce between 300,000 and 350,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of benzene; 250,000 and 300,000 tpa of paraxylene; and 50,000-100,000 tpa of other xylenes. These products in turn will provide the raw materials for downstream sales and marketing, partly to domestic buyers in Jubail and the eastern province, and partly for two other Ibn Rushd projects at Yanbu which have already been commissioned. The first is for Sabic's PTA (purified terephthalic acid) plant being built with technology from Italy's Technimont; it provides the raw materials for the second, a PET (polyester fibres and chips) plant licensed with Germany's Zimmer. The Sabic/British Offset project represents the first commercial-scale use of the Cyclar process, according to Mr Colin Craig, financial adviser to the British Offset Committee and a director of Schroder Asseily, the merchant bank advising the offset group. The Cyclar process uses LPG instead of the more expensive naphtha as feedstock. The successful British marketing of the Cyclar process to Saudi Arabia follows two years' work by BP at its Grangemouth refinery in Scotland. UOP is a world-wide supplier of technology to both the refining and the petrochemical industries.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: OVERLOOKED?  </P> <P> Despite a slew of celebs, who helped net a hefty $85,000 for the evening, the  AIDS Hospice Foundation's Oscar night fund-raiser at the Directors Guild of  America got scant press coverage last week. One trade paper columnist  mistakenly referred to it as "the DGA party."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the evening attributed the lack of media attention to a soft  publicity push: "Since it was our first one, we didn't want to oversell."  </P> <P> The Schutrum-Piteo Foundation, a nonprofit group that provides care to single  seniors, underwrote the event, which was produced by the Friends of the AIDS  Hospice. Maple Drive, 72 Market St. and a dozen other posh restaurants provided  food and waiters. Studios pitched in personnel. And so on.  </P> <P> In a unique fund-raising twist, the foundation arranged for sponsors to put up  $1,000 for every celebrity who signed a guest book before the crowd. Among the  stars showing up: Angelica Huston, ex-Gov. Jerry Brown, Edward James Olmos,  Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, Dudley Moore, Sally Kirkland, Robert Downey  Jr., Estelle Getty, Rob Lowe. Bob Goen, host of the daytime "Wheel of Fortune,"  emceed.  </P> <P> Biggest moment of the evening: when "Common Threads: Stories From the (AIDS)  Quilt" won the Oscar for best documentary. John M. Wilson  </P></p>

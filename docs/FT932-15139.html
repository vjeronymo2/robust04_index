			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Newbury ballot tied to council elections THE government set the stage yesterday for the most important test of its popularity since last year's general election by announcing that the Newbury by-election will be held on May 6. The date for the by-election, where the Conservatives face a powerful challenge from the Liberal Democrats to their 12,357 majority, has been chosen to coincide with the county council elections. The reasoning in Conservative Central Office is that the impact of a defeat might be cushioned by a stronger performance in the local polls. Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives were being careful yesterday not to overstate their confidence of winning the seat. Senior officials on both sides said privately that they regarded the result as 'too close to call'. Newbury has traditionally been regarded as part of the Conservatives' home counties heartlands, but the recession has severely eroded support for the government. The Liberal Democrats also have a strong presence on the Berkshire county council where their support ensures a Labour administration. The poll, caused by the death of Mrs Judith Chaplin, is regarded by the Liberal Democrat party as a key test of its ability to re-establish its political profile after a lacklustre year. The 9.3 per cent swing it needs to win the seat is well within the margin of its by-election victories during the last parliament. Labour, which polled fewer than 4,000 votes in the constituency last April, is not regarded as a serious contender. For Mr John Major the stakes are still higher. Apart from the obvious psychological blow, a defeat would reduce the government's Commons majority from 21 to 19. With several Tory MPs now 'semi-detached' from the government as a result of the row over Maastricht, its 'reliable' majority on many issues is already in single figures. Mr Paddy Ashdown, who yesterday launched his party's campaign for the local elections with a prediction that it would win a record number of seats, said Newbury had the opportunity to 'speak for Britain' in rejecting the government's policies. Mr Ashdown rejected Conservative charges that his party had established informal pacts with Labour, insisting that no deals had been struck at local or at national level. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said yesterday that he had asked for a report on the withdrawal of some Labour candidates in Berkshire in an apparent attempt to help the Liberal Democrats. Prospective candidates named for the by-election so far: Julian Davidson (C), David Rendel (Lib Dem), Steve Billcliffe (Lab), Jim Wallis (Green), Dr Alan Sked (Anti-Federalist), Colin Palmer (21st Century party), Lord David Sutch (Monster Raving Loony 30 Years party). General election result, April 1992: Mrs Chaplin (C) 37,135; David Rendel (Liberal Democrat) 24,778; Richard Hall (Lab) 3,962; Jim Wallis (Green) 539. Unemployment has risen five times faster in Conservative-controlled counties than in their Labour counterparts, Labour claimed yesterday in its local election campaign. Launching a survey on the 'success' of Labour councils in protecting companies and jobs, Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow chief Treasury secretary, said that Labour had promoted economic development and attracted inward investment. Labour said the jobless total in the last four years had risen 193 per cent in Tory-controlled counties against an average of 37 per cent in counties under Labour control.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia and the United States now have no fundamental  differences on problems of an Arab-Israeli settlement, Russia's  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated after his meeting in  Geneva with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. In the  past week Moscow was the center of the Middle East peace  process, he said: it was visited by PLO leader Yasir `Arafat and  Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Now Washington is, as it  were, taking over the baton from us, and it is very important  for our actions to be coordinated, Kozyrev stressed. The  Russian minister had in mind the visit by the U.S. Secretary of  State to the Near East, which starts today. Christopher will  visit Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Syria.</p>

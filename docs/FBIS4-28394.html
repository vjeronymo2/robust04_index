			<p>BFN     [Text] Former Young Turk Leader Manun Rupkhachon has been  officially reinstated in the military with the rank of  major-general and will return as a staff officer attached to the  Defence Minister, a Government House source disclosed yesterday.    The source said the Office of His Majesty's Principal  Private  Secretary has approved the Government's proposal for the  reinstatement of Mr. Manun who was sacked after the now-defunct  National Peace-keeping Council seized power from the Chatchai  Chunhawan government in the February 23, 1991 coup .    Mr. Manun, then staff officer attached to Gen. Chatchai, who  was also defence minister, was dismissed on June 12 of the same  year for desertion after the former Young Turk leader  disappeared.    "I feel delighted hearing the news and deeply appreciate the  Government's push for the reinstatement," said Mr. Manun, adding  that he was happy to finally get justice.    He said he has not yet been officially informed by the  Government of the reinstatement. However, a number of his  colleagues including Deputy Defence Minister Maj-Gen Sombat  Rotphothong and ex-Phalang Tham Party leader Maj-Gen Chamlong  Simuang had already congratulated him.    Mr. Manun, 57, said he would continue to serve in the  military until his retirement in 1996.</p>

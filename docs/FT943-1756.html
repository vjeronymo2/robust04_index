			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fluctuating milk prices behind Golden Vale's fall to IPounds 4.4m Fluctuations in milk prices led to a 52 per cent drop in pre-tax profits at Golden Vale, the Irish diary group, although acquisitions lifted turnover at the interim stage. In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 9.14m to IPounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.37m). Operating profits fell from IPounds 10.03m to IPounds 6.61m, which included a reorganisation charge of Pounds 1.52m. Turnover increased by 39 per cent from IPounds 184.5m to IPounds 256.1m, including a IPounds 77.9m contribution from acquisitions. Sales in the dairy and food products division were down from IPounds 164m to IPounds 154.6m. Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive, reiterated a warning first issued in June that pre-tax profits for the full year would fall by a third. The share price, which shed 30 per cent after the first profits warning, closed up 2p at 57p yesterday. The fall in profits was caused by a number of factors, he said. The imbalance between the price paid to suppliers for milk and the market price of products caused a IPounds 2m drop in the contribution to operating profits from milk. However, production efficiencies and improved margins produced a IPounds 800,000 contribution from milk related products. An unchanged interim dividend of 0.6p was declared. Earnings per share fell from 4.66p to 2.3p.</p>

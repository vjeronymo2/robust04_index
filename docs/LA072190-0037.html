			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> VIET FISHERMEN FIGHT OLD LAW  </P> <P> A group of Bay Area Vietnamese fishermen asked a panel of federal judges Friday  to bar enforcement of a 200-year-old law that prevents them from earning a  living. In oral arguments before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,  attorneys challenged the use of the 1789 Jones Act to prevent resident aliens  legally living and working in the United States from doing many kinds of  commercial fishing. The law bars non-U.S. citizens from owning or captaining  boats of more than five net tons or more than about 35 feet long.  </P></p>

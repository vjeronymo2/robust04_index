			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MCCAFFREY HAS FOUR TOUCHDOWNS FOR STANFORD  </P> <P> Ed McCaffrey made sure he will have plenty of fond memories of his final game  at Stanford Stadium.  </P> <P> Stanford's wide receiver caught three touchdown passes and ran for another  score to lead the Cardinal to a 31-13 Pacific 10 Conference victory over  Washington State on Saturday.  </P> <P> In winning its final home game of the season, Stanford, 3-6 and 2-4 in the  conference, held Washington State (3-6, 2-4) to 183 total yards and looked  nothing like the team that was shut out, 31-0, at Oregon last week.  </P> <P> McCaffrey looked like the conference's premier receiver. In compiling 176  receiving yards, he needs only 161 yards in his final two games to become  Stanford's all-time leading receiver.  </P> <P> "It was very emotional for me to be playing my last game here and I wanted to  go out with a win," said McCaffrey, who caught touchdown passes of 69, 34 and  31 yards and scored on a two-yard run.  </P> <P> "This was the way I wanted to go out. I savored every minute of it." The  Cardinal offense racked up 500 yards in total offense to end a three-game  losing streak.  </P> <P> McCaffrey caught seven passes for a career-high 176 yards, the fourth-highest  total in Stanford history. His four touchdowns were also a single-game career  high.  </P> <P> "Ed just played a super game," said Stanford quarterback Jason Palumbis, who  completed 23 of 30 passes for 353 yards and three touchdowns. "He's a great  receiver."  </P> <P> Washington State quarterback Drew Bledsoe completed only eight of 26 passes for  64 yards before being replaced by Aaron Garcia late in the game. The Cougars  netted 81 yards in 27 carries.  </P> <P> After Washington State took a 10-0 lead on a 42-yard field goal by Jason Hanson  and a two-yard run by Paul Carr, the disappointments began for the Cougars.  </P> <P> Stanford scored 17 consecutive points in the final nine minutes of the second  quarter to take a 17-10 lead. In the third quarter, Stanford increased its lead  to 24-10 when Palumbis threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to McCaffrey.  </P> <P> With 4:53 left in the quarter, Palumbis and McCaffrey teamed up again, this  time for a 31-yard touchdown and Stanford led, 31-10.  </P> <P> Arizona State 34, Oregon State 9 -- Kelvin Fisher rushed for 121 yards and two  touchdowns in 18 carries and safety Nathan LaDuke returned one of his two  interceptions a school-record 95 yards for another score as the Sun Devils  ended a five-game losing streak by beating the Beavers at Tempe, Ariz.  </P> <P> The Sun Devils (3-5, 1-4) avoided tying the school record for most consecutive  losses, six, set in 1929.  </P> <P> Oregon State (1-8, 1-4) was held to Jamie Burke's three field goals.  </P> <P> Arizona State led 10-6 at halftime on Paul Justin's 10-yard touchdown pass to  Eric Guliford with 6:35 left and Steve Rausch's 50-yard field goal as time  expired.  </P> <P> Linebacker Brett Wallerstedt's interception at the Oregon State 37 set up the  touchdown.  </P> <P> Mike Richey's 23-yard field goal made it 13-6 with 8:03 remaining in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Fisher scored on a 16-yard run 36 seconds later, one play after LaDuke's  interception and 26-yard return.  </P> <P> LaDuke's 95-yard return with 5:32 remaining in the game broke the previous  school record of 93 yards, set in 1985 by Jeff Joseph.  </P> <P> Justin, in his second game back since suffering a separated left shoulder Sept.  29, completed 10 of 22 passes for 97 yards with one interception.  </P></p>

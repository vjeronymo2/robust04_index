			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 25 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Canadian Prime  Minister Jean Chretien today congratulated Mexico on its entry  into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD). He announced that he asked the business sector in his  country to carry on with their investment plans for Mexico.    During a news conference at the Canadian Embassy in Mexico  City at the end of his three-day visit, Chretien said: "Mexico's  entry into the OECD is a sign of the country's progress, which  has been recognized by the organization's member countries as  well as other nations." He announced that he had called upon  members of the Canadian business sector to continue with their  investments in Mexico because there is economic and political  stability, despite the murder of the government's presidential  candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.    Chretien indicated that he made the appeal during a meeting  this morning with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. He told the  entrepreneurs to remain calm and to continue with their  investment plans for Mexico "in order to contribute to the  growth of the economy and democracy." He made a similar appeal  to the exhibiters at Canada Expo 94, which is the largest  commercial exhibition ever organized for a foreign country.  There are about 430 companies participating in the event, which  opened on Monday in Mexico City. He said that Mexico is a stable  country and that "what has impressed me the most is that the  authorities and the people have remained calm following the  tragic death of Colosio, and no violence has occurred despite  the deep consternation."    He denied that his country had granted financial aid to  Mexico, but stressed that he is willing to do so if Mexico  requests it.    Regarding the upcoming general election in Mexico, currently  set for 21 August, Chretien said that if Mexico requests  observers or assistance Canada will respond.    Chretien said that his first official visit to Canada had  been successful. He reported progress regarding the talks with  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to define the concepts of  subsidies and dumping within the NAFTA framework. "Mexico and  Canada are not strong enough to face the United States alone,"  he said, "therefore we need more countries to join NAFTA to  balance out the situation."    He reported that he had expressed his will to President  Salinas to resolve the Canadian trade balance deficit with  Mexico, which is approximately $1.5 billion. He also offered to  open an office for the state-owned Mexican Petroleum in Calgary,  Alberta, to sell its services and technology. Chretien made  other proposals, such as a firm agreement under which the  Canadian Cameco Corporation would sell uranium to Mexico for its  nuclear power plant in Laguna Verde, Veracruz, in addition to  the fuel is now supplies.    Chretien left Mexico City just after midday to go to a  Caribbean beach resort for a two-day rest with his wife.</p>

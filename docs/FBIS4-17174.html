			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report by from St. </F> Petersburg by M. Velikoselskiy and Ye. Alekseyev, identified by  caption]    [Text] Not many visitors to this museum in St. Petersburg  have been able to see the entire exhibition. Despite the fact  that only specialists are admitted to the exhibition halls of  the Russian Scientific Center of Applied Chemistry, it takes a  special permit for some doors to be opened. Old women living  nearby claim that the atom bomb itself was built here.    In actual fact the State Institute of Applied Chemistry was  and is working on other problems, also mainly of a defense  nature. Engine fuel for space rockets from Gagarin's Vostok to  the Buran has been developed here.    However, in recent years the share of orders from the  military-industrial complex has totaled less than half of the  Institute's orders. Now there is not enough money to implement  ideas, equipment is not being updated, and specialists are  leaving. Unless the situation improves, this unique scientific  center will become a subsidiary of its own museum, and no new  generation of would-be Russian space travelers is likely to  blast off to remote galaxies.</p>

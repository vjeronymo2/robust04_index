			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CITY FORBIDS RELEASE OF EMPLOYEE NAMES  </P> <P> City Council members who release the addresses of city employees for private  and political use can now be slapped with a misdemeanor charge under an  ordinance the council approved Monday night.  </P> <P> Councilman Richards L. Norton, who introduced the ordinance, said the new law  protects the privacy of city employees.  </P> <P> The council approved the ordinance 6 to 1, despite vigorous opposition from  Norton's nemesis, Councilman Daniel E. Griset, who had called the ordinance "a  cute political ploy."  </P> <P> Griset protested that the restriction was too narrow and would make common  criminals out of council members. If found guilty of violating the ordinance,  council members could face a $600 fine.  </P> <P> City employees are already protected by the state law, which prohibits the  release of confidential information about employees, Griset said.  </P> <P> The proposal stems from a dispute between Norton and Griset, who were competing  for a council seat in the 1988 election, over whether the city could legally  release the addresses of its employees. Griset had sent letters to about 300  police officers, decrying the police union's endorsement of Norton.  </P> <P> The ordinance prohibits the release of addresses and telephone numbers from  personnel records by city council members for private, business, or political  use.

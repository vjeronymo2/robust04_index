			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / University forms crisis group THE University of Wales has set up a 10-man committee under Sir Melvin Rosser, a retired chartered accountant, to look at its future structure. The move follows sharp disagreement over the shape of the university in the wake of government funding changes. Proposals by Sir John Meurig Thomas, deputy pro-chancellor, to sharpen the university's federal structure were attacked by the heads of several colleges amid accusations that Sir John was seeking to establish a tighter central bureaucracy. Sir John said last year that flaws existed in the way the university operated. 'We now have a wonderful opportunity to take a federal university, which is not really functioning as one, in a proper federal direction.' That produced an outcry from the heads of the colleges and it was decided to refer the matter of reorganisation and the relationship of the university to other higher education institutes to a committee.</p>

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Uncertain Dow keeps to narrow range Wall Street US share prices remained stuck in a narrow range, reflecting investor uncertainty about the outlook for the economy, corporate earnings and domestic equities, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.60 lower at 3,282.41. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also a shade lower at the close, down 0.29 at 403.41, while the Nasdaq composite index finished 0.33 lower at 547.87. Volume on the NYSE was light at 155.6m shares. Although the Dow fell 10 points in the opening minutes, the market soon settled into the pattern established this week: every time shares fall far, buyers step in to bring them back to earlier levels, and every time shares rise substantially, a wave of selling quickly erodes most of the gains. The day's only economic news - a 0.3 per cent increase in personal income and a 0.5 per cent rise in personal consumption during May - had little impact. Recent indicators of economic weakness have boosted hopes for an interest rate cut, but no-one is confident enough to buy stocks in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will ease policy. Total was the most heavily traded stock, rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 3/8 in turnover of 4m shares after the international energy group launched a secondary offering of 14.8m of its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at a price of Dollars 22.23 each. The ADRs were sold by the French government. Also in the oil and gas sector, Offshore Pipelines plunged Dollars 3 1/8 , or more than 20 per cent, to Dollars 10 3/4 on a warning from the company that fourth-quarter revenues and earnings will be short of expectations, and Oceaneering International firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 13 1/2 after the broking house Robinson-Humphrey added the stock to its 'best buys' list, citing strong earnings momentum. British Petroleum ADRs were heavily traded, falling Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 48 3/8 as investors continued to react negatively to news of the ousting of Mr Robert Horton, the group's chairman and chief executive. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 66 3/4 in turnover of 4.4m shares after two Wall Street broking houses downgraded their ratings for the stock. Dean Witter Reynolds lowered its rating from 'buy' to 'neutral/hold' and Kidder Peabody reduced its grade in a similar fashion. The analysts are worried about the effect of price competition in the market for Windows software, and slowing demand for products in Europe on Microsoft's earnings. Sequoia Systems fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 in active trading after the company said that it expected to record fourth-quarter and full-year earnings 'significantly below' the high end of analysts' forecasts. Canada IN TORONTO share prices closed slightly higher in moderate trading. Based on preliminary data, the composite index rose 12.78 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 3,351.33. On the week, the composite index was almost unchanged, ending up less than one point. Advances today led declines by 298 to 225. Trading volume of 24.718m shares was below Thursday's 36.495m shares, and trading value was CDollars 278.6m against CDollars 387.1m.</p>

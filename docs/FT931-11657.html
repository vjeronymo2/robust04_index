			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Bophuthatswana - the slow trek to inevitable oblivion: Patti Waldmeir finds little future for the homeland in any ANC-dominated South African government THERE is no logic to Bophuthatswana except the terrible logic of apartheid. That is the argument made by black anti-apartheid leaders who want to see this testy little black 'homeland' abolished, and its territory reincorporated into a new South Africa blind to both colour and ethnicity. They argue that 'Bop', as it is disparagingly known, is a creation of apartheid and should disappear along with its creator; that it was granted independence by an illegitimate regime in Pretoria (the only government ever to recognise it); and that there can be no argument for continued autonomy. The reality, as always in South Africa, is not so simple. For as the homeland's President Lucas Mangope points out, 'Bophuthatswana cannot and will not be wished away. 'For us to change our constitutional dispensation, the change will have to be for something better or alternatively a future which at least is as good.' The crux of his argument is economic: Bophuthatswana, a nation of 2m Tswana people which gained nominal independence from Pretoria in 1977, has more to lose economically from reincorporation into South Africa than any other homeland. Economic growth in recent years has exceeded that in almost every other independent African country: the Bop economy grew at a real annual rate of 18.4 per cent in 1985-89, which compares well with even the best-run African economies and far exceeds the performance of other independent homelands (Transkei grew by 3.1 per cent, Ciskei by 7.4 per cent, and Venda by 11.4 per cent over the same period). Critics argue that, as South Africa' best-endowed homeland, it is bound to be the most prosperous - Bophuthatswana is home to one of the world's largest platinum producers, and its proximity to the industrial heartland near Johannesburg has made it the only homeland with any significant industrial development. They ignore the fact that, on a continent which scarcely distinguishes itself by the quality of economic management, Bophuthatswana clearly excels. But however strong Bop's economic argument for remaining independent, the politics of the new South Africa will win out in the end. Bop officials continue to pay lip service to their demands for self-determination as a homeland for the Tswana people, and back their claims with historical arguments about how the British split their nation in 1910, making part of it a crown protectorate (Bechuanaland, now independent Botswana) and treacherously ceding the rest to the new South African republic. They argue that Bophuthatswana's independence from Pretoria only redressed this historical wrong. Government officials - including Mr Mangope's eminence grise, Mr Rowan Cronje, former minister in the Rhodesian government of Mr Ian Smith and now Bophuthatswana's minister of state affairs, defence and civil aviation - insist Bop could 'go it alone' as an independent state after South Africa is unified. But realistically, the homeland could not survive with a hostile neighbour in the republic: along with the subsidy, Bop would lose another quarter of its budget if Pretoria cut off payments from the Southern African Customs Union, and remittances from half the homeland labour force, which works in South Africa. The ANC, for its part, makes clear that no such subtle methods would be used if it were in power: ANC officials say privately that they would 'finish Bop off' within days, if necessary through military means. Faced with the inevitability of reincorporation, Bop has shifted the focus of its political battle to demanding substantial regional autonomy in the new South Africa, in alliance with right-wing Afrikaners who dominate the western Transvaal and northern Cape regions, over which are strewn six of the seven separate bits of Bophuthatswana. As presently envisaged, Bop's dream of a 'TswanaBoereland' is unrealistic: it would cover a huge chunk of South Africa, including some of the best gold mines, and would jealously guard mining royalties, company and other taxes for the regional government. The ANC will grant only far more limited autonomy to this or any other region in the new South Africa, and a long battle lies ahead before a final deal. A recent Amnesty report concluded that the Bop authorities 'have continued to rely on their powers under security legislation to silence their opponents. Violent coercion has occurred through harassment, detention and torture of activists and use of excessive force against demonstrators'. In the end, Bophuthatswana must make its peace with the new South Africa and must make the best deal it can with the ANC; however stubbornly it clings to sovereignty - Bop recently opened its own information office in Latvia, of all places - its days of independence are surely numbered.</p>

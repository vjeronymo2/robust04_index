			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Fed confident of recovery but still ready to cut rates THE Federal Reserve believes it has done enough to revive the stagnant US economy but stands ready to cut interest rates again if growth fails to materialise, Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, indicated yesterday. He told bankers in San Antonio, Texas, that the central bank would 'if necessary, move to an increased degree of monetary ease'. However, he said he believed the monetary stimulus already in the pipeline would prove sufficient. On Wall Street, many analysts expect a small cut in short-term market rates  -now 4 per cent - within the next week or so. Many traders were surprised that the Fed failed to respond last week to much worse than expected employment figures for January. Non-farm payrolls fell 91,000 compared with an expected gain of about 30,000. The Fed, however, is thought to believe that last Friday's employment figures, which fluctuate markedly on a monthly basis, overstated the underlying weakness in the economy. It is sticking to its view that the economy is flat rather than declining. Fed officials are also encouraged by a revival of monetary growth in recent weeks, although some of the rebound reflects faulty seasonal adjustments. In recent testimony, Mr Greenspan rejected claims that monetary policy was ineffectual. He believes the central economic problem is the weakness of personal and corporate balance sheets caused by an excessive build-up of debt in the 1980s. Lower interest rates are providing direct relief by reducing debt service costs. They have also spurred higher equity and bond prices and thus encouraged the replacement of short-term debt by equity and bond issues. However, because the US has not faced balance sheet pressures of this kind for several generations, it is unclear how long the restructuring process will take. On several occasions, however, Mr Greenspan has indicated his belief that the bulk of the adjustment is probably complete. The Fed continues to expect a mild recovery in the spring. In speeches Mr Greenspan has said public anxiety about the economy is excessive in the light of hard data, which continues to be much less discouraging than in the recessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82. The unemployment rate of 7.1 per cent, for example, is far below its previous peaks. Fed officials believe the competitiveness of US industry has actually risen sharply in recent years. The turning point was the restructuring of manufacturing industry prompted by the strong dollar in the mid-1980s. Since then, US manufacturers have benefited from a combination of lower costs and rapid depreciation of the dollar.</p>

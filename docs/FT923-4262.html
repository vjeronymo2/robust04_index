			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / A welcome mat for the rental market: The British government is rethinking the merits of home ownership as property prices continue to fall After a decade in which increasing home ownership has been the flagship of UK housing policy, the government looks set for a significant switch in emphasis. Ministers have let it be known that they are contemplating incentives to revive the privately rented sector, with measures to encourage investment in rented property. The signals come from the Department of the Environment, where Sir George Young, the housing minister, is keen to reinvigorate private renting. The Treasury, which wants to improve the supply of housing without restarting an inflationary rise in house prices, is also said to be 'very receptive' to new ideas about renting. Stimulating the UK's privately rented sector would be no easy matter, however, given its apparently inexorable decline. From providing about 90 per cent of housing in 1900, the privately rented sector had shrunk to below 7.5 per cent by 1990. One factor behind the decline was the regulatory burden of rent controls and security of tenure for tenants. Another was the growth in owner-occupation, fuelled by tax breaks such as mortgage interest tax relief and exemption from capital gains tax. Mrs Thatcher's drive to sell council houses to their tenants, and her enthusiasm for home ownership, gave new momentum to the growth in owner-occupation throughout the 1980s. Increasingly, however, doubts have been raised about the emphasis placed on ever-rising levels of home ownership. Housing experts point out that the level in the UK - now approaching 70 per cent - is much higher than in most other European countries. This is matched by an abnormally small privately rented sector. Throughout most of Europe, up to 20 per cent of housing is privately rented, with the figure as high as 45 per cent in western Germany. In the US and Canada, it is more than 30 per cent. Economists argue that this imbalance between different types of tenure distorts the working of the British economy. 'It is economically efficient for young people to rent housing before they are settled, so that they can move easily,' says Alan Evans, professor of environmental economics at Reading University. 'Owner-occupation, almost as much as local authority housing, discourages mobility and slows down the adjustment and growth of the economy.' Two serious attempts were made towards the end of the last decade to stimulate private renting. The first was the 1988 Housing Act: for new lettings, this restricted tenants' rights and freed up rentals. The other was the extension of the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) to provide tax breaks for investors in housing for rent. The BES incentives had an immediate effect, with a plethora of schemes raising Pounds 800m to create more than 15,000 homes according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social affairs think tank. However, the tax breaks last only five years, at the end of which the homes are usually sold. The boost to private renting, therefore, is only temporary - one reason why the government has now announced that the BES is to end next year. The 1988 Housing Act had a less immediate effect, partly because many potential landlords feared that a future Labour government might reimpose rent controls and restore tenants' security of tenure (although Labour denied that it would take any retrospective action). But there is some evidence that the deregulation of private tenancies has begun to reverse the decline in the level of private renting. Last year, for the first time in a decade, there was no decrease in the proportion of privately rented homes, and managing agents report record interest among potential landlords and tenants. Sir George is reluctant to claim success at this early stage. He concedes that the slump in the housing market has led many who cannot sell their homes to rent them out. Falling house prices have also increased demand, as many first-time buyers decide to rent rather than risk buying and losing their deposit. The pause in the decline comes at a time when Sir George has been pressing forward with initiatives to stimulate the private rental sector. These include the rent-a-room scheme in this year's Finance Act, which allows householders who let out rooms in their homes to earn rent of up to Pounds 3,250 a year tax-free. He is also trying to encourage shopowners to rent out the flats over their premises. Sir George is particularly bullish about a scheme to use housing associations to tempt financial institutions back into rented property. He believes that the institutions are currently reluctant to invest in housing for rent because they do not want to manage the lettings. Housing associations, with their generally good reputation as landlords, could act as managing agents, 'taking the hassle out renting', as Sir George puts it. Critics feel that Sir George's enthusiasm for such schemes avoids the real issue behind the absence of investment in rented housing: it is a poor investment proposition. 'Without the large subsidy currently provided by the BES, it just doesn't stack up,' says Mr Robert Lo of Johnson Fry, the most prolific promoter of BES property schemes. One company which has tried to make private renting stack up is Quality Street, set up in 1987 with finance from Nationwide building society. Mr Paul Mugnaioni, chairman - and formerly housing director for Glasgow - hoped to demonstrate that it was possible to be a 'blue-chip' private landlord, offering high-quality property for rent with first-class management service. Five years on, with 2,000 homes built and another 1,000 under management, Mr Mugnaioni believes that the company has achieved the spirit of those objectives. But he has been able to build far fewer homes than hoped because the returns are not high enough to attract investors. 'There's a shortfall of about 30 per cent between the returns we can earn and what the investor wants,' he says. 'We can't provide good accommodation at rents below Pounds 100 a week without the sort of subsidy which owner-occupiers enjoy.' Mr Mugnaioni suggests a package of tax measures to bridge the gap: sheltering investment in rented property from corporation tax; exempting it from capital gains tax; and lifting the burden of VAT. A similar approach is advocated by Mr Neville Lee of the Association of Residential Letting Agents. He wants tax allowances for the capital and conversion costs of residential property and a two-year tax holiday on rent from offices converted into homes. To pay for such tax breaks, Mr Mugnaioni and Mr Lee both advocate redirecting some of the Pounds 6bn spent on mortgage interest tax relief into encouraging private rentals. But while there is plenty of money going into subsidising homeowners, now is not a good time to raid the owner-occupier piggy bank to encourage private rentals. Removing mortgage interest tax relief would almost certainly further depress house prices, and be politically unsaleable given that up to 1m owners have negative equity in their homes. Yet if the economists are right about the negative effects of the weakness of the privately rented sector, some way needs to be found of shifting the subsidy from owner-occupiers to private tenants. At the very least, a replacement is needed for the BES, which offers incentives to those who invest long-term in property for rent.</p>

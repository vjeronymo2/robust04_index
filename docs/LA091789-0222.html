			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> PART ONE: GETTING AHEAD;  </P> <P> SELECTING A TRADE SCHOOL;  </P> <P> A LITTLE HOMEWORK CAN HELP IN FINDING ONE THAT FITS  </P> <P> The high school counselor tells you to go to college. Mom wants you to be a  doctor. And Dad says he doesn't care what you do as long you're happy, but,  gee, wouldn't law school be terrific?  </P> <P> Well, no, you tell the folks. What you really want to do is deal cards, pour  drinks, take care of kids (and get paid for it), fix computers, cut hair, drive  a truck, cook (and get paid for it), groom pets, build boats or fix musical  instruments.  </P> <P> But Stanford University won't teach you to be a nanny. And UCLA doesn't offer a  major in tending bar. So what's an aspiring student of any age to do? Call the  local trade school, of course.  </P> <P> California has an estimated 2,000 technical and vocational schools -- some 400  of which are accredited -- schools that teach everything from air conditioning  repair to X-ray technology. But not all trade schools are created equal, and  court cases have shown that some are better avoided than enrolled in.  </P> <P> Still, trade schools "have been filling a void, supplying services that people  have not been able to find in other sectors of higher education for years,"  said Christopher Davis, spokesman for the National Assn. of Trade and Technical  Schools.  </P> <P> Today, more than 2 million students attend such schools. The average course is  10 months long, and the average cost for that 10-month course is $3,800. In the  last decade, the number of accredited schools represented by Davis' group has  risen to 1,300 from 550. Industrywide, Davis said, enrollment has increased  about 14% in the past two years.  </P> <P> "College tuition is increasing faster than inflation, and we think that may be  a reason why more students are turning to our schools," he said.  </P> <P> Students like Lavene Banks, who is currently a loan officer at the American  Federation of Television and Radio Artists-Screen Actors Guild Credit Union in  Los Angeles. Before Banks enrolled in the Banking Institute, she had a  low-paying job as a supermarket courtesy clerk.  </P> <P> Banks finished the four-month course, which is given in the former Union Bank  headquarters building at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue.  Three days before she graduated from the 13-year-old school, she got her first  job -- as a bank teller for the credit union. Soon after that, she was promoted  to her current position.  </P> <P> Banks' experience with technical school was a good one, in part because she  checked out the school carefully before plunking down her $2,515 for tuition,  books and registration.  </P> <P> According to Davis, students looking for private technical schools should  follow a few important rules:  </P> <P> * Students should contact several schools, request information and carefully  review the catalogue.  </P> <P> * They should visit the school and tour the entire facility. If, for example,  the institution says it teaches computer repair, it should actually have  computers on campus.  </P> <P> * Students should make it a point to talk to past and present students and  employers who hire the school's graduates. They should find out what employers  think of their new workers and what kind of starting salaries they offer.  </P> <P> * Students should make sure that, if they drop out of the school, a reasonable  percentage of their tuition is refundable -- for example, 75% if they make it  through only a quarter of the program.  </P> <P> * And they should make sure that the school is accredited and licensed by the  state.  </P> <P> "It's a question of promise versus performance," Davis said. "Students should  find out what the school's promises are and if the school actually makes good."  </P> <P> But Elena Ackel, special projects attorney for the Legal Aid Foundation of Los  Angeles, gives a different kind of advice to students looking for private  vocational schools: Don't go.  </P> <P> Ackel receives an average of five complaints a week from students who say they  have been defrauded by such institutions -- ones where a different teacher  taught each day, or where students who dropped out were not refunded their  money.  </P> <P> When it comes to vocational education, Ackel said: "The suggestion that I give  is to go to Los Angeles Trade Tech or an L.A. community college."  </P> <P> But if you insist on attending a private trade school, this is what Ackel  counseled: "You shouldn't train for something that requires no training. . . .  If you do, you're being sucked in for a lot of stuff you don't need."  </P> <P> Kristin Kleppe, owner and president of the Banking Institute, takes great  exception to such criticisms of trade and technical schools and contends that  bad publicity does more to damage students than to protect them.  </P> <P> "If consumers understood what questions to ask and how to research schools, I  think they'd be more willing to take risks and find success that's potentially  there for them," Kleppe said.  </P> <P> Sybil Henry, a free-lance fashion designer, took that risk in 1981 when she  enrolled in the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Although the Fashion Institute offers some basic college classes in its  curriculum, its major mission is to teach students about the garment industry  and then get them jobs. That's just what it did for Henry, who graduated in  1983 and has made a living designing women's and children's sportswear ever  since.  </P> <P> "I had basic skills, natural ability," Henry said. "But they needed to be  refined, molded, made marketable. . . . I loved the school. It gave me all the  foundation I needed to be a professional and compete in the industry."  </P></p>

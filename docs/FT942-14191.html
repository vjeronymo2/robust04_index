			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Irrelevance of share options Sir, I have read with interest the various articles and letters over the past few months on the subject of share options. Although the coverage has been virtually comprehensive, there are a couple of vital points which have been overlooked. The first is that share options have for some years been cynically regarded as 'a gamble to which executives were entitled'. I think it is now questionable whether, in fact, share options are necessarily any more a relevant method of reward. They obviously had a place when executives had been highly taxed and found it almost impossible to amass capital during their business career but now, like long contracts and over-generous severance payments, they may no longer deserve their place. Second, if parity between executives and shareholders in the ownership of their company is sought, then perhaps the old-fashioned route of loans to purchase shares at full value and freedom to sell and buy to suit the executive's personal circumstances might not be a bad way of ensuring involvement. Outstanding company performance may be better rewarded by cash bonuses paid over the long term and directly and visibly linked to that performance.

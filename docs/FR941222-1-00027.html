			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Coverage by Other Regulatory Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Listing decisions can be strongly influenced by the effect of other regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on the wastestreams involved. Where another Federal or State program or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA requirements clearly will provide the type of control needed to eliminate the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with a certain type of waste management, a RCRA listing may be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary or redundant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Other Federal or State programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If other Federal or State programs clearly regulate risk associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream, listing may not be necessary to eliminate risk. For example, if the Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Air and Radiation within EPA has issued an NESHAP to control emissions of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent, it may be unnecessary to consider risk from inhalation of that constituent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making listing determinations. In some cases, another regulatory program may be in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of developing such regulatory requirements. If this program is under statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements or Court Order, EPA may consider these regulatory requirements to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forthcoming and, in some cases, may defer to them in listing determinations, even where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such regulatory coverage is several years away. If this program is under no statutory or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal deadline, no deference typically will be given to projected future regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage from other programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Waste Volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Waste volume is, in fact, part of a risk-level calculation. Risk is projected based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the volume of waste involved. However, volume of waste is also a factor EPA may consider when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the projected risk falls in a marginal risk range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Evidence of Co-occurrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virtually all wastestreams EPA assesses are complex mixtures of constituents. Where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible, the Agency calculates potential risk for all measured pollutants. Where more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one risk value for carcinogenicity is calculated, concern about overall wastestream effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases and the Agency will consider that risk additive. However, where sampling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis data show compelling evidence that the constituents cannot or do not occur together in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastestream or at the receptor, the Agency generally will only consider the risk associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with individual constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Damage Cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For each listing determination, EPA seeks data on damage cases. These are cases in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some prior waste management practice has resulted in environmental harm. Where there has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a clear case of harm, the data suggest the management of that waste has already damaged human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health or the environment in some way, and that such damage could occur again. Depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number and severity of the damage cases and the potential for these damages to happen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> again, adverse damage cases may provide a ``stand alone'' reason for listing the waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where damage cases appear to contradict the risk analysis, EPA will try to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason and use that assessment in the overall listing decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Unknown or Unquantified Risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Not all constituents in a complex wastestream can be analyzed for risk. Hazard data may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be available either directly or through mechanisms such as structure/activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationships, or they may be in a form which is not considered usable by EPA. In the cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where some constituents are present but no risk levels can be assigned to them, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers the potential for these constituents to be hazardous. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, use of these additional factors is not limited to cases in which the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels fall between 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Pursuant to EPA's listing determination policy ``weight-of-evidence'' approach, the Agency will consider these factors, as appropriate, even where risk levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fall in the presumptive list or presumptive no-list levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Today's Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Summary of Today's Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Confidentiality Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The hazardous waste listings proposed here are based in part upon data claimed as confidential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by certain dye and pigment manufacturers. Although EPA intends to publish information derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these data claimed as confidential (to the extent relevant to the proposed listing), the Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to do so at the present time. Therefore, this proposed rule is being published without some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the information that supports the Agency's proposal. Where that information is missing from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> text, it is noted in the text. Whenever EPA is unable to include pertinent data in a table, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following statement appears in a footnote: ``Relevant data are not included at the present time due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to business confidentiality concerns.'' EPA is pursuing avenues to allow publication of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, and intends to supplement the public record prior to issuing a final listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

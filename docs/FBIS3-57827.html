			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pol Van Den Driessche: "Consultation Model Gets </F> a Second and Possibly Final Chance"]    [Text] Brussels, 28 Dec -- During the next two months  employers and unions must prove that the famous  interprofessional consultation is still meaningful, SP [Flemish  Socialist Party] Chairman Frank Vandenbroucke stated in a talk  concluding his political working year. Together they have a  second and probably last opportunity to speak, in an ambitious  way, about employment. For the SP leader, the precondition for  success is social partners' readiness to depart from cheap  cliches and "simplistic thought patterns." If the consultation  fails, they will also be responsible for the negative employment  results.    Vandenbroucke said that he had reason to look back with  satisfaction on the past political year. In particular his  party's major renewal, both structurally and substantially,  visibly pleases him. He has succeeded in overturning the SP's  almost fossilized structures and in gradually constructing a  modern, political membership party. He reminded listeners of  his successful referendum, in which more than 95,000 SP members  were given an opportunity to express their opinions, an  invitation which almost half of them accepted. "Did you know  that a few years ago we didn't even have a central members'  register?" Vandenbroucke quickly added.    Moreover, the recent party congress agreed to update the  contents of the traditional socialist message. "For a long time  social progress was equated with purely materialistic progress.  We broke with this vision, and now insist that social  emancipation also involves raising the quality of life and  society. Contrary to some opinions, this is very much a  message of and for the average Fleming, i.e., not just for  intellectuals."  <H5>  New Spring </H5>   The chairman concurs that the six hearings the SP organized  aroused enthusiasm primarily among intellectuals. "Possibly  this has more to do with the death of the culture of meetings  than with the rich contents. You cannot get average people out  of their homes any more for a meeting, only professionals still  make this effort."    The party leader went on to state that a new generation of  socialists was ready to embody this doctrine. "It is these  newcomers who made the success of the SP congress two weeks ago.  At the risk of forgetting names, I would point to the rich  contribution of people like Jan Peeters, Johan Vande Lanotte,  Leo Peeters, Renaat Landuyt, Anne Van Lancker, Carlos Lisabeth,  Dany Vandenbossche, and Francy Vanderwildt. They seem to be the  first blossoming buds announcing a new spring for us."    Vandenbroucke answered the question as to whether this  renewal would also be apparent in the list of candidates  prepared for the communal elections, with the statement that  local policies cannot be dictated from SP headquarters on  Brussels' Keizerslaan. "The local departments received a clear  suggestion from me to give the enlargement a chance in the  communal elections. In Mechelen and Ghent they have already  made the first moves in this direction. For me, the real test  only comes in December 1995, with the next parliamentary  elections."    He was not ready to give away much about the preparation of  the SP list of candidates for the June 1994 European elections.  "I wanted first of all to know whether the government would  survive. Now that I am certain, I am beginning my talks."    He recognizes that European Commissioner Karel van Miert in  first place would "be a particularly good thing, but, for  various reasons, this is not a simple matter." Insistent  questions as to whether he would head the list were brushed  aside with enigmatic smiles: "You'll hear about it, the question  is not that urgent yet."    We noted the same reserved attitude when the Vanvelthoven  affair was placed on the table. "We expect total integrity from  our mandataries. Louis [Vanvelthoven] [Former president of the  Flemish Council] acted consistently, I don't want to say  anything more about this." Vandenbroucke finds it very  irritating that this affair is mentioned in the same breath as  the SP scandals.    At the same time he appears very conscious of the problems  threatening the [Prime Minister] Dehaene cabinet if Deputy Prime  Minister Guy Coeme is pressed further into the corner by the  courts [for his alleged involvement in the Agusta helicopter  bribery case] and should this Walloon politician eventually  refuse to act upon this appropriately.  <H5>  Voting Rights </H5>   For Vandenbroucke, 1993 was the toughest year for Flemish  socialists since the split of the BSP (Belgian Socialist Party)  at the end of the seventies. "We continued to participate in the  government after an election defeat; the budget preparation and  control were difficult and demanded considerable effort; the  economy is doing particularly badly, forcing us to prepare a  crisis plan. Despite this we note that the opinions polls once  again give us a slight edge. Although it's not enough yet. At  the end of the government's term of office, we should end up at  our true level, a good 20 percent," the SP chairman  philosophized.    With his negative opinion on granting voting rights to  migrants, he was asked if he is not rejecting a number of  left-wing intellectuals, while some "brown thinking" supporters  consider him just a little "too flexible" when it comes to  foreigners? "I am in favor of votes for migrants via  naturalization, let's be clear on that. But arguing about this  right now plays only into the hands of the extremists and to the  disadvantage of the tolerant center."    A little later, Vandenbroucke openly recognized that his  participation in the "hand-in-hand" demonstration through  Antwerp did him no electoral good. This by no means implied  that he will not appear in future antiracist demonstrations.    The socialist leader is counting on the government to  implement its crisis plan with a triple aim: to prove the  prophets of employment doom wrong, to achieve the reform of the  pension system and health insurance, and to give solid results  by 1995 in the fight against fraud.    At the same time, the Flemish Government received a  compliment in this festive period from Vandenbroucke for its  recent decision to encourage the distribution of work by giving  the so-called second check. "I hope that the federal social  partners will take equally creative paths, in order to proceed  to the necessary redistribution."    Almost passionately he went on to add: "I would ask the ABVV  [Flemish wing of Socialist Trade Union] and the ACV [Flemish  wing of Christian Trade Union] to show, after the new year, that  the unemployed are as important for them as the employed.  Indeed it is high time that we spoke a little less about what  is impossible, and a little more about what is possible?"  <H5>  VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] </H5>   Finally, Vandenbroucke has no plans to soften the discussion  about what future we want for Flanders and the Flemings. As a  result he continues to challenge the VLD to disclose its  alternatives. "Moreover I notice a steadily increasing  similarity between the VLD and the `Reaganomics' of the early  eighties: the relating of totally unbelievable statistics to  ideological coherence, i.e. only the rich fare better. In  concrete terms, the middle class is entitled to hear from the  VLD how much it is really going to cost them."    In 1994, politically interested Flanders will therefore  again  be able to witness several rounds of powerful verbal-ideological  fighting between the SP and the VLD. Just as long as this does  not become personal, it is -- at times -- even very interesting.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Saatchi may quit if name dropped Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's non-executive directors want to change the name of the advertising group's holding company, but have been warned by Mr Maurice Saatchi, the group's founder and executive chairman, that he may resign if his surname is dropped. The issue is likely to come to a head on Friday, when the board is scheduled to discuss a possible change in group identity and other proposals put to the company by a group of dissident shareholders. 'The board is completely split on whether to force Maurice out,' said one Saatchi director. Saatchi non-executives - including Sir Peter Walters, SmithKline Beecham chairman; Mr Paul Girolami, former Glaxo Holdings chairman; Professor Ted Levitt of Harvard University; and financier Mr Clive Gibson - gave their views in favour of a name change at a meeting last week. However, a formal vote to retain the Saatchi name only for use by operating subsidiaries has not yet been taken. Many Saatchi employees and directors back the argument put forward by rival advertising group WPP that the holding company brand name should be different from the operating subsidiaries' brand names. They argue that the development of those subsidiaries without 'Saatchi' in their name is stifled because when they win a client, the success is often described as a 'Saatchi' achievement. Mr Saatchi has the backing of a majority of executive directors for his continuation as chairman. However there are only four executive directors, including Mr Saatchi, compared with seven non-executives. Executives immediately below board level are split on whether Mr Saatchi is an asset as chairman. Saatchi's five biggest shareholders, controlling a third of the shares, have proposed to the board that it should drop a plan to give Mr Saatchi a Pounds 5m option package, that it should change its name and that it should consider asking Mr Saatchi to stand down as holding company chairman to become chairman of the operating subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising. They are threatening to requisition an extraordinary meeting to put the issue to a shareholder vote, if the board fails to do what they want. Lex, Page 18</p>

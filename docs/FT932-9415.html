			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Heron Intl restructuring is 'flawed' HERON International's financial restructuring is flawed and carries a 'fairly high probability of default' according to one representative of the property group's bond holders. However, he accepted that the proposed refinancing, explained to bondholders in a 219-page document, would have to go ahead. The group is already surviving on the goodwill of its banks, which have had to put up further new money. If there was a suggestion that the restructuring plan had to be renegotiated, he said, the banks would withdraw that support. In the document Price Waterhouse, the accountants, say that insolvency proceedings would produce a lower pay-out to creditors and long delays in payments. The document sets a final date for the restructuring to be complete by July 31. Creditor meetings will be held at the end of June. The business plan underlying the refinancing of Heron's debts, which totalled Pounds 1.7bn in November, when sterling's weakness increased the value of foreign currency borrowings, depends on a recovery in the property market. The bond holder representative said that the structure of senior debt, junior debt and equity was meaningless since servicing the senior debt alone requires an improvement in the property market. He said the different categories were no more than 'entitlements to whatever there is'. The document details Heron's losses for the year to March 1992, when net losses of Pounds 693.1m produced negative net assets of Pounds 328m. On a pro-forma basis the restructuring would give the group net assets of Pounds 12m. However, the document also says, 'further material reductions in values will need to be incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended March 31 1993.' Also net assets would fall again because interest charges exceeded operating income and the fall in the pound had increased the foreign debt. Four pages of the document are devoted to 27 legal cases Heron is involved in. These include a Dollars 83m (Pounds 53.9m) claim from the owner of Pima, a US savings and loan company taken over by a government agency in 1990. The suit is against Mr Gerald Ronson, Heron's chairman, and other directors and managers, but Heron has indemnified them. Heron's housebuilding subsidiary is being sued by purchasers of properties in a Docklands development. They say council tenants were housed in the development reducing the value of their homes.</p>

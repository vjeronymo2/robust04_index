			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Canal paths used for fibre-optic grid Competition for long-distance telecommunications traffic was stepped up yesterday by the launch of a company using Britain's canal tow-paths to build a fibre-optic network. Fibreway says it is the first company engaged solely in the wholesaling of capacity to other operators. It will offer no services directly to end-users, but will sell capacity to the growing array of entrants to the UK market. Construction of a link between Edinburgh and Glasgow is under way, with others planned in the Midlands. With more than 2,000 miles of canal available, the potential exists to create a network linking most of the UK's biggest cities. The three existing long-distance networks are owned by companies which also provide telecoms services to consumers. They are British Telecommunications, Mercury, and Energis, which will launch a service next month. Fibreway's largest shareholder is GPT, the telecoms equipment joint venture between GEC and Siemens, the German group. It is acting in partnership with British Waterways. Mr Gerry Boothroyd, Fibreway's director, said that initial investment would be in the 'tens of millions', with network construction determined by demand. Cable companies building local networks in urban areas are keen to see a diversity of long-distance operators. Mr Eugene Connell, head of UK operations for Nynex, the US group making significant UK cable investments, expressed 'serious interest' in the new operator as a means of linking Nynex's franchises in different parts of the country. The idea of using canal tow-paths for a telecoms network has been in the air for several years, but appeared to founder two years ago when Sprint, the US long-distance carrier, dropped plans to build its own UK network. The railways are already used for telecoms. Part of Mercury's long-distance network runs alongside the tracks, and British Rail's own telecoms subsidiary is preparing to offer a service to outside operators.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: Misleading view on Mexico's exchange rate policy Sir, I was disturbed by your suggestion ('Mexico gambles on parity with dollar', January 23) that I believe the Mexican finance minister, Pedro Aspe, is courting disaster with his exchange rate policy. I have never said such a thing. I have long been critical of the policy pursued by the previous government in Chile of freezing the exchange rate in nominal terms. This created a serious crisis because of the very slow convergence between domestic and international interest rates. This in turn made Chilean producers lose their competitive position and suffer enormous losses and bankruptcies, and caused a collapse of a large part of the financial system. I have discussed these views at length with my friend Pedro Aspe and other Latin American finance ministers, so they are well known and widely shared by my colleagues. Your comment gives a wrong impression about my opinion of Mexico's economic policy. I have enormous admiration for what President Salinas and his team have achieved and will continue to achieve in the economic field. I think Mexico is implementing a set of economic policies which are not only sound but appropriate to Mexico's exceptional circumstances. Our own economic policy is very similar to theirs and the results in both cases are very solid. Mexico has not fixed the exchange rate but is following exchange rate rules fully consistent with the excellent condition of its balance of payments. And if they were to fix the exchange rate in the future, it would not be my role to comment on it, because each country has specific circumstances that may justify such a policy. In the late 1970s, the policy did not work in my country; that does not mean it will not work in other circumstances, for example in present day Argentina. Alejandro Foxley, minister of finance, Republic of Chile</p>

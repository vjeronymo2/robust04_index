Early in 1993, under an illegal plan hatched by a certain  Hong Kong businessman surnamed Ning, the general manager of the  Qinzhou City Goods and Materials Company, Pei Yuchun [5952 5940  2504], the manager of the first corporate trade department  subordinate to the Qinzhou branch of the People's Bank of China,  Chen Zuheng [7115 4371 0077], the manager of the Beihai City  Industrial Supply and Marketing Corporation, Luo Peng [5012  7720], and the manager of the Liuzhou City Foreign Economic  Trade Corporation's Chemical Branch Corporation, Zeng Biao [2582  1753], in order to provide individuals and their own units with  exorbitant profits, and using relevant stipulations under which  China allows commodity trade to be carried out with a number of  countries, adopted a falsely signed commodity contract, and  bogus reporting of a production site as a method to avoid  customs inspections, and without restraint engaged in automobile  smuggling criminal activity. Without authorization, they used  the name of the Liuzhou Foreign Economic and Trade Corporation,  and plotted to sign false barter contracts for 1389.98 tons of  zinc ingots and 294 tons of zinc oxide, respectively, in  exchange for importing 686 and 112 "Modern" brand small  automobiles. They falsely reported the vehicles' original place  of production, keeping clear of the state import export  licensing administration, and obtained a customs signed and  issued "import export commodity tax free certificate." This  resulted in the clinching of a deal for 798 smuggled automobiles  which passed the border with no trouble. In order to defray the  costs of the transaction, the Qinzhou Commodities Corporation  Head Office and the Beihai Industrial Supply and Marketing  Corporation actively raised money, and entrusted Chen Zuheng  before the case was discovered to collect in succession eight  sums of money totalling more than $11.2 million and deliver them  to Ning's Yisheng Corporation in Hong Kong.    After the case was discovered, they also mutually colluded,  and continued to falsely create automobile original  manufacturing site documentary materials, and provide false  information on nature of their trading, to conceal their  smuggling.    The "798" smuggled automobiles case caused the country  tremendous economic loss. In November of 1993, the Guangxi  District Discipline Committee and the Supervisory Office  conducted a rigorous investigation of the entire case. The four  people involved, including Pei Yuchun et al., have been expelled  from the party and administrative disciplinary measures have  been taken against them. Because of their violations of the law,  the case has been handed over to judicial organs for  investigation. Others bearing major responsibility have also  been punished through expulsion from their posts in the party,  placement on probation within the party, and some have been  relieved of their administrative positions.</p>

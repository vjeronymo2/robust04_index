			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEVILLE BROS.' VIBRANCE, TALENT A SECRET NO LONGER;  </P> <P> POP: AFTER YEARS, THE GROUP, WHICH PLAYS AT THE COACH HOUSE WEDNESDAY AND  THURSDAY, FINDS COMMERCIAL SUCCESS ON "YELLOW MOON."  </P> <P> For most of the 1980s, the Neville Brothers' story was bittersweet.  </P> <P> The band's obvious excellence and originality brought it deep admiration among  cultists and critics. But its failure to reach a mainstream audience was always  a cause for sympathy.  </P> <P> Stars like Linda Ronstadt, Keith Richards and Huey Lewis would sing the praises  of the Nevilles, who play Wednesday and Thursday at the Coach House, and  sometimes try to give them a boost with opening slots on their high-profile  tours. Music publications would hail the band for fiery, socially conscious  albums and performances that embodied the uniquely vibrant soul and R&amp;B  tradition of the Nevilles' hometown, New Orleans. But always there would be  that sad side to the tale: The Nevilles' excellence seemed destined to remain  one of pop's proverbial best-kept secrets.  </P> <P> Then came 1989 and the release of "Yellow Moon," the fifth album by the  Nevilles since 1977, the year that brothers Art, Charles, Aaron and Cyril  merged their previously separate musical careers to record as a family band.  With all that good will built up from the past, and with producer Daniel Lanois  lending the Nevilles' churning funk the atmospheric cast he had previously  brought to hit albums by the likes of U2 and Robbie Robertson, "Yellow Moon"  became the album that broke the Neville Brothers into the mainstream.  </P> <P> The accolades kept coming from the cognoscenti -- but there was no longer any  need to temper admiration with sympathy about undeserved commercial neglect.  </P> <P> "It really got us exposed to a lot of people who weren't aware of us,"  saxophonist Charles Neville said over the phone from San Francisco last week as  he assessed the impact of "Yellow Moon."  </P> <P> "It didn't quite get to gold (500,000 copies sold), but it got close. The last  I heard, it was well over 300,000 and still selling. I think it was a  combination of the album, and the publicity that went before it. Over the  years, people have been hearing all these other people (like Richards and  Ronstadt) talking about us. I think the combinations of all the things that  went on in the '80s" led to the breakthrough with "Yellow Moon." While not a  major hit by today's industry standards, the album's appearance on the  Billboard Top 100 albums chart was still an achievement for a band that isn't  naturally attuned to '80s pop formulas.  </P> <P> According to Charles Neville, "Yellow Moon" may bring the Nevilles more good  news: "The rumor we've heard is there's a good chance of it being nominated for  Grammys in more than one category," he said. If so, the Nevilles would have a  chance to enjoy a delicious reversal: Last year, they were the entertainment at  the post-Grammy ceremony party for nominees. If the Grammy organizers have any  sense at all, they will use the opportunity of a Neville Brothers nomination to  have the band play on the national telecast.  </P> <P> Other recent developments have placed the Neville name before the public even  more. The band's rhythm section -- Cyril Neville on percussion, guitarist Brian  Stoltz, bassist Tony Hall and drummer Willie Green -- was enlisted by producer  Lanois to serve as the backing unit for Bob Dylan's "Oh Mercy" album. And Linda  Ronstadt called on Aaron Neville and his sumptuous tenor for four duets on her  new, million-selling album, "Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind." Neville  receives special "featuring Aaron Neville" billing on the Ronstadt album's  cover. The Nevilles will be the opening act for Ronstadt on her 1990 tour,  Charles Neville said, with Aaron Neville doing double duty in duets with  Ronstadt.  </P> <P> According to Charles, there is no nervousness within the band over the fact  that Aaron's distinctive voice lends itself to outside projects, not to mention  a solo career.  </P> <P> "That's something that's encouraged," said Charles, who, at 51, is a year  younger than the eldest Neville, keyboards player Art. "I don't think it could  hurt us at all for him to get as much notoriety as possible. (Aaron) is  planning on doing a solo album. Hopefully, at some point we'll all be able to  do that with enough recognition of the Neville Brothers name to have some  instant clout behind whatever the solo project is."  </P> <P> Among the outside projects is Art Neville's recent reunion with two other  original members of the Meters, bassist George Porter and guitarist Leo  Nocentelli. In the '60s and '70s, the Meters brought tight New Orleans funk to  mass audiences as a backup studio band for Dr. John, Paul McCartney, Robert  Palmer and Labelle.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Charles said, the Neville Brothers are working up songs for a  follow-up to "Yellow Moon." The group will record at Lanois' studio in New  Orleans, he said, but with a different producer -- the idea being not to  retrace the sound Lanois crafted for the Nevilles on "Yellow Moon."  </P> <P> This time the band will be building on success instead of wondering whether it  will ever achieve a commercial breakthrough.  </P> <P> Although the Nevilles often talked of the need to come up with a hit during  their years of small cult awareness (their 1987 album, "Uptown," was a blatant,  but failed, attempt to gear songs to radio tastes), discouragement never set  in, Charles said.  </P> <P> "Things were always at a kind of slow-but-steady pace, getting better and  better. We were selling out more places, getting bigger venues and a larger  following. Our purpose was never that we were doing this to make a really great  success. We're doing it because we love doing it." Then Charles chuckled. "If  we get a couple of million sellers, that's fine."  </P> <P> The Neville Brothers and Michael Anderson play Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.  at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $25.  Information: (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Mario Conde walks through fire yet again: The bank chairman who became a media magnate after a boardroom coup in Madrid Mario Conde has just infuriated Madrid's close-knit financial community with yet another example of his ability to walk through fire. On Wednesday the 42-year-old chairman of Banesto, one of Spain's biggest banks, became a media magnate when he engineered the takeover of a television channel and a daily newspaper. Antena-3 TV was taken over in a swift, Banesto-financed Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m) move by Mr Conde, Mr Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born publisher, and a Madrid publisher friend, Mr Antonio Asensio. Mr Conde has learned quickly to do his business the way most of Spain does - with his friends. He first bounded on to the financial stage in 1987 when he and a friend sold their bulk chemicals producer to Montedison for Pta65bn (Pounds 355m). With the proceeds they bought their way on to the Banesto board just as the bank was being threatened with a takeover and Banesto's rattled board made him president within days of his arrival. Since January 1988, Mr Conde has become easily the most controversial personality in Spain, making enemies as easily as he holds on to his friends. He rudely cleared Banesto's board of its venerable old shareholders and set himself the almost impossible task of untangling the bank from the cross-holdings that linked it to a vast industrial empire. The government openly dislikes him, not least because the media has decided he may become Spain's first democratically elected conservative prime minister if Mr Felipe Gonzalez ever decides to retire. Mr Gonzalez criticises him in public. The Finance Ministry stopped him selling Banesto's insurance subsidiary offshore and, when he finally separated Banesto's industries from the bank and merged them into an industrial corporation, it allowed him only a fraction of the tax waiver permitted by the law on revalued assets. The Bank of Spain last year threatened to challenge Banesto's accounts for not passing portfolio losses through profits, but backed off. Earlier this month he stoked those fires by calling for a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, to the fury of the government, and last month he was attacked at a shareholder's meeting by BP, which claimed he had reneged on a deal to buy back Banesto shares owned by an oil refiner he sold in 1991. Antena-3 TV may be his best means of defending himself from public attack. But to be effective, Antena-3, the least successful of three commercial channels licensed in 1989, needs to improve its ratings radically. To do that, Mr Murdoch's experience and his US and UK programming will be vital. However, anyone trying to remove Mr Conde from Banesto risks causing great damage to the institution at the same time. And the Banesto group is troubled. After creating his industrial corporation, Mr Conde had wanted to float some of it for around Dollars 800m. The invasion of Kuwait collapsed the markets, saddling him with industries accounting for 1 per cent of Spanish gross domestic product in an economy the government was trying to cool down. It has succeeded, and so Banesto's industrial profits plummeted 48 per cent to Pta12.6bn last year. Unable to float the corporation, he is selling it piecemeal: Petromed to BP last year; the insurer Union y Fenix into a joint venture with AGF. Industrial affiliates' profits fell 76 per cent on average in 1991. As a result consolidated (bank and industrial) profits fell 7.3 per cent to Pta52.3bn in 1991. For the right price, all the companies are for sale. At the bank itself, he has managed to sustain asset growth through extremely aggressive lending. Last year Banesto's lending grew 50 per cent faster than the banking sector. This might backfire as bad debts rise to record levels and the investors have cut Banesto's stock market capitalisation by 30 per cent to around Dollars 270bn. But, says Mr Joaquin Tamames of the corporate analysts Axel Group, the banking business is coming good. 'Over the last three years consolidated operating profits have increased remarkably and the bank is containing costs.' Banesto bank profits rose 14 per cent last year to Pta45.6bn and consolidated group fee income from banking services rose some 70 per cent to Pta54bn. Mr Conde is, nevertheless, constantly on a knife edge and he deals with it by running at trouble rather than away from it. Three months ago he signed a deal with the Count of Godo, the founder of Antena-3 TV, to take stakes in the television channel and Mr Godo's rich newspaper, La Vanguardia, in Barcelona. Criticised by the government and journalists, Mr Godo hastily pulled out of the deal. On Wednesday he learned a little about crossing Mr Conde and was toppled from his presidency of Antena-3. One of the next chapters in this adventure might be a government-inspired attempt to find someone to take over Banesto. The stock is cheap with the shares yielding about 20 per cent more than the banking average, but local buyers are scarce and Mr Conde knows the last thing Madrid wants is another foreigner swallowing a large slice of Spain's economy.</p>

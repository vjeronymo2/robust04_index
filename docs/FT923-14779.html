			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Major hoping for early Gatt deal: Trade likely to be among the issues figuring in G7 talks starting today in Munich MR JOHN MAJOR, the UK prime minister, said at the weekend that the countries negotiating the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks were 'sufficiently close to an agreement to make a real effort to get one, and get one without delay'. Speaking after Saturday's EC-Japanese summit in London, and in the run-up to this week's Group of Seven talks in Munich, he said that reaching a conclusion to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round as soon as possible was 'an imperative' for political, economic and humanitarian reasons. He said there were still difficulties to be overcome. But there was a collective agreement at Saturday's talks, attended by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, the EC commission president, that a satisfactory outcome should be pursued 'as speedily as possible'. Mr Major said he expected the problems of the trade round would be discussed in Munich, where the G7 leaders today open their annual economic summit. However, he said the issue might be addressed in bilateral meetings rather than at the main summit of the leading industrial countries. US President George Bush and French President Francois Mitterrand were reported to have narrowed differences over agriculture that have stalled Gatt talks, at a dinner meeting last night. Mr Mitterrand's spokesman said: 'On the key question of agriculture the positions have moved closed together and the prospect of global balanced accord is quite possible to envisage.' However, French officials tempered the optimism, saying the EC had made all the concessions it could on farm exports. The Gatt talks have stumbled over US demands for cuts in subsidised EC cereal exports. Efforts were being made yesterday for Mr Delors to meet Mr Bush tomorrow. Mr Major's assertions raise the danger of seriously embarrassing the G7 if no headway is made in Munich. G7 leaders have called for urgent settlement of the Uruguay Round at two previous summits, to no effect. Mr Major said there was no doubt that a Gatt agreement would be a 'significant stimulus' to world trade at a time when it was flagging, unemployment was rising in many countries and growth was falling. Britain also wanted an agreement because it would be of particular help for developing countries. The Japanese mission, led by Mr Miyazawa, had visited Washington before arriving in London to demonstrate close ties with the US. At the London meeting between leaders from the EC and Japan, Mr Delors suggested the two should set up an expert group to analyse the cause of Japan's trade surplus, which has re-emerged as a source of tension since it rose to a record Dollars 27.4bn (Pounds 14.3bn) in the 1991 fiscal year. Mr Miyazawa said he wanted to look at details of the proposal further, but would want such a group to examine discrimination measures targeted at Japan by some European countries. Of specific concern were quantitative restraints on a total of 49 Japanese exports - ranging from cars and motor cycles to pineapples and light bulbs - imposed by countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. Both sides 'recognised the need for further efforts by Japan and the Community and its member states to increase EC exports to Japan'. Mr Miyazawa admitted that the Japanese economy was 'slowing down rather substantially'. But the Japanese government was prepared to inject further resources if necessary. If the present policy of bringing forward state spending in this year's budget failed to rally the economy it would consider 'additional fiscal measures' in the form of a supplementary budget in the autumn. This would include more public work investments and help for small and medium-sized businesses, he said. Mr Major said he had asked the Japanese prime minister whether Japan's 3.5 per cent annual growth target for the next five years was practical. He said Mr Miyazawa told him he was confident the target could be met over five years.</p>

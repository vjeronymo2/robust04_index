			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lottery - a route to riches, and honours Sir, R L Webb (Letters, January 1/2) is not at all alone in disliking the new plan for premium bond prizes and I agree entirely with his observations. It might have been better to leave premium bond prizes as being 'little and often' as a counterbalance to the 'lots but unlikely' winnings proposed for the national lottery, with the pools to cater for those who want a chance of either result.

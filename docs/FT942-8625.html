			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Global bond issues reach Dollars 84bn International bond issues net of amortisation reached an all-time peak of Dollars 84bn in the first quarter of 1994 in spite of unsettled market conditions, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in its latest report on international banking and financial market developments. The BIS said the record issue volume in January meant that overall financing in the first quarter remained high. However, turbulence in financial markets had an impact on the composition of issues, with straight fixed-rate financing declining to its lowest quarterly level since the fourth quarter of 1992 while floating-rate issues reached their highest level ever. Equity-related issues increased by the largest amount since the second quarter of 1989. Most of the increase took place in convertible issues for borrowers from France, Japan, the Cayman Islands and the UK. French issuers accounted for almost all of the large increase in issues denominated in French francs, which rose from Dollars 200m in the fourth quarter last year to Dollars 3.3bn in the first quarter this year. The widespread increase in borrowing by OECD entities more than offset reduced borrowing by developing countries and international organisations. However, in spite of the less favourable issuing conditions created by Mexico's domestic political situation, borrowing by Mexican entities continued at a strong pace, displacing Argentina as the most important LDC borrower. In the syndicated loan market, total financing was relatively steady with Dollars 52bn of new facilities, compared with Dollars 55bn in the previous quarter. The lower volume of facilities for OECD borrowers was partially offset by higher volume for LDC borrowers, in particular large facilities arranged for Indonesian borrowers. The decline in margins on new facilities began to extend from prime names in the OECD area to other groups of borrowers, particularly Asia.</p>

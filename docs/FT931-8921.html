			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Observer: BTR puzzle Now that 65-year-old Norman Ireland has decided to hand over the chairmanship of Bowater to a man four months younger, could he be freeing himself up to take over the chairmanship of BTR from his old boss, Sir Owen Green? Admittedly, it's unlikely. BTR is Britain's 10th biggest company and under Sir Owen Green has been one of the country's most successful. However, Green turns 68 in May and has indicated unofficially that he plans to retire this year. But so far no word on his successor. BTR has had a non-executive chairman before - Sir David Nicolson did the job for 15 years - but given Sir Owen's thoughts about non-executive directors it would be out of character if he encouraged his colleagues to look outside for his successor. The obvious internal candidate would be BTR chief executive Alan Jackson, 56. He is said to have made a success of BTR's Hawker Siddeley acquisition. But he has only been doing his job for a couple of years, so perhaps Ireland, who is two years younger than Sir Owen, might stand in to keep the seat warm till Jackson is ready. Unlike British Aerospace chairman John Cahill, another old BTR hand, Ireland does at least have time to spare now. Just an idea.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Forced to find common ground: Germany's declining economy is raising hopes of a pact between government, unions and employers When gloom overtakes the German economy, it always seems to come with a vengeance. And yet this time, the very sharpness of the downturn is forcing erstwhile political foes to agree on a remedy. The principal economic indicators have been looking dejected for months, but the series of dismal statistics in the past couple of weeks takes some beating. Real gross national product fell 1.5 per cent between the second and third quarters of the year, investment spending fell 3 per cent, and consumer demand was down 0.5 per cent. Unemployment was up in November to almost 3m in east and west Germany combined. Chancellor Helmut Kohl even dared to use the 'R-word' - recession - to describe the state of the German economy in an unscripted insert in his budget debate speech at the end of last month. This merely confirmed what most economists have been saying for months. Particularly worrying was the failure of inflation to continue its gradual downward trend in November - not least for those in the rest of Europe looking for a relaxation in the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy. Figures from the country's regions suggest inflation will remain at a stubborn 3.7 per cent for the country as a whole. In January, a 1 per cent rise in VAT will push inflation back over 4 per cent. And then came another sharp drop in industrial orders in October - down 5.1 per cent from September, and 9.7 per cent compared with October 1991. The respected IFO economics institute says 1992 will show the first real decline in manufacturing output for a decade, down 1.5 per cent, and that will accelerate to 3 per cent in 1993. The truth is that the extent of the downturn has been aggravated by the short-lived surge Germany enjoyed after unification, which also delayed the realisation in the west that the international recession was going to hit it too. The forecasters have sharply reduced their expectations for the coming year, but they still expect recovery to begin from mid-year. Thus the five leading economic institutes, in their autumn report, were still predicting a GNP growth of 1 per cent next year (just 0.5 per cent in the west). In mid-November, the five 'wise men' who provide independent advice to the government, were putting it at zero growth overall. Behind their caution lies the question of whether the unique economic upheaval caused by German unification, and the subsequent collapse of east German industry, is not going to cause something more profound than a temporary recession. The combination of a weakening western economy, and a devastated eastern economy requiring a total structural overhaul, presents German leaders with a daunting challenge. Chancellor Kohl's response has been to propose a high-risk, peculiarly German political strategy: to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' between government and opposition, trade unions and employers, to finance the long-term costs of unification without sending the economy into a tail-spin. The idea is to seek western restraint to finance eastern recovery: wage restraint from the unions, cuts in public spending from central and state governments, an extra boost in eastern investment from the private sector, and all of it financed in an equitable, socially-acceptable way. It is a tall order under any circumstances. Mr Kohl has set himself a deadline of Christmas to reach a deal, with a fall-back position of January. And thanks to the welter of economic gloom from the statisticians, his chances of success are greatly increased. The importance of the solidarity pact goes far beyond the borders of a united Germany, as indeed the currency market traders are acutely aware. For if it succeeds, it contains precisely those ingredients - credible wage restraint and budgetary discipline - which will persuade the Bundesbank to move much faster in cutting interest rates. If it fails, the prospects of early relaxation will sharply recede. So far, the signs of progress have been better than expected. The chancellor has had a series of secret meetings with four top trade unionists, details of which only began to leak out late last month. He has had a first round of talks with Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), from which both emerged saying they wanted to do a deal. And he has presented the insurance and banking industries with a plan to spend DM1bn (Pounds 400m) apiece on new housing in the east. The clearest indication of a breakthrough came three weeks ago, when the chancellor was talking to industrialists in Schwerin, capital of the eastern land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the poorest of all the eastern lander. There he indicated a U-turn in government policy: he was no longer going to insist on 'privatise or close' as the motto for eastern enterprises, he said. To prevent an outright collapse of eastern industry, the government was ready to consider keeping a variety of 'key enterprises' going on direct subsidies, if they could be 'restructured' over the longer term. It was precisely what the trade unions, and the SPD, had been calling for: an industrial policy to preserve at least some portions of the east German industrial heartland. Some say it is too late. Mr Wolfgang Roth, economy spokesman of the SPD, fears that eastern manufacturing is almost beyond rescue. 'So much is already destroyed,' he said. 'By the end of next year, there will only be 400,000 manufacturing jobs left in a labour force of 6m. That is a tragedy, and it was avoidable.' Nonetheless, the trade unions are convinced that a belated industrial rehabilitation effort is better than no effort at all. The problem is identifying precisely where it begins and ends. 'The question is how you choose which firms qualify,' according to one senior government official involved in the talks. 'It is difficult to explain why, say, 100 enterprises should be saved, and not 120. Then it is extremely difficult to decide how long they should be kept afloat. Many are competing with western companies, who are themselves being forced to cut back.' The Treuhand privatisation agency had sold off 10,403 separate enterprises by the end of October, leaving 3,189 still on its books. The biggest ones are the biggest problem. Almost 224,000 workers are employed in companies with 1,500 workers or more, out of the 549,000 on the Treuhand's books. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, boss of the big IG-Metall engineering trade union, has proposed an all-embracing engineering holding company to preserve the bulk of the eastern industry. There seems little chance that Mr Kohl would be prepared to go so far. But he has asked Mr Steinkuhler and his colleagues to come up with their own list of the enterprises which should be saved. The very fact that Mr Kohl is talking about an industrial intervention strategy has raised the hopes of the unions. 'Mr Kohl is making our speeches for us now,' says Mr Jorg Barczynski, spokesman for IG-Metall. In return, the unions are clearly moving towards a policy of wage restraint, even though they are very loath to talk precise figures. The OTV public sector union, whose leader, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, is also involved in the top-level negotiations, has tabled a claim for 5 per cent in west Germany next year - with most analysts expecting a settlement down towards 3.0 to 3.5 per cent. Several union leaders, including Mr Steinkuhler, have talked of holding their pay claims down to the rise in the cost of living. The employers are sceptical - they want productivity, not inflation, as the measure - but the direction is clearly down from last year's settlements. Mr Kohl very much wants wage restraint in the west, above all in the public sector. But he equally wants big concessions in the east, where the wage problem is if anything more critical. Wage equalisation with the west has run far ahead of productivity, so that wages now stand at some 70 per cent of western levels, and productivity at only some 30 per cent. The argument therefore is that the unions, and especially IG-Metall, should water down their negotiated wage contracts which provide for continued rapid wage equalisation, reaching 100 per cent by 1994. Mr Steinkuhler has flatly rejected any statutory move to re-open the wage contracts, as proposed by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the free-market economics minister. But he is clearly prepared to consider some form of case-by-case relaxation. He argues that productivity levels vary widely from company to company in the east, and no single statutory solution would be appropriate. In spite of union-government movement on those issues, the stickiest area remains: financing the policies, and cutting back spending in the west to do so. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has just endured an agonising exercise with his own supporters in the coalition government, attempting to cut some DM6bn out of spending from next year's DM435bn budget. He still needs to find savings to finance the proposed industrial policy in eastern Germany, but budget officials say the only big areas they can now cut involves social spending. And that is anathema to the trade unions. Latest leaks from the negotiations suggest that Mr Waigel is proposing to reduce unemployment benefits. He is also pushing for a 2 per cent ceiling on pay rises for civil servants, the one group which has not had to pay increased unemployment contributions for the labour market measures introduced in the east. Now the negotiations are likely to get down to the really hard bargaining. But if there is no deal on public sector restraint, given soaring public sector deficits, the Bundesbank is going to keep the screws on monetary policy, according to the signals coming out of Frankfurt. The key to a deal remains Mr Kohl's own readiness to bargain. At talks last month, Mr Steinkuhler savaged Mr Mollemann for understanding less about economics than his 12-year-old son, when he wanted more pocket money. The chancellor intervened on behalf of the union leader, and told his minister to go away and do his homework. 'The truth is that the chancellor wants a deal. He knows he cannot win the next elections in 1994 without support from east Germany,' according to one trade unionist. 'That means he has got to tackle the unemployment problem, and we are the only ones with the policies to help him do so. 'It may be true that the chancellor does not understand very much about economics. But he understands a great deal about power.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Labour market in east Germany                                                             ('000)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1990    1991     1992     1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Economically active               8,868   7,179    6,170    5,900 Short-time work                     758   1,616      370      190 Early retirement                    239     543      820      830 Full-time retraining                 11     223      420      400 Unemployed                          240     913    1,190    1,240  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Economic institutes, Council of Economic Advisers and Federal Statistical Office  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

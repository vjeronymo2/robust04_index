			<p>BFN     [Text] The OAU secretary general, Salim Ahmed Salim, has  expressed support for the initiative taken by President Mwinyi  of Tanzania to convene a peace conference on Rwanda.    In a press statement yesterday, Mr. Salim said the meeting  in  Arusha is expected to bring together representatives of the  Rwanda Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front as well as  representatives of the observer countries and international  organizations. He said that the government of Tanzania, as  facilitator, is proposing this conference with two main items on  the agenda: ceasefire and the implementation of the Arusha  peace agreement.    Mr. Salim called on the UN Security Council to continue to  provide the necessary support to involve the UN Assistance  Mission for Rwanda to effectively carry out its mandate. He  also appealed to the international community, including  nongovernmental organizations to provide increased and adequate  resources to cater for the thousands of affected persons in  Rwanda.</p>

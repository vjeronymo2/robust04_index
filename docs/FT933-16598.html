			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / The Property Market: An uncertain game plan - BR's vast holdings post-privatisation In the game of Monopoly, few investments are more reliable and straightforward than station property. But in the real world, the opposite may apply. The opportunity to invest in railway property after British Rail's privatisation is likely to be greeted with perplexity and caution. This is not for lack of opportunity. British Rail owns land on a scale unmatched by any other nationalised business. It owns 156,000 acres of land, 2,500 stations and a tenanted estate with an annual income of Pounds 148m. Although BR refuses to divulge the results of a recent property revaluation, its property assets undoubtedly runs into billions of pounds. Initially at least, privatisation is likely to offer plum opportunities for chartered surveyors, rather than investors or the taxpayer. The new structure for the railways will create many landlords and tenants, each of which will require property advice. 'It will be a bonanza for property advisers,' says Mr Bob Hill, managing director of British Rail Property Board (BRPB), which manages BR's tenanted estate. Unlike some privatisations, investors are not being lured by the promise of a rich vein of under-exploited property. 'There is as much effort going into ensuring that in the future assets are properly managed as looking for scope for exploitation,' says Mr Stephen Barter of chartered surveyors Richard Ellis, which is advising the Department of Transport on the property implications of privatisation. The question of how privatisation will improve the management of BR property assets provokes answers that are long on rhetoric and short on detail. The government's advisers say that privatisation will identify and exploit those opportunities where greater competition and the involvement of private sector finance and management skills can provide better value for money. There are two ways in which privatisation is expected to lead to better property man-agement: Privatisation may lead to more cost-effective management of the railway estate, since privatised station operators will have greater incentive to contain their costs. Privatisation will overcome the allegedly unhelpful division of management within stations between British Rail, which manages the train operations and is responsible for issues such as safety, and BRPB, which manages the buildings. These different responsibilities will be handled by a single authority when a station is sold to a private operator, which will have an incentive to improve both the running and the facilities of the station. Just how far British Rail needs to improve its property management is a moot point. In 1985 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission published a highly critical report about BRPB. The report slammed everything from its marketing skills to its filing system. But in recent years, BRPB is credited with having exploited the 1980s development boom adroitly. In conjuction with Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, it was responsible for the Broadgate and Ludgate complexes in the City of London, some of London's better new developments. Given British Rail's proven ability to co-operate with the private sector in projects such as Broadgate and Ludgate, there is some scepticism within the organisation about the advantages offered under the new regime. According to Richard Ellis, an important difference under the new system is that the private sector will be able to undertake developments inside stations, as well as above and alongside them. Investors might, for instance, see opportunities for installing shopping plazas inside stations located in city centres. At this stage, discussions with potential investors are tentative. The Department of Transport is unable to market the opportunities too energetically because of the poor state of the property market and the large number of policy questions which still answers. Even the plans that have been worked out could be altered by parliament before the bill receives royal consent, probably in October. In broad outline, the privatisation plan is to split BR's estate into two parts. One half, which may be known as BR Property, will manage its non-operational property, such as disused viaducts. The other half will comprise station freeholds and other operational property. These will be owned by Railtrack, the track authority, which in turn will be owned by the government, although it has been earmarked for privatisation in the medium term. There is still considerable uncertainty about how these arrangements will work in practice. It is unclear, for instance, how much Railtrack will be able to borrow; which assets Railtrack will own; and which of BRPB's staff will join Railtrack (Mr Bob Hill, managing director of BRPB, has already been appointed Railtrack's property director). Once these questions have been resolved, there will be an extensive overhaul of the railways' property management. But there is some scepticism among BR's senior management about the significance of these changes. In the view of Mr Hill, the impact will be muted. 'I think the reality is that there won't be a dramatic difference in terms of what happens to property,' he says.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                   CHANGES IN PROPERTY VALUES (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                            Retail              Office  ------------------------------------------------------------------                     Year to   Mnth of    Year to   Mnth of                     May 93    May 93     May 93     May 93  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Rental growth         -4.0      -0.3      -18.1       -1.5 Capital growth        -3.3       0.0      -11.9       -0.1 Total return           4.5       0.6       -2.9        0.7 Current yields         9.0                 10.3  ------------------------------------------------------------------                         Industrial              All  ------------------------------------------------------------------                     Year to   Mnth of    Year to   Mnth of                     May 93    May 93     May 93     May 93  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Rental growth        -11.5      -1.4      -10.7      -0.9 Capital growth        -8.3      -0.1       -7.4      -0.1 Total return           1.5       0.8        1.3       0.7 Current yields        11.4                  9.9  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: IPD Monthly Index, Investment Property Databank  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

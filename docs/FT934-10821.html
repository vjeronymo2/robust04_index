			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow overcomes profit taking to set new high Wall Street AFTER posting early losses on profit-taking and rising bond yields, US share prices rallied on the back of strong cyclical stocks to end the day at or close to record highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen to 3,667.46 by mid-morning, finished a net 5.03 ahead at an all-time peak of 3,697.64. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.66 off at 468.44, while the American SE composite gained 1.71 at a record 484.28 and the Nasdaq composite was finally up 1.89 at 785.66. New York SE volume totalled 305m shares. After Monday's record-breaking gains, when confidence in the economic outlook pushed blue chip stocks to new highs, investors took the opportunity to book some profits early yesterday. At one stage the Dow was down 25 points. Also adding pressure to stocks was another rise in bond market yields. As on Monday, news of strengthening economic activity depressed bond prices, and pushed up yields at the long end to almost 6.1 per cent. The trigger for the selling was the report of a 20.8 per cent rise in September home sales. The increase, the largest since 1986, was well ahead of forecasts. The day's other news - a 0.5 per cent increase in September leading economic indicators - was also bearish for bonds but bullish for stocks. Consequently, after suffering sharp declines in early trading, equity prices returned to positive territory later in the day, aided by strong demand for economically sensitive stocks. Analysts said the rise in bond yields, while worrying, had not been large or rapid enough to offset the positive implications of recent economic data. The Dow was helped by a strong advance by IBM. Following a delayed opening due to an order imbalance, IBM moved ahead Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 50 7/8 in volume of 10.2m shares after brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette raised its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'very attractive'. Among firmer cyclical issues, forestry product stocks were especially strong for the second consecutive day. Louisiana-Pacific jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 41 1/2 , Georgia-Pacific climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 68 and International Paper added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 . Auto shares were also in demand, with Ford up Dollars 1 at Dollars 63 3/4 and General Motors ahead Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 49, both in heavy trading. WorldCorp surged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 6 1/4 on news that Malaysian Helicopter planned to buy a 24.9 per cent stake in the company for Dollars 27.4m. On the Nasdaq market, Geotek Industries advanced Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 13 1/2 in volume of 5.3m shares after stating that several big investors, including the influential money manager Mr George Soros, were investing Dollars 40m in the company to build wireless telecommunications networks overseas. Canada TORONTO ended steady after extremely heavy trading. The TSE 300 index edged up 2.3 to 4,250.3 and rises led falls by 482 to 341. Volume came to 82.8m shares valued at CDollars 703.7m. Eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher, led by paper and real estate, which rose 2.04 and 1.50 per cent respectively.</p>

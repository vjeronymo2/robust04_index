			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guarded welcome for fish deal FISHERMEN ARE giving a guarded welcome to the deal on fish quotas and fishing regulation for next year which the European Community fisheries council agreed on Sunday. For British fishermen in the North Sea the agreement means a near doubling of the quota of haddock, while European Commission plans to impose a 190-day tie-up on Britain were rejected. Mr Bob Allen, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said: 'We congratulate the ministers on getting the EC tie-up scheme out of the picture but we do not accept the (British) government's approach'. The 82 per cent increase in the British North Sea haddock quota from 42,640 tonnes to 77,620 tonnes was welcomed because of the value of this catch to fishermen. Haddock stocks have recovered substantially after two bad years. Herring catches in the North Sea will remain about the same, as will cod allowances. Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, hailed the outcome of the fisheries council as 'a great victory for the countries of Europe over rigid centralised bureaucracy'. This was because the ministers, over whom he presided, had rejected the commission proposal to operate a blanket 190-day ban on fishing by British boats. Instead Britain will attempt to regulate its fishing effort through the newly-passed Sea Fish (Conservation) Act, which gives the government power to restrict the number of days a boat spends at sea by relating its activity to its performance in 1991. Fishermen will be given fishing days to match their days at sea in 1991 and new allowances will take into account days at sea spent servicing oil rigs or carrying out non-fishing work. They will not be subject to having to spend consecutive days in port. The government believes this will ensure access to fishing is allocated fairly and that the supply of fish to the market will be more even, avoiding the gluts which led to sharp price falls this year. But the fishermen say they will continue their fight against the provisions of the act. 'We will continue to wage war on the idea of limiting days at sea,' Mr Allen said. The fishermen still say they would prefer a much larger decommissioning scheme than the one planned by the government, which involves spending Pounds 25m over three years. Commenting on fishermen's reactions, Mr Gummer said in Brussels: 'This agreement means that the industry can continue to be structured so that fishermen's incomes continue to keep ahead of inflation. 'We have to regulate the industry for conservation reasons. I am very aware that a previously unregulated industry is now being restructured and we are restraining the activities of natural hunters.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Increase in Number of Intelligentsia Members </F> Registered"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--The Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] has registered a large increase in the number of  intelligentsia members among its members, and the movement's  profile is improving from this point of view, HZDS Deputy  Chairman Sergej Kozlik stated in an interview for TA SR.  According to his words, statistical data confirm that the  HZDS's structure is no worse in this regard than that of the  Party of the Democratic Left. "We even have a lower percentage  of people with only a basic education than, for example, the  Christian Democratic Movement," he added.    Speaking about meetings between HZDS representatives and  citizens of Slovakia, Sergej Kozlik said that it was necessary  to seek forms that would alleviate tension and prevent outbursts  of aggression, such as the recent physical assaults on four  journalists. It is questionable, and it has not been proved by  anyone, that these were HZDS supporters, he said of the  assailants. He admitted that people are to be seen at the  movement's rallies who behave in an uncivilized manner, often  under the influence of alcohol. The HZDS does not regard these  people as its supporters, however. "Dramatic political  situations always attract these types of people," he said, and  did not rule out that an attempt at political provocation might  be involved. "At any rate, these manifestations are neither  democratic nor ethical, and there is no place for them on the  political scene," he stressed. Sergej Kozlik assumes that  future HZDS rallies would have an expressly civic character.  [passage omitted]</p>

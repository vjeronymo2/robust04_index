			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Making the right choice It is important to select the right type of insurance bond to match your requirements, both from the tax aspect (see above) and your attitude to risk. Guaranteed income bonds These are designed for the very cautious investor who wants a regular income and to preserve capital. They are fixed-term products usually held for one to five years, with a penalty for early termination. Charges are not disclosed but are deducted from the return, as with a building society account. Rates change often but it is possible at present to secure an annual return of 7.5 to 8.5 per cent, net of basic rate tax, for five years. Guaranteed growth bonds operate in a similar way but re-invest the income. With-profits bonds These are designed for cautious investors who want an element of capital growth. The fund invests in equities, property, gilts and cash. While the full return of capital is not always guaranteed, the annual return (or 'bonus') is, once it has been allocated. Bonuses have fallen in recent years, but a well-managed fund should outstrip building society returns by a substantial margin. There is no fixed maturity date, but a minimum term of five years - and preferably 10 - is recommended. If market conditions are very poor, the provider retains the right to make deductions (known as the market value adjustor) when a bond is cashed in. Distribution bonds These represent the next step up the risk ladder from with-profits bonds. Your investment buys units in the fund, which is invested in similar assets to the with-profits bond. Distribution bonds separate the income from the capital growth. Withdrawals are taken from the income, leaving the original capital intact. Managed and specialist unit-linked bonds These are designed for the more adventurous investor. Managed funds generally invest in a range of the providers' main funds but tend to be equity-dominated. Specialist funds invest in particular markets - say, Far East or European equities - but low-risk funds, such as cash and fixed interest, are also available. Usually, it is possible to switch between funds free of charge or for a nominal fee. These internal switches will not incur a tax charge. High-income bonds These are similar to guaranteed income bonds but there is no guarantee that the full capital invested will be returned. Instead, this usually depends on the performance of the FT-SE 100 index. If the index does not fall over the investment period, the return of original capital may be guaranteed. At present, these bonds offer 9-10 per cent income a year net of basic-rate tax. Investors should always check the conditions under which the full capital will be returned. Guaranteed equity bonds These are growth-orientated and not recommended for people seeking income. The bond usually provides a minimum rate of return - for example, 25-35 per cent over five years on top of the original capital. There may be additional returns, depending on the performance of the index to which the bond is linked. Offshore bonds can be used as long-term vehicles for tax planning, especially where you want to leave the assets to the next generation. They are gross funds: the tax and CGT liability rests with the individual.

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Tribunal flexes its muscles Hydro-Quebec, the big Canadian hydroelectricity producer, has become one of the first companies in the world to appear before a self-appointed international water pollution 'tribunal' to defend itself against its critics, marking a departure in the public relations war of words between environmental groups and business. The Canadian company, the world's fifth largest hydroelectricity producer, voluntarily stood in the 'dock' in Amsterdam last week to defend itself against charges of breaching laws and causing serious environmental harm in pursuit of the large-scale James Bay hydroelectric project in northern Quebec. Hydro-Quebec, one of the few corporate 'defendants' to appear in 10 separate cases heard by the Second International Water Tribunal, was brought to court by the Cree Indians. After a five-hour hearing, the eight-member jury - composed of environmental lawyers, writers and scientists - recognised that Hydro-Quebec and the provincial government had entered into a series of agreements with the Indians but said they doubted whether 'such a contract adequately reflects the aspirations of the Crees to self-determination and control over resources'. In one other case, representatives of PetroEcuador, the Ecuadorian oil company, also appeared in Amsterdam. This marks a stark contrast to the the first international water tribunal in Rotterdam in 1983, when none of the companies cited in complaints about polluting the Rhine was present. Jacques Finet, Hydro-Quebec's vice-president for Europe, said his appearance before the tribunal was designed to get the company's point of view across to European public opinion. 'We are proud of what we do,' he said. 'We have nothing to hide.' His accusers, who included the Cree's chief Matthew Coon-Come, were formidable competitors for media attention. They arrived at a pre-tribunal canal-side press conference in a traditional Indian canoe.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, May 17 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong  Province is forming an overall economic opening pattern.    Already, three economic and technology development zones and  nine high-tech development parks, mainly in the east coast area  and including Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai Cities, have appeared  in an embryonic form.    The Qingdao Bonded Zone is in full operation. So far it has  approved the establishment of 102 projects with funds from other  parts of the country and overseas. These projects involve a  total investment of 63 million U.S. dollars.    The Qingdao Shilaoren Tourism and Holiday Village has held  talks on about 700 projects involving a total investment of 3.1  billion yuan.    As the coastal areas are adjusting their foreign investment  structure to attract international consortiums and corporations  and compete in the world market, Shandong's central and western  parts are taking advantage of their natural resources and  abundant labor forces to absorb foreign investment to help boost  their agriculture and rural industry.    The provincial government has granted export autonomy to all  its cities and prefectures, and selected 25 counties with  backward economies to try out a scheme of overall economic  growth.    The province has established friendly relations with 52  cities in 20 countries.    By the end of last year Shandong had approved the  establishment of 13,000 foreign-funded enterprises with  contractual investment totalling 12.45 billion U.S. dollars.    It exported 5.98 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods last  year, an increase of 27.1 percent over the previous year.</p>

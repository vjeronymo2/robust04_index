			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Observer: Coming home One of Shaftesbury Avenue's leading theatres - the Globe - has become the Gielgud, in honour of Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday. Sir John was in commanding form as he accepted the honour yesterday: 'In recent years I've gone down Shaftesbury Avenue many times and not recognised any of the names on the theatres. Now at least I recognise one.' He was particularly happy because he has been involved in 15 productions there - including Hamlet 60 years ago; and his sister worked in its box office 50 years ago. Janet Holmes-a-Court, whose Stoll Moss chain includes the Gielgud, was happy to spend Pounds 25,000 to change the theatre's sign and place Sir John's photograph, by Lord Snowdon, in the foyer. Few actors' names grace a London theatre. There is the Garrick; the Olivier, at the National; and, if you include actor-managers, the Wyndham. Sir John would like one more - for his old sparring partner Sir Ralph Richardson.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Unexpected loss knocks Allianz off its pedestal - Disillusion with the insurer and high interest rates have depressed German equities THIS week has proved to be a baptism of fire for Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive of Allianz, the Munich-based insurance company which is one of Europe's most powerful financial institutions. In recent days the company has had some rare trouble with its share price, which in turn has dragged down the German stock market. On Tuesday, Mr Schulte-Noelle held his first press conference since he took over from Mr Wolfgang Schieren last autumn. What he had to communicate was not welcomed by the stock market. Shareholders were presented with a larger-than-expected underwriting loss in 1991 - the first-ever loss on Allianz's mainstream insurance business. The loss amounted to DM1.78bn (Dollars 1.2bn), down from a profit of DM182m in the previous year, reflecting difficult conditions in eastern Germany and in North America. That day, Allianz's shares dropped by 3 per cent. But the company's problems  -and those of the market - did not end there. Following an analysts' meeting on Wednesday, which prompted a hefty downgrading from DB Research, the research arm of the Deutsche Bank, the shares dropped by another 4 per cent on Thursday, and carried on sinking yesterday. Allianz shares ended the week at DM1,835, a 9 per cent fall since Monday. The DAX index closed at 1,615.42, little changed from last Friday but down 7.2 per cent since the Bundesbank raised its discount rate from 8.0 to 8.75 per cent on July 16. Analysts say that Allianz's blue-chip image and its status as a proxy for the market because of its shareholdings in other companies have both been been tarnished. Furthermore, investors who previously had been apprehensive about the merits of the strategy pursued by the outgoing Mr Schieren, are now totally disillusioned. His aim had been to reduce Allianz's dependence on the profitable domestic market by investing overseas. Equally controversial was the decision to buy Deutsche Versicherungs, the former east German state insurance monopoly which is unlikely to be profitable before 1995-96. He spent vigorously - some DM10bn during the 1980s - but these investments, it appears, on the basis of Tuesday's figures, have lowered the quality of the company's earnings. The shares were dealt a further blow by a sell note from DB Research. DB analyst Mr Michael Drepper believes that Allianz has grossly overstated its reported Earnings Per Share (EPS) for last year.  He says that the 1991 figure should more properly have been DM26, less than two-thirds of the DM40.85 reported on Tuesday. He has also cut his forecast for this year's EPS from DM 45.50 to DM28 and for 1993 from DM54 to DM44. His recommendation is based on the way Allianz has accounted for DM576m of losses incurred by Deutsche Versicherungs. In calculating its EPS, it treated the losses as an 'extraordinary' item which is taken 'below the line' and therefore has no impact on earnings. DB Research argues that as the losses were normal trading losses, they should have been taken above the line, thus significantly reducing earnings. Such an unequivocal 'sell' recommendation is unusual in the consensual world of German finance. Conspiracy theorists see it as evidence of a deterioration in relations between Deutsche Bank and Allianz, the two most powerful institutions in the German financial services sector, and, through their extensive industrial holdings, in corporate Germany as well. The conspiracy theorists may well be wrong. What is clearer is that DB's sell note shows the increasing influence of Anglo Saxon-style equity analysis in the German stock market. Deutsche Bank has recently reorganised its research activities in an effort to boost its credibility as a provider of independent advice to institutional investors. Equally Anglo-Saxon was Allianz's response to the sell note: it released a statement to the press defending its position and Mr Diethart Breipohl, the finance director, held an impromptu press conference. This sort of reaction to share price developments may be familiar in the UK or the US, but it is still uncommon in Germany. Not surprisingly, the Allianz affair eclipsed the other corporate news of the week. Commerzbank, the first of the big three banks to report its figures, reported a 14.7 per cent increase in half-year profits; and BMW, the luxury car maker, announced a 10.5 per cent increase in net profits in the first six months, in spite of poor conditions in world car markets. In both cases, the figures were impressive, but not enough to lift the gloom which has settled on the German equity market since the interest rate rise. Only the bravest investor would argue that today's prices offer a buying opportunity. A technical rebound may be possible in the short term but it seems unlikely that there will be a robust recovery in share prices until the Bundesbank relaxes its monetary policy. At present, the consensus is that the central bank will not cut rates until the first quarter of 1993 at the earliest, and may even have to raise the internationally-sensitive Lombard rate before then.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Powell Duffryn organises its top management succession The top management succession at Powell Duffryn, one of the few British companies to defeat an unwelcome takeover bid from Hanson, seems to have been sorted out with the appointment of Barry Hartiss, 44, as deputy group chief executive. Hartiss, who joined the group following the 1985 acquisition of UK Petroleum Products, has been responsible for rationalising the group's low margin fuel distribution business. He has been heavily involved in Powell Duffryn's move into port operations. The firm is a major shareholder in Tees and Hartlepool port and is bidding for British Coal's South Wales operations. Hartiss was one of two internal candidates who appeared to be in the running to take over from Andrew Roberts, 59, who retires as chief executive next July. Last September, Michael Noakes, 48, an ex-BTR executive and former chief executive of Boustead, joined the board and there had been speculation that he was being groomed for the top job. However, Noakes will take charge of the group's principal engineering subsidiaries when Freddie Bircher, 62, retires later this year. The intention is that Hartiss will succeed Andrews who, along with Powell Duffryn's chairman David Hubbard has been responsible for refocusing the group after the unwelcome bid from Hanson. Hubbard, a year younger than Andrews, is expected to stay on as chairman until 1997, eventually handing over to VSEL's chief executive Noel Davies, 60, who has been appointed deputy chairman. The appointment of Davies, who comes from an engineering background, is designed to balance the promotion of Hartiss, who has come up through the fuel distribution side.</p>

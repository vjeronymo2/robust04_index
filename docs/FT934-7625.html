			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Czechs get more time for shares THE Czech Republic has extended the registration deadline for a voucher privatisation which aims to sell shares in up to 770 companies with a book value of Kcs145bn (Pounds 3.3bn), writes Patrick Blum in Vienna. Companies now have until the end of December to register for privatisation, and citizens until December 8 to register for voucher books, compared with an original deadline of December 1 for both. Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, said the main reason for the extension was to avoid companies having to close their annual accounts twice in one month to provide the full accounts necessary for registration.</p>

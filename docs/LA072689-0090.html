			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> AN EYE FOR A TOOTH;  </P> <P> GARRETT RAY HAS UNCANNY KNACK OF SPOTTING ELUSIVE CORBINA AT LOW TIDE  </P> <P> At dawn, with the tide so low that only a gentle sheet of water rushes up onto  the the flat sandy coastline, a familiar sight appears over a small dune.  </P> <P> Garrett Ray, having walked a short distance from his Venice Beach home, is well  aware of what this minus tide will mean, and he has planned his day  accordingly.  </P> <P> With the tide this low, the white-haired fisherman will be able to see the  "chuck holes" in the wet sand that will eventually fill with water -- and fish  -- from the incoming tide. Prospects will be best here, he says.  </P> <P> More important, however, he can witness the wary corbina, swimming in with each  wave to feed. They are easily visible in the shallow flats created by the minus  tide, and thus more susceptible to the careful fisherman.  </P> <P> A friend of Ray's arrives, and a few others are on the beach with fishing rods  in their hands and hopes of success in their heads.  </P> <P> Their chances will be greatly enhanced by the presence of Ray, 61, who has  fished extensively for corbina for the last 50 years, and who in that time has  fine-tuned his skills in what can be described as one of the most frustrating  types of fishing.  </P> <P> "He's a damned good corbina fisherman, one of the best there is," said Bob  Wylie, whose Malibu bait shop has been catering to surf fisherman for more than  42 years.  </P> <P> The corbina, an elusive croaker that is strong enough for the powerful  inter-tidal currents in which it swims and feeds, has discouraged as many  people by its reluctance to bite as it has excited by its sizzling runs on hook  and line.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty smart fish," Ray says. "You've got to be when you've got to get  in here and mingle with all these swimmers."  </P> <P> He points to surfers wading through the corbina's territory and alludes to the  hordes of beach-goers that will arrive later in the day.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the conditions seem right. The tide is rising slowly and the anglers  follow Ray a short distance up the coast. Having filled a tin can with  soft-shelled sand crabs, as opposed to the more abundant but less-productive  hard-shelled variety, the fishermen rig their gear and begin to cast.  </P> <P> Ray, meanwhile, chooses to wait, and talk about his favorite fish. He recounts  the day he caught 25 corbina and donated them to the local lifeguards for a  fish fry. He recalls the six- and seven-pounders -- the largest on record  weighed 8 1/2 pounds -- that were "pretty consistent" in the 1930s, when he  started fishing for them.  </P> <P> "I get a bigger kick out of the people fishing around me than catching them,"  he says. "Sometimes I'll leave my pole at home and bring people down and show  them how to fish 'em."  </P> <P> After all, Ray doesn't want to be selfish. He says he has caught and released  about 300 corbina this year alone, a claim that people who know him will back.  </P> <P> "He can spot the fish like nobody else," says Bill Beebe, a local columnist who  has fished with Ray over the years. "He'll point to an area holding two or  three fish and I'll have to really strain to see them."  </P> <P> Ray's eye for corbina, which range from southern Baja California to Point  Conception, becomes evident before long, as he begins to spot fish in the surf.  </P> <P> "There's one," he shouts as he points to the swirling corbina. "Did you see  that big ol' one over there?"  </P> <P> Before long, Beebe is hooked up, his seven-foot ultra-light rod bent almost  double. Ray doesn't get excited. "It's just a small one," he suggests. "It'll  go 1 1/2, maybe 1 3/4 pounds."  </P> <P> After about five minutes, Beebe has landed the fish, bearing out Ray's  prediction.  </P> <P> Ray and Beebe then walk farther north, Ray scouting the surf line while  recalling the five-pounders that had come in so far to feed that he had to  "kick them off the sand bars," or how the corbina will sometimes "stand on its  head while digging through the sand for hard-shells (sand crabs)."  </P> <P> Sand crabs represent 90% of the corbina's diet -- some insist the fish's flesh  tastes similar to crab meat -- and Ray says that 99% of those are hard-shells,  simply because they are abundant. Soft-shelled crabs, though more difficult to  come by, are prized as bait. Ray, while walking, talking and scouting for fish,  digs them up with his big toe.  </P> <P> Asked how he can find them when others can't, he replies, "After 50 years I  better know how."  </P> <P> He then tells how they are usually the last to bury themselves in the sand, and  how they sometimes leave small bumps in the sand after burrowing under.  </P> <P> Soon, he too has hooked up and about 10 minutes later a 3 1/2-pound corbina  lies exhausted on the beach. Ray nonchalantly picks it up and releases it in  the surf.  </P> <P> Moments later he calls to another fisherman, waves him over and points to an  area just in front of him. The fisherman, seeing three fish in a chuck-hole not  more than 10 yards out, casts and eventually lands a 3 1/2-pounder.  </P> <P> By mid-morning, all fishing with Ray have caught a fish. Others have gathered,  but Ray, claiming the tide has risen too far, calls it quits.  </P> <P> "They're still out there," he says. "But I don't even bother when I can't see  them."  </P> <P> Nope. Ray prefers to stalk the corbina, much as one would stalk the bonefish of  the Florida Keys.  </P> <P> "Here, with the right surf in the flats, I can walk along and show you groups  of three fish, five fish or even seven fish," he says, pointing out what has  already become evident.  </P> <P> And when the corbina is hooked, often in ankle-deep water, it gets downright  stubborn, darting out beyond the surf line or merely turning sideways to resist  the angler's pressure. On four-pound test it is a challenge for even the most  experienced angler.  </P> <P> "There are more and more corbina fishermen every year," Ray says. "But they'll  never be fished out because you're not going to find too many people that are  going to catch them."  </P></p>

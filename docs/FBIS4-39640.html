			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 8 June TASS - "If sanctions are imposed on  North Korea, its leadership will have to act adequately to the  situation," North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said.    Speaking at a news conference in Kiev on Wednesday [8 June],  Kim Yong-nam said that "we will choose the concrete form of  self-defence when we know what measures the countries demanding  `punishment' for North Korea intend to take."    The minister stressed that the "nuclear problem is  artificial. It was created by certain circles in the U.S. and  IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) in order to strangle  socialism in the country." "The nuclear crisis on the peninsular  must be solved by the United States and North Korea through  negotiations," he said.    "The participation of other countries is out of the  question," he added.    Commenting on Russia's initiative to convene an  international  meeting on North Korea, Kim Yong-nam described it as  "interesting," adding that "we are studying it."    The minister expressed the confidence that "the intention of  the U.S. and IAEA to inspect nuclear reactors is closely  connected with the opening up of the country's military  facilities." He termed it as an "interference in the internal  affairs of the state." "We are not against inspections, but only  there where there are nuclear reactors," he added.    Speaking about Pyongyang's position, Kim Yong-nam said that  "until the United States fulfills its obligations in full, North  Korea will not join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."  "These obligations call for an end to hostile policy and nuclear  threat to the state, and for preservation of peace and security  on the peninsular, impartial policy and assistance in converting  the reactors working on light water," he said.    "We are in such a position that we cannot trust the United  States unless our conditions are met," the minister said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of </F> Defense: ``Ukraine's Nuclear Facilities'']    [Text] Some foreign mass media continue carrying  information on the critical state of nuclear facilities located  on the territory of Ukraine. They make particularly frequent  references to ``Russian experts,'' officials of the Russian  Ministry of Defense, and some Russian politicians.    Ukraine's minister of defense made a tour of units and  facilities of strategic rocket troops deployed on the territory  of Ukraine and visited temporary storage facilities for nuclear  warheads detached from those missiles that have been taken off  combat duty for an objective evaluation of their condition.    During the trip, Ukraine's Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy  and  officials in charge of the condition of nuclear weapons made  statements for the press.    Lieutenant General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, commander of the  43d Rocket Army of Strategic Rocket Troops:    ``Problems involving maintenance do exist. This is perfectly  understandable. However, there is no need to lay it on thick.  The situation at nuclear facilities is fully under control. We  have all the necessary means for this. Any attempts at drawing  parallels with Chernobyl or something similar are absolutely  groundless.''    Lieutenant General Valeriy Vasylyev, commander of the  Ukrainian Air Force:    ``The strategic aviation within the Ukrainian Air Force is  equipped with nuclear munitions. They are presently reliably  stored. Even though our aviators also have numerous problems,  there cannot even be talk about a critical situation. Such  assertions do not correspond to reality.''    Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's minister of  defense:    ``On the instructions of the president and in accordance  with  a special program, we, together with military specialists and  scientists, visited all the facilities where nuclear weapons are  stored. Our main task was to obtain objective information on  the operational status of nuclear warheads and assess the  quality of their maintenance and storage. We particularly  wanted to find out what additional measures need to be taken  locally with regard to such important issues as the security and  defense of the facilities and protection from fire and  detonation.''    ``Of course, we have enough problems. Particularly so on the  eve of negotiations on these issues with the Russian side. In  the very near future, we plan a meeting with the Russian  Federation's defense minister [Pavel Grachev]. A whole package  of documents have been elaborated and will be discussed. It is  important that both we and Russia show a willingness to  constructively resolve all problems that are emerging.''    ``Therefore, one should not overdramatize the situation, as  some journalists and politicians have done. The situation at  the missile facilities is satisfactory. We are taking  additional measures to reinforce security, maintain normal  conditions for storing nuclear warheads, and provide units and  subunits of strategic troops with everything necessary.''</p>

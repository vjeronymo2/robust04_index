			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Rule by number not OK: Voting cannot change an ethnic identity, in Belfast or in Bosnia My identity is 'national'. Yours is 'ethnic'. Those people over there are 'tribal'. No doubt there are text-books that define those three adjectives, and distinguish them by objective criteria. But in everyday usage they express a value judgment, or even a political prescription. The word 'national' implicitly asserts a right to statehood. Irish nationalists, for example, are people who are proud to be, or think they really should be, citizens of an Irish state. A 'national minority' is a group whose members do not share the national identity of the majority of their fellow citizens. They may accept that situation as tolerable, but in their hearts they identify with another state - which may already exist on the other side of a frontier, or may as yet be only a dream. If I call such a group an 'ethnic minority' I am implicitly distancing myself from those aspirations. By calling someone an 'ethnic Hungarian', for instance, I am saying: 'This chap likes to think of himself as a Hungarian, and we must respect his culture and identity, but of course he is a Romanian (or Slovak or Serbian) citizen and there is no question of that changing.' So 'ethnic conflict' is something regrettable, in which the speaker is implicitly neutral; whereas a 'national struggle' is something heroic, in which there are goodies (a nation defending its right to exist and the rightful frontiers of its state) and baddies (an imperial power denying that right, or an aggressor violating those frontiers). As for 'tribes', they are definitely uncivilised. A 'tribal' conflict is not merely regrettable but deplorable and irrational. If I refer to 'tribal' behaviour in a European context there is a strong overtone of racism: I am saying that people who behave like that are not truly European. And if I call a group's aspirations 'tribal', I imply that they need not be taken seriously. Most English people think of Northern Ireland as tribal. They see the violence there as profoundly irrational; they make no distinction between the different groups engaging in it; they tend to see Northern Irish society and culture as producers of violence, more than as victims of it; and they have little patience with, or interest in, the political programmes of any of the Northern Irish parties. Actually the issue in Northern Ireland is simple. It is a conflict between rival national or (if we wish to be superior and neutral about it) ethnic identities. One side feels Irish and would like to be part of a united Ireland, though it is deeply divided about how feasible that is as a political objective, and about what means are legitimate, or likely to be effective, in pursuing it. The other side is deeply confused about its national identity (British? Scots? 'Ulster'?) but is absolutely clear that it is not part of the Irish nation and does not want to be part of the Irish state. The British instinct is that the matter should be settled in a sensible British way, by a show of hands. Thus successive British governments have said that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK so long as that is what the majority wants, and at least twice this century referendums have been held to make sure that the majority has not changed its mind. Ironically the same mistake was made, with even more disastrous consequences, by the European Community when it called for a referendum before recognising the republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina. It is a mistake to suppose that such questions can be settled by majority vote, because the notion of a majority vote (and even more so that of majority rule) presupposes the prior consent of the minority to be bound by the result. In other words, both sides have to form part of a pre-existing political community, committed to stay together whichever way they go. If no such community exists, you cannot call it into existence simply by establishing that one side is more numerous than the other - a fact that both sides are usually well aware of already. Democracy is not the same as demography. Even if, by virtue of differential birth and migration rates, the Protestants one day find themselves the minority in Northern Ireland, they will not thereby be convinced that they should accept Irish unity or that it is a good thing - any more than their grandparents were convinced by the fact that they were a minority in Ireland as a whole. Indeed, it is probably the fear of such a scenario, rather than 'blind' revenge for IRA atrocities, that motivates the growing number of murders by Protestant paramilitaries. Mowing down innocent people in a village in County Londonderry, where Catholics and Protestants mix and Sinn Fein scarcely gets a vote, makes no sense if the object is retaliation against the IRA. But it does make sense, in a horribly familiar way, if the object is to drive the two communities further apart, persuading both that they can feel safe only in ethnically homogeneous and militarily defensible territorial blocs. 'Ethnic cleansing' is the ghastly price some people are prepared to pay, or to make others pay, rather than let themselves be dragooned, even by the ballot-box, into a nation-state they do not recognise as theirs. How wise, then, of Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, to make the consent of the unionist community, rather than simply of a majority in Northern Ireland, one of the six 'guiding principles' for an agreement which he set out last week. The Irish conflict is not about majorities and minorities; it is about the co-existence, peaceful or otherwise, of people with sharply different national identities.</p>

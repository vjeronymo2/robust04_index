			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Border shows 40% advance to Pounds 1.22m A 40 per cent advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 866,000 to Pounds 1.22m, was announced by Border Television, the USM-quoted regional operator based in Cumbria, for the year to April 30. The result was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 11.8m - principally due to reduced programme sales of Pounds 732,000(Pounds 1.55m) following ITV network changes. Advertising sales, however, improved by 1.5 per cent, a 'creditable performance in depressed conditions,' the company said. The outcome reflected cost controls and an emphasis on conserving cash resources. The cost reduction programme would continue, the company said. Earnings per share improved to 7.6p (6p) and the proposed final dividend of 1.6p lifts the total to 2.7p (2.1p). For the remainder of 1992 advertising revenues were expected to achieve at best marginal growth, directors said. They were confident, however, that their arrangement in the north for Granada to market and sell its airtime would be beneficial. Border has holdings in Radio Borders and South-West Sound in Scotland and has recently acquired a 30 per cent holding in Morecambe Bay Radio. It is also part of a consortium bidding for the Carlisle radio franchise.</p>

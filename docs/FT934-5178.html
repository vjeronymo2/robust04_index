			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: Glass meets Poe in the House of Usher - Opera Five or six years ago the minimalist composer Philip Glass took a break from writing monster stage-pieces, to devise (with Arthur Yorinks) a chamber opera after one of Edgar Allan Poe's most famous horror tales. The Fall of the House of Usher had its premiere in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988; the following summer, Music Theatre Wales staged it at the Vale of Glamorgan Festival. Last week they revived it for the Huddersfield Festival of Contemporary Music, and it is touring southward to reach the Queen Elizabeth Hall on December 18. I caught up with it in the Oxford Playhouse on Sunday. Michael McCarthy's efficient production fitted the stage well, with Richard Aylwin's chunky set suggesting both hi-tech cruelties and the gloom of a Victorian pile - it doubles as Roderick Usher's library and the family vault, with plenty of stage mist. The neurasthenic Roderick, as you may remember, is the last of his line, devoted (possibly incestuously) to his fey sister Madeline. She dies, and is duly interred - but she is not quite dead. In one of Poe's craziest, most overwrought visions, a friend of Roderick's reads from an ancient epic over weirdly apposite sound-effects, the sounds of Madeline struggling out of coffin and vault to expire at last on her brother's breast: cue fall of House. The grip of the original tale depends upon the wild efflorescence of Poe's language. For operatic purposes, of course, most of that has to go. When Debussy set out to make a one-acter of it, the music instead was to recreate the haunted atmosphere. It is a tribute to Glass's indomitable chutzpah that with Debussy's fragments now recovered, filled out by other hands and staged, he should set the story in his own chugging style, as much brutalist as minimalist. Endlessly repeated chords and arpeggios, mostly bland and diatonic: the odd 'wrong' note is slipped into the harmony for piquancy, but it never leads anywhere. One half-expected that the Glass manner might suit the obsessive character of the tale, but despite the 12-strong band and a keen conductor, Michael Rafferty, the effect is soon soporific - except when the volume is rudely turned up to make climaxes. Early Glass used to be altogether more interesting. The plot does not bear stretching over two acts (two hours with interval). The principals - Julian Pike as Roderick, Anne-Margrethe Elkaas as Madeline, Gwion Thomas as the faceless friend - strove ably to invest their plain vocal lines with intensity and character beyond what the music contains. Glassophiles may detect more virtue in this piece than I could do; well, they will get their chance on the South Bank.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO NEWS  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> Last Sunday marked the 100th anniversary of Charlie Chaplin's birth, and Key  Video is celebrating the occasion this week with the re-release of 11 tapes  containing the comedian/director's greatest films at the bargain price of  $19.98. Included are "City Lights," "Modern Times," "Monsieur Verdoux," "The  Great Dictator" and a combined "The Kid"/"The Idle Class."  </P> <P> Another classic new on videocassette this week is "The Merry Widow" (MGM/UA,  $29.95), the 1934 Ernst Lubitsch comedy/musical starring Maurice Chevalier and  Jeanette MacDonald.  </P> <P> On a far less sublime level, the week's video pickings include the action  thriller with the silliest movie title of 1988, "Amsterdamned" (Vestron,  $89.98, R), and the silly-headed "Cocktail" (Touchstone, $89.95, R), featuring  Tom Cruise as an acrobatic bartender -- before "Rain Man" made him respectable  again.  </P> <P> Other new releases include (remarkably soon after its theatrical release) "Some  Girls" (MGM/UA, $89.95, R), which The Times' Sheila Benson called "a smart,  enticing enchantment that may be the first sexual comedy to look like an Art  Nouveau fairy tale," "Memories of Me" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13), a father-son  comedy/drama with Alan King and Billy Crystal, "Nijinsky" (Paramount, no  suggested price), a 1980 movie about the great, eccentric dancer, directed by  Herbert Ross ("The Turning Point"), "Under the Gun" (Magnum, $79.98, R), a  violent thriller starring singer/former Miss America Vanessa Williams, and  several Nelson Eddy/Jeanette MacDonald musicals from the '30s and early '40s:  "Sweethearts," "I Married an Angel," "The Girl of the Golden West," "Bitter  Sweet" and "The Chocolate Soldier" ($29.95 each).  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER VIDEOS  </P> <P> Chaplin also figures in what's perhaps the most carefully crafted, informative  and entertaining documentary series ever made about the silent film.  "Hollywood," shown both on PBS and in commercial-channel syndication, is now  available in thirteen 52-minute volumes from HBO ($19.99 each). The superb  series, put together by David Gill and Kevin Brownlow and narrated by James  Mason, features detailed, often revelatory looks at the more important aspects  of the art. Chaplin and Buster Keaton are the focus of the excellent "Comedy --  A Serious Business" entry.  </P> <P> Legends from a different field are captured in concert film seen previously  only on Cinemax cable: "Jimi Hendrix: Live in Monterey, 1967" and "Otis  Redding: Live in Monterey, 1967" are the complete performances (seen in part in  "Monterey Pop"). Both are available from HBO ($19.99) as are "The Doors: Live  in Europe, 1968" and "John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band: Live Peace in  Toronto, 1969."  </P> <P> Paramount is releasing three of the "Live from Lincoln Center" performances  seen on PBS: "The Barber of Seville" (1976, Beverly Sills), "Giselle" (1977,  Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshinikov) and "An Evening with Danny Kaye"  (1981). The tapes carry no suggested retail price -- check with your dealer for  details regarding rental or purchase. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

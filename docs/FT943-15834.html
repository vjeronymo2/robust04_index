			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Observer: Rum rationing Dash it all, is no British naval tradition safe? Already under fire from the merchant shipping industry for allegedly being less than generous to ships flying the red ensign, from August 1 the government intends scuppering medium frequency Morse code, used for transmitting weather and navigational information. The medium frequency is used by ships up to 250 miles distant from the coast. Mariners further out will still be able to tune into high frequency Morse messages, but the medium frequency will be retained just for search and rescue alerts. This distressing move will annually save the Maritime Safety Agency the paltry sum of Pounds 200,000. Time for the one Morse message familiar to every school child: Dot-dot-dot dash-dash-dash dot-dot-dot.</p>

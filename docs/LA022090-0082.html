			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> WORKING MOMS: Working Mother magazine listed America's "Ten Best Cities for  Working Moms," but omitted Irvine, which in the past has received accolades for  its commitment to child care. . . . That's OK, says Irvine child-care  coordinator Nancy Noble, "they just don't know about us." . . . She concedes,  however, that the county is behind the child-care curve, with only Irvine and  Anaheim having child-care coordinators. "The county, traditionally, because of  its conservative nature, has been a little slower on child care, mainly because  it considered it a private sector thing."

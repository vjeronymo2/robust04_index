			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimean Internal Affairs Minister Oleksandr Plyuta  has asked the Crimean president to not consider him as a  candidate to head the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVS]  when a new government is formed. This is how the minister  reacted to an interview Meshkov held with INTERFAX, in which he  accused the Crimean MVS and its leadership of corruption and  inability to effectively fight crime.    At a time of distrust, when the press, your team, and you  personally are spreading mass fabrications and rumors that the  MVS and its leadership are connected with criminals; when legal  nihilism and the lack of control came into being under your  administration, it is practically impossible to work -- thus  reads a letter written by Oleksandr Plyuta to Yuryy Meshkov.</p>

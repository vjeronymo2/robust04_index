			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NEELY FUELS STREAKING BRUINS PAST WHALERS, 4-1  </P> <P> Cam Neely is in his seventh season in the NHL. The first three were at  Vancouver, a team that never was a winner.  </P> <P> Since joining the Boston Bruins, the veteran right wing has blossomed into a  star. It has helped that the Bruins are usually a contender.  </P> <P> These days Neely is excited. He has the feeling the Bruins are ready to go  after the Stanley Cup. He is doing his part.  </P> <P> Neely scored the tiebreaking goal Monday night at Boston and assisted on  another to lead the Bruins to a 4-1 victory over the Hartford Whalers.  </P> <P> The Bruins, leading the Adams Division, have won 10 of their last 12 games and  have the best overall record (27-16-3).  </P> <P> "I'm excited about this club," said Neely, who has 32 goals. "We have the size  and strength we have lacked. We're ready to play anybody."  </P> <P> Boston goalie Andy Moog made 32 saves.  </P> <P> Toronto 7, Chicago 6 -- A controversial goal by Wendel Clark with 6:15  remaining in regulation enabled the improving Maple Leafs to finish their  homestand with a 6-1-1 record.  </P> <P> Chicago goaltender Jacques Cloutier had his mitt covering the puck after a  shot. But Clark poked at it, finally dislodging the puck and sending it over  the line.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks claimed the play should have been blown dead, but referee Ron  Hoggarth allowed the goal.  </P> <P> Montreal 4, Minnesota 3 -- Todd Ewen's first goal of the season with 8:42  remaining in regulation at Montreal gave the Canadiens the victory.  </P> <P> Ewen, acquired from St. Louis, knocked in the rebound of a shot by Brian  Skrudland. It was the 13th game Ewen played since being traded by the Blues.  DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

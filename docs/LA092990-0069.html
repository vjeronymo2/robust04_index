			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> BERNSTINE'S BLOCKING PANNED  </P> <P> Don't strain yourself looking for Rod Bernstine on the field. The former tight  end, now a running back and sometime H-back, has played sparingly because of  less-than-devastating blocking skills.  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning received a plethora of letters from boosters in past  weeks suggesting he could make better use of Bernstine at tight end. Henning  offered a rebuttal Friday at a luncheon for Charger backers.  </P> <P> "Rod Bernstine is a very versatile, good athlete," he said. "His blocking  operation right now is minimal. If he were to be a big-time blocker, as a tight  end with those types of receiving abilities, then you could put him in the game  more often. You have to have a threat to be a blocker, or you'd better be a  receiver that can beat the defensive back, because if they don't think you can  block they put a defensive back on you and say 'OK, run.' So Rod is at that  stage in his career that he needs to improve his blocking."  </P> <P> Wide receiver Nate Lewis, second in the AFC with a 25-yard average in six  kickoff returns, aggravated a shoulder injury in practice and is questionable  for Sunday's game against the Houston Oilers at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Because Houston's run-and-shoot offense will tax Charger defensive backs,  Henning had planned to use running back Darrin Nelson on the kickoff team in  place of cornerback Donald Frank, who will play about three times more than  usual. If Lewis can't play, he will be replaced by either Frank or wide  receiver Anthony Miller. Nelson will fill the other spot.  </P> <P> "We think we can use Darrin in that capacity," Henning said. "We've seen pluses  and minuses in Donald, and Donald is playing full-time now because of the  run-and-shoot. We're trying to take as much of a load off those secondary guys  for this game as we possibly can."  </P> <P> Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, from the one-stoplight town of Boyd, Tex., was  brimming with Lone Star state pride Friday, and what better time with the  Houston Oilers arriving in town.  </P> <P> "What Texas needs to do is secede from the United States and run  independently," he said. "Except it's such a great state and the United States  needs it to survive. They would probably take the military in there and take it  back."  </P> <P> Safety Vencie Glenn doesn't plan to stand around too long watching from the  sidelines. Glenn, who has started 54 consecutive games for the Chargers, will  miss the Houston game because of a concussion he suffered against Cleveland  Sunday.  </P> <P> Asked about the possibility of a trip to the injured reserve list, Glenn said:  "That isn't my decision. All I know is I'm not playing this week, and I'll be  ready to play the next one."  </P> <P> Lester Lyles will fill in at safety.  </P> <P> "I'm taking it in stride," Lyles said. "I've been in this league six years, and  these kind of things happen. I've been in this spot many times before. It's  just a matter of keeping a cool head."  </P> <P> In partial reaction to the sexual harassment charge Boston Herald sportswriter  Lisa Olson has made against the New England Patriots, the Chargers decided to  change the location of Henning's post-game interviews to allow an empty room  for female sportswriters to conduct interviews outside of the dressing area.  </P> <P> NFL rules allow women equal access to the locker room, and Henning said female  writers will have the choice of entering the locker room or using the separate  interview room.  </P> <P> "We're trying to avoid the type of thing that possibly might have happened in  New England," Henning said.  </P> <P> Tackle Joel Patten, who had arthroscopic surgery before training camp, will be  eligible to come off injured reserve Monday, but Henning said Patten will  probably remain inactive to allow for further healing. "He feels like he could  probably go," Henning said, "but the doctors are telling him that if he did go  . . . he might only last three or four weeks, whereas if he waits awhile  longer, his career might be longer too." . . . Cornerback Gill Byrd said  doctors have still not determined the illness of his 6-year-old son, Gill Jr.,  who has been running a fever and suffering from sore joints the past two weeks.  "They've taken a conservative approach, just doing blood tests and bone scans,"  Byrd said. "I think they may start taking a more aggressive approach and try to  find out what is actually wrong."

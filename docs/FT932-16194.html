			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Early bill payment move 'undermined' MINISTERS' attempts to persuade public-sector organisations to set an example to industry by paying their bills on time are being undermined by some government departments, according to an industry group. A survey of 129 companies supplying heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment published yesterday shows that public-sector bodies remain among the slowest payers. The building management and construction arms of the publicly owned Property Services Agency (PSA) had the worst record for payments, according to the survey conducted by the Heating and Ventilating Contractors' Association. The PSA construction division has since been sold to Tarmac, the large construction and building materials group, while the building management arm is still up for sale. Companies were asked at the start of this year how long on average it took for organisations, such as the PSA, to pay bills after the contractors had submitted claims. PSA management took on average 93 days while PSA projects, the construction division, took 91 days on average. Other government organisations also performed poorly, the study says. The Ministry of Defence took 42 days to settle its bills and the Home Office 41 days. On average government bodies took 27 days between receiving a claim and making payment. The association said that its members working on private-sector contracts would normally expect to be paid within 24 days of submitting a claim. The association said that the PSA, which acts as main contractor on many government projects, refused to pay sub-contractors until it had first been paid by whichever public body it was working for. The association's survey showed that local authorities on average took 65 days to settle their bills while hospital boards and trusts took 52 days. Privatised utilities such as British Gas and the water companies were among the best payers taking 26 days on average to settle accounts. The government recently published a green paper on the late payment issue and by the end of this year large companies are expected to be obliged to state in their accounts the average time taken to pay their bills.</p>

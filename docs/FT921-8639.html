			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Algeria presses Gulf states for aid ALGERIA is pressing Gulf states and potential aid donors for up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in emergency assistance to combat severe economic difficulties, which it blames for recent Islamic fundamentalist-inspired unrest. Mr Lakdar Brahimi, Algeria's foreign minister, visited Saudi Arabia at the weekend at the start of a Gulf tour apparently aimed at securing Arab financial support. According to Algerian officials, Mr Brahimi is taking a similar message to that put in Lisbon, last week, to his Portuguese counterpart, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro. 'We need assistance right now,' said one official. 'If, tomorrow, there is civil war, the instability will be felt everywhere, including Europe and the Arab world.' A state of emergency was declared in Algeria about a week ago after days of rioting had left at least 50 people dead and hundreds wounded. The disturbances followed the cancellation of a second round of voting in national elections in which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was certain to consolidate a landslide victory. Algeria's plea for additional help coincides with delicate negotiations with its main creditor banks for the 're-profiling' of about Dollars 1.5bn in short-term commercial debt. Algerian central bank officials insist they are not seeking rescheduling, but are asking instead for an extension of the debt's maturities to an average of about eight years. About 85 per cent of the debt is owed to Japanese and French banks. Attempts by a core group of creditor banks, led by Credit Lyonnais to reach agreement on a 're-profiling' package are being held up because of objections by Bankers Trust of the US whose limited exposure in Algeria amounts to about USDollars 20m. It is estimated that such an arrangement would release about Dollars 800m to help fund imports of raw materials, spare parts and equipment to spur Algeria's recovery. The government is finalising an emergency economic programme aimed at solving Algeria's chronic housing problem and at providing jobs for an army of unemployed young people. Algeria, whose external debt totals about Dollars 27bn has been squeezed since the mid-1980s by the collapse in oil prices. Its economy - oil and gas account for 97 per cent of export earnings - has registered negative growth in recent years, and its difficulties in meeting its debt commitments have added to its economic woes. Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, head of a military-backed five-man presidency set up to rule Algeria, told the foreign press yesterday there 'may be 5,000 to 6,000' FIS supporters in detention camps. It was the first official acknowledgement that such a large number of suspected FIS activists had been rounded up. Previously, government officials had spoken of hundreds. The authorities are known to have established several detention centres outside Algiers to accommodate people arrested under the state of emergency declared more than a week ago.</p>

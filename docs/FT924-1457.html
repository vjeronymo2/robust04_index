			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / BA furthers global ambitions with ADollars 665m stake in Qantas BRITISH AIRWAYS took an important step yesterday in its strategy to become a global airline by acquiring a 25 per cent stake for ADollars 665m (Pounds 291m) in Qantas, the Australian national carrier. The UK carrier was chosen by the Australian government as the preferred foreign airline partner for Qantas against stiff competition from Singapore Airlines. The Qantas deal coincides with growing signs that BA is likely to fail in its efforts to win US government approval for its proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 476m) acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will make a final attempt to secure US government approval for the BA-USAir deal during talks with President George Bush at Camp David tomorrow. BA said it had 'significant cash resources and external borrowing facilities' to finance the Qantas stake. The deal is the first stage in the privatisation of the state-owned Australian carrier. The Australian government's remaining 75 per cent stake will be sold through a flotation next year. The government said it hoped to receive a further ADollars 1.5bn to ADollars 2bn from the flotation, which would value the airline at between ADollars 2.1bn and ADollars 2.6bn. Foreign financial institutions will be allocated 10 per cent of the stock, which may be listed on overseas stock exchanges. The net return to the government will be between ADollars 800m and ADollars 1.3bn, after providing for a ADollars 1.35bn recapitalisation of Qantas through the conversion of ADollars 1.2bn debt to equity and a cash injection of ADollars 150m. But the flotation may have to be delayed until 1993-94 to avoid a clash with the next federal election, due to be held by June. BA's bid was accepted after Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, topped a rival offer from Singapore Airlines in last minute negotiations in Canberra with Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's finance minister. Mr Willis said BA also offered greater strategic benefits to Qantas than Singapore Airlines, which sought to buy 20 per cent of the Australian carrier. Mr Willis said Australian control of Qantas and its identity as a national flag carrier would not be jeopardised. BA's bid had met some strong opposition in Australia because of fears that the UK carrier would seek to dominate Qantas. But BA, which will be allocated three seats on a new 12-seat Qantas board to be chaired by an Australian, went to considerable lengths to reassure its critics it had no intention of seeking control. BA also said it planned to sign a 10-year commercial agreement with Qantas and establish a joint committee to identify areas of potential co-operation. The two carriers have an association dating back to 1933 when the then Qantas Empire Airways was formed. BOAC sold its shares in Qantas to the Australian government in 1947. Sir Colin said the deal would provide 'significant benefits' for both airlines by linking BA's strong North American and European networks with Qantas's Pacific and Asian routes. BA has now fulfilled its ambitions in Asia and Europe, where it recently took over Dan-Air in the UK and acquired large stakes in a French and a German regional carrier, but it is facing an uphill battle to gain approval for its proposed USAir deal. The US has been seeking greater access for its carriers in the London market in return for approving the BA-USAir transaction. This has so far been vigorously resisted by the UK side.

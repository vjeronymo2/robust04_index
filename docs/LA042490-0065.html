			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Garbo a Paul Lynde Fan?: What did Greta Garbo do while she was alone all that  time? She watched a lot of TV, according to People magazine.  </P> <P> Although the reclusive star collected valuable art and antiques (her will named  her niece as sole beneficiary), her taste in television was rather pedestrian.  Raymond Daum, a friend of the actress, told the magazine that Garbo once said,  "If a program is advertised as experimental, I never turn it on." Kenny  Kingston, a psychic whom Garbo consulted, says she was especially enthralled by  "Hollywood Squares": "She adored Paul Lynde. I think she even wrote him a fan  letter." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

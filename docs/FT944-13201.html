			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: The negative aspect of trying to keep all the equity - Stanhope needs a short-term financial fix to give its principal asset time to bear fruit Stanhope's struggle for survival is perhaps the last great battle of the 1980s' property boom. The company, under its founder Mr Stuart Lipton, was responsible for many of the decade's high-profile developments, including the 3.5m sq ft Broadgate office complex in the City of London. As Stanhope searches for ways of repaying the Pounds 140m owed to its 16 banks, its fortunes are closely linked with those of Broadgate. The prized development is Stanhope's main asset, held through its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties, and the main reason why an outside investor would want to step in. As a working environment, there is no doubt that Broadgate is an outstanding success. It has attracted 20,000 workers to an area of the City previously considered a backwater. But as a financial structure, Broadgate already looks dated. It was funded almost exclusively with bank loans, using non-recourse financing techniques imported from the US by Mr Godfrey Bradman, chief executive of Rosehaugh, which owned the other half of Broadgate Properties until its receivership in 1992. In a rising property market this style of finance was attractive to developers. By keeping all the equity for themselves, they also hoped to collect as property values increased. Mr Bradman is reported to have said: 'You can lose as much on a small development if it goes wrong as on a major project, but the upside is not nearly as exciting.' Yet problems arose when property values started to fall. Despite holding assets valued at over Pounds 1bn, once debts were deducted, the value of Broadgate to its shareholders fell to only Pounds 148m at June 30 1993. With few other assets and Pounds 140m debt of its own, Stanhope showed negative net worth of Pounds 15.7m at the same date. Yesterday's results from Broadgate Properties show that the position has improved. Stanhope should show positive net assets when its results for the year to the end of June are announced. Increasing property values also add weight to Mr Lipton's argument that it would be foolish to sell Broadgate into a rising market. A forecast commissioned by the company from Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, suggested that rents at Broadgate could rise to Pounds 50 a square foot by June 1997, from perhaps Pounds 30 a square foot today. On this assumption, Broadgate Properties' assets might be worth about Pounds 1.3bn in three years' time. If its debts remained at about the same level, its value to shareholders could quickly rise to Pounds 500m. While some property professionals regard this forecast as a little ambitious, most are prepared to concede that Jones Lang Wootton's expectations for rental growth are not wildly aggressive. The shortage of prime quality offices in core areas of the City of London means that space at Broadgate should command a premium price. In principle, Stanhope's syndicate of 16 lending banks would probably agree that it would be better to hold on to Broadgate. But while they are sympathetic towards Mr Lipton's position, their prime interest lies in having their loans repaid by the December 16 deadline. Stanhope needs an equity injection to allow this to happen. The search for a partner willing to invest anything up to Pounds 100m - codenamed Project Phoenix - started late last year. By February, Stanhope was close to agreeing terms with an east Asian investor, believed to be Singapore Land. The plan envisaged Singapore Land taking a 30 per cent stake in Stanhope through a Pounds 150m rights issue. Bankers close to the deal say there were even thoughts of buying the other 50 per cent of Broadgate Properties from Rosehaugh's receiver, in which case the rights issue would have looked to raise anything up to Pounds 260m. The move in February by British Land, the property company run by Mr John Ritblat, to buy 30 per cent of Stanhope changed everything. The shares came to British Land, via Bank of Nova Scotia, from Olympia &amp; York, the failed Canadian developer responsible for Canary Wharf which bought the stake in 1988. Stanhope waged a long but ultimately unsuccessful legal battle to prevent British Land acquiring the shares. According to Mr Lipton, the episode also scared off his white knight, which was not prepared to tangle with Mr Ritblat. By the time the legal proceedings finished in May, Project Phoenix was back to square one. In a statement earlier this month Stanhope said that it was talking to a number of interested parties, but that any offer was likely to made at less than the prevailing 26p share price. Among those rumoured to have been in negotiations with Stanhope are Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which run substantial property funds, and Chelsfield, the property investment and development company run by Mr Elliott Bernard. Mr Ritblat, of course, still has a 30 per cent stake in Stanhope and has made no secret of his desire to take control of Broadgate. With the banking deadline looming, the outcome will be determined over the next few weeks. Stanhope's advisers still hope to find a way of rescuing the company while at the same time buying the other 50 per cent shareholding in Broadgate Properties from Rosehaugh's receiver. Such a deal would increase the value of the assets at a stroke, since the whole would be worth more than the sum of its parts. The point is not lost on the banks in Stanhope's syndicate, which also made loans to Rosehaugh. Through the receiver they already own Rosehaugh's stake in Broadgate Properties. If Stanhope were to fail they would effectively have control of the development. The banks would rather avoid such an outcome. If Stanhope can find a formula which offers them full repayment - or something close to it - there is every sign that the relatively small lending syndicate will be supportive. For shareholders who backed Mr Lipton's vision in the 1980s, though, the choice is likely to be between accepting little or nothing.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            THE ASSETS EQUATION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         STANHOPE PROPERTIES PLC             Debt: Pounds 140m*      Net assets: Pounds 10m*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUBSIDIARIES 100 PERCENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Net assets: negligible Watling House Stanhope Interior Stanhope Estates Management Stanhope Development Management  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BP GROUP 50 PERCENT      SKP GROUP 50 PERCENT     LRC GROUP 33 PERCENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Net assets:              Net assets:              Net assets: Pounds 232m              Pounds 10m*              negligible Broadgate                Stockley park 58%        Kings Cross Ludgate                  Euston                          London Wall  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           STC GROUP 50 PERCENT        SCL GROUP 50 PERCENT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Net assets:                 Net assets:           Pounds 42m*                 negligible           Chiswick Park               St. George Court  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BANKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays Bank        First Austrian Bank        Long-term Credit Credit Suisse        Industrial Bank of Japan     Bank of Japan Lloyds Bank          Sumitomo Bank              Mitsubishi Bank Nippon Credit Bank   Bank of America            Sakura Bank Societe Generale     Dai-ichi- Kangyo           Asahi Bank Bank Leu                                        Bank of Tokyo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company Accounts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Analysts' Estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

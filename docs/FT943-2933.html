			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Our man in . . . What do the following have in common: North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, World Trade Organisation? Answer: all three are intergovernmental bodies (though the third technically does not exist yet) currently in search of a chief executive. In all three cases the choice will be made by the governments of the member states. That in turn means it will be decided through political negotiation, as opposed to the kind of selection procedures whereby senior posts in other organisations are normally filled. Purists deplore this, but it could not really be otherwise. Such jobs are not purely managerial or technical. They have a political content, greater in some cases than others, and governments must be expected to have an eye to their national interests in arguing for one sort of candidate rather than another. But where many governments go wrong is in assuming that national interest is best served by securing such posts for their own nationals. This is insulting to the candidates in question, since the terms of reference invariably require the holder of the post to act as the servant of the organisation as a whole, and to forswear partiality towards their own country. On the whole this requirement is taken seriously, and it is not unknown for such people, once in office, to cause their own governments considerable irritation. It would not matter if governments simply vied with each other to put up the best candidate. But in many cases they seem determined to get the job for 'their' man (or woman) irrespective of merit. That leads to unseemly horse-trading, and to the notion that countries disappointed in one race are entitled to 'compensation' in another - a pretension which becomes offensive and ridiculous when the bodies in question have quite different memberships and purposes. Thus Canada, Iceland, Norway, Turkey and the US, none of them members of the EU, are expected to accept a Belgian secretary-general of Nato, with little or no experience of defence policy, because the Belgian prime minister was denied the presidency of the European Commission. At least in Nato's case there is some sense in the tradition of having a European as secretary-general, since the supreme allied commander in Europe is always an American. It is far less obvious why the tradition of having a European secretary-general of Gatt should be carried forward into the WTO; let alone why non-Europeans should be expected to accept whatever candidate the EU chooses, especially when that choice itself is dictated by a trade-off in the contest for a quite different post. In each case the effectiveness of the organisation is being sacrificed, and the internationalist spirit it is supposed to embody is being ignored.</p>

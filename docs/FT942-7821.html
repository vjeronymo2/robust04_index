			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Measure for measure - The Inland Revenue has its eye on partners who plan to exploit tax changes, warns Robert Rice Tough measures against tax avoidance, designed to limit the scope for the UK's 9m self-employed people to exploit changes in personal taxation, have been outlined by the Inland Revenue. Many accountants had described the changes in personal taxation for the self-employed, announced in the 1994 Finance Bill, as a significant, one-off, tax-planning opportunity for UK partnerships. The bill covers the introduction of self-assessment, and the changeover from taxation on a preceding-year basis to a current-year basis from the 1997-98 tax year. But the Inland Revenue's announcement has made this opportunity less attractive. Mrs Denise Catterall, a tax partner of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, had said that transitional rules, while the changes were being introduced, would enable partnerships to plan their tax payments. For partnerships in existence on April 5 this year, 1996-97 will be a transitional year. Under the transitional provisions, tax paid in 1996-97 will be a 12 months' average of the tax payable on the profits arising in the two years to April 5 1996. Thus for a partnership with a year end of April 30, the relevant accounts on which tax will be assessed for the transitional year 1996-97 will be for the periods May 1 1994 to April 30 1995 and May 1 1995 to April 30 1996. Tax will be payable on 12/24ths, or half, of those results. To take advantage of the transitional rules, partnerships anticipating any large or unusual items of income were advised to try to ensure payment would be made during the transitional assessment period, as it would effectively be halved for tax averaging purposes. Equally, large one-off items of expenditure, such as refurbishment or redundancy costs, ought to be kept out of the assessment period, because a firm would effectively get tax relief on only half. Some partnerships may have already followed this advice. Firms with 1993-94 financial year ends which have passed may have brought forward exceptional items of expenditure into the 1993-94 tax year or delayed receipt of exceptional income to place it in the 1994-95 tax year. Partnerships which have not yet reached their financial year end could still take advantage of the tax-planning opportunity. But their efforts may have been in vain. When details of the new system were announced, the Inland Revenue also made it clear that it would bring forward a narrowly targeted anti-avoidance measure. Details of how this will work in practice will not be known until next year's finance bill is published, but the Revenue has now published guidelines. The Revenue identifies four 'triggers' which may bring the anti-avoidance rules into play. Two of them - transactions with persons with whom the taxpayer has a family or proprietorial link, and arrangements with unconnected persons which are wholly or partly reciprocal or self-cancelling  -are fairly straightforward. But the other two - a change or modification of an accounting policy, and any changes in business behaviour - could present problems. Mrs Catterall says, as presently envisaged, the last trigger is very widely drawn. It appears to mean that any change in a settled practice of a partnership in relation to the timing of things such as the invoicing of customers and the collection of debts, or the purchase of goods and services, the incurring of business expenses and the settlement of debts, could trigger the anti-avoidance rules. This could catch a law firm which, in an effort to become more efficient, decides to speed up its billing procedures. 'The last trigger effectively gives the Revenue wide-reaching powers to allege that higher profits in the affected transitional periods constitute avoidance of tax,' she says. There are defences to a charge of tax avoidance, but they are narrowly drawn and the onus will be on the taxpayer to prove the Revenue does not have a case. Once the Revenue has challenged a change in accounting policy or business behaviour, it will be satisfied that avoidance has not taken place only if the taxpayer can show: that obtaining a tax advantage was not the main benefit, or one of the main benefits, expected to arise from the change; or that the change was undertaken solely for bona fide commercial reasons. Obtaining a tax advantage will not be regarded as a bona fide commercial reason. However, as obtaining a tax advantage is always likely to be at the back of the mind of the well-advised taxpayer as 'one of the main benefits' arising from a change of business behaviour, it will not be easy to satisfy either of these defences, Mrs Catterall says. But the real sting of the anti-avoidance proposals is in the tail. If the taxpayer tries but fails to convince the Revenue that one of the defences is satisfied, the penalties are heavy. Where, for example, it is shown that profits have been moved into the transitional period, then those profits will be taxed in full (at 40 per cent in the case of a higher rate taxpayer) in addition to being taxed as part of the averaged profits for the two years to 1996. In other words, the profits caught by the anti-avoidance rules will effectively be taxed one and a half times, or at an equivalent rate of 60 per cent. There is time to try to persuade the Revenue to water down the penalties before the finance bill is published early next year. In the meantime, with further guidance from the Revenue as to how the anti-avoidance rules will work in practice unlikely, partnerships still contemplating taking advantage of the tax-planning opportunity must tread carefully.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Yerovchenkov] </F>   [Text] Nicosia June 10 TASS -- "I believe that my visit to  Russia was successful from every point of view, and the talks I  had with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow were very  resultative," Cyprus Foreign Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis  told ITAR-TASS at the International Airport of Larnaca upon his  return home from Russia.    "There are sufficient grounds for this success, because  Russia and Cyprus are linked by good relations from time  immemorial. We have a common culture and we worship the same  religion. The peoples of our two countries are cooperating  fruitfully in the economic sphere".    "I wish to note especially my talks with Andrey Kozyrev,  which were marked by an atmosphere of complete mutual  understanding," the minister stressed. "The Russian side has  displayed not only its understanding of the Cyprus problem, but  also readiness to help resolve it in every possible way. It is  also pertinent to note that Russia is behind two out of the five  versions for settling the Cyprus problem, included in the report  of the U.N. secretary- general. All this gives food for  satisfaction and we hope that a correct way was found to settle  the Cyprus problem."    "Problems linked with the expansion of Russo-Cyprus economic  relations were also thoroughly discussed in Moscow. For  instance, we examined the possibility of implementing an  inter-governmental agreement, which envisages the participation  of Cyprus in the development of one of the Black Sea regions of  Russia, mainly the Krasnodar territory. I have visited that  region and it produced a very good impression on me. I think  that our cooperation with the Krasnodar territory will be  mutually profitable and successful."    "To put it in a nutshell," Mikhailidhis noted, "new broad  vistas for deepening multilateral cooperation are now opening up  before our two nations."</p>

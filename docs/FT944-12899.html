			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Balance in Bosnia shifts Moslems' way Bosnian Moslem forces were yesterday consolidating their grip on 80 square miles of territory in the far north of the republic seized in a lightning offensive over the past three days. Their Bosnian Serb enemies - isolated from their protectors in Belgrade and facing a growing shortage of fuel - were caught unawares by the onslaught and abandoned armour and equipment as they fled, according to the UN. In other potentially ominous developments for the Bosnian Serbs, government forces mounted an assault near the stronghold of Kupres, west of Sarajevo, and the UN and Nato agreed on new procedures for air strikes. General Dragomir Milosevic, a Bosnian Serb commander, pledged to retaliate by shelling 'selected targets' in Sarajevo. This amounted to a threat to restart the brutal bombardment of the Bosnian capital which ended in February. In a clear reference to air strikes, the UN commander General Sir Michael Rose responded by saying: 'If they shell Sarajevo,they know what they can expect.' The Moslem successes reflect a gradual shift in the balance of military power inside Bosnia, thanks to clandestine supplies of light arms and the 'over-stretched' condition of the Bosnian-Serb army as it struggles to hold on to 70 per cent of the republic's territory. The flare-up in Bosnian fighting coincides with a breakthrough in international efforts to achieve a broad reconciliation between Serbs and Croats. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the mediators on former Yugoslavia, announced that Zagreb and Belgrade would start regular consultations at foreign minister level on normalising their relations. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has been told by western countries and Russia that he should recognize Croatia as a precondition for further easing of UN sanctions against his country. On the face of things, both the Bosnian fighting and the peace moves in Croatia are part of a single process: the decision by Mr Milosevic to seek international favour and sever or at least loosen ties with his former proteges in both neighbouring republics. Under one scenario, a Belgrade-Zagreb reconciliation would deepen the Bosnian Serbs' isolation and make them more willing to sue for peace on terms acceptable to the world. A strategic deal between Mr Milosevic and the Croatian government could also neutralize the influence of the stridently nationalist politicians who now control the Serb-occupied areas of Croatia. As things now stand, those politicians are good friends of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader and champion of Serb nationalism in its most diehard form. Few observers see any prospect of the Bosnian partition plandevised by four western nations and Russia being accepted in itscurrent form, and there is scant possibility of the plan's sponsors changing it. But as French officials have pointed out several times, that does not stop the warring parties agreeing among themselves to alter the plan - if and when they all feel that military options have been exhausted. However the latest developments could have other, much less happy consequences. One possibility is that a reversal of the Bosnian Serbs' fortunes will put President Milosevic, and conceivably his friends in Moscow, under unbearable pressure to come to the rescue of Mr Karadzic. Another danger - mentioned recently by General Bertrand de Lapresle, UN commander in ex-Yugoslavia - is that Moslem military successes will put strain on the delicate relations between Moslems and Croats. 'If the Moslems have too strong an army, that could frightenthe Bosnian Croats and render fragile the Croat-Moslem federation,' the French general recently told the French newspaper Le Monde. A third possibility is that even if the Bosnian Serbs eventually seek peace on humiliating terms, there will then be little appetite for compromise among the Moslems' battle-hardened commanders.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister tells Tories to reject free-market dogma ONE OF the rising stars of Mr John Major's government last night called on the Conservative party to abandon the 'slavish adherence' to the economic dogma which characterised the politics of the 1980s. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the collapse of Eastern bloc socialism gave the Conservatives the opportunity to shed their polarised image as a party content simply 'to leave things to the market'. His comments came as Mr Major prepared to underline to the Confederation of British Industry his commitment to industrial revival by calling for a partnership between government and industry across all Whitehall policy areas. He will reaffirm his determination to encourage the joint financing of infrastructure projects by the public and private sectors. The prime minister will also tell the CBI annual dinner tonight that the white paper on science policy being drawn up by Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, will be geared towards improving British industrial competitiveness. In his lecture to the Tory Reform Group last night, Mr Dorrell underlined the break with Thatcherite 'ideology' by arguing that dogmatic attachment to market economics had represented a 'profound misrepresentation of the true Tory position'. Mr Dorrell, who is tipped for membership of the cabinet in the next reshuffle, said that the party should instead recognise that market economics was no more than a means of delivering political objectives. Central to those objectives were higher living standards, but they included also such concepts of social stability, evolutionary change, individual responsibility and the rule of law. 'Economic policies must, therefore, be shaped by our commitment to those wider political objectives, not simply the arid dictates of academic economics.' Mr Dorrell stressed that this did not imply any weakening of the government's resolve to deliver price stability. The relative experiences of Britain and Germany in the post-war period underlined the damage - economic, social and industrial - wrought by failure to control inflation. Admitting candidly the government's past mistakes he added: 'There is no secret why the recession in Britain was longer than elsewhere - we had a higher rate of inflation than our competitors in the 1980s. Recession follows inflation as night follows day.' Mr Dorrell also emphasised that the disciplines of the marketplace provided the essential basis for wealth creation by matching the output of producers with the changing needs of consumers. But adopting a rhetoric calculated to dismay those on the right of the Tory party who cling to the free market doctrines expounded by Baroness Thatcher, he added: 'Market disciplines are not the Holy Grail.' Governments would also want to define the parameters in which market conclusions were acceptable, he said.</p>

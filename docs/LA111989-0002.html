			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> In Superman (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), that romantic and thoroughly  entertaining 1978 fantasy, we're introduced to the comic-book hero who comes  from the planet Krypton -- Marlon Brando, no less, is his father -- to save  Metropolis. Christopher Reeve is as perfect as shy, awkward, myopic Clark Kent  as he is as Superman, embodiment of the invincible hero.  </P> <P> Perry Mason: The Case of the All-Star Assassin (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new  TV movie in which an injured hockey star (Jason Beghe) is accused of murdering  a sports mogul (Pernell Roberts). Raymond Burr stars as Mason.  </P> <P> Outrageous Fortune (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an often hilarious female-bonding  movie that allows Shelley Long's upper-class aspiring actress and Bette  Midler's earthy waitress-cum-actress to be sensational together and as  individual presences. Under Arthur Hiller's direction, this 1987  comedy-adventure has a smart, raucous drive.  </P> <P> Volunteers (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a  disappointing Tom Hanks comedy that finds him cast as the most arrogant rich  boy in Yale's class of '62, who wings off to the jungles of Thailand with the  Peace Corps. Instead of satirizing the incipient activism of the New Frontier,  it's essentially just another mean-spirited yuppie comedy. John Candy co-stars.  </P> <P> Paul Brickman's Risky Business (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a genuinely  funny comedy-fantasy about a young man (Tom Cruise) who, under the sway of  seductive young hooker Rebecca De Mornay, turns his handsome suburban Chicago  home into a brothel while his parents are away.  </P> <P> Connie Sellecca and Wendy Kilbourne star in the new TV movie Turn Back the  Clock (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) in which a woman who kills her husband at midnight  on New Year's Eve gets a chance to prevent this from happening.  </P> <P> In the swift-moving 1986 series pilot Popeye Doyle (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8  p.m.), Ed O'Neill of "Married . . . With Children" has the title role as the  rough-and-tumble New York City detective first played by Gene Hackman in "The  French Connection."  </P> <P> In A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.),  the morbid tone of the original has given way to horror comedy set off by quite  spectacular and imaginative fantasy sequences. This installment is no less  grisly than its predecessors, but at least it invites you to laugh at it.  Robert Englund is back as the hideously disfigured child murderer Freddy  Krueger.  </P> <P> Once Bitten (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a modest, enjoyable 1985 comedy  in which Lauren Hutton, undoubtedly the world's most beautiful vampire, is  finding it harder and harder to locate male virgins whose blood is essential to  preserving her eternal youth.  </P> <P> Slick and scarcely subtle but undeniably potent, Steven Spielberg's Jaws  (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) builds single-mindedly to its big, scary  climax involving that awesome shark. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard  Dreyfuss star.  </P> <P> Animal House (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) was the first in a long line of  movies about the outrageous pranks of college kids obsessed with booze, bad  language and nubile women. John Belushi stars as the worst slob on the campus,  circa 1962. For all its exaggerations the film's roots are firmly established  in the reality of the Greek system at the time.  </P> <P> In the delightful Superman II (CBS Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) our hero (Christopher  Reeve) must at last confront his invincibility, choosing between the woman he  loves, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and the world he has vowed to protect.  </P> <P> The Man in the Santa Claus Suit (Channel 2 Saturday at 8 p.m.), a 1978 TV  movie, stars Fred Astaire (playing seven different characters) in a frothy  Yuletide fantasy about how the proprietor of a costume shop changes the lives  of many people.  </P> <P> Directed by Arthur Hiller, Silver Streak (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is  pleasant and amusing, even if takes a tad too long to arrive at its literally  smashing finish. Gene Wilder and Jill Clayburgh become entangled in adventure  and romance aboard a train bound from L.A. to Chicago. Richard Pryor, as an  amiable crook, steals the picture.  </P> <P> The Freshman (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.), a 1925 Harold Lloyd classic,  finds Lloyd in the title role as a wet-behind-the-ears frosh desperate to be  liked.  </P></p>

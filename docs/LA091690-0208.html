			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: CHOOSING AMONG ARRAY OF SHAREHOLDER SERVICES  </P> <P> The mutual fund business in recent years has borrowed an act from the auto  industry. As competition has become more intense and buyers more  discriminating, fund companies have unveiled additional features -- some of  which have nothing to do with financial performance.  </P> <P> Many of these innovations fall within the realm of shareholder services. They  range from automatic purchase plans to the ability to place open orders when  buying or selling funds. No longer can you be content merely with selecting the  type of investment vehicle you want, or the one with the most powerful engine.  You also need to pick and chose among the various add-ons. Here are some of the  more common shareholder services:  </P> <P> * Automatic-purchase plans. You can choose to buy a mutual fund either in one  lump sum or in increments. With an automatic-purchase or share accumulation  plan, you authorize the fund company to take out a set amount on a fixed  schedule, such as $100 a month, from your checking account. You purchase shares  in small amounts and at various prices, so you don't have to worry about buying  in at a market top.  </P> <P> An automatic-purchase plan can be a handy means for novices to start investing.  "It's a forced savings plan and for most people a relatively painless way to  go," says Mark C. Winmill, senior vice president at the Bull &amp; Bear Group,  a New York-based fund company that's adopting such a program.  </P> <P> Conversely, you can also select to withdraw money from a fund automatically and  at regular intervals. This makes sense if, for example, you're retired and want  to live off of the dividend income that a bond fund generates.  </P> <P> * Dividend-reinvestment plans. But there's a good reason not to tap your  dividends and capital gains distributions. If left alone, this money can be  used to buy additional shares, and that can substantially boost the value of  your account. In fact, over many years, it's likely that reinvested dividends  and capital gains distributions will come to represent a large proportion of  your total profit, bigger even than the nominal appreciation of the stocks or  bonds held by the fund.  </P> <P> * Telephone switching. On the other hand, a lot of people find it too  difficult, emotionally, to remain invested for the long term, and that's where  telephone switching comes in. This option allows you to move from one fund to  another, or back again, with a simple phone call. You may also make exchanges  in writing.  </P> <P> Market timers love the telephone service since it allows them to switch quickly  from a stock or bond fund to a money market portfolio. "I have some real  problems with a buy-and-hold strategy, because it forces you to hang on through  crashes and bear markets," says Charlie Hooper, publisher of the Mutual Fund  Strategist newsletter in Burlington, Vt.  </P> <P> While nearly all fund groups now offer at least one money market portfolio, not  all allow telephone switching. Even so, the service is becoming increasingly  common, especially among no-load and low-load families.  </P> <P> Some firms allow switching, but with restrictions. For example, Twentieth  Century Investors of Kansas City, Mo., requires a 30-day wait between  movements, while several companies limit the number of switches to four round  trips (four buys and four sells) a year. Still other firms impose modest fees  of $5 or so per switch.  </P> <P> But that's not as bad as it might seem. Having investors entering and exiting  too frequently can make it hard for a portfolio manager to run a fund  effectively, to the detriment of other shareholders. Besides, if you switch too  often, you will likely find yourself getting whipsawed. On average, Hooper  flashes about 2.3 round-trip switch signals a year. "If you go beyond four, you  will have problems," he says.  </P> <P> * Wide investment selection. Some people might not classify this as a  shareholder service, but it's something you need to consider if you want to do  all of your investing under one roof. Most medium and large fund families offer  a diverse mix of stock and bond funds that vary greatly in their potential for  risk and returns.  </P> <P> In addition, most fund groups will accept your investment dollars in the form  of a retirement account -- IRAs for individuals, 401(k) plans for companies and  Keoghs for the self-employed. Dozens of funds that normally require relatively  large investments of $3,000 to $10,000 or more will lower their minimums for  people wanting to put money into an IRA.  </P> <P> * Simplified record keeping. Fund companies will periodically mail you  statements that show how many shares you own, what they're worth and when you  made purchases and redemptions. The statements list any dividends earned and  your share of the fund's capital gains or losses -- a handy feature when it  comes time to fill out your tax return.  </P> <P> * Telephone representatives. Fund companies aren't allowed to offer advice on  which portfolios you should buy or sell. It's up to you, your broker or other  financial adviser to make these and related decisions. However, most fund  companies have telephone representatives available to field questions and to  mail out prospectuses and other fund literature. Most companies now offer  toll-free numbers for this purpose.  </P> <P> * Swaps for fund shares. A few groups will allow you to buy shares in their  funds, using stock you own as payment. If you have accumulated stock you don't  really want -- from an inheritance, for example -- this is a way to swap it for  a stake in a mutual fund without having to pay a broker commission.  </P> <P> Bull &amp; Bear offers this program, and Winmill admits there's some  case-by-case subjectivity as to which stocks will be accepted. "The securities  have to be like those in the fund you want, although they don't have to be  current holdings," he explains.  </P> <P> For example, if you own 500 shares of IBM, Bull &amp; Bear will let you apply  the value of the stock to the purchase of its equity funds. "We wouldn't want  some illiquid, pink-sheet company," Winmill says, referring to thinly traded  over-the-counter stocks. He adds that Bull &amp; Bear prefers to accept round  lots of stock (100-share increments) rather than odd lots. Likewise, Bull &amp;  Bear will accept certain bonds as payment for shares in its fixed-income funds.  </P> <P> The SFT Group of King of Prussia, Pa., will accept odd lots of stock for an  equal value of shares in its Odd-Lots Fund.  </P> <P> * Buying on margin. This involves borrowing money from a brokerage to purchase  additional fund shares, just as you can leverage your stock holdings. With  margin, you have greater profit potential, along with increased chance of loss.  You also must pay an interest charge on the amount borrowed.  </P> <P> To make use of margin with mutual funds, you have to go through a brokerage;  the fund companies themselves don't provide this service. And brokerages vary  as to the number of funds they will let you margin. Charles Schwab &amp; Co.,  the San Francisco-based discounter, has one of the most expansive programs,  allowing investors to buy, sell or take margined positions in about 450  no-load, low-load and full-load funds.  </P> <P> As with cars, expect mutual funds to come out with even more and fancier  options in the future. Just last month, for example, Benham Capital Management  of Mountain View, Calif., unveiled an open-order system that lets you decide in  advance the prices at which you wish to buy or sell the company's funds.  </P> <P> Just call the company, specify your price and wait. When the fund hits that  price, Benham executes your order. Unfilled orders expire after 90 days, but  you can renew or change them at any time. Stock investors for years have had  the ability to place open orders, but Benham's system appears to be a first for  the mutual fund business.  </P> <P> Chairman James Benham expects to see more such innovations down the road. He  predicts that fund companies will increasingly try to deliver superior services  as a way to differentiate themselves from the competition. With about 3,000  stock, bond and money-market portfolios around and new ones coming out each  week, that need is greater than ever.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TIMING YOUR TRADES  </P> <P> One key difference between stocks and mutual funds centers on intraday pricing.  With a stock, you might get any of several prices, depending on the time of day  you buy or sell. Not so with mutual funds. Nearly all funds calculate their net  asset values just once daily, at the close of trading at 1 p.m. Pacific time.  Thus, you can get only one of two prices on any day the market's open. Here's  how it works:  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:3.76IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> If the fund company receives  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> You get the price as of:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> your mail or phone order:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> After 1 p.m. Friday, before  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Monday's close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1 p.m. Monday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> After 1 p.m. Monday, before  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Tuesday's close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1 p.m. Tuesday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> After 1 p.m. Tuesday, before  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Wednesday's close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1 p.m. Wednesday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> After 1 p.m. Wednesday,  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Thursday's close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> before 1 p.m. Thursday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> After 1 p.m. Thursday,  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Friday's close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> before 1 p.m. Friday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> If you have telephone switch privileges and you want a timing edge, make your  trades as close to the 1 p.m. deadline as possible.

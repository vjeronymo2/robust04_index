			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Indian rupee slips 9.4% as shares soar after budget THE Indian rupee depreciated by 9.4 per cent against the dollar in money transfer operations yesterday when foreign exchange markets reopened in India after presentation of a new national budget on Saturday and a bank holiday on Monday. The Bombay Stock Market (Sensex) index, however, continued its giddy ascent, rising to a new peak of 3457 in acclamation of the budget and the boost it gave to the development of the capital markets. The index has risen 22 per cent since the budget and about 80 per cent since the beginning of the year. The slide in the rupee follows the announcement made by Dr Manmohan Singh, the minister of finance, in the budget that the rupee would become partially convertible with 60 per cent of foreign exchange remittances exchangeable at a new market determined rate. The new open market rate yesterday levelled out at Dollars 1=29.5 as against an official rate of Dollars 1=25.82. Under the new partially floating system, foreign exchange holders are required to change the remaining 40 per cent of a remittance or traveller cheque at the official rate. Dr Singh told a foreign press lunch in Delhi that he regarded the floating rate as a step to full convertibility 'once we get the fiscal situation under control'. The government's target is to reduce the budget deficit to 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the coming years as compared with a deficit this year of 6.4 per cent. He said the government wanted to move towards dismantling foreign exchange controls. Dr Singh sought to minimise the inflationary impact of the depreciation, saying that this 'would not be very significant.' He said that the 20 per cent devaluation of the rupee in July had not had as strong an impact as had been anticipated on manufactured prices. India's inflation rate has come down to 12 per cent from a 16.7 per cent high in August. But it is still well above the 9 per cent that the finance minister had originally projected for the end of the current financial year. Bankers yesterday believed that the rupee would depreciate marginally further because dollar demand in Delhi was unusually weak yesterday. The depreciation benefited exporters less than other holders of foreign currency. This is because exporters had previously been entitled to an eximscrip - a marketable currency instrument - on a part of their export earnings and which they could sell at a premium. Difficulties in administering the eximscrip system were a leading factor in pushing the government to move more rapidly to a partial floating of the currency. The eximscrip system limited the volume of imports to the availability of foreign exchange through export earnings. World Stock Market report, Page 39</p>

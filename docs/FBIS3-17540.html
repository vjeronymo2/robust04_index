			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Mar -- It has fallen to the lot of  Murmansk, which is situated beyond the polar circle, to be the  venue of the "first date" which the foreign minister of the  Russian Federation, Andrey Kozyrev, will have with the new head  of the Norwegian foreign policy department, Bjorn Tore Godal.  Their talks will take place on 26 March there and they will  become an original Russian debut for the Norwegian minister in  his present role. [passage omitted] On the eve of his visit  in an exclusive interview with an ITAR- TASS correspondent in  Oslo, Bjorn Tore Godal said it was particularly important that  the meeting with the Russian foreign minister would take place  in Murmansk since Norway attaches great importance to bilateral  cooperation not only at state level but at regional level as  well. "The program of action with regard to Eastern Europe"  drawn up by the Norwegian Government gives priority to the  Russian northwestern regions. The increased activity of the  council for cooperation in the region of the Barents Sea also  opens wide prospects.    One should admit that the environmental situation in  northern  Europe at present is causing well nigh the greatest concern of  the Norwegian public since the region is very vulnerable in this  sense. The closeness of powerful nuclear arsenal of the ships of  the Russian Northern Fleet hardly adds to the optimism of the  Norwegians as regards ensuring ecological safety.    The fact of Russian military presence at NATO's northern  flank is an objective reality. In this connection the  Norwegians pin great hopes on establishing the spirit of  openness and partnership in relations between the East and the  West in the military and political sphere. The readiness to  join the Partnership for Peace program announced by Russia and  the current joint exercises in the Barents Sea with the "Pomor"  code name give evidence to the fact that these expectations are  justified.    The real contents and expanding range of the  Russian-Norwegian cooperation predetermine the intensity of  personal contacts between the foreign ministers of the two  countries. One can have no doubts: the Murmansk meeting will be  followed by other meetings. The more successful the present  start in Murmansk is, the more often these meetings will be.</p>

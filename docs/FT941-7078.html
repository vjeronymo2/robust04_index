			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: French seems to be making a meal of it in Manhattan Sir, Perhaps Mr Jacques Toubon, culture minister of France, has not had the pleasure of visiting New York City for some time. If he had, his fear that Anglo-Saxon countries are 'deploying considerable efforts . . . to conquer new territory for their language' ('France steps up battle with English language', February 24) would surely be laid to rest. One must only walk a city block to see the forceful influence of French culture in the Manhattan area, what with the proliferation of those wonderful 'bread' shops such as Au bon pain, Le Croissant, and Au-Bon-Croissant. Eileen M O'Connor, 20 Edgewood Road, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, US</p>

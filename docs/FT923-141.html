			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party At Blackpool: Drastic cuts urged as financial strain begins to show CONFERENCE DELEGATES up to and including frontbench spokespeople are being billed for their photocopies and faxes by Labour's resource office this week. It is a small but telling example of how the party's financial crisis is biting. With membership both of the trade unions and the party itself still falling, putting income under strain, an NEC report approved yesterday calls for administration costs to be slashed by 30 per cent from 1991 levels, with 'even more drastic' cuts to follow in 1993. 'The general election defeat has left the Labour party with probably the most serious financial crisis in its history,' the document states. It was an effective way to sober up an audience intoxicated by Mr John Smith's debut conference address as party leader. Outlining the report, Mr John Evans, MP for St Helens North and conference chair, explained the gravity of Labour's position, saying: 'We are not talking about the normal financial problems we have encountered over the years.' If conference failed to approve an increase in membership subscriptions, he said: 'I will immediately have to look for further staff reductions and reductions in activity. The rigour of the cost-cutting programme also reflected the need to achieve surpluses in the early part of the parliamentary cycle to enable the party to afford extra spending in the next general-election run-up. Having endured a string of combative speeches arguing against the proposed Pounds 3 increase to Pounds 18 in individual subscriptions, the NEC will not know until today - when the ballots have been counted  - whether its recommendation has been accepted. The upward trend in subscription charges certainly goes against the long-term wishes of many senior party figures as well as the grass roots. It was billed by Mr Evans as 'a holding exercise' pending a longer-term assessment of the subscription structure. Earlier, Mr Sam McCluskie, the NEC's gruff retiring treasurer, gave an equally glum assessment of the party's position, saying it had to 'face up to the fact' that its income could not 'continue to maintain an organisation at the current levels'. Supported by Mr Jimmy Knapp, an honorary auditor, he presented accounts showing that Labour made a bigger-than-expected Pounds 1.33m loss on everyday spending in 1991 - its ninth such deficit in 11 years. That almost doubled the cumulative end-1991 deficit in the party's general fund to Pounds 2.9m - the largest ever. To cover its losses, the party negotiated an extra loan facility of Pounds 600,000 from the Co-operative Bank, which it has been repaying at a rate of Pounds 50,000 a month since the general election in April. Notes to the 1991 accounts show that bank charges and interest payments, even without that burden, climbed more than 60 per cent to Pounds 187,000 from Pounds 116,000 a year before. They also indicate that membership processing costs trebled year-on-year to Pounds 498,000 (Pounds 161,000). During yesterday's sombre debate, the leadership even had to endure a salvo from the party's hard left in the shape of Mr Ted Knight, former Lambeth council leader. Referring to large sums designated in the accounts as unitemised other expenses, Mr Knight questioned how much of those funds had been earmarked for internal party investigations. 'How much is it costing the party to investigate, to expel, to suspend and in many ways demoralise members of the Labour party?' he asked. 'If we want to save some money, stop witch-hunting Labour party members.'</p>

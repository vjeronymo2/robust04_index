			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive article" by Jorge Child, economist, journalist, </F> columnist for various Colombian publications, and PRENSA LATINA  collaborator: "Recipes for the Fight Against Inflation"]    [Text] The recipes for fighting inflation are very simple:  a policy on income or the control of demand. The first recipe  is known as unorthodox stabilization and the second as the  orthodox policy of the IMF.    If demand alone is restricted, the economy's unemployment  rate rises and investments which support agricultural production  levels and small manufacturers are reduced. On the other hand,  if prices and salaries are frozen -- in keeping with the  unorthodox plan -- and demand is not controlled, inflation will  quickly increase as occurred during the Cruzado Plan (in  Brazil), which aimed at zero inflation in 1986.    The decision was made not to devalue the currency because  the  exchange rate was considered real and there was a trade surplus.  This trend continued through 1986 before the Cruzado Plan was  implemented.    During the first few weeks of the program, businesses became  more efficient, chose their products well, and increased  productivity, but the tenets of the plan did not prove true: the  trade surplus did not continue and the balanced budget that was  relied upon was abandoned; salary increases returned, and the  loss of competitiveness because of a fixed exchange rate halted  investment growth.    In Argentina, the Austral Plan was the answer to a prolonged  period of high inflation rates due to uncontrolled government  spending. This plan consisted in a freeze on prices, public  spending, and salaries, that is, the unorthodox plan.    Its failure was due to the unfreezing of prices that must be  implemented during periods of economic recession and when the  fiscal deficit has been reduced; otherwise inflationary  pressures will be triggered again due to government spending and  the upsetting of relative prices.    Argentine President Carlos Menem's current plan, based on  the  orthodox plan of controlling demand, has been successful thus  far because of the income received from the substantial  privatization of government-owned businesses. The fixed  exchange rate, in line with the U.S. dollar, has supplied the  consumer market with imported goods but has not resulted in a  parallel flow of exports.    The Menem plan has been partially implemented in the Mexican  experience. This plan is known as the Stability,  Competitiveness and Employment Pact (PECE), and its emphasis is  on reducing transfers abroad that occur because of an overvalued  exchange rate and reduced government spending.    During the first phase the restrictive credit policy was  used  to complement budget adjustments and the currency exchange  policy. Like in the Menem plan, privatization has contributed to  fiscal resources without inflationary pressures.    The relative success of these orthodox anti-inflationary  strategies in Argentina and Mexico are due to the fact that they  were implemented during a period of relative stagnation, during  which unemployment has played an important role as a  deflationary mechanism.    The Colombian experience with the orthodox strategy  implemented by Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has not had the  same success because of the inert components of the generalized  system of adjusting interest and salary rates. Simultaneously,  uncontrolled spending on public security has been inevitable due  to the high level of violence in Colombia which, according to  the National Department of Planning, has reached a world-record  77 murders per 100,000 residents, followed by Brazil, in a  distant second place with 24 murders per 100,000 residents.    The exchange rate as an instrument for making the economy  competitive on real international levels does not work if we do  not keep salary trends in mind. This happened to the Chilean  economy in the 1980's, with a reulsting high social cost.    According to Rudiger Dornbush, in the preface to his book  "Fighting Inflation" (Editorial Grijalbo 1993), the combination  of orthodox and unorthodox plans requires conviction and a  minimum sustained effort so that after brief moderate successes  the inflationary spiral will not be recur. If not, the current  decade's illusion of monetary stability will mirror the  frustration of the previous decade.</p>

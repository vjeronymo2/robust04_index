			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Judicial review of M25 plan refused The High Court yesterday refused Surrey County Council permission to seek judicial review of the government's plan to widen the M25 London orbital motorway in stages. The council argued that the 'piecemeal approach' to the overall project was unlawful and prevented a balanced appraisal of environmental impact. Mr Justice Macpherson said the application was premature. He said a public inquiry was due to examine the first phase of widening.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANDERSON SIGNS TWO-YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE GIANTS  </P> <P> Free agent Dave Anderson, the Dodgers' veteran utility infielder, signed a  two-year contract with the San Francisco Giants Tuesday.  </P> <P> Anderson, 29, received $420,000 in 1989. Terms of his new contract were not  disclosed, but it was learned that he is guaranteed more than $1 million for  two years.  </P> <P> Once considered the Dodgers' shortstop of the future, Anderson was plagued by  back problems and never appeared in more than 121 games in a season. He hit  .229 in 140 at-bats last season and .232 during his six previous seasons with  the Dodgers.  </P> <P> The Giants were attracted to Anderson because they may lose Ken Oberkfell, a  free agent, and Chris Speier who is expected to retire after 19 years.  </P> <P> Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, said he was interested in  retaining Anderson, but only on a one-year basis. He said the Dodgers remain  well stocked in utility infielders. ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

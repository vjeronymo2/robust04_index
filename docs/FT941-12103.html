			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Rich British ancestry fails to provide independent future - End of an era Three men in particular dominate the tortuous recent history of what has become the Rover Group: Donald Stokes, Michael Edwardes and Graham Day. Stokes, who started his working life as an apprentice at the Leyland truck company in the 1930s and rose to become its chairman, was persuaded in 1968 by Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, to run the British-owned vehicle industry. Wilson's policy was to encourage the UK's chief strategic industries to become more internationally competitive via mergers and then to select the best management available to run them. When the British Motor Corporation and Leyland merged in 1968, Stokes was responsible for a group making more than 1m vehicles a year, with 40 per cent of the UK new car market, 30 factories and about 200,000 employees. BMC could trace its origins back to the early days of the motor industry; the first Rover was a bicycle made by the Starley company in 1884. Companies encompassed by Stokes's new British Leyland Motor Corporation, was enviable: apart from Rover it included Austin, Jaguar, Land Rover, MG, Morris, Standard, Triumph, and Wolseley. Stokes made his reputation selling British trucks worldwide and he and his team were out of their depth managing a huge business still suffering from years of under-investment. British Leyland also faced increasingly fierce competition as the UK began opening up to rival European manufacturers and had to deal with powerful trade unions which almost invariably used strikes to resist any attempt to reform outdated working practices. When the world motor industry was sent reeling by the oil supply crises, which started in 1973, British Leyland's finances were already fragile. Even the successful truck operations were suffering: they had been drained of investment funds used to subsidise the lossmaking car businesses. In 1975 the Labour government bought out British Leyland's private shareholders. Two years later Michael Edwardes, a South African who had made his name as chief executive of the Chloride batteries group, became chairman. He persuaded first the Labour government, and then the Conservatives, to provide British Leyland with funds to revamp its range of cars, and made the first contacts with Honda to share costs through co-operative ventures. But Edwardes will mainly be remembered for his determined and successful efforts to break the power of the unions within the car plants and to reform work practices. Edwardes succeeded where Stokes failed partly because he could threaten the ultimate sanction - to close down the company permanently. During his time with British Leyland, which he renamed BL, it absorbed Pounds 2bn of state aid but still accumulated losses of Pounds 2.6bn. Edwardes found himself increasingly at odds with Margaret Thatcher after she became prime minister. She pointed out that the aid to BL represented Pounds 200 for every man, woman and child in the UK. She wanted the group broken up and sold off. Edwardes moved out in 1982. The management team he left behind were hamstrung by Thatcher's refusal to provide BL with more money. They sold Jaguar in 1984 via a stock market flotation (it was subsequently bought by Ford) but in 1986 Thatcher lost patience and sent in Graham Day, fresh from rationalising British Shipbuilders, to sort out BL. Early on, Day came close to selling the whole business in two chunks to the two biggest US vehicle groups - trucks to General Motors and cars to Ford - but that fell through because Thatcher feared a political backlash. Day continued to reshape the car business, cutting production to viable levels while moving the range upmarket with the help of Honda, now the dominant partner in the engineering-design co-operation arrangements. BL was sliced up and sold off: trucks to DAF of the Netherlands; buses to a management group which sold on to Volvo of Sweden; Unipart, the spare parts operations, to a group of financial institutions, and finally BL, renamed yet again Rover, to British Aerospace. That controversial deal was heralded by Thatcher's government as one which kept Rover 'British' by putting it safely into the hands of the UK's biggest engineering group.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: When fortune can favour the cautious - The Bottom Line SOME sectors, such as building materials, seem to defy the gravity of the comments made by company chairmen in their enjoyment of high, recovery-anticipating ratings. Other sectors, notably conglomerates, look cheap even though many of their constituents also would benefit from an upturn. Sometimes, it almost seems their defensive qualities, such as a spread of activities and locations, are held against them. This line of thinking has led Credit Lyonnais Laing to bring out a document arguing that investors seeking recovery stocks can find better value among what it calls 'holding companies.' The examples include Hanson, BTR, Williams Holdings and Cookson. Part of the argument is that just because the profits of well-spread companies have not been slashed by recession, it 'does not mean they cannot rise sharply.' They, too, operate in cyclical industries - BTR in motor components, for instance. The trouble is that the sector might be cheap for good reason and that, when it comes to buying, the very diversity of the companies involved makes individual stock selection much more important than sectoral characteristics. Take the cheapness. The conglomerates sector includes some big bad performers - Lonrho and Trafalgar House, for example. And it is dominated by Hanson, where the rating has declined for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons are peculiar to Hanson. Others have been applied more generally in a derogatory way to holding companies. Accounting policies often are picked over. The acquisitive activities of these groups have prompted questions about whether earnings growth is genuine or inflated by the below-the-line write-downs and provisions allowed by acquisition accounting. On the other hand, perception of these companies will depend partly on their acquisition strategy. What will Williams Holdings go for after failing to take Racal Electronics? When will Tomkins make a move? BTR has at least pulled off a big deal with its acquisition of Hawker Siddeley. Some of these organisations may also be seen as traders in companies whose profits may be boosted by gains on one offtransactions. And they can look unfocused. These were the kinds of arguments which led to the unbundling of Racal. And such ideas are gaining renewed currency as conglomerates become unfashionable. A contrary opinion would point to the way acquirers, with the legitimate help of flexible accounting, have rationalised many a company and sold off weak subsidiaries to reduce gearing. The lack of focus need not matter when a strong management system can be applied to a variety of operations. The last point is illustrated by Tomkins, which has an explicit management formula. Its justification has been the continuing progress in earnings per share and the Pounds 70m cash accumulated by last November. But then, Tomkins' share price has outperformed the FT-A All-share index by a third in the past year. So, when it comes to individual stock selection, the price may be up with events, and there has been some recognition of the holding companies' virtues in sectors other than conglomerates. Other industrial materials and business services have both recovered lost ground. Nevertheless, they remain much cheaper than single-industry cyclicals, such as building materials and hotels and leisure. Hence the case for taking an interest in them. David Ireland, conglomerates analyst at Hoare Govett, says they suit the 'cautious' investor who attaches as much weight to track record as to recovery hopes. Financial strength should be an important attribute of the stocks. With doubts about the timing and the strength of recovery reflected in the recent slipping of the FT-SE 100 index, fortune may favour the cautious rather than the bold.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade April 11 TASS -- Muslims were the first to  initiate combat activities in Gorazde, however leader of Bosnian  Serbs Radovan Karadzic ordered to stop any shelling of the town  upon a Russian request, Russian Special Envoy to former  Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin told TASS on Monday.    He explained that after NATO air strikes new reports about  Serbian attacks on Gorazde appeared. He then discussed the  issue at talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic who, in  his turn, contacted Karadzic and the latter ordered to cease  fire.    Churkin believes that the fighting near Gorazde testifies  that neither the Serbian nor Muslim military can be well  controlled. "It is to be remembered that it were the Muslims who  were the first to begin combat activities in Gorazde despite the  fact that the region was proclaimed a safety zone by the UN",  the Russian envoy stressed.    In general the situation has become critical after NATO air  strikes, according to Churkin. "A new element has appeared - the  interference of the United Nations into the Bosnian conflict.  There is a tendency of moving to a greater confrontation", he  said and added that the major task is to avert the tendency and  conclude a ceasefire agreement.    Upon a request of Milosevic, Churkin is now heading to Pale,  the capital of Bosnian Serbs, to "try and bring together the  fragments of the Bosnian peaceful settlement".    After the NATO air strikes Bosnian Serbs announced they stop  any cooperation with the UN forces. "However, during our meeting  with President Milosevic today an understanding was reached that  the process could not go uncontrolled, that it is necessary to  reach a ceasefire agreement which the sides failed to do over  the last days", he said.    "The talk is about an armistice along the whole of the  frontline", the Russian envoy said.    Churkin regretted that neither UN nor NATO had consulted  Russia before the air strikes although they had enough time for  that. However, Bosnian Serbs did not consult Russia either.  They responded to all Russian requests that they had no plans  regarding Gorazde and that there was no necessity for Russia to  resort to serious actions to normalise the situation in the  town, according to the Russian envoy.    "All sides could have exerted efforts so that Russia did  mediate. But this was not done", Churkin said. He did not rule  out that NATO may resume air strikes on Bosnian Serbs. "At  present no possible combat actions can be ruled out", he  stressed.</p>

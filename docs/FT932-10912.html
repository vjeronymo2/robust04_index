			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Placer Dome survives bullion fall PLACER DOME, the international gold producer based in Vancouver, has reported unchanged first-quarter earnings, with lower costs and taxes offsetting a 2 per cent fall in output and a 7 per cent drop in the bullion price. Earnings both this year and last were USDollars 11m, or 5 cents a share, while revenues fell to Dollars 228m from Dollars 267m. Tax provisions dropped to Dollars 6m from Dollars 19m. Placer's share of gold output from its 14 mines dipped to 450,000 oz from 460,000 oz, due mainly to lower ore grades at the Porgera and Misima mines in Papua New Guinea. But production at the Campbell mine in Ontario rose to 70,500 oz from 59,500 oz. Average cash production costs fell to Dollars 192 an ounce. Improvements at nine mines were due to higher grades, tighter cost controls and favourable exchange rate movements. Placer expects output from its Australian and Papua New Guinea operations this year to be about 20 per cent below 1992. Lower grades will continue to hit production at Porgera and Misima. Furthermore, Placer has reduced its stake in Porgera, and last year sold the Big Bell mine in Australia. The company said it had completed a feasibility study for a 4,600 tons-per-day open pit mine and processing plant to exploit its 60 per cent-owned Pipeline deposit in Nevada. Recoverable ore reserves are estimated at 35.3m tons with a grade of 0.12 oz of gold per ton. Construction costs are estimated at Dollars 250m. An updated feasibility study on development of the 50 per cent-owned Zaldivar copper deposit in Chile is due to be completed in July.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus and AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT bureau in Amman: "Restructuring of the Northern and  Southern Commands Paves the Way for a New Phase in the Yemeni  War"]    [Excerpts] According to Yemeni military sources, battles  raged yesterday in the town of Zinjibar and extended to  al-Bayda' Governorate in the north in the areas of al-Kawd and  al-'Urqub and all the way to Mukayris. It seems that the  northern al-'Amaliqah forces deployed there are drawning their  last breath. The northern command had pinned great hopes on them  for victory and for the occupation of Aden, and they were  considered the pincers in the area to the north of Aden.    As regards the other forces which have been trying to  besiege  Aden from the north and the west in the  Ta'izz-al-Rahidah-Mawiyah axis, they have withdrawn from the  borders and from the areas they had occupied to the north of  Ta'izz Governorate. [passage omitted]    In the course of the re-formation of the southern command,  new appointments have been made in the various sectors as  follows:    1. The eastern front (the governorates of Shabwah and  Hadramaut): The operations there are supervised by Salih  Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, former oil and mineral resources minister  and chief of staff in the south.    2. The Abyan-al-Bayda' front is under the command of Abyan  Governor Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad.    3. The Kirsh front is under the command of Colonel Qasim  Bin-Yahya.    4. The Maqtabah front is under the command of Salih 'Ubayd  Ahmad, former deputy prime minister who was defense minister  before the unity.    5. The Ta'izz and Ibb brigades are under the command of  Housing and Planning Minister Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah (Muhsin)  and Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar (both members of the  Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]), and  Sultan al-Sami'i, the formerly independent deputy.    As regards the northern command, it has been formed as  follows:    1. Ahmad Musa'id Husayn (member of the General Committee --  the Political Bureau -- of the General People's Congress [GPC]):  Command of the Shabwah front.    2. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the new defense minister, and  Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni: Al-Bayda' command.    All three of them [as published] are former south Yemeni  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's men.    3. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Muhammad Salim Basindwah,  Ahmad Faraj, and 'Abdallah al-Qadi: Ta'izz command.    4. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and a group of central areas  officers: Ibb command.    5. (Central Security Commander) Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih,  (Air Force Commander) 'Ali Salih al-Ahmar, (1st Armored Division  Commander) 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, and (Information Minister)  Hasan al-Lawzi: Sanaa area command. The aim is to purge it of  the political parties and others who sympathize with the YSP.    6. 'Abd-al-Rahman Muhammad 'Ali 'Uthman, 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-zayn, and other leadership and staff members: Command of  al-Hudaydah front.    Meanwhile, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained some information  about the arrest of a group of Sudanese and Iraqis in Aden and  the arrest of 60 members of the extremist Afghan Jihad members  in al-Dali'. There is information confirming that Eritrea has  admitted into its airports a group of northern civilian planes  which were taken to Asmara Airport out of fear that they might  have been a target of attack at the airports of Ta'izz, Sanaa,  and al-Hudaydah.    Although YSP sources have refused to confirm that Eritrean  airports were used in the Yemeni war, some reports say that the  southerners bombed Asmara airport after discovering that  northern military aircraft had taken off from there.    The reports add that the north paid Eritrean President  Isaias  Afewerki $20 million for allowing the planes into his country's  airport.    Sources close to the Yemeni Defense Ministry have told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the southern 'Abbud Brigade, in  cooperation with the public in al-Dali' Directorate in the Lahij  Governorate, successfully confronted the attack launched by  northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  consisting of al-Hamzah Brigade reinforced by selected  Republican Guard forces. The Defense Ministry in Aden said the  result was a "crushing" defeat for the northern forces which had  to retreat.    The sources said that the 'Abbud Brigade's forces, which are  under the command of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General  Haytham Qasim Tahir, captured 15 tanks and destroyed 10 tanks  and a number of vehicles and troop carriers, but the Defense  Ministry did not give the human losses on both sides.    Sanaa has not denied that report to close politicians and  reporters, who are finding it difficult to contact the outside  world and who see Sanaa's silence about these battles of the  past two days as an indication that the results were not in its  favor.    Sources of the Yemeni Defense Ministry in the south said  that  four of Sanaa's Russian-made aircraft were shot down as they  attacked civilian targets in Aden. Two of the pilots were  captured. One of them is an Egyptian Islamic extremist and the  other an Iraqi from the Iraqi Air Force. The other two were  killed when their two aircraft exploded in mid-air.    The sources attribute the use of Iraqi pilots in the Yemeni  war to the weakness of north Yemeni pilots and the warm  relations between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn. Before the outbreak of battles,  political and press sources said that a number of Iraqi military  experts had arrived in Sanaa. [passage omitted]    In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Damascus,  Yemeni military sources said that the planes which bombed Aden  were Yemeni planes which took off from military airfields in  Eritrea and were flown by Iraqi pilots. It seems that Iraq  entered the battle through Eritrea after the latter was paid  large sums of money. [passage omitted]</p>

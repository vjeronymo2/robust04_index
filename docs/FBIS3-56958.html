The  head of the Baltic state reported on the late night television  news, "Clinton categorically asserts that he differentiates  between human rights, citizenship, and the question of the  withdrawal of Russian troops." The army, said Clinton, must be  withdrawn within the deadlines set without any kind of  additional conditions. He spoke of his support for the troop  withdrawal process and expressed the hope, according to Ulmanis,  that Latvia will resolve the issues of human rights and  citizenship in the spirit of the provisions of the CSCE.  Clinton also stressed "that human rights and citizenship are  the affair of each state, of each people." "I think," Ulmanis  noted, "that this is very important for us."    During the conversation an exchange of comments took place  on  the recent utterances of Andrey Kozyrev. The view of the U.S.  President, Ulmanis said, "allows Latvia to calm down somewhat."  However, Ulmanis added, "we should always be prepared for such  an aggressive policy."    According to Ulmanis, Clinton's telephone call "allowed us  to  dispel many of the suspicions regarding the talks between the  United States and Russia."</p>

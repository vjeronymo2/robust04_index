He made it clear, however, that his candidacy is negotiable and  may be exchanged for an alliance. He said: "Each party cannot  have its own candidate, and people should not consider  themselves invincible just because they may have respectable  aspirations. Right now the nation comes first."    This was the tone of Magalhaes' speech at the opening of the  1994 Bahia State Legislative Assembly sessions. On 1 March, the  governor stayed in touch with Brasilia throughout the day. He  believes the fate of the constitutional amendment, which could  change the requirement for people in executive positions like  his to resign from them in order to run for president, will be  decided in the next 48 hours.    The governor said he is not working to push the amendment  through and that all parties will be free to vote as they  please. Magalhaes recalled, however, that the Constitution had  reduced the terms of office for governors who took over on 15  March 1991. He explained: "The proper thing to do would be to  restore the lost portion, and one way of doing this would be by  approving the amendment that will extend the deadline by which  presidential hopefuls must resign from their executive  positions. It also would be nice if reelections were possible  because if that were to happen Brazil would witness something  unprecedented in Bahia State: the lack of candidates willing to  compete with me for the governorship."</p>

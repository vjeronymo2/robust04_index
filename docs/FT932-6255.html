			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Channel 4 attacks ITV sales effort THE CHAIRMAN of Channel 4 yesterday attacked the ITV companies for apparently underselling Channel 4 advertising in the past three years. The period coincides with the passage of the 1990 Broadcasting Act, when it became clear Channel 4 would be selling advertising-time in competition with ITV. Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, said: 'It is remarkable that from 1989, while our audience share continued to grow, ITV suddenly seemed to have difficulty in selling our advertising effectively.' In 1992, when Channel 4 had 19.9 per cent of the non-satellite commercial audience, ITV attributed 14 per cent of its advertising income to Channel 4, Sir Michael said. This 'by some strange coincidence' matched the 14 per cent revenue safety net. Mr Michael Grade , the Channel 4 chief executive, declined to comment on an industry belief that Channel 4 was taking about 17 per cent of total advertising. Channel 4 also confirmed that the BBC paid it Pounds 65,000 after the departure of Ms Liz Forgan, its former programme director, to be managing director of BBC Radio. The money repaid a 'golden handcuff' paid to Ms Forgan.</p>

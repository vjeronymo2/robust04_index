			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / ADB economists forecast continuing rapid growth in China ECONOMISTS at the Asian Development Bank have forecast continuing rapid growth in China, which they describe as the 'engine of growth' for Asia, writes Jose Galang in Manila. However, the Manila-based bank notes that 'emerging bottlenecks' - in transportation, energy and raw-material production - and continued tight monetary policy will slow China's expansion in 1994. In an assessment of short- and medium-term development prospects in the Asia-Pacific region, the ADB predicts overall growth in Asia's developing countries at 7.1 per cent this year, slightly higher than the 6.9 per cent last year. A slight slowdown next year is also forecast.</p>

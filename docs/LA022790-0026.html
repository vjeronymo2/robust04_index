			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES PROFIT PLUNGES 80%  </P> <P> Traditional Industries in Agoura Hills said its fiscal second-quarter profit  tumbled 80% from a year earlier on a 10% decline in revenue.  </P> <P> In the quarter ended Dec. 31, Traditional, which sells packages of photographic  products and services directly to consumers, said its net income fell to  $309,000 from $1.56 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Its revenue dropped to $13.5 million from $15 million.  </P> <P> For the first half of its fiscal year, Traditional's profit plummeted 72% from  a year earlier, to $1.27 million from $4.56 million, but its six-month revenue  climbed 18% to $33.5 million from $28.4 million.  </P> <P> Traditional attributed the lower earnings to higher debt-interest and  administrative costs, and to higher than expected legal and accounting costs  related to its recent settlement of a dispute with the Federal Trade  Commission, which had objected to some of Traditional's sales practices.  </P></p>

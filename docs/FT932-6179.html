			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Poles apart but ready to do a deal: Despite Poland's government crisis, the country is poised for recovery One vote decided the outcome of yesterday's no-confidence motion in the Polish parliament. It was that of Mr Zbigniew Dyka, recently sacked as justice minister in the coalition government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka. He turned up too late to vote for the government of which his Christian Nationalist party is a member. In effect, the government crisis now facing Poland happened by mistake. The minority government succumbed to the vote called by the Solidarity trade union group in parliament despite clear signs that most of the 18 political groups in the 460-seat Sejm, or lower house, neither wanted nor expected a crisis. But the no-confidence vote, which threatens to leave Poland without effective government just as the first signs of economic recovery are appearing, did not come from nowhere. It followed months of parliamentary skirmishing both within the government coalition, which never enjoyed a parliamentary majority, and between the government and a wide spectrum of opposition parties. The skirmishing came to a head over two main issues: the tight budget and the government's ambitious privatisation programme. The strategic aim of the most powerful members of the six-party coalition government has been to run a budget capable of retaining the confidence of the International Monetary Fund and foreign investors. This forced Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister, into a series of bruising encounters with the more populist or nationalist members of parliament. Solidarity, in particular, took up the cudgels on behalf of the main losers from the spending curbs - teachers, nurses, other public sector employees, and farmers. It was Solidarity which insisted that the budget be amended to provide higher pay for teachers and nurses. The government argued that Poles must accept fiscal stringency now to attract the capital needed to create sustained economic growth. It refused to amend the budget, which received the reluctant assent of parliament on February 12 and which set a ceiling on this year's budget deficit of 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The most the government would concede was a promise that it would allow a small increase in salaries if the introduction of value-added tax in July raised revenues above target. Such tough policies have led to domestic strife for the government but have helped transform Poland's external credit rating. A month after the budget vote the International Monetary Fund approved a Dollars 660m standby agreement. This will help Poland secure the full 50 per cent reduction of its Dollars 33bn official debt. Under an agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors in March 1991, Poland received debt reduction of 30 per cent immediately and the promise of a further 20 per cent if it abided by strict IMF performance criteria. In addition, the World Bank last month agreed two new loan programmes worth Dollars 750m for agricultural reform and bank restructuring. Support from international institutions has helped reassure foreign investors and set the scene for the most important task facing Poland - the achievement of a debt reduction agreement with the London Club of commercial bank creditors. Poland owes the banks Dollars 12.1bn in capital and capitalised interest accumulated since Warsaw stopped servicing the debt in 1989. London Club talks with the banks are due to resume in Paris on June 8. Yesterday's crisis underlines the urgency of reaching a similar 50 per cent reduction agreement. Paradoxically, the no-confidence vote could help Poland's debt negotiators, as it highlights the difficulty of squeezing more money out of the budget for up-front debt repayment as demanded by the banks. The likelihood is that President Lech Walesa will seek to install a caretaker government to carry on with debt negotiations and other administrative functions. Poland's constitution places the initiative firmly in the president's hands. At a cabinet meeting after yesterday's vote, President Walesa refused to accept Ms Suchocka's resignation offer, leaving his options open. He can now either ask Ms Suchocka or another politician to form a new government on the basis of the present parliament, or run the risk of a political vacuum until an election. Ultimately he could opt to take over as head of a presidential government. But this would saddle him with a responsibility he appears reluctant to accept. He, or any other head of government, would be obliged to demand the same economic sacrifices as Ms Suchocka. At present, no combination of parties is likely to achieve an overall majority in the current parliament. This might change, however, after an election which would be fought under new electoral rules, approved by parliament only hours after yesterday's no-confidence vote. The new rules mean that parties with less than 5 per cent of the vote cannot be represented in parliament. This is expected to reduce substantially the number of parties and possibly lead to more stable coalitions. Ms Suchocka, the 47-year-old Poznan lawyer close to the Solidarity movement, has become the most popular politician in Poland. But the four years since Poland became the first former Soviet bloc country to form a non-communist government have also seen a recovery in the political fortunes of former communists. They are not in a position to form a government, as happened recently after elections in Lithuania. But the formerly communist SLD has become the largest single group in the Polish parliament. It helped the government push its privatisation plan through last month and is gaining credibility in business as well as political circles as a possible junior partner in a future coalition. This time the SLD voted as a bloc for the no-confidence motion. But this was only after discreet talks with the Democratic Union about its terms for abstaining. The Union is the former Solidarity mainstream party to which Ms Suchocka belongs, and which formed the core of the outgoing government. The latest crisis appears to bring closer the day when parties such as the Democratic Union could join forces with the SLD, the self-declared social democratic successors of the now dissolved communist party, or the former communist peasant movement, the PSL. But at this stage the most likely outcome is the formation of another shaky coalition, probably led by Ms Suchocka. Continued instability will remove any lingering illusions about the political and economic difficulty of eastern European transformation. Poland has had its difficulties and made its share of mistakes. But it is also poised for recovery and enjoys a strong consensus on economic policy. It would be a mistake to overreact to the latest act in its political drama.</p>

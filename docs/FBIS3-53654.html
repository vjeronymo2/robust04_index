			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili opposes a  referendum on the Golan Heights. Mr. Zvili told our party  affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal that it makes no sense for the  Labor Party to stop the political process in order to hold a  referendum. According to Zvili no discussion on this issue has  been held in Labor, and no decision on this issue was adopted by  the party or government. The only basis for holding such a  referendum is the coalition agreement with SHAS [Torah Observing  Sephardim].    Ministers Hayim Ramon and Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer also  expressed reservations about the idea. Minister Ramon said that  elections are preferable. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer says a  referendum opens the door for a new system which could undermine  democracy. According to Ben- Eli'ezer the government was  elected for a period of four years after declaring its  intentions. There is no need for a referendum, because the  public might react emotionally rather than logically.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud,  Meretz,  Tzomet, and Darawshah's Arab Democratic Party announced they  oppose a referendum on the Golan Heights. Our correspondent  notes that a Knesset decision is required for holding a  referendum, and so far it looks as though such a decision is not  assured of a majority.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad Salih  Basindwah stated that the Arab League's emergency meeting to  discuss sending Arab forces to disengage Yemen's combatants is  unjustified, noting that Yemen's situation is an internal affair  and not a conflict between two separate states.    In an interview with the BBC today, he said limited fighting  is now taking place in Abyan and Lahij provinces between the  government forces and what he termed as a group of the  separatist forces.    He said Scud missiles had been used against Sanaa and other  cities in the north and that aircraft from the south had raided  the capital Sanaa. He added that of the aircraft that had  raided the capital and other cities ten were shot down.    He said the decision to dismiss Yemeni Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid was permitted by the constitution, which empowers  the State Council to make such decisions.</p>

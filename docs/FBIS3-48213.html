The ministry will finalize the system by June and present  its  proposal to the National Assembly in autumn for introduction  next year.    Businesses with more than five employees must join the  national pension scheme. Contributions of 6 percent of wages  are shared by the employee (4 percent) and his employer (2  percent) according to the national pension law.    Anyone else who wants to join the system may, but they must  pay all 6 percent themselves.    According to a tentative plan drawn up by the ministry,  about  995,000 households in farming and fishing villages and 650,000  non-farming or fishing households in rural areas will be obliged  to join the national pension scheme.    In rural areas, contributions and pensions will be paid on a  per household basis instead of an individual basis. Pensions  are payable from the 60th birthday of the head of the household.    An official said, however, that the ministry is still  studying whether to share the contributions.    The government also has to decide what percent of income --  3  percent or 6 percent -- rural people should pay toward their  pensions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, April 2 (XINHUA) -- North China's Shanxi  Province is experiencing a sharp growth in its private sector.    Thanks to the reform and opening-up policies since 1978,  private businesses have mushroomed in the province and have  shown their strong muscles in the intense market competition.    Now the private firms are playing an ever-increasing role in  the province's economic development.    By the end of 1993, the number of private firms added up to  507,000, involving more than one million local residents. Most  of them were farmers.    The total production output value in the private sector  reached 8.16 billion yuan and the taxes they have paid accounted  for 7.9 percent of the province's revenue.    As the private firms have extended to every industrial  sector  and other fields, such as industry, construction, transport,  science and technology, commerce, real estate, education,  culture and information services, the investment in this sector  has also expanded.    A recent survey shows that the average registered funds of  each private firm topped 7,614 yuan in 1993, with nearly 100  firms whose total registered funds surpassed one million yuan  each.    Many of the private firms have now become large enterprises  or group companies.    The survey also shows that about 90 percent of the  individuals and private firms that were set up last year were  engaged in the service industry, a hefty 40 percent rise from  1992.    In addition, 43 private companies have received foreign  investment, and thereby became joint ventures.    The products produced by the private companies have also  been  sold to many foreign countries, such as the United States,  Canada and the Republic of Korea.    So far, the gross commodity retail sale of the private  sector  is about one fourth of the province's total.    The rapid development of the private sector not only drives  the province's economy to a new height, but also promotes its  social progress.    Li Anmin, a private business owner in Jiexiu County in  central Shanxi and also a member of the National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has in  past few years donated 7.53 million yuan (866,000 U.S. dollars)  to develop local education.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram and Ibrahim Humaydi: "Conflicting </F> Information About al-Dali'; Eight-Point Socialist Party  Initiative"]    [Excerpt] Sanaa, Damascus, London, AL-HAYAH -- There were  conflicting reports about the fate of al-Dali' yesterday. Sanaa  stressed that its forces had captured the city and opened a new  front in Shabwah Governorate, and that its forces were advancing  in the Bab el Mandeb area with a view to encircling Aden from  various directions.    But the Socialist Party completely denied the capture of  al-Dali', a stronghold for a large number of southern army  commanders. The party yesterday presented a political  initiative which included the following:    1. an immediate halt to the war;    2. the formation of a national salvation government to  eliminate the effects of the war;    3. measures to safeguard what is left of the Armed Forces,  reorganize and regroup them, disengage the warring forces, and  withdraw attacking forces to their positions before the war;    4. measures to safeguard citizens' lives and property,  fairly  compensate those harmed by the war, and consider victims of the  war -- military and civilians -- martyrs.    5. the release of military and political prisoners; no  arrest, pursuit, or torture of any political or military  elements; measures to prevent the looting of citizens' property;  and the return of looted property to the owners, or compensation;    6. no backtracking on the democratic option and political  pluralism, and recognition of the parties' right to engage in  political action in accordance with the Constitution and the law;    7. no backtracking on implementation of the Pledge and  Accord  Document.    8. action by the national salvation government to  investigate  who caused the war, with the conclusions to be announced to the  people.    In Damascus, former [South] Yemen President 'Ali Nasir  Muhammad has told AL-HAYAH that he met yesterday with Yemeni  Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah and Oil Minister Salih  Abu-Bakr Bin Husaynun. Both had met with President Hafiz  al-Asad and he had asked them to work to halt "aerial  bombardment involving scud missile strikes against cities."    'Ali Nasir added that he had discussed with them "the latest  developments in the military and political situation in the  country. And they spoke with me about their contacts with Arab  leaders" during their tour of a number of Arab states.    The former Yemeni president pointed out that he had agreed  with a number of "important" Yemeni figures to launch an  initiative guaranteeing "a cease-fire and a swift solution to  the crisis."    He added that the initiative is based on a number of "clear  points" aimed at finding a way out of the current situation.  However, he declined to talk about these points in detail, "in  order to ensure its success, as we will be moving to Yemen after  the contacts." [passage omitted]</p>

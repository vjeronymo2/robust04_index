			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Swiss franc marches on The Swiss franc continued its firm showing on the foreign exchanges yesterday, touching its highest level against the D-Mark since early 1991, writes Philip Gawith. While the Swiss franc finished unchanged in London against the D-Mark at SFr0.83, the German currency fell as low at one stage as SFr0.8285. The D-Mark was weaker against most European currencies, in spite of the Bundesbank council's decision to leave German official rates unchanged. The central bank also fixed the repo rate at 4.85 per cent for another two weeks. The dollar improved modestly, helped by the weaker D-Mark. It closed at DM1.5467, from DM1.5374, and at Y99.38 from Y98.875. In New York it ended at DM1.5492 and Y99.45. Sterling also had a quiet day, with a mild gain against the D-Mark offset by a loss against the dollar. The trade weighted index was unaltered at 79.2. Two short term factors buoying the Swiss franc were the Swiss National Bank's decision to leave rates unchanged - there had been speculation of lower rates - and unconfirmed reports that Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National Bank president, had told a private gathering that a rise in rates in the future would be necessary. A number of other factors, however, are supporting the Swiss currency. The most obvious is the increased quest for safe haven status, now that there is heightened concern about the outcome of next month's German election. A further factor is the increased worry about the level of global stock markets. This has buoyed the gold price, which traditionally has a good correlation with the franc. Analysts argued that with the Swiss economy having been the first out of recession in Europe, and the SNB having made it clear that rates will probably not fall further, the differential compared to German interest rates is likely to narrow further. Many observers are predicting further strength for the franc. If it reaches the key technical level of SFr0.825, then there are predictions that it could go as far as SFr0.79. This presents an uncomfortable problem for the SNB. While it would like to help exporters, who are being hurt by the strong exchange rate, it is doubtful how much it can achieve, given that most factors supporting the franc are beyond its control. The dollar paid little attention to the release of minor economic data, though the bias was towards the upside of recent trading ranges. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the dollar's inability to break the down-side of its recent trading range may have created conditions for an upward squeeze on the currency. In terms of fundamentals, what the currency needed to move higher was weaker figures, which would quell inflation fears and help the bond markets, said Mr Marshall. But recent releases did not provide convincing support for this picture. It may be, however, that technical factors will drive the currency up. 'There has certainly been a real loss of momentum with the dollar selling on the downside,' added Mr Marshall. This had contributed to a change in sentiment, though he stressed that trading conditions remained thin, with most longer term investors out of the market. The possibility of a US invasion of Haiti has started to impinge on markets, and does not appear to offer any upside for the dollar. Mr David Munro of High Frequency Economics in New York said that President Clinton's campaign risked courting further unpopularity, and would 'bomb the markets'. There were no surprises from the Bundesbank council, whose decision to maintain the status quo had been widely anticipated. Although some economists believe one further fall in German rates is still likely, this optimism is not shared by the futures market. The Euromark futures strip is currently discounting three-month money at 5.26 per cent in December, and at 6.06 by next June. Three-month money is at present being offered in German cash markets at around 4.95/5 per cent. One argument doing the rounds is that the Bundesbank will not lower rates ahead of the October 16 elections to avoid being accused of favour-itism towards the Kohl administration. But Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, commented: 'There is no historical evidence to support the view that proximity to Federal elections imposes a moratorium on Bundesbank interest rate decisions. In 1987, rates were cut three days before the election, and in 1990 rates were raised 31 days before the poll. The Bank of England provided Pounds 568m assistance to UK money markets, at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 550m daily shortage. Overnight money traded between 2 and 5 1/8 per cent. Mr Durrant said efforts to describe Monday's monetary tightening as reactive, rather than pre-emptive, were harsh. He said the media remained 'obsessed with past policy mistakes'.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Ignore the gripe, don't believe the hype TO JUDGE BY the rhetoric of economic commentary, almost every mbig ajor economy is in dire straits. The US recovery is heading from anaemic to 'seriously in doubt' in the pundit's lexicon. Recessionary Japan is meanwhile on the verge of a 'double dip'. The effects of Germany's deepening recession are spreading across the continent. Only the British economy, despite setbacks to its nascent recovery, has 'defied the sceptics' over the past six months. But the conventional economic wisdom is more than usually misleading. The US economy has been diffident about recovering because, at least by past US standards, it had a short dose of recession to recover from. Federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's move to cut interest rates in 1990 spared the US a lengthy period of negative growth. Output fell by just 2.2 per cent between the second quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991. It has since more than recovered this lost ground, as the chart shows. But American consumers had only a year to correct their debt-laden balance sheets before they were expected to begin the cycle all over again. After this brief period of retrenchment, the fact that personal sector debts remain equivalent to 100 per cent of disposable income, compared with 75 per cent in 1980, makes for a restrained upturn. The UK recovery, while also held back by personal sector debts, may prove faster than America's. But once again, the chart puts matters in perspective. The UK is currently recovering from two years of falling output and high nominal interest rates. UK output fell by 4 per cent between the second quarter of 1990 and the second quarter of 1992 and has not yet returned to its level at the beginning of 1989. Japan's record does not look too bad when judged against this rather dismal Anglo-Saxon performance, Despite last week's worries about a 'double dip', Japan has barely had a single dip worth noting. Japanese output fell by a mere 0.6 per cent between the second and third quarters of 1992. It has risen by 14 per cent since the end of 1988. Only Germany's recent performance fits the rhetoric. Since the first quarter of last year, west German output has fallen by 2.8 per cent. Even so, this fall followed a dramatic period of post-unification growth. Between the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 and the onset of recession, output rose by 9.9 per cent. And France and Italy, while facing a difficult year, have not experienced anything like the falls in output that debt-burdened America and Britain have suffered. So why this need to describe every economy with the same doom-laden language? Headline writers are partly to blame. But politics also plays a role. In Britain, government politicians have been relieved at the pace of recovery, even though economists remain sceptical about its staying power. Across the Atlantic, things are less comfortable. President Bill Clinton, like Mr Bush before him, faces a politically potent gap between economic performance and expectation. To fill it, the new resident at the White House has turned abroad - to Germany and Japan - to provide the boost to demand which US public opinion demands. Mr Clinton's quest for growth has had some success. The Bundesbank is still holding out against US and European demands for further German interest rate cuts. But Japan's current account surplus has proved an easier target. Though foreign trade accounts for only around 11 per cent of American GDP, US Treasury officials have successfully exhorted the Japanese government to boost their domestic economy through higher public spending and further cuts in interest rates. The Clinton administration has a point: the Japanese economy is losing momentum, less government saving and more demand for imports is the best way to cut the trade surplus, and boosting Japanese domestic demand might help the US recovery along. But the chart makes attempts to fault Japan's recent contribution to world growth seem a little short-termist.</p>

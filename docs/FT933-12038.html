			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Campaign to boost women reaches 25% of workforce OPPORTUNITY 2000, the business-led campaign to improve the position of women in the workforce, now covers more than a quarter of the UK workforce, it was announced yesterday. Business in the Community, the business-backed voluntary organisation behind the campaign, said that 200 organisations had signed up. Recent recruits included Oxford University and retailing chains Texas Homecare and MFI. Members of Opportunity 2000 agree to draw up targets for improving the balance of their workforces, which are then published. A minority of members have set themselves numerical targets for the employment and promotion of women. Other initiatives have included the introduction of special training for potential female managers and the introduction of job-sharing schemes. The number of employees affected by the initiative is approaching 6m, Business in the Community said. One reason for the high figure is that almost all government departments have joined the campaign. The initiative was launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in 1991. The campaign's executive is chaired by Lady Howe and members include Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, Mr John Birt, director general of the BBC, Sir John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, and Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National.</p>

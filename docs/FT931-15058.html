			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Davy/Shearson consortium wins Dominican gold contract A CONSORTIUM of Davy International of the UK and Shearson Lehman Brothers of the US have been awarded a contract by Rosario Dominicana, the Dominican Republic's state-owned gold miner, for a refractory gold ore treatment plant, according to government officials in the Dominican Republic. The officials said, however, that Rosario Dominicana and Davy International are yet to agree aspects of the contract, which will be determined by further feasibility studies and the raising of the funds, expected to be between Dollars 200m and Dollars 250m, for the project. 'Negotiations are still to be concluded, and when these are finished President Joaquin Balaguer will make a public announcement on the awarding of the contract,' said one official. Davy International and two other companies, Minproc Engineering of Australia, and Paulo Abib/Andrade Gutierrez of Brazil, were shortlisted by Rosario Dominicana after submitting bids for the project. A statement by Davy International, a member of the engineering division of Trafalgar House, said the project involved the conversion of Rosario Dominicana's existing 10,000 tonnes-a-day oxide and transitional ore mill to treat between 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes-a-day of refractory (difficult to treat) gold ore. The contract involves a study to identifiy the optimum ore throughput and the preparation of a 'bankable feasibility study on the chosen option'. Shearson Lehman Brothers will be responsible for raising the money for the project. .CO.-             Rosario Dominicana.</p>

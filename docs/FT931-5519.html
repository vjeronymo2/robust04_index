			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Barclays takes the plunge Many people will be anxious to kick Barclays when it is down. They risk missing the point. Barclays is making its shareholders pay for years of second-rate management of its loan book. But, having cut its dividend, it may have stolen a march on at least one of its main competitors. Barclays now has a tier one capital ratio of 5.5 per cent. That of National Westminster, which has set an uncovered dividend for each of the past four years, is a skimpy 5.2 per cent. This matters because there was a degree of discretion in Barclays' decision. By limiting the Pounds 226m increase in its largely voluntary general provision, it could have found the money for the dividend. NatWest resorted to a number of devices to bolster its tier one capital, including flattering its earnings by a release of general provisions. Its low capital will suffice only if a sharp rebound in profits provides enough retained earnings to finance expansion of the loan book in recovery. If this does turn out to be the banking trend, Barclays' dividend cut would look with hindsight like a lurch from reckless profligacy to excessive caution. It seems more likely though that bank profits will only recover slowly, especially since the second half of 1992 saw provisions rise across the sector. Barclays has taken a cautious view on earnings retention. It may thus enter the recovery with a strong balance sheet while NatWest is still struggling to maintain its capital ratio. None of this is any excuse for what has gone before. The previous chairman retired prematurely and now Mr Andrew Buxton is sheltered by the bank's theory of collective responsibility for its mistakes. As executive chairman, Mr Buxton lacks effective presentational skills when Barclays needs strong leadership and strategic vision to correct the deep-rooted weakness in its lending culture. If the dividend cut hastens the introduction of some outside blood, it will have served a doubly useful purpose.</p>

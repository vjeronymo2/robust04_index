			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Pools operators in plea on lottery Football pools operators are renewing their campaign to persuade the government to do something about their disadvantages compared with the National Lottery. The pools have lost a significant slice of their revenue to the lottery and some executives fear that the viability of the industry, which employs 45,000 full-time and more than 80,000 part-time workers, could be undermined in the long term. It is thought that the lottery has already led to a reduction of about 12.5 per cent in the weekly takings of Vernons, the pools subsidiary of Ladbroke. Littlewoods, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the pools market, says it has been hit by the lottery but Mr Tony Hodge, marketing manager, said the effect had been 'relatively minimal'. Its revenue drop is almost certainly less than 9 per cent. The main concern of the pools companies is the higher percentage of income they pay to the government and good causes. The lottery pays 12 per cent tax and gives a further 28 per cent to good causes. The pools are taxed at 37.5 per cent and pay a further 5 per cent plus a voluntary 5p in every 105p to sport and the arts.</p>

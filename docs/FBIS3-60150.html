			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lourdes Alonzo Parrao] </F>   [Text] Campeche, Camp., 21 December--In an operation  conducted on the Yucatan Peninsula, forces from the Office of  the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) succeeded in  dismantling one of the leading drug trafficking rings operating  in the country, headed by the Colombian, Antonio Bermudez. The  PGR agents captured 21 of its members, who were found to have in  their possession approximately a ton of pure cocaine, which they  were attempting to market in the neighboring state of Quintana  Roo. This announcement was made at a press conference today by  the PGR's state representative, Antonio Tiro Sanchez.    The report added that six late-model cars with Quintana Roo  plates were also seized, as well as a fuel tanker that was  hauling the alkaloid. The operation began at dawn last Sunday,  when the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] intercepted a tank truck  in the vicinity of the settlement of Escarcega, Campeche. Owned  by the company Traga, Adjustable Capital Corp., with license  plates 045TX9, it was carrying 22 gas cylinders containing 711  kg of cocaine.    No armed confrontations were reported in this seizure,  during  which Gilberto Erick Gomez Ortega, Felipe Corro Alcantara,  Daniel Soto Vargas, and Antonio Reyes Cabanas were arrested. All  are members of the organization led by Bermudez who were  guarding the shipment in an imported luxury car with Quintana  Roo plates URD8679.    According to the bulletin issued by the PGR, from the  preliminary statements made by Antonio Reyes Cabanas while in  custody, the police obtained the names of those who were to  receive the shipment by sea in the neighboring town of Chetumal.  They also learned the identities of the subjects waiting for it  in Cancun, Quintana Roo.    PJF personnel in Chetumal arrested Antonio Ordonez Rodriguez  and Gregorio Barradas Montero. Meanwhile, in Cancun, they  captured Jose Luis Sierra Rodriguez, of Spanish nationality;  Luis Carlos Pinto Camacho, alias "Ramiro Vazquez Perez"; and  Humberto Segundo Montenegro Freyre, alias "Alberto Rodriguez  Garcia," or "Alberto Garcia Aleman," the latter two of Colombian  nationality. Also arrested were the Mexicans, Benjamin Reyes  Cabanas and Mario Fuentes Perez, from whom three late-model cars  with Quintana Roo plates were confiscated.    The statements from those under arrest made it possible to  intercept, early Monday morning, a vehicle being driven along  Itzaes Avenue in the city of Merida in Yucatan State. Riding in  it were nine persons who were guarding 199 packages containing  nearly 400 kg of cocaine.    Tiro Sanchez revealed that the nine subjects arrested were  members of the ring led by the Colombian, Antonio Bermudez, and  answer to the names of: Gustavo Adolfo Ayala Ramos, Jorge Alonso  Uraga Paez, Manuel Olmeda Gutierrez, Luis Vega Rivas, Alberto  Vega Rivas, Jorge Peraza Bernal, Jose Espinoza Dominguez,  Cipriano Beltran Madueno, and Hernan Valdez Apodacas. Two cars  and a passenger van were seized from these drug dealers.    The official denied that any confrontations had occurred  during the arrests. He claimed that, after the case records are  completed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, those  responsible, with the items and equipment found in their  possession, would be placed at the disposal of the authorized  judge.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Optimism grows for accord on trade European Union and US leaders signalled yesterday that they were prepared to be flexible to achieve a breakthrough in their long-running talks on trade liberalisation. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said he was optimistic about an agreement after meeting Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative. The suggestion of new-found flexibility came as negotiators in Brussels, flanked by large contingents of advisers, set out on a race to reach a comprehensive bilateral deal by tonight. The talks were last night moving forward 'little by little', according to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, who also met the chief US and European negotiators. Mr Christopher warned that failure to complete the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would not just hobble the world economy but would damage the transatlantic relationship. The stakes 'are absolutely immense', he said. 'We have a responsibility to meet flexibility with flexibility.' His remarks echoed sentiments expressed in Bonn after a two-day summit meeting between French and German leaders. President Francois Mitterrand of France and German chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed that compromise was essential. Sir Leon and Mr Kantor appeared cautiously optimistic that they would be able by tonight to deliver to a special EU meeting of foreign and trade ministers a package of tariff cuts and farm trade proposals that will pave the way for successful completion of the Uruguay Round. One negotiator said: 'We are at the stage where people are making honest assessments. Public characterisations showing how tough we are for domestic audiences are not the point.' The talks are regarded as critical if the long-stalled Uruguay Round negotiations are to be completed successfully by the deadline of December 15. If they succeed, their market access deal could embrace tariff cuts on manufactured goods such as non-ferrous metals, semiconductors, wood and paper products, ceramics and glass, and leather goods. Even more sensitively, it could embrace late US concessions on the year-old Blair House accord limiting EU exports of subsidised farm goods, and EU commitments to raise imports of agricultural products. Negotiators have suggested that agreements are not yet in hand for services trade, anti-dumping policies and rules regulating subsidies. Any agreement reached today will be presented by Sir Leon directly to the special meeting of EU finance and trade ministers. It will simultaneously be delivered to Gatt in Geneva, where negotiators from the other 114 participants in the Uruguay Round will meet tomorrow to consider the deal. Gatt officials hope the agreement will lead to improved offers from other countries, in tariff cuts and in opening their markets to trade in services. Gatt pledge, Page 6</p>

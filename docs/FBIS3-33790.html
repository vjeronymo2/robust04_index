			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Khayrallah Khayrallah article: "Syria Was the Primary </F> Target"]    [Text] Arab sensitivities should have receded, at least a  little, now that the peace process in the region has entered a  decisive phase that would not tolerate any mutual campaigns. To  make hasty accusations against one Arab party or another after  the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat in Beirut is to  ignore the risks involved at this particular juncture. One  cannot but understand the Jordanian position maintaining that  the aim of the assassination of the diplomat was to strike at  any bid for rapprochement between Amman and Damascus. Is any  Arab party opposed to such rapprochement? The realistic answer  is no.    Actually, it should be stressed that the incident which  occurred in Beirut, the first of its kind in three years, was a  severe blow to Lebanon and all of its government's attempts to  prove to Arabs and foreigners that security prevails in Beirut  and that they can return there. In terms of the aim it was  meant to achieve, the incident is only comparable to the blowing  up of the Phalangist headquarters on New Year's Eve. That was  meant to be a clear message to whom it may concern that Beirut  would not return to normal, that all the attempts to rebuild it  would fail, and that it would remain hostage particularly to  those who are thought to have allocated millions for its  destruction and for making it what it is, a den of blackmail, as  it was in the eighties. It is clear, however, that just as the  Phalangist headquarters explosion did not stop the  reconstruction process, there is nothing to indicate that the  assassination of the Jordanian diplomat, serious as it is, will  stop the government's march.    Even more important, the assassination appears to be aimed  primarily at Syria which has, in recent weeks, taken a number of  important steps culminating in the summit meeting between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva on 16  January. At that summit President al-Asad emphasized that peace  is Syria's "strategic choice," and the United States confirmed  its willingness to improve relations with Syria, which would  pave the way for the elimination of its name from the list of  states sponsoring terrorism. There can be no doubt that Syria's  conduct in Lebanon will be one of the matters to be taken into  consideration in the assessment of bilateral relations in  accordance with a certain mechanism agreed by the foreign  ministries of the two countries. That being the case, is it  conceivable that the aim of the assassination was anything but  to embarrass Syria and portray it as incapable of holding all  the cards in the Lebanese game, and to show that the Lebanese  question should also be discussed with other non-Syrian parties  and outside the framework of the Lebanese Government?    It seems, therefore, that in the coming few days Syria will  have to confirm that it has made its choice and that its  decision is final. Helping the Lebanese Government identify the  party which perpetrated that ugly crime would be the best  confirmation of this, because Syria would not tolerate those who  pursue a strategy different from its own, those whose strategy  is in harmony with Israeli interests, especially the Israeli  interest in keeping Beirut out of bounds for Arabs and  foreigners.</p>

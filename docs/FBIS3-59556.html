			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Speeds Up Introduction </F> of Euro-ISDN"]    [Text] By the end of 1994, ISDN [Integrated Services  Digital Network] will be available for 95 percent of Netherlands  business consumers. Prompted by the business community's high  demand for ISDN applications, PTT Telecom is reducing the  initially planned introduction period by nearly six months.    At the opening of EURIE '93, the European ISDN  telecommunications event, held from 14 to 16 December and  involving 17 countries, PTT Telecom announced that it is  particularly companies with subsidiaries throughout the country  that are requesting the fastest possible introduction of  nationwide ISDN.    Since June 1993, European-standard-based ISDN has been  available in 30 Netherlands urban areas with three-digit area  codes. As of July 1994, it will also be available in 20 areas  with five-digit area codes. These are the areas where demand  for ISDN is highest. ISDN will be introduced in phases in the  rest of the country. By the end of 1994, 95 percent of the  country should be covered, while 100-percent coverage is  expected by late 1995.  <H5>  Projects </H5>   To promote the development of ISDN, the PTT is nurturing  various projects by allowing access to its know-how and  resources. One of these projects involves the development of a  radio news database by regional broadcasting stations, which  will allow the exchange of news items with high audio quality.    The Netherlands Standardization Institute has started a  pilot  project aimed at giving its customers access to a database via  the ISDN network. This will enable the exchange of  standardization documents in a much faster and more efficient  and inexpensive way.    The third project involves the Foundation for ISDN  Integration.</p>

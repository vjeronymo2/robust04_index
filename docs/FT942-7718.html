			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Seton rises 39% as UK healthcare side grows Seton Healthcare, the medical products and sports equipment group, said it would concentrate for the next few years on the UK healthcare market, where it was enjoying strong organic growth. The Oldham-based company reported a 39 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 8.45m, in the year to February 28. Sales rose by 28 per cent, from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 49.4m. Of that, Pounds 1.7m came from acquisitions and Pounds 8m was contributed by the Cupal businesses, bought at the end of 1992. Mr Ian Cater, chief executive, said the contribution to group sales from healthcare had risen from 61 per cent to 67 per cent. Seton's concentration on community care and the over-the-counter products was paying off in UK healthcare, which showed organic growth of 11 per cent. Healthcare's operating profits rose from Pounds 5.99m to Pounds 7.86m. Trading conditions were difficult in continental Europe, with sales to Germany and Italy adversely affected by healthcare reforms. The focus of European activity was being moved into community care and the OTC sectors. The much smaller sports and leisure division increased sales by 9 per cent to Pounds 5.5m. It increased market share and improved margins, lifting operating profit by 16 per cent to Pounds 703,000. During the year Seton spent Pounds 5.25m on OTC brands, including Waspeze, an insect bite remedy, and Burneze, a burns treatment. Since the year-end, a further Pounds 6.25m has been spent on dietary supplements and a range of antacid products. Gearing increased from 3 per cent to 36 per cent during the year, although interest cover was a comfortable 28 times. A new Pounds 5.4m distribution centre at Oldham has been completed on budget and will become operational later this year. Earnings per share rose by 17 per cent to 19.1p (16.3p). A final dividend of 4.6p (4.1p) gives a total for the year of 6.5p (5.74p), a rise of 13 per cent. COMMENT Seton's focus on OTC brands and community care through its sales force of former nurses seems well suited to the prevailing trends, at least in the UK. Self-medication now accounts for more than 30 per cent of sales. The group has integrated the Cupal acquisitions smoothly and and marketing of new brands has also paid off. The shares, up 6p to 318p yesterday, rose swiftly after being floated at 130p in 1990. However, since peaking at 360p last year, they have underperformed the market by more than 20 per cent as healthcare stocks fell out of favour. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.7m put Seton's shares on a prospective multiple of about 14 - which seems undemanding for a group with such a timely focus.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (8): Investment will cut the bills - Demand for energy efficiency is focusing on the generators SOME 20 per cent of the UK's energy bill could be saved by investing in 'cost-effective energy efficiency measures', according to Mr William Rickett, director-general of the UK Energy Efficiency Office. The scope for reducing energy use is not in doubt. Nor is the need to do it. Carbon dioxide (CO), the main 'greenhouse' gas causing global warming, can only be tackled by reducing energy consumption. Rather than meeting increasing energy demand with increasing supply, existing supplies must be used more efficiently. Demand for change will focus on the electricity industry, an important contributor to CO emissions. The UK has radically re-structured its electricity industry over the past two years in preparation for the private sector. The restructuring arguably offered a unique opportunity to incorporate incentives for energy efficiency into the licences and the regulation of the new companies. The opportunity was not taken. Under the system in England and Wales, it is in everyone's interests to sell electricity, and in no one's to save. The profits of the generators depend on maintaining their market share. The profits of the 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) depend on the amount of electricity they distribute and sell. The duty to 'promote', not enforce, energy efficiency lies with the regulator, Professor Littlechild. So far this regulation consists of ensuring the RECs provide their customers with adequate information on ways to cut consumption. What privatisation may do is open up the generation side of the market for new, more efficient technologies. Nearly all of the plant being built or proposed today is based on combined cycle gas-fired turbines (CCGT) which achieve greater efficiency levels than conventional coal-fired plant. It has also raised the profile of combined heat and power (CHP), which has potential efficiency levels of more than 80 per cent. Critics point out that by splitting generation and distribution, and by the regulatory formula used, the government has removed the potential to introduce measures to curb demand, such as least-cost planning. This involves a utility considering whether improving the end-use efficiency of its customers is more cost-effective than building new generating plant. Least-cost planning is being 'aggressively pursued' in about 20 US states, according to Mr Mike Foley of the US National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). Some state regulators require utilities to explore both demand and supply-side options before licensing new capacity. In most cases, utilities are then allowed to claim back a rate of return on their investments in energy efficiency. The employment of demand-side management is due to be expanded as part of the new US National Energy Strategy (NES). Although the power industry at first resisted this approach, many utilities are now finding it profitable. These include New England Electric, Boston Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, three large, privately-owned utilities. According to Mr Mike Monahan of Boston Edison, such demand-side management is Edison's main focus because at 'the bottom line it is more cost-effective to buy back electricity than it is to build new generating plant'. Boston Edison will spend Dollars 250m (Pounds 139.6m) to 1995 on energy conservation measures for its customers, including distributing compact fluorescent lightbulbs, and offering free energy audits. In this way, it shaved some 130MW off its peak demand growth in 1990; by 2000, it expects the figure to be closer to 300MW-400MW. One of the reasons this strategy works is that most US utilities are vertically integrated and have a mandate to serve a particular area. They therefore have an incentive to cut demand. The UK RECs, on the other hand, are distributors and suppliers whose franchise market is due to disappear over the next eight years. An attempt by the House of Lords to enable the regulator, under the Electricity Bill, to enforce energy efficiency measures before approving tariff increases was overturned in the Commons. The structure of the European electricity supply industry is diverse, and consequently the potential for least-cost planning patchy. Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall believes it could cut 12TWh-19TWh out of a commercial and residential demand of 70TWh a year. The next phase, due this autumn, is to discover how much of this potential can be realised. According to Mr Morgan Andersson, project manager, the recent decision by the Swedish government to delay the phase-out of nuclear power means that 'it is still vital to keep conservation measures going, but the commercial incentive has changed'. Vattenfall now has no need for new generation until 2000. Other Swedish utilities, notably Stockholm Energi, and some German utilities have implemented demand-side management measures. Italy's state-owned utility ENEL is a vertically-integrated monopoly supplier faced with growing demand and increasingly unable to site new plant due to environmental opposition. It has started to look at how to cut domestic demand by working with manufacturers to promote more efficient electrical appliances. A recent study for the UK Energy Department by the March Consulting Group estimates that in the UK alone, replacing appliances with the best available on the world market could save 24,000GWh of electricity. The MCG report, along with the recently released Energy Select Committee report on energy efficiency, comes to the now familiar conclusion that improvements are unlikely to happen without government intervention. Schemes to label appliances according to their efficiency have been introduced by France, Denmark, and Germany with varying degrees of success, but no European country has implemented labelling fully. Again, the US record is impressive, with the 1987 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act setting minimum standards for domestic appliances. The recent NES is set to expand this. A number of US utilities also offer customer rebates for buying efficient electrical appliances. Meanwhile it may be left to international legislative moves to take energy efficiency to the top of the agenda. Movement may be slow, but environmental legislation is set to grow increasingly stringent. The European Commission has already issued a directive setting standards for SOx and NOx emissions from power plants. An EC draft directive calls for compulsory labelling for most domestic appliances in member states from July 1992. Minimum standards are set to follow. Future pressure from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climatic Change to cut global CO emissions may force utilities and governments to try a little harder.</p>

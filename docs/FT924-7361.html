			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Observer: Pas ici Place your bets, please, for the new name for ICI's soon-to-be-spun-off bioscience operation. Since the demerger was first mooted back in July various nicknames have been tried out, ranging from Baby-Bio to Good-Bio. How about calling it Mond? The name has an international feel to it and Sir Alfred Moritz Mond, first Baron Melchett, was one of ICI's founders in 1926. Problem is that Brunner Mond, ICI's soda ash business, was sold to a management buy-out team last year, so there might not be enough Monds to go round. Some variation on Nobel Industries, another of the founding companies, would also have a nice ring to it but might be confused with the eponymous Swedish chemicals and explosives group. United Alkali Company and British Dyestuffs Corporation, the two other founding companies, hardly fit the bill for a high-tech bioscience company. Sir Denys Henderson breaks the news tomorrow. Bet it has Bio in the name even if it won't have ICI.</p>

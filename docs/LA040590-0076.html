			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: KUROSAWA SERIES CONTINUES; CURTIZ FILMS, 3-D FEST ON TAP  </P> <P> There is an abundance of alternative film offerings this week.  </P> <P> The comprehensive Kurosawa retrospective continues at the Little Tokyo Cinemas,  as does the survey of Iranian cinema of the '80s at UCLA, where a 34-film  Michael Curtiz series commences tonight with his 1921 Austrian silent "The Way  of Terror." There's even a three-month 3-D festival starting Friday at the  Vagabond, with the 1953 "House of Wax." Director Andre de Toth and star Vincent  Price are expected to appear.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, LACE will present "Ten to Eleven: Television by Alexander Kluge," a  90-minute presentation of recent work for TV by the spiritual father of the New  German Cinema. The program will screen continuously during gallery hours from  today through May 20.  </P> <P> "Ten to Eleven" finds Kluge at his most playful, freely associating and  reprocessing images from 20th-Century popular culture to create fresh and often  amusing meanings. One whimsical segment imagines the kidnaping of the Eiffel  Tower, its relocation to an Arizona canyon and eventual magical return to  Paris. Not surprisingly, there are many references to World Wars I and II, and  Kluge even includes a newsreel on currency reform in the immediate aftermath of  the Second World War. Throughout these videos, Kluge makes connections between  popular culture, current events and economics.  </P> <P> One delightful segment deals with vintage advertisements, with Kluge reducing a  silly Nazi gymnastics rally -- the gymnasts form a swastika a la Busby Berkeley  as a finale -- to the level of a commercial. Through a bit of judicious  editing, Kluge turns an actress in an old movie -- she is almost certainly Leni  Riefenstahl -- into endorsing a product in the midst of a love scene. Best of  all is Kluge's "100 Years of Tango," which intermixes shots of the Battle of  the Marne to the cooling towers of a nuclear plant, with homages to the tango's  greatest stars, Rudolph Valentino and Argentine singer Carlos Gardel, both of  whom suffered untimely deaths. Information: (213) 624-5650.  </P> <P> Also commencing today is "Amerikanism," a series of films presented at the  County Museum of Art in association with the Goethe Institute, which explores  the role of America in Weimar culture after World War I. Opening the  retrospective in the Bing Theater at 8 p.m. is Fritz Lang's final silent,  "Woman in the Moon" (1929), a film so prophetically accurate and technically  dazzling that in 1937 the Gestapo confiscated not only all models of its  spaceship but also all foreign prints of the picture.  </P> <P> Though Lang was honored for the film years later by the Space and Rocket Center  in Huntsville, Ala., he always gave major credit to his good friend, pioneer  rocket enthusiast Dr. Willy Ley, who collaborated with Hermann Oberth (later a  rocket designer for the Nazis) in designing for the film a two-step rocket  model along with other elaborate paraphernalia of space travel.  </P> <P> Based on a novel by Lang's then-wife and co-scenarist Thea von Harbou, "Woman  in the Moon," apart from its stunning visuals, is a typically exaggerated  silent melodrama, a kind of vintage "Star Wars" played straight and involving  an eternal triangle between two men and a woman. While Lang did not take the  film's plot seriously, he was always proud of the film, especially for his  inadvertent invention of the countdown to dramatize visually the spaceship's  takeoff, a special challenge in the silent cinema.  </P> <P> Performance artist and avant-garde composer Christine Baczewska will perform a  live sound track for the film, using her voice as the primary instrument and  supplementing it with synthesized tracks.  </P> <P> Friday's 8 p.m. program will be F. W. Murnau's "Sunrise" (1927) and Walter  Ruttmann's "Berlin: Symphony of a City" (1927). For full schedule, call (213)  857-6010.  </P> <P> This month's Temp'theque program at the Directors Guild is "The Divine Garbo."  If you missed "A Woman of Affairs" last January at UCLA, you will have another  chance Saturday at 7 p.m. Greta Garbo is at her most transcendently beautiful  and subtle in this 1928 silent version of Michael Arlen's "The Green Hat." It's  followed at 9:15 by "Love," a 1927 version of "Anna Karenina."  </P> <P> Friday's 7 p.m. double bill includes her first two MGM features, "The Torrent"  and "The Temptress" (both 1926), followed at 9:45 by one of her finest, "Flesh  and the Devil" (1927). For full schedule: (213) 466-FILM.  </P></p>

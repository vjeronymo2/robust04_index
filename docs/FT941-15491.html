			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore launches split capital investment trust Gartmore is launching a new split capital investment trust, the British Income and Growth Trust, via an offer for subscription opening on February 15. There will be two classes of shares: ordinary income, with a predicted dividend yield of 9.3 per cent; and zero dividend preference shares, with a forecast annualised gross redemption yield of 8 per cent. Packaged units, yielding 4.4 per cent, are also available. The trust will invest in UK shares with higher than average yields, though not always the highest yielding, to allow greater diversification. The trust is due to be wound up at the end of 2002. It will need to achieve growth of 5 per cent a year if income shares are to be repaid with no loss of capital, and an annual yield of 140 per cent of the FT-SE-A All-Share to cover all charges as well as predicted yields on income shares and packaged units. Mr Lewis McNaught, of Gartmore Fund Managers, said he expected strong demand for the zeros from institutions, and for the income shares from private investors looking for Pep investments ahead of the tax year end. Mr John Szymanowski, an investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, said the trust was very similar to Gartmore's Shared Equity trust, which had a slightly higher yield. Shared Equity was launched in November as a result of the restructuring of Gartmore Value. Mr McNaught said that interest shown in that launch had prompted the development of the new fund with an almost identical structure. Launch expenses will be capped at 4 per cent, and the annual management charge will be 0.5 per cent. Pep charges will be 1 per cent initially and 0.75 per cent annually.</p>

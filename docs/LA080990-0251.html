			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MTV SUED OVER GAME SHOW IDEA  </P> <P> "I want my MTV royalties," says a 39-year-old man who claims in a federal  lawsuit that the music television network stole his copyrighted idea for a rock  'n' roll game show.  </P> <P> Mark Winik, who runs a printing supply company, is suing MTV and its parent  company, Viacom Inc., over the network's 3-year-old game show "Remote Control"  and a show that debuted this year called "Turn It Up."  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed this week in U.S. District Court, contends that Winik  developed an idea in 1985 for a game show called "Rockout." He copyrighted the  concept and tried to sell it to MTV in 1986, but the music network rejected his  proposal, the suit said.  </P></p>

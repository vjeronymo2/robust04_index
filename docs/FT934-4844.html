			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Mayhew takes responsibility for mistakes Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, accepted 'full ministerial responsibility' last night for a series of errors in secret documents released by the government this week detailing exchanges with Provisional IRA leaders. The government admitted to 18 errors in the 39 pages of papers. Most of the mistakes were in a single document: a nine-paragraph message to Provisional leaders on March 19 - the eve of the Warrington bombing - setting out the government's conditions for beginning talks. A version of this message was also released this week by Sinn Fein. The effect of last night's corrections is that the government now admits the Sinn Fein version was accurate in virtually every respect. Late last night, in a letter to Northern Ireland MPs and parliamentary spokesmen, Sir Patrick said the errors had arisen from the speed with which the dossier of messages had had to be completed. Many of the mistakes involved the omission or substitution of a single word but in the government's report of a message from Provisional leaders, sent on August 14, a sentence was left out. This read: 'The purpose of a dialogue about peace is to bring all organised violence by all parties to the conflict to an end.' As many as seven of the errors occurred in a single paragraph of the March 19 message to the IRA. The government attributed these to a mistaken transcription from a late draft of the document. There have been suggestions that the government's original version of this paragraph appeared to confirm that Provisional leaders initiated the chain of messages by asking for the government's advice on how to bring the Northern Ireland conflict to a close, while the Sinn Fein version cast doubt upon it. The government's original version included the wording: 'We note that what is being sought at this stage is advice.' It has now accepted that the Sinn Fein version - 'What is being sought at this stage is advice'  - is accurate. Provisional leaders have denied that it made any request for advice. Sir Patrick said: 'Since my statement in the House on Monday, allegations have been made by the IRA leadership that it was the British government who initiated the exchange of messages and was seeking advice. These allegations are entirely false. The first message was the one received on 22 February originating from the IRA.'</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'HERITAGE COURT' PROGRESSES  </P> <P> Dominguez Park in Redondo Beach is one step closer to becoming the permanent  home of Morrell House and two other historic homes. The City Council Tuesday  approved the concept of a "heritage court" for historic houses at the park on  190th Street.  </P> <P> It now requires approval from the Parks and Recreation and Planning  commissions.  </P> <P> The proposed plan would put the historic home, built in the 1900s, next to a  parking lot near Flagler Lane. Although the council set aside space for two  additional historic homes in the nine-acre park, those buildings have not been  chosen.  </P> <P> The Morrell House on North Carolina Street was bought in November, 1987, and  the site was developed for condominiums. Simon Chang, the developer, donated  the house to the city when preservationists sought to have it saved.  </P> <P> The city relocated the Morrell House to Perry Allison Playfield in March. But  residents near that small park objected to the loss of open space. Since then  the city has sought alternative sites for the heritage court.  </P> <P> The estimated cost for the move of the home to Dominguez Park would be $17,200,  city officials said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTS CENTER'S BUDGET GROWTH TO ALLOW MORE PROGRAMMING;  </P> <P> FINANCES: THANKS TO A SERIES OF SUMMER SELLOUTS, THE FACILITY IS $400,000 AHEAD  OF ITS PROJECTED SPENDING PLAN, MEANING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CAN ADD SOME  SHOWS IN 1990.  </P> <P> Confident of ending the year in the black after a series of sold-out summer  programs, the Orange County Performing Arts Center has adopted an operating  budget of $16.5 million for 1990 -- $1.5 million larger than this year's. The  money would support a slight increase in programming, according to Center  President Thomas R. Kendrick.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Center has asked its original architect, theater designer and  general contractor to prepare a "specific needs study" for an proposed new  concert hall, said Kendrick, who made the announcements Thursday after a  quarterly meeting of the Center's board of directors.  </P> <P> The Center is $400,000 ahead of its current projected $15-million budget  because of its "extraordinarily successful summer," Kendrick said. "We had 25  sellouts in a row within four weeks of (performances by) the Kirov Ballet,  'Fiddler on the Roof' and 'Cats.' "  </P> <P> The 1990 budget increase is attributable principally to plans for "slightly  more programming."  </P> <P> Last year, there were 210 presentations in the building, sponsored by regional  groups and by the Center itself. Revenue, generated mostly through ticket  sales, are projected to increase by $1.5 million in 1990, Kendrick said. The  prediction is based on increased attendance, he added, not higher ticket  prices.  </P> <P> Overall attendance so far this year is up 5% and subscription renewals for both  the Center's ballet and Broadway series -- which alone gained 1,300 new  subscribers this year -- have been strong, Kendrick said.  </P> <P> Ticket sales have been far above the national average since the Center opened  in 1986, Kendrick continued. Last year, box office receipts contributed 83% of  earned revenue, compared to the national average of about 65%.  </P> <P> Even with the ticket sales, the Center expects a budget deficit of $5.73  million before charitable donations for the 1990 budget, Kendrick said. But  fund-raising efforts and other sources of support are expected to deliver $5.74  million.  </P> <P> Included in the 1990 budget is $100,000 for the needs study, to be conducted by  CRSS (called Caudill Rowlett Scott when the firm designed the center),  Peck-Jones General Contractors, and John von Szeliski, who designed technical  elements of the Center's interior.  </P> <P> The study is intended to help staff members determine "exactly what kind of  (new) structure would be built," Kendrick said. Size and overall purpose would  be addressed, along with questions regarding specific facilities. Construction  costs can then be estimated and final plans drawn, Kendrick said.  </P> <P> Henry T. Segerstrom, the Center's chairman and chief operating officer, said a  site for the proposed Orange County hall also would not be discussed until the  needs study is complete. Segerstrom's family donated the land on which the  current Center building sits.  </P> <P> An earlier marketing feasibility study called for a new concert hall and a  smaller theater within the next decade. The proposed hall, to be used chiefly  by the Pacific Symphony and the Orange County Philharmonic Society, could cost  from $60 million to $80 million and seat 2,300 to 2,500, the study estimates.  </P> <P> Center officials expect the new study to "refine" these estimates. They also  hope it will avert problems in evidence at Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert  Hall, now under construction. Projected costs for that hall (for which  Peck-Jones also is contractor) have risen dramatically above initial  projections, Segerstrom said.  </P> <P> The Center board on Thursday also nominated two new members for three-year  terms: Reed L. Royalty, Pacific Bell's vice president for Orange, Riverside,  San Bernardino and Inyo counties; and Michael B.A. Nobbs, vice president and  managing director of Citicorp Real Estate Western Region.  </P> <P> The Center also signed a new three-year contract with the International  Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the stagehands' union, which remains  virtually unchanged in its primary terms, Kendrick said.  </P></p>

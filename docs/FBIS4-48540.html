			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Yaovi Agboyibor, chairman of the Action </F> Committee for Renewal in Lome on 20 May]    [Text] The steering committee of the Action Committee for  Renewal [CAR] met today and took note of the fact that the  so-called by-elections slated for 15 May did not take place.  The CAR interprets the nonorganization of these elections as  the government's recognition of the fact that these elections  can only take place at a date when the conditions of legality,  openness, and security have been met. Consequently, the CAR has  decided to lift its ban on the participation of its deputies in  National Assembly sessions.</p>

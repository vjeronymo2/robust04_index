			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Call to liberalise cable TV Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, yesterday threw his weight publicly behind a full and speedy liberalisation of Europe's cable television infrastructure. The commissioner, outlining the role of competition policy in telecommunications, said his aides were studying the impact of allowing cable TV companies to offer services already open to competition, such as alarm services and data bases. This would not include voice telephony to the public. 'The central issue we have to address is whether such an initiative would undermine the ability of the incumbent telecoms operator to provide universal service. It is my conviction that this is not the case,' said Mr Van Miert.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A VOICE AGAINST SUNDAY MULHOLLAND CLOSURE  </P> <P> About the Mulholland Sunday closure from Kanan Road to Seminole Hot Springs  (Aug. 5): Is this an efficient and economical use of sheriff's and CHP  personnel?  </P> <P> If the object of the exercise is to end street racing, then identify the dozen  or so young men who insist on misusing the public road and impound their  vehicles and restrict their licenses. As it is now, the cops are used as hired  thugs to harass the business and patrons at the Rockstore, which is being  scapegoated as the cause of street racing.  </P> <P> Developers would love Ed &amp; Vern Savko, the owners, to be forced out, to  obtain their property for continued exploitation of the Santa Monica Mountains.  Where is the Planning Commission? Who is in bed with the local supervisor?  Should sheriff's and CHP units be parked all day Sunday when there are real law  enforcement and traffic duties elsewhere on the coast and access roads?  </P> <P> The Mulholland Highway Scenic Corridor, conceived as a recreational route for  citizens of Southern California, has become a fat prize for greedy developers  intent on paving the entire mountains for profit. And the cops have become  their gunsels.  </P> <P> What will be next "For Our Own Good?" PCH closed except for those who can  afford to live on the coast?  </P> <P> ALAN D. TEEL  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

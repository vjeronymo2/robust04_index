			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Leading Article: The dollar dilemma The gyrations of the dollar since the news of strong American jobs data on Friday still leaves the US currency well below the levels predicted by mainstream forecasters at the start of the year. What is the explanation for the dollar's continuing weakness against the D-Mark and the yen in the aftermath of successive increases in the US federal funds rate? With the Fed tightening policy, it was widely assumed that the dollar could only rise, with short-term rates still falling in Europe and possibly also in Japan. Instead, the dollar has weakened, and often on the basis of perverse arguments. The yen, to take the obvious case, has risen against the dollar on trade war rhetoric. Yet a trade war should have precisely the opposite effect: protectionism in the US would lead to the sale of fewer dollars because of an enforced fall in Japanese exports. Short-term technical factors no doubt provide part of the explanation for the US currency's weakness. Many hedge fund operators had been overweight in dollars before the Fed's first rate increase on February 4, so there was bound to be a backwash as leveraged speculative positions were unwound. Yet there are also important fundamental factors at work. The more interesting of them relate to the pattern of long-term portfolio flows. A notable change over the past 18 months has been the recognition by US pension funds of the portfolio theorists' case for international diversification. From holding less than 5 per cent of their assets overseas they have increased their average holdings to about 8 per cent and will probably reach double figures by the end of 1994. Mutual funds, which have seen huge inflows of money as depositors have deserted the banking system for higher returns in the capital markets, have been diversifying in similar fashion. Portfolio exodus While hedge funds have been responsible for significant capital outflows, these two conventional groups of investors have been the more significant impetus behind last year's portfolio exodus from the US of more than Dollars 120bn. When that long-term capital outflow of Dollars 120bn is added to the current account deficit of Dollars 120bn to produce a figure that used to be known as the basic balance, there are potentially stressful implications for global markets. The Japanese current account - and thus the Japanese supply of savings to world markets - is no longer rising. Within the capital account of the Japanese balance of payments the long-term outflow is modest by the standards of the 1980s. European countries are not, in aggregate, diversifying on anything resembling the scale of the US. So the US is going through a huge one-off portfolio adjustment at a time when there is no comparable balancing flow of stable long-term funds back into the US. It follows that the financing of the US balance of payments is unduly dependent on short-term inflows and foreign central bank purchases of dollars. Overvalued yen Since the Japanese authorities are anxious to prevent an overvalued yen throttling their exporters, they are no doubt happy to oblige for the moment. But for all other holders of dollars the extent of the long-term outflow means that an increased risk premium is probably required to compensate for an excessive portfolio weighting towards the dollar. In Europe this point is reinforced by the growing evidence of economic recovery. An upturn in Germany would imply that the Bundesbank's scope for interest rate cuts may be less than earlier assumed. Taken together with political worries arising from the Whitewater affair and concern over changes in the composition of the board of the US Federal Reserve, this could well imply continuing short-term vulnerability for the dollar. But before too long the portfolio pressures may ease. The markets have been pricing three-month money in 12 months time at about 5 1/2 per cent, substantially above today's level. That, taken against the background of weak bond and equity markets, would imply a considerable incentive for investors to retreat from mutual funds back into the banks. A flow of unhedged mutual fund capital would then be repatriated, creating upward pressure on the dollar. If at that point the US is still expanding more strongly than Europe and Japan, the dollar bulls may have their day.</p>

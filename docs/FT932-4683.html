			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Emap up 56% and new magazines on the way EMAP, the media and exhibitions group, is planning its most significant slate of new magazine launches for many years. Mr Robin Miller, chief executive, said yesterday plans were well advanced for new magazines in motoring, music and other leisure areas in both the UK and Europe - an immediate investment in the region of Pounds 5m. He was speaking as the group announced a 56 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 42.4m for the year to April 3 - underlying profit growth of 24 per cent excluding the effects of last June's Pounds 78m rights issue and new accountancy standards. Mr Graham Ross-Russell, chairman, said the record results had been achieved with no help from the economy and 'we are not expecting much assistance in the year ahead'. The strongest performer was consumer magazines where operating profit rose 17 per cent to Pounds 24.2m on turnover up from Pounds 115.1m to Pounds 142.6m. The group had 24 titles in the Top 100. The worst result came from newspapers and printing where there was a 15 per cent fall in operating profit to Pounds 6.7m. Emap lost a significant contract - the printing of the Sport newspapers to the Daily Telegraph. The loss and tight margins led to restructuring and a cut in overall pay of 20-30 per cent for about 100 printers. Newspaper advertising was down by 1 per cent although there were signs of improvement in the final quarter. Exhibitions showed an 11 per cent increase in operating profit to Pounds 6.4m and the first full year of Radio City and Kiss FM saw revenue up 18 per cent and profit of Pounds 800,000. Emap has applied for a new AM licence in London for a service aimed mainly at women. The largest percentage leap came in business publishing where profits rose from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 4.6m, mainly reflecting the acquisition of Maxwell Business Communications. There was also a maiden contribution from the 14 business titles bought from International Thomson. 'We increased profit margins on the Maxwell titles from 4 per cent to 9 per cent. We hope we can do the same with the Thomson titles,' Mr Miller said. A final dividend of 5.825p lifts the total by 9 per cent to 7.9p, payable from earnings of 17p (12.1p). COMMENT Emap continues to produce good results from a stable formula of launching new titles and going for careful acquisitions. The group will have to continue doing that to justify its high market rating - a current 37 per cent premium on the FT-A All-Share Index. The group is, however, not relying on any help from the economy in their budget forecasts for the current year. A sustained economic recovery could transform the outlook for the company. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 47m and Pounds 49m this year.</p>

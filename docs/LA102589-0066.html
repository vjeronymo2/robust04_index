			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROUND-THE-CLOCK TALKS URGED IN TEACHERS  STRIKE  </P> <P> Petitions containing more than 900 signatures from parents and other residents  urging the Beverly Hills school board to begin round-the-clock talks with  striking teachers were delivered to district headquarters Tuesday afternoon,  according to a newly formed parents group.  </P> <P> The group, called Children First, began circulating the petitions Friday night.  The petitions also ask the board to "explore creative financial alternatives"  to provide raises for the teachers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on Day 7 of the strike, attendance appeared to be stabilizing.  Districtwide, it was at 58% Tuesday, down slightly from Monday's 60% but up  from the 43% of last week.  </P> <P> Also on Tuesday, about 170 Beverly Hills teachers, many dressed in black,  marched outside Hawthorne School to protest what they said were the autocratic  and anti-union policies of the principal there. The teachers union had filed a  charge with the Public Employment Relations Board, accusing Principal Ann  Picker of undermining the union and of harassing union representative at the  school.  </P> <P> The employment relations board is investigating the case, board attorney Tom  Allen said. He said the charge is not directly connected to the strike over  wages and benefits.  </P> <P> Picker has declined to comment on the union's charge, referring inquiries to  Supt. Robert French. On Tuesday, French reiterated his support of Picker. He  said the case is a personnel matter and that it is "totally improper" for the  union to bring it up during the strike.  </P> <P> Teachers are demanding an 18% salary increase over two years. The district says  it can afford only 11%.  </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Taiwan prosecutor questions executive THE chairman of a Taiwanese company at the centre of the island's biggest shares scandal has denied charges of manipulating stocks and has been allowed bail, Reuter reports from Taipei. Taipei's chief prosecutor Chuang Chun-shan freed Mr Peter Hsu, chairman of the Formosan Rubber Group, on bail of TDollars 1m (Pounds 22,471) after questioning. Mr Hsu, who had been sought by agents of the Bureau of Investigation, voluntarily appeared before the prosecutor. He denied collaborating with detained leading stock market player Mr Lei Po-lung to manipulate the price of shares of Formosan Rubber. Meanwhile, Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission has recommended that 21 people be charged with stock manipulation. Mr Chuang said he would summon the suspects for questioning before deciding whether to charge them. He did not name any of them, but said they were individual investors. If found guilty they could face seven years in prison. The 21 allegedly manipulated the price of shares in Formosan Rubber, which is at the centre of a scandal surrounding defaults on payments for TDollars 9bn stock purchases. The price of Formosan Rubber's shares soared to TDollars 370 per share in September from TDollars 68.50 in May. It closed at TDollars 89.50 yesterday. A leading stock market player and a board member of Formosan Rubber are in custody on similar charges. Mr Lei Po-lung, one of four shadowy 'Big Hands' who often determine the fortunes of the volatile and speculative market, was detained on September 20 for alleged involvement in a string of stock payment defaults that sent the bourse plunging last month. Mr Alex Hsu, a member of the board of directors of Formosan Rubber Group, has been detained for allegedly collaborating with Mr Lei to prop up the price of the company's shares.</p>

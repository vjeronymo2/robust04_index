			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Wace shares drop 33% after property write-down of Pounds 37m SHARES in Wace tumbled a third from 77p to 52p after the pre-press and specialist printing group warned that profits for 1992 would be well below market expectations. Wace, which earlier this year was rocked by the sudden departure of Mr John Clegg, chief executive, also announced a Pounds 37m property write-down and said the US operations would be sold. It said tough trading conditions had forced it to reduce costs, and restructuring would lead to an exceptional charge of Pounds 5m. Mr Trevor Grice, who took over as chief executive, said properties were being carried in Wace's books at values assessed last December by Dominic Hart, a company of chartered surveyors with which Mr Clegg had been closely connected. The group appointed Richard Ellis as surveyors, which as of November wrote down the value of the group's investment property from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 8.3m, industrial property from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 11.3m and US property from Dollars 14.3m to Dollars 9.3m (Pounds 5.9m). Mr Grice said of the write-down, of which the rest was associated costs: 'We were surprised by the severity.' After completing a strategic review, Wace has decided to sell its US operations, which last year accounted for more than a third of the group's total sales of Pounds 305m. Mr Grice said he hoped to raise about Dollars 100m net from the US disposal, which would be used to reduce group debt. Wace has a gearing of about 250 per cent after the property write-down, but Mr Grice emphasised that its interest cover was covered more than twice over by operating profit. Mr Clegg was living and working in the US when the DTI launched a still-unpublished investigation into share dealings that were conducted in the name of some of his relatives. Asked if Mr Clegg would be a buyer for the US operations, Mr Grice said: 'Never in a million years.' Wace said economic conditions had not improved. July and August had been difficult trading months and while sound results were recorded in September, October and November, the operating profits for the second half would be down on the first half and substantially down on the second half of last year. Last night's closing price gave Wace a market value of Pounds 38.2m, against last year's peak of Pounds 193m.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Trustees and the law A COUSIN and her husband were joint trustees of a small family trust. Her husband died several years ago, leaving her as sole trustee. Although I have suggested that she should appoint another trustee, she does not appear to see any need to do so. Is there any legal requirement that a trust should have more than one trustee, and can you indicate the likely cost involved in making a further appointment? As a general rule, the number of trustees is unlimited by law, one being sufficient and any greater number permissible. There is an exception, however, where land forms part of the settled property, in which case the minimum for giving a good receipt for purchase monies is two trustees who are individuals. While it is sufficient for there to be a sole trustee, this might be unsatisfactory from the point of view of the beneficiaries of the trust because of the opportunities for maladministration and fraud which then arise. The trust deed should be read to see if it provides for the minimum number of trustees. Additional trustees may be appointed under an express power in the trust deed, or by the exercise of a statutory power contained in section 36 Trustee Act 1925. Section 36 confers on a surviving trustee the power to appoint new trustees. The section also provides that the appointment be in writing, which usually means the drawing up of a deed. You will need to ask a solicitor how much he would charge for this and any other document which is required on the appointment of a new trustee (eg, a vesting declaration). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

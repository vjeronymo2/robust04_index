			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Question mark over CSFB as an era ends - The elevation of the London chairman to the holding company CREDIT SUISSE First Boston and its London chairman, Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff, have raised strong passions in the Euromarkets since the beginning of the 1980s. Arrogant, aggressive, ambitious - the bank has aroused a pungent mixture of distaste and respect in its rise to become one of the top London-based investment banks. Yesterday's announcement that Mr Rudloff was being elevated to the board of the bank's Swiss holding company, CS Holding, signalled the end of an era. It also raised a question about what changes lie in store for one of the most successful institutions operating in London's international financial markets. The answer yesterday from Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding: 'None.' He shrugged off suggestions that the management moves had been prompted by CSFB's disappointing performance in 1992. The bulk of the group's profits last year were provided by First Boston, which had been outshone by CSFB in previous years. In addition, CSFB's standing in the Eurobond league table slipped to third, with a market share down to under 6 per cent. 'There has been no dissatisfaction with last year's performance, even if it wasn't as shining as in the past,' said Mr Gut. Profits were held back by CSFB's expansion in eastern Europe and the move of its London operations to Canary Wharf, which takes effect on Monday. Both of these were investments for the future, he said. There were no plans to change course. Despite this, the close identification of Mr Rudloff with CSFB's success make yesterday's changes seem charged with significance. Mr Rudloff was in charge throughout the era of expansion in London which preceded the 1988 reorganisation of CS Holding's investment banking interests in London and New York. Before the changes, it operated as an autonomous London-based bank, separate from First Boston in the US. Afterwards, a new group company, CS First Boston, was created to own operations in Europe (Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston), the US (First Boston) and the Asia/Pacific region (CS First Boston Pacific). CS First Boston is itself 66 per cent owned by CS Holding, which also owns Credit Suisse. The reorganisation was intended to end divisive rivalries which had afflicted the group, as well as to generate more cross-border investment banking business. 'Those rivalries are a thing of the past,' says Mr Gut now. But other senior bankers in the Euromarkets claim that there is still no love lost between the various parts of CSFB. Could the appointment of Mr Mulford, a former US Treasury official, and a vice-chairman of First Boston, reflect a shift of control towards the US and Mr Jack Hennessey, head of the CS First Boston group? Mr Rudloff described Mr Mulford - a former Merrill Lynch executive - as 'very good on the new business side'. But despite his 20 years of experience in investment banking, insiders at CSFB expect him to be less hands-on than Mr Rudloff. Control of day-to-day operations of the firm in London seem likely to remain in the hands of Mr Allen Wheat. Hired from Bankers Trust in 1990 to head Credit Suisse Financial Products, the firm's derivatives unit, he is now also head of trading in London. Mr Wheat had himself been tipped for some months as a potential successor to Mr Rudloff.</p>

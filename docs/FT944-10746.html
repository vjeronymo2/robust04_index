			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: WEW Group returns to black with Pounds 3.3m After its first full year at the helm, the new management team at WEW Group, which currently runs 71 What Everyone Wants discount stores, was yesterday able to announce a return to the black. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to July 30 emerged at Pounds 3.25m, against losses last time of Pounds 2.09m, on total turnover of Pounds 112m (Pounds 106m) - Pounds 2.04m was from discontinued activities. The turnround was helped by a reduction in net interest charges to Pounds 355,000 (Pounds 744,000) after the injection of Pounds 15m of new capital in January. The group has had to take Pounds 397,000 as an exceptional charge, representing compensation to Mr Ian Grabiner, who resigned as managing director in August. There have been provisions of Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 3.21m) in respect of properties and operational guarantees from the discontinued Dennis Day, the clothing manufacturer now sold. At the operating level, profits from continuing operations were Pounds 5.13m (Pounds 6.02m restated). Earnings were 1.35p (losses 2.7p) per share, and the final is lifted to 0.35p (0.25p), though the total falls to 0.7p (1.35p). Shares closed down 2p at 31p.</p>

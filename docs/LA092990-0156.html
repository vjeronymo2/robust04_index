			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> AFTER HECTIC DAY, CALM RETURNS TO OIL FUTURES MARKETS  </P> <P> Crude oil prices Friday failed to top the record highs of the day before and  closed practically unchanged in a day of skittish trading marked by a lack of  news from the Middle East.  </P> <P> Crude oil for November delivery closed down just 3 cents a barrel from  Thursday's record close, settling at $39.51 a barrel. Crude oil for later  months closed slightly higher.  </P> <P> The uneventful trading was in sharp contrast with the frenetic buying of the  day before, when rumors of war drove crude oil prices briefly above $40 a  barrel for the first time since crude futures began trading on the New York  Mercantile Exchange seven years ago.  </P> <P> "It was a quiet day," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus  Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "There's a reluctance to buy or to  sell. . . . Many people I've talked with today are breathing a collective sigh  of relief."  </P> <P> Overall, crude oil prices on the mercantile exchange have gained $4.08 a barrel  in the last week and more than $18 since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.  </P> <P> Prices rose at the opening Friday but peaked at $39.95, suggesting resistance  at the psychological barrier of $40.  </P> <P> "I think people were very cautious and wanted maybe to reduce their exposure a  little bit going into the weekend, and they didn't want to take on any new  positions," said James R. Fiedler, a broker with E D &amp; F Man International  Futures Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> Prices then fell as traders took profits, spurred partly by news that the House  had agreed to triple the proposed 5-million-barrel test drawdown of crude oil  from the 590-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The low during the  trading day was $38.65 a barrel.  </P> <P> The low prices sparked renewed buying, and prices picked up near the close,  nearly reaching Thursday's level. "With the threat of war out there, people are  afraid to be too short," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy  Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> One reason: Sunday is the birthday of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed, a likely  occasion for more harsh words from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> On Thursday, traders paid little attention to President Bush's announcement  that he would begin tapping the strategic reserve in an effort to cool  overheated markets. As prices went through the roof that day, Administration  officials backed off statements that the test drawdown was intended to lower  oil prices.  </P> <P> But Energy Secretary James D. Watkins let it be known to House leaders that he  would favor increasing the drawdown to 500,000 barrels a day, and the House  voted for the change Friday.  </P> <P> Still, the news did not quell fears that war may break out and threaten  worldwide oil shortages, fears that are keeping oil prices firm, traders said.  </P> <P> The International Energy Agency, which met Friday in Paris, did little to allay  those anxieties: It ruled out following Bush's lead and tapping strategic  reserves of its 21 industrial country members.  </P> <P> The IEA did, however, ask its members to prepare for emergency drawdowns in the  event of supply disruptions.  </P> <P> Beyond that, there was little of the paranoia of recent days to drive Friday's  trading, traders said. "There's end-of-the-week profit taking. There's a real  lack of any fresh rumors. There's no saber rattling," said Sal Gilbertie, a  trader with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.  </P> <P> Prices for unleaded gasoline opened higher but closed lower as traders took  profits as the month ended. Unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed down  0.93 of a cent at $1.0176 a gallon. Prices for later months also closed down.  </P> <P> Buying of home heating oil contracts was stronger as fears of winter shortages  persisted, and home heating oil for October delivery closed up 0.61 cent a  gallon at $1.0498. Contracts for later months also closed higher, except  January, which was off a tenth of a cent.  </P></p>

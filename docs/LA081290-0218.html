			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SET YOUR VCR  </P> <P> Targets (TMC Wednesday at 8:30 a.m.): Peter Bogdanovich's provocative 1968  feature debut contrasts the screen terror so long represented by Boris Karloff  (to whom the film is an homage) and the impersonal mass killings represented by  the Texas tower sniper (and his many predecessors). (1:30)  </P> <P> Henry V (KCOP Wednesday at 8 p.m.): Laurence Olivier's stylized 1945  Technicolor version is durably stirring -- and brought him a special Oscar.  (2:00)  </P> <P> On Dangerous Ground (AMC Saturday at 10 a.m.): An unjustly forgotten 1951  Nicholas Ray film noir starring Robert Ryan as an embittered big-city police  detective who crosses paths with a trusting blind woman (Ida Lupino) living in  the wilderness. Boasts Bernard Herrmann's favorite among his scores. (1:30)  </P> <P> French Can-can (Bravo Saturday at 9 p.m., 1 a.m. early Saturday): Jean Renoir's  lush, heartfelt 1955 homage to show business, a clearly fictionalized account  of the Moulin Rouge, is very much like a Hollywood backstage musical, yet is  also a highly personal expression of love for the theater. Jean Gabin stars.  (1:33)  </P> <P> The Seventh Seal (KCET Saturday at midnight): The 1956 Ingmar Bergman  allegorical masterpiece in which Max Von Sydow plays a knight engaged in a game  of chess with Death. (1:40)  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (2): New name for an old idea - The impact of simultaneous engineering THE FURTHER one looks into the future, the more wayward the predictions. As a result, UK, European and US manufacturing companies, with over-long development times, are delivering products that no longer meet customers' expectations when launched. Yet, according to Computervision's 1992 manufacturing attitudes survey (carried out by Benchmark Research) cutting the time it takes to develop products was a key business issue for only 63 per cent of companies, with quality and reduced costs occupying the top positions. What has yet to be fully realised is that long development times, increased costs and poor quality go hand in hand. Dr Nick Barter, chief engineer at Jaguar, explains the situation: 'It takes European car companies six years to develop a car, while the Japanese take two years and produce more variants.' The Japanese can react far quicker to customer demands and keep costs down by using new technologies and the latest production techniques. 'Another advantage', says Mr Stephen Nugent of Computervision, 'is that if you have only two years rather than six between models, it does not matter if you get landed with a dud.' Short product cycles also need improved quality. With a product development cycle of two years, the Japanese cannot afford the European and US luxury of 11 months to return to normal after a car launch. In short, Japan is in the driving seat on cost, quality and development time. All businesses, not just automotive companies, face time pressures. For Rolls-Royce to stay competitive it had to cut engine development time from eight years to match Boeing's four-year airframe development. Lesser league players than the international automotive and aerospace giants also see time as a competitive pressure. As Mr Benjamin Taylor, joint managing director of probe manufacturer Renishaw, explains: 'We were seeing products cost twice what they should to develop and we still did not get it right. If we can develop products quicker there is less of a problem if we get it wrong.' The obvious solution is to cut the time it takes to design new products. The question is: How? In the past two years simultaneous (some call it concurrent) engineering has entered the industrialists' lexicon. It is a new name for an old idea. For many years companies have been using multi-disciplinary design and manufacturing teams to develop products that, in theory, meet customer and production requirements. The difference today is the influence of the computer. While there is little doubt that the principles of simultaneous engineering can be achieved without computers, judicious use of technology is needed to reap all the potential benefits. A premise of simultaneous engineering is that putting more effort into the concept phase of a design will reduce the number of problems experienced later when expensive tooling, components and equipment have been ordered. The assumption is that these potential design, manufacturing and material problems can be identified early on. 'For many companies that is still an act of faith,' claims Mr Peter Penhallow, consultant at AT&amp;T Istel. The risk is that the concept design phase will be lengthened without any reduction of manufacturing problems, cost or time to market. Like all techniques, total quality, just-in-time and so on, badly implemented simultaneous engineering will fail. And information on how to implement it is scarce. There are plenty of academic papers on company organisation and the team approach, but most of the practical savings will come from modifying the design to manufacturing process to make it more efficient and responsive to change. Today, any simultaneous engineering solution involves computers. Unfortunately, if users and vendors are honest, the impact of an isolated technologies such as computer-aided design and manufacturing (Cadcam) on overall development time, product cost or total quality has been negligible. The reasons are more to do with the way these systems are used rather than the technology. A Cad system restricted to a design department will contribute little to simultaneous engineering. However, computers have the potential to link the different functions - design with manufacturing, purchasing with engineering and so on - needed to make simultaneous engineering work. Neither organisational change or technology alone can solve the time problem. Both must operate in harmony. Take the example of Renishaw. It operates collocated, multi-disciplinary development teams, but the actual time and cost savings achieved come from the efficient use of technology. Renishaw's main problems occurred when products moved from being specially produced in the model shop to mass production. The solution was to eliminate the time and cost associated with prototype model building and go direct from design to manufactured part. By using a modified version of McDonnell Douglas' (now EDS) CAD system, Renishaw captures all the design and manufacturing expertise of the development teams into a CAD solid model of the part. This information is then used to program the production machines. The writer edits Manufacturing Systems magazine</p>

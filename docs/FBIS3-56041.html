			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Yakovleva: "President Repeals Incorrect </F> Decisions on Land Reform"]    [Text] A president's edict has been signed "on bringing  Russian Federation land legislation into line with the Russian  Federation Constitution."    "This is an entirely natural procedure: to remove the  restrictive norms of the old legislation after the adoption of a  new Constitution," Doctor of Economic Sciences Yevgeniya Serova,  adviser to the minister of agriculture for economic questions,  comments on the situation.    And so what has this edict repealed? It has transferred all  powers of the abolished Soviets connected with the regulation of  land relations to the local administrations. It has removed  from the Land Code the concept of the "holding inherited for  life," which was once introduced as a palliative under  conditions when it was impossible to legalize land ownership.    In addition, Article 7 of the edict "on the regulation of  land relations and the development of agrarian reform in  Russia," which grants committees for land resources and land use  the right to trade in land which, as IZVESTIYA wrote, is fraught  with the danger of the emergence of a monopoly trader, has been  repealed. Although this has no direct bearing on the  Constitution it does correct an erroneous preceding decision.  The decree and statute on holding competitions and auctions for  the sale of land plots, which enshrined the unjustified rights  of the Russian Committee for Land Reform and Land Resources,  which followed the edict, are also being repealed.    In Yevgeniya Serova's opinion, from the viewpoint of legal  technique, the amendments could have been done more  punctiliously.    By mechanically repealing the concept of the "holding  inherited for life" and failing to explain the terms under which  this right is turned into property, millions of people have been  plunged into an area which is not governed by law. And by  depriving the Russian Committee for Land Reform and Land  resources of the right to do deals involving land plots on the  state's behalf (what they have in mind here is most likely the  purchase of land for federal needs) they have removed competent  people from this business. The "organ of state management,"  which will engage in this and which according to rumors should  be created by the State Committee for the Administration of  State Property, could be not very professional.</p>

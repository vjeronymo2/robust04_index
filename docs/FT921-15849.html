			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: Lully's 'Alceste' in Paris Some centenaries work. Lully's tercentenary came in 1987: in Paris the echoes have not died down but rather increased. From being a respected name in books and useful provider of warmers-up for song recitals, he is climbing up the classical charts. At the Champs-Elysees, the beautiful theatre now one of the city's auxiliary opera houses, a spectacular staging of his Alceste brilliantly inaugurates a series of annual Lully revivals, backed up by concert performances of relevant works (Gluck's Alceste included), lectures, exhibitions, sumptuously illustrated handbooks about 'tragedie lyrique'. At the Opera-Comique they are reviving the Arts Florissants production of Atys which won much praise in the tercentenary year. No half-measures or cheese-paring over Alceste. Producer Jean-Louis Martinoty has surrounded himself with a team of talents - Hans Schavernoch (sets), Daniel Ogier (costumes), Jacques Benyeta (lighting). The choreography, essential feature of an opera written by an expert dancer for a society mad about dancing, is by Marie-Genevieve Masse and Francois Raffinot. The Compagnie Barocco provides the dancers. Someone recently described Lully as 'the Diaghilev of his time, but a Diaghilev who could compose like Stravinsky and dance like Nijinsky'. That is not all: he coached, conducted and produced. Only Wagner rivalled him, and he didn't dance. Preparations for the first Alceste in 1674 were shared between Versailles and Paris, the heavy transport expenses for scenery and machines paid by the passionately interested Louis XIV, who attended rehearsals when he could. Because of court mourning the premiere took place not at Versailles but in Paris in the Palais Royal, the public theatre where Lully's operas were shown sooner or later to enthusiastic audiences ready to go again and again. Since Lully had a monopoly, there were no alternative choices. Alceste was the second of the 'tragedies lyriques' Lully wrote with Philippe Quinault, whose exceptional gifts as a librettist are now recognised again. There are many differences from the version of the story used by Gluck. Alceste is betrothed but not yet married to Admete. Alcide (Hercules) plays an important role: he loves Alceste devotedly. Having retrieved her from the underworld after she has sacrificed herself to save Admete (wounded in battle), he nobly gives her up to the man she loves. Lycomede, King of Skyros, is also in love with her. Comedy mingles freely with the serious matter. Alcide and Lycomede have confidants, Lychas and Straton, both in hot pursuit of Alceste's confidante Cephise, whose view of morality is in complete contrast - she welcomes both young men and would like more. One famous episode is the rough and ready but not unfriendly treatment by Caron (Charon) of the dead souls clamouring to cross the Styx in his bark. It is the great achievement of this staging that the producer, aided by Quinault and Lully's dramaturgical and musical skills, has ensured that the darker moments - Alceste and Admete grieving for his approaching death, the long scene of public mourning for Alceste, and most of all the sacrifice of Alcide, stand out strongly from the comedy and the mass of spectacle and movement. An art-form long regarded as dauntingly old-fashioned and overcomplicated is now, with each major revival of Lully or Rameau, being revealed as full of life, relevance, entertainment value and, given the means, eminently stageworthy. Schavernoch's designs boldly and imaginatively blend French Baroque with modern styles. There are machines galore - gods and goddesses descend from the skies on puffy silver clouds, fat little Cupids fly about, huge blown-up photographs of formal gardens or seascapes are viewed through tall windows with giant Venetian blinds with revolving slats polished like mirrors. There is a stunning effect when they reflect a floor-cloth painted like a baroque ceiling. Costumes are Baroque theatre traditional, worn in the French way with pride and unselfconsciousness. As the heroine, Colette Alliot-Lugaz gives yet another enchanting performance. She uses more, and more convincing, period gesture than anyone else. Howard Crook sings Admete with his usual poise. No-one could make the character seem worth so much sacrifice. Jean-Philippe Lafont asked indulgence for a bad throat, but his Alcide is a noble, commanding, moving figure. He is one of the lucky ones who can dominate a stage while keeping still. Francois Loup mops and mows as the oily Lycomede. The comedy roles are in the expert hands of Sophie Marin-Degor (Cephise), Gilles Ragon (Lychas), Jean-Francois Gardeil (Straton), Gregory Reinhart (Caron), Michel Gens (Pheres). In the big mourning scene the voice of Veronique Gens rings out finely. One stumbling block of tragedie lyrique has always appeared to be the recitative for which Lully studied in detail the declamation of leading players of spoken theatre. Now we have a generation of singers who can perform these scenes clearly and naturally. And because so many of Quinault's lines are simple, direct and even witty, these same recitatives, weaving in and out of short, expressive 'airs', become a positive pleasure. Spectacle is indeed an essential part of French serious opera, but the words remain paramount. In Lully's day the libretto was published in advance, studied, and taken to the theatre. The Grande Ecurie et La Chambre du Roy (orchestra, authentic instruments) and the lively Ensemble Vocal Sagittarius (chorus), were under the direction of Jean-Claude Malgoire, who firmly outlined the shape and varying moods of the score even if one missed the greater rhythmic buoyancy and keener textures of other ensembles of this kind. The opera is given, so far as I could tell, virtually uncut. Dresden and Vienna contributed painted cloths, British firms supplied engineering and lighting technology. The list of technical personnel is as long as their handling is efficient. Paris programmes are less specific than ours about financial support. I gather sponsorship came from the Conseil Superieur du Mecenat Culturel and the Caisse des depots et consignation. Alceste is a co-production with Montpellier.</p>

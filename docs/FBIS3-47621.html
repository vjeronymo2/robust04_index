			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- The Clinton  administration's willingness to accept North Korea's offer of a  one- time inspection of seven out of nine identified nuclear  sites only emboldens North Korean leader Kim Il-song, a  conservative think-tank said Thursday [13 January].    The U.S. Government's agreement with North Korea on the  nuclear inspection leaves America's Asian allies wondering  whether U.S. security assurances are reliable, Seth Cropsey, the  director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, said.    The Clinton administration should make no more concessions  at  the negotiating table, Cropsey said.    Instead, it should inform North Korea that if it does not  allow full international inspections of all its nuclear sites on  a regular basis by Feb. 1, the United States will ask the U.N.  Security Council for economic sanctions the following day, he  said.    The Clinton administration has already erred by postponing a  diplomatic confrontation in the U.N. Security Council, where the  issue of sanctions against the Kim regime should be raised,  Cropsey said.    "North Korea now realizes President Bill Clinton suffers  from  lack of nerve, yielding to the apparent implacability of an  armed tyrant demonstrates vulnerability," Cropsey said.    "It can only lead to more North Korean evasion, excuses,  delaying tactics and in the end aggression -- perhaps nuclear  aggression."    Even worse, he said, "By placing two North Korean nuclear  sites beyond the reach of international inspectors, the  compromise leaves the way open for Kim to continue his  weapons-building program."    The compromise also abandons Washington's reasonable  expectations that North Korea will allow regular inspections as  set forth in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he said.    Cropsey, a former high-ranking U.S. Defense Ministry  official, recommended that the United States seize the  initiative in Asia with a number of bold steps. They include:    -- Lift the trade embargo against Vietnam to demonstrate to  North Korea that Americans are magnanimous to former foes.    -- Increase pressure on Japan to reduce the flow of funds --  at least 600 million U.S. dollars a year -- from Korean  residents in Japan who send desperately needed hard currency to  North Korea.    -- Promise more favorable terms to China as a means to  enlist  Beijing's help in putting economic pressure on Pyongyang.    -- Hold a naval military exercise in the western Pacific to  remind Kim Il-song how quickly America can move military forces  over a long distance.</p>

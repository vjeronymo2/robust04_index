			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> MAN HURT AS TRUCK CAB COMES LOOSE  </P> <P> A freak truck accident triggered by a dog in traffic left a 19-year-old Oxnard  man hospitalized in serious condition Monday, authorities said.  </P> <P> Ismael Espinoza had to be cut out of the truck's tilt-cab, which flipped  forward on Etting Road in Oxnard when the driver tried to stop for the dog and  crashed roof-first into a 50-foot-high telephone pole, a California Highway  Patrol spokesman said.  </P> <P> Espinoza was a passenger in the empty flatbed truck that he and his cousin,  Miguel Espinoza of Oxnard, had recently painted and were returning to its  owner, Officer Jim O'Connor said.  </P> <P> Miguel Espinoza, 22, was driving east on Etting Road about 12:40 p.m. when the  dog darted into his path near Hailes Road. He was traveling at about 30 m.p.h.,  which normally would have been slow enough to brake without difficulty,  O'Connor said.  </P> <P> But the latches on the truck's tilt-cab were not secure, and the momentum of  braking flipped the cab forward, so the windshield ended up parallel to the  road surface at bumper-high level, O'Connor said.  </P> <P> With the driver unable to steer or apply the brakes, and its occupants staring  down at asphalt, the truck veered off the roadway and the right side of the  roof sliced through a telephone pole and collapsed onto Ismael Espinoza, police  said.  </P> <P> Rescue workers took more than an hour to free the semiconscious passenger,  whose right leg was broken and deeply cut by the wreckage, O'Connor said.  </P> <P> Ismael Espinoza was in an intensive care unit at St. John's Regional Medical  Center after surgery to reattach severed leg arteries, a hospital spokeswoman  said.  </P> <P> Miguel Espinoza was treated for minor injuries at the same hospital and  released.

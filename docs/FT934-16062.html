			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Power company to make 350 redundancies SOUTH Western Electricity, criticised in a report by Which? magazine yesterday as having the most expensive tariffs in England, is to make 350 people redundant as part of a cost-cutting programme. The losses, to be made 'at all levels' next year, represent 10 per cent of the company's staff in its core electricity business and follow a similar percentage cut over the past two years. The privatised utility has 1.2m business and domestic customers in Avon, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. Mr Derek Lickorish, customer service and marketing manager, said yesterday that Sweb was responding to the electricity supply review by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. He added that the cost-cutting was 'part of an ongoing commitment to contribute to price stability. We want to maintain Sweb's competitiveness'. He added: 'We hope to achieve the job losses through natural wastage, redeployment and voluntary redundancy.' Other measures will include internal restructuring, retraining and a consolidation of office locations. Other regional electricity companies have been shedding jobs to improve efficiency. Several thousand jobs have been lost in the past year alone and, with the companies under pressure from Prof Littlechild to contain costs, many more redundancies are expected. Southern Electric has already announced that 1,000 jobs will go over the next three years. Which? said that Sweb was the equal worst of the regional electricity companies at keeping appointments and worst at connecting new customers quickly. But it said the company had won a government charter mark for improvements in service. Mr Lickorish defended Sweb's service record. He said: 'We do not believe we have poor standards but that does not mean we are complacent.' Mr John Seed, chief executive, said Sweb had responded effectively to the changing demands on it. In June, Sweb reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 101.1m, up 22 per cent on the previous year. Yesterday its share price closed at 578p, up 7p.</p>

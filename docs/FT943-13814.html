			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Arts: The decline and fall of elegance - Dress standards at the Royal Opera House reflect a national malaise In February 1946, after six years wartime service as a dance-hall, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, once again had ballet in residence. On that opening night, our national ballet won its laurels with The Sleeping Beauty. As an occasion it seemed a public recognition that peace was truly back in London, despite the bombed buildings, the unrelieved greyness of austerity. The gloss and brightness of Beauty's design told us that whatever else had changed - and here was our own ballet rather than some Ballet Russe troupe - our greatest theatre was alive again. The first night, redolent of such hopes, was also redolent of moth-balls. The audience had dug out long dresses, dinner-jackets and tails, from wartime hibernation. It was a show of faith and social manners that the war might have eroded, but which still survived. 'Going to the Opera House' was once more an occasion. A half-century has changed many things, and not least that attitude towards Covent Garden. Is it wrong to expect some effort to dress up to an Opera House visit rather than down? In recent months I have been astonished at the dimness and sometimes dinginess of the way people outfit themselves for what must be an expensive night out at opera or ballet. No one today expects dinner-jackets and long dresses, except for important galas. But should not men make some attempt at neatness? Are a rumpled top and sagging slacks (the 'Sitting Up All Night in a Train' Look) the best a woman can contrive? I record with some disbelief that latterly I have seen men in shirt-sleeves, grubby jeans, trainers; women in tee-shirts, those fearsome leggings which expose far too much thunderous haunch on all but the slimmest, and boots that would not disgrace a despatch-rider. And a faux-fur poncho. Grunge may be a style for the very young - and anything the young wear at opera or ballet is right, because the important thing is that they should be there - and Vivienne Westwood may make Hallowe'en outfits and call them fashion, but going to our grandest theatre should imply some idea of dressing for an event. Of course people come on from offices and work-place. Of course they are there to see and not be seen. Yet is there not a reciprocal exchange between stage and audience, where the public expects artists to do of their best, and performers are entitled to believe that we treat their activities with a respect which includes, perish the thought, the courtesy of neat attire? There is, implicit in all this, something about Covent Garden as it is today. In other opera houses, there seems a perceptible audience response to the look and ethos of the building itself. The public has a special identity  -in behaviour and appearance - at the Palais Garnier or the Opera Bastille, at the Mariinsky, or the Met and the State Theatre in New York, or in big German houses. Opulent or smart-but-relaxed, grand or a bit bourgeois-stuffy, they match their surroundings. As they always have, if historical record is anything to go by. Covent Garden offers little guidance to manners today. The fault is not entirely of the theatre's making, but is owed to national policies that believe that great music, great dance, must be paid for through the nose by the consumer, and that a state owes no duty to its members to make such art available, approachable, affordable. Hence the ever-present sense nowadays at Covent Garden that every penny must be squeezed from the audience. Hence the profusion of bars - the foyer now more like a pub than the entrance to an opera house - and the omnipresent tables for the cold snack brigade. Is there another nation in the world that eats and drinks so relentlessly as the British as an adjunct to watching opera and ballet? There are even people picnicking on the main stairs, spreading glasses and paper plates around them. Munch, munch, munch] Sip, sip, sip] Pay, pay, pay] This is the policy of a theatre which, in trying to be 'approachable' - witness the egregiously vulgar Opera House magazine that is its latest PR exercise - has become more like that hell-hole, Terminal 1 at Heathrow, than a great opera house in a capital city. Small wonder, then, that some of the audience dress for Heathrow rather than Covent Garden. It is time, as the proposed Covent Garden closure looms and thoughts of the National Lottery give arts administrators Golconda dreams, for the Royal Opera House to rid itself of its dowdy air, and its cafeteria ideals. Its public might well respond in kind.</p>

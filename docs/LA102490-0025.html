			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELEASE THE KEATING REPORT NOW  </P> <P> Six weeks after its completion, the report by the Senate Ethics Committee's  special counsel on the part played by the "Keating Five" in the savings and  loan scandal remains hidden from public scrutiny.  </P> <P> The report is said to recommend dropping charges of improper conduct against  John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Arizona's John McCain, the only Republican among the  five senators who reaped a total of $1.3 million in political contributions  after helping Charles H. Keating Jr. hold off federal regulators. That  intervention helped prolong the survival of Keating's shaky Lincoln Savings  &amp; Loan. One result was to balloon the cost that must now be paid to bail  out Lincoln's depositors.  </P> <P> This week McCain and Glenn demanded the immediate release of special committee  counsel Robert S. Bennett's report, a 354-page compilation of evidence and  recommendations, believing it will help restore their political reputations.  That's understandable. But there is a much larger issue involved in the  committee's delay in releasing the report. That is the public's right to know,  in timely fashion, what its elected representatives may have been up to,  including most specifically whether some of them violated Senate rules and  certain federal regulations.  </P> <P> McCain and other Republicans charge that the Bennett report is being held back  for partisan reasons until after next month's congressional elections, because  it proposes further investigations of Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of  California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan.  Whatever the validity of that claim, the Ethics Committee has now voted to hold  public hearings on senatorial involvement with Keating beginning Nov. 15, more  than a week after the elections. That is something less than  confidence-inspiring.  </P> <P> The savings and loan debacle dwarfs every previous financial scandal in the  nation's history. New estimates are that ultimately it could cost taxpayers up  to $1 trillion. How did the Keating Five, or the Keating Three, contribute to  this mess? The Ethics Committee has some clues, maybe even some answers. The  public has a right to that information, now and in full.  </P></p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Eritreans vote for independence Jubilant Eritreans flocked to vote yesterday in a referendum certain to deliver independence from Ethiopia - the fruit of victory in Africa's longest civil war, Reuter reports from Asmara. Hundreds of people queued patiently at polling stations for the chance to secure the prize of 30 years' bitter fighting. Eritrea, a former Italian colony federated with Ethiopia by the United Nations in 1952, has effectively been governed as a separate state since May 1991 when Ethiopia's marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam was overthrown.</p>

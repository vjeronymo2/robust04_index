			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: FT-Actuaries Fixed Interest Indices The FT-Actuaries Fixed Interest Indices Committee has decided to cease the calculation and publication of the Debenture and Unsecured Loan Stock Index from December 31 1994. The main reason for this decision is that changes in the structure of the market have reduced the number of liquid stocks with an adequate range of maturity dates. The committee feels as a result that the integrity of the Debenture and Unsecured Loan Stock Index can no longer be guaranteed. Investors in debenture and unsecured loan stocks will find a variety of indices of this sector of the market calculated by leading market makers.</p>

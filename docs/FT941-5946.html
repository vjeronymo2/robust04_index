			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Broadcasters escape quota action European broadcasters who have failed to meet quotas for European films and programmes will escape legal action for the time being, the European Commission said yesterday, writes Lionel Barber from Brussels. The Commission decision follows surveys by the 12 member states, which show that more television channels are devoting more than 50 per cent of air time to European works. The surveys did not include all satellite and cable programming. The 1989 'Television without Frontiers' directive requires 51 per cent of material shown on television to be of European origin, and 10 per cent to be set aside for independent European producers - much to the fury of foreign producers, particularly in Hollywood. A Green Paper on the audio-visual sector is to be published this month, but the surveys showed there was anyway a growing preference for European programmes. In France, which has led the campaign against alleged US cultural domination, showed all five state-owned channels as meeting the quotas. In the UK, 19 out of 42 channels transmitted a majority content of European works.</p>

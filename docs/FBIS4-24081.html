			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattibuted editorial] </F>   [Text] The issue of three ANC cabinet ministers in  KwaZulu/Natal refusing to attend meetings of the provincial  Legislative Assembly held in Ulundi gives the impression that  the ANC is not really committed to peace and reconciliation.    We say this because much has already been said by the ANC in  the short space of time that the issue has come up. Most  unfortunately its spokesmen are in the habit of using a sharp  tongue to tackle delicate issues. We do not know if this is  deliberate, or if it is the result of the hotheadedness of youth.    It is not constructive now, and will never be, to speak of  Ulundi in a manner that even a child can see is not just debate  on an issue of interest, but that is rather aimed at stirring up  the cauldron of hate and stubbornly barricading all avenues to  peace and reconciliation.    It is most unfortunate that this is taking place in  KwaZulu/Natal, a province that lags so far behind others in  development and needs a new provincial government dedicated  above all to redressing the situation. The ANC must learn that,  as the Zulu saying goes, "Don't spit into the wind". We know  how hard it is for the ANC to swallow all those terrible things  it said about Ulundi before the election, and that is why it is  fighting so hard to ensure that Ulundi does not become the  provincial capital.    We admonish the ANC not to be one-sided in such issues. We  also urge it to accept the fact of its defeat in the provincial  elections, because we believe that its problems stem from its  attempts to mentally block out this one fact. It must realize  that the contribution needed in our region is not its ability to  hurl abuse, slander, and disparaging remarks whenever it does  not get its way, but that the spirit of peace and reconciliation  be nurtured.</p>

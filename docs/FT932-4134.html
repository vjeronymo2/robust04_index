			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices fell away from earlier highs in late trading on the LME, but still ended steady, as did most other metals. Three-month metal made an abortive attempt to break above Dollars 1,850 a tonne, aided by option-linked buying. Selling emerged above Dollars 1,840, however, and by the close the market was back at Dollars 1,834, unchanged from Tuesday. ALUMINIUM also eased in late trading, pressurised by continued profit taking and resistance above Dollars 1,180 a tonne for three-month metal. But given recent investment fund and speculative buying, the market remained on course for Dollars 1,200, dealers said. London's robusta COFFEE closed with small gains. The market is caught between underlying buying interest from roasters and overhead origin selling, particularly from Brazil and Indonesia. London COCOA closed with marginal losses. Business was dominated by active rolling forward of positions out of the near July contract into September. Dealers said there was some talk that the business might have been fund-related. Talks at the ICCO continued to be monitored. The key issue remains the eventual dispose of the buffer stock. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has compiled a tentative set of rules on copyrights  pertaining to software for multimedia use to help promote the  growth of the multimedia business which is considered to be the  most promising field in information-related industries in the  future. The ministry's proposal includes a plan to set up a new  "digital information center" where video and audio information  will be centralized, and their copyrights managed. It also  provides for database users to freely copy and edit accessed  data whose authors have registered their copyrights with the  information center, simply by paying a compensatory fee. MITI  plans to shortly urge the Agency for Cultural Affairs to make  revisions to the Copyright Act. So far, producers of multimedia  software have had to get approval separately from several  authors to use their data. This has been very time consuming.  Should MITI's plan materialize as envisioned, the groundwork  would be completed toward promoting the multimedia business.    Multimedia techniques allow free editing of audio and video  data by computer. For example, it is possible to create a piece  of work that has a different appearance or capabilities compared  to the original by changing the colors of a visual image or  pasting a different image. However, the concept of multimedia  has yet to be clearly defined. There may be broader  applications depending on future technological advances.    However, audio and visual data which serve as the raw  materials in the production of multimedia software are protected  by copyrights. Before multimedia software producers can use  such data, they must get approval from the respective copyright  holders. Particularly since multimedia software is  characteristically produced by combining a wide variety of  copyrighted data, it is necessary for users to locate all the  copyright holders and negotiate with them on royalties.  Therefore, it has been very time and money consuming.    According to MITI's proposed set of rules, authors can  voluntarily register their copyrights with the digital  information center, and prospective users can go to the center  where they will have access to a complete list of available  copyrighted data along with their respective royalty fees.  These fees paid by users will be collected by the information  center which will in turn reimburse the copyright holders. In  this way, users will be relieved of having to search for  individual copyright holders.    MITI's plan also calls for revision of the current Copyright  Act regarding a provision which prohibits editing an item in a  manner not in line with its author's beliefs. Specifically, the  plan calls for permitting free editing of data as long as such  editing does not discredit its author who can file a suit with  the court to forbid objectionable acts only when he judges that  he has been discredited.    Other major industrialized nations are also faced with  difficulties regarding the handling of copyrights on  multimedia-related items. An idea which is very similar to  MITI's plan to set up a centralized body to handle such  copyrights has surfaced in the United States.    However, it is still uncertain whether MITI's plan will  simply be accepted as it is by the Agency for Cultural Affairs  and its Copyright Council, which are reviewing whether it would  be necessary to revise the Copyright Act.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commission may try to raise ceiling on EC revenues FARM and regional spending will gobble up most of a likely modest increase in EC revenue over the next five years. The Commission has not yet finalised its 1993-97 finance package, due to be unveiled to the European parliament on February 12. But already it seems plain that an increase of about two thirds planned for regional development, and rises in farm spending which cannot yet be fixed because of uncertainty over reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), will absorb at least 60 per cent of the increase. This leaves little over to finance the bigger foreign aid obligations the EC expects to assume towards eastern Europe and North Africa, and the desire of the Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, to set up a fund for restructuring, retraining, and research in the car, defence, electronics and textiles industries. Officials expect the Commission to try to raise EC revenue to 1.35 per cent of Community gross national product by 1997, from its ceiling of 1.2 per cent now. This year's budget of Ecu66bn (Pounds 47bn) is below the current ceiling, at 1.14 per cent of GNP, so that the 1997 budget would be Ecu86bn at current prices, assuming annual EC growth of 2.5 per cent. Several officials now believe a bigger increase would be resisted by the current net contributors to the EC budget: Germany (by far the largest), the UK and France. Germany, moreover, 'is not going to commit itself until it knows what's happening on farm spending,' a senior Commission official said. He added that 'if we stay within 1.35 (per cent), there will be limits; we will have to choose among our options'. Regional spending looks set to rise from Ecu17.7bn this year to Ecu29bn in 1997, at 1992 prices. This would include a new 'cohesion fund' worth up to Ecu2.5bn to help Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece meet EC environmental standards and put in cross-border transport links. The Commission's original costing of its CAP reform plans would raise farm spending from Ecu35.3bn this year to Ecu38.6bn in 1997. Both figures look optimistic. But reform would initially cost even more, with spending reaching close to Ecu40bn in 1996, and it is unlikely that it can be financed without bigger allocations. Spending on what would become a separate budget category for foreign policy would get priority, but still remain modest, rising from less than Ecu3bn to just over Ecu5bn at current prices. The Commission has not agreed on Mr Delors' so far undocumented plan to regroup spending on research and unemployment into a fund to raise competitiveness in the face of industrial restructuring in the 1990s. The two core ideas are: that research spending should be brought closer to the market, able to respond to innovation in industry; and that the part of Social Fund spending on long-term unemployment which is not tied to regions could be used to intervene to prevent job losses through retraining in the four targeted industries. Mr Delors appears to be testing the water before making a formal proposal. However, the tight arithmetic suggests any new fund would not get more than about Ecu 5bn in 1997. EC governments yesterday received the final version of the Maastricht treaty on European union for signature next week, after vain Dutch and Irish attempts to alter aspects of the controversial social policy protocol agreed by Britain's 11 partners, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Negotiated at last month's Maastricht summit, the 'treaty on union' is likely to be signed on February 7 in Maastricht at a meeting of foreign and finance ministers. The past month, spent in cleaning up the text for signature, has produced a treaty whose substance is virtually identical to that agreed by EC leaders on December 11.</p>

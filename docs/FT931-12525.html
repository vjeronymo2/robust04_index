			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / GEC cut in redundancy terms is ruled unlawful A UNILATERAL change to employees' redundancy terms at a GEC plant was unlawful, the High Court sitting in Birmingham ruled yesterday. Lawyers representing unions involved believe this case alone will cost the company Pounds 5m and have wide-ranging implications at other GEC plants and at other companies. The case directly affects the Beeston plant of GPT in Nottingham, 60 per cent owned by GEC and 40 per cent by Siemens. As part of a cost-cutting exercise in 1991 GEC reduced the redundancy terms which then prevailed at many plants to near the statutory minimum of one week's pay for each year of service. The effect of yesterday's ruling by Mr Justice Connell is that GEC has to reinstate the original redundancy terms at Beeston of four weeks pay for every year of service for the 1,800 employees. It will also almost certainly have to make up the difference between the original and the new terms for 800 employees made redundant after the terms were changed. The company said last night that it was still considering the judgment and had not decided whether to appeal. The unions at Beeston, led by the TGWU and GMB general unions and the MSF white-collar union, said the judgment would cost the company at least Pounds 5m at Beeston alone. Legal costs of the case, which the company was ordered to pay, come to more than Pounds 1m. The main legal point clarified yesterday was that redundancy terms enshrined in a collective agreement were deemed to be part of an individual contract of employment. Mr Phil King, a partner in solicitors Robin Thompson &amp; Partners who represented the unions, said: 'This judgment could have far-reaching implications and by making redundancy more expensive for companies could save a large number of jobs'.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Slowly sliding out the welcome mat / Review of responses to the US election result THE American people have spoken. What do British fund managers have to say about it? In spite of his two-year tenure in Oxford, Bill Clinton is unlikely to have the interests of the UK's savers high in his list of priorities. But many managers believe his arrival could usher in strong performance for UK investors in US markets. Much of this has to do with the dollar. In the last two months, the dollar has appreciated against sterling by roughly 25 per cent - meaning that fund managers who failed to make their fund grow at all in dollar terms can still show their British investors a healthy profit. Although the dollar has risen sharply, there are still two fundamental reasons to expect continued US currency strength. Economists expect purchasing power parity to be an important determinant of exchange rates. On this basis, the pound still seems to be too strong against the dollar at current rates, giving room for dollar appreciation. Then there is the 'interest rate differential'. If interest rates in one country rise while those in other countries stay constant, then, all other things being equal, the country's currency will strengthen. With US base rates currently thought to be at their lowest point, and cuts in European base rates likely next year, the dollar should appreciate. Confidence in the US should also improve now that political uncertainty has been resolved. One implication of a continued strong dollar could be a boost for the investment trust sector. Peter Walls, investment trust analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing, points out that as most investment trusts are heavy dollar earners, the sector tends to out-perform during periods of dollar strength. The trend over the last 10 years is marked with peaks of investment trust outperformance almost exactly correlating with peaks for the dollar - so there could be an opportunity here for British investors. Another reason for optimism about the US is that many believe the economy turned the corner under President Bush. Chris Jenkins, manager of the Hill Samuel US Smaller Companies unit trust, pointed to the recovery in economic growth and low inflation and said: 'It's ironic that Bush has lost just as we are getting a turn.' The drastic restructuring of many American companies has already fed through into higher productivity, which analysts believe will mean good corporate profits next year. That should be good for equity prices. But many fund managers still think that Clinton in the White House will make a real and positive change. Susan Wood, manager of Mercury's American unit trust, put it this way: 'What we think is so optimistic about Clinton is that it's the first time in many years you have got a co-operative Congress. His policies will be pro-growth and we are greatly enthusiastic about the plans for infrastructure and capital spending.' She also pointed out that Clinton will try to restore the politico-economic cycle, so that the economy reaches a peak in 1996 when the next presidential election is due. He should therefore be able to resist any temptation to go for a quick 'rush for growth' this year. Other managers are less optimistic, although none are as negative as might be expected when a Democrat comes to power. Martin Brooke, manager of Cannon North American is nervous but says: 'I hope Clinton isn't going to do us too much damage. I suspect there will good opportunities in the US market regardless.' Which sectors could benefit the most? Many managers are positive about infrastructure and capital goods, both of which should benefit directly from Clinton. Vice-president-elect Albert Gore's enthusiasm for environmental issues has created great interest in 'green' stocks. John Haynes, manager of the Fleming North American IT, said: 'The environmental stocks should be boosted by Clinton's victory. They've had a tough time for the last few years, as the Bush administration has been very unco-operative.' Other fund managers are less confident about the timing. James Findlay, of Foreign &amp; Colonial, thinks that the pre-poll 'bounce' in environmental share prices may have been overdone. He said: 'We are playing more of a wait and see game and concentrating on companies where the fundamentals are already good.' Sectors likely to do badly include oil stocks, although Brooke points out that poor crude prices may already be depressing the sector. Defence stocks are also likely to be hit by Clinton's plan to benefit further from the 'peace dividend'. The Clinton approach to the health issue could damage many drugs companies - Wood names it as the most obvious sector to do badly under the new administration. But the fast-growing health services sector, which provides administration for hospitals, could be even more in demand as new reforms are introduced. Fund managers may be optimistic about the prospects for US shares, but private investors should remember that equity investment is for the long term. You should only invest if you can afford to maintain your holding at least until President Clinton faces re-election in 1996.</p>

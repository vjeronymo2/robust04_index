			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO BEACH SUPER BOWL 10K;  </P> <P> MEXICO'S CRUZ SHOWS OFF TALENT IN FINISHING FIRST AMONG 14,000  </P> <P> It was a run in the sun for most everybody else, but for winner Alejandro Cruz  of Mexico, Sunday's Redondo Beach Super Bowl 10K was another race to showcase  his developing skills.  </P> <P> Cruz, unknown internationally until he won last fall's Chicago Marathon in 2  hours 8 minutes 57 seconds, ran a canny race Sunday in sunny and cool  conditions.  </P> <P> Cruz led almost from the start, running just ahead of Steve Cram of England,  the world-record holder in the mile, and Thom Hunt of San Diego.  </P> <P> Hunt and Cruz left the pack at about 3 miles and left Cram to battle Matt  Ebiner of West Covina for third place.  </P> <P> In the hilly second half of the course, Cruz, 20, wore down Hunt with a series  of surges. In the last mile, Cruz attacked the final hill and pulled away from  Hunt for good.  </P> <P> Cruz, seventh in the 1988 Los Angeles Marathon, is a university student in  Mexico City who trains at Boulder, Colo.  </P> <P> Cruz' winning time was 29:20, Hunt was second in 29:23, Ebiner was third in  29:42 and Cram, who almost lost a shoe early in the race, was fourth in 29:51.  </P> <P> "I had to stop and tie my laces at 2 miles," Cram said. "That was it. End of  race. You can't catch up against these guys. It's a basic error. That's the  first thing you learn. It's the first time in my career this has happened. But  I had fun. I like these kind of races."  </P> <P> It was nothing more than a training run for Cram, and something of an exercise  in anonymity. The three-time Olympian went largely unrecognized at the race,  which was the 11th annual bash for 14,000 entrants.  </P> <P> Sylvia Mosqueda of East L.A. was the women's winner in 32:48.  </P> <P> The real stars of this race, though, are the wacky runners who run dressed in  all manner of garb. There was the predictable: Young men wearing football  uniforms, complete with helmets and pads. The football players carried -- and  passed -- a football the entire 6.2 miles.  </P> <P> There were the odd: Five men inside a cardboard bus (mounted on their  shoulders), wearing wigs and singing the theme song to TV's "Partridge Family."  Singing badly.  </P> <P> There were the irreverent: At least two groups lampooning Florence Griffith  Joyner, the fashionable winner of three gold medals at the Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> A group of women in the 6-pack division wore long black wigs, taped-on  4-inch-long fingernails, false eyelashes and, of course, Joyner's trademark  one-legger -- in this incarnation, the women wore a flesh-colored tight on one  leg and a lacy white tight on the other.  </P> <P> There was also Slo-Jo. A middle-aged woman wearing a flannel shirt with one  sleeve cut off. She ran wearing a sign that read, "No speed. No fingernails. No  chance."  </P></p>

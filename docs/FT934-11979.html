			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Precious metals moved up again in steady business with the London GOLD price recovering Tuesday's Dollars 4.50 fall to move back above the Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce level. The move, which followed the expiry of options positions, was helped by a higher than expected 0.7 per cent rise in US September durable goods orders. Silver also bounced, closing at Dollars 4.46 1/2 an ounce, up 10 cents. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices recovered from early eight-year lows. Dealers noted, however, that though the market was reasonably well supported on dips, buyers were reluctant to chase the market higher, suggesting that a move down to the Dollars 1,050-a-tonne target for the three months delivery contract could not be far away. The three months price closed yesterday Dollars 1,073.50 a tonne, down Dollars 1.25. COPPER prices also flirted with recent six-year lows, although news that the OK Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea was unable to ship concentrates deterred serious selling interest. By the close the three months position had recovered to Dollars 1,622.50 a tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Canadian bank loan rates rise CANADIAN banks will raise their prime lending rates today for the first time in two years, Bernard Simon reports from Toronto. Shortly after the Bank of Canada lifted its bank rate yesterday for the fifth consecutive week, the banks announced they were raising prime rates from 7.5 per cent to 8.25 per cent. The upward move reflects the Bank of Canada's efforts to slow a fall in the Canadian dollar which has slid from a peak of 89.30 US cents last November to below 84 cents earlier this week. Mr Donald Mazankowski, finance minister, said yesterday that the rise in interest rates should not be seen as a long-term trend. The government is anxious to lower interest rates to help pull the economy out of recession.</p>

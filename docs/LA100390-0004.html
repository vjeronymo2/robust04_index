			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG RATE HIKE FOR ASSIGNED-RISK CAR INSURANCE  </P> <P> In response to "Assigned-Risk Rates to Rise Average of 85%," Sept. 20:  </P> <P> Now that my auto insurance is being raised from $575 to $1,000 per year (I have  assigned-risk insurance because my car is old, 1965 model), I suppose I should  jump for joy for getting a discount from the insurance companies when they get  both feet in the door with good old no-fault. No way.  </P> <P> I'm going to give myself a 100% discount; no more insurance until the state  gives me affordable insurance. I would like to see the state add an insurance  fee ($200) to the license fee on every vehicle.  </P> <P> This probably will never happen because it would be asking our politicians to  put their hands back in their own pockets.  </P> <P> JEROME HOLBROOK  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

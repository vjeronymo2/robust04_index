			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "The Postelection Riddle: </F> Three Hypotheses Advanced"]    [Text] Rome -- Assuming that an opinion poll was required  to confirm that it will not be easy to form a government after  the elections, here are the results.    In fact, the American press agency KNIGHT-RIDDLER FINANCIAL  has asked Italians -- via the CIRM [Italian Center for Market  Research] -- to express their opinion. Now then, 20 percent of  the interviewees did not even believe that it would be possible  to form a new government without holding new elections. A more  substantial proportion (36 percent of the interviewees) believed  that it would be necessary to wait for at least three months to  know the name of the new tenant at Palazzo Chigi [government  seat]. The majority of the voters' sample (somewhat over 50  percent) is predicting that an understanding will have to be  reached among forces belonging to more than one coalition in  order to give birth to the Second Republic's new government.    Today, the simple truth is that none of the three alignments  expects to win a majority of the seats in parliament.  "Reserved" surveys show that the progressives are in the  ascendant, that the center is doing better than expected, that,  conversely, Forza Italia's momentum is diminishing within the  right-wing coalition, and that, in the north, [League Secretary  Umberto] Bossi's war on [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi  will lead to considerable upheavals in the polling booths. A  general settlement is being predicted: The Right and the Left  will be almost even, with the center holding the balance.    This is why the proposal to form an "institutional"  government is gaining momentum as the electoral campaign  develops. This would be a transitional, politically neutral  government, which would only be requested to complete the  electoral reform by introducing a majority system, and then step  down. The "institutional" nature of the Palazzo Chigi team has  already been referred to by Spadolini [Italian Republican Party  (PRI) Senate speaker], and [Mino] Martinazzoli [secretary of the  Italian Popular Party, PPI], and later by [Achille] Occhetto  [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] and  Berlusconi. The last two, however, subsequently qualified their  statements. The PDS secretary explained that he was envisaging,  if need be, a "caretaker" government, but he rejected -- with no  less than four "no's" -- the possibility that men from Botteghe  Oscure [PDS headquarters] might join the same government as  Berlusconi's representatives. Forza Italy retorted by utterly  rejecting what it called "palace agreements or makeshift  arrangements which smack of historical compromise -- a solution  favored by the communist or paracommunist coalition...." A  nondescript government, deprived of any particular color, is  therefore a simultaneously envisaged and rejected prospect.    However, a weighty alternative prospect cannot be ruled out,  namely, that of a government backed by a genuine political  majority. This is a convincing hypothesis, which is being  increasingly mentioned in the various leaders' statements and  speeches. The center, occupying the middle camp, is  particularly open to the prospect of alliances. It is looking  about to make its choice. A temporary agreement with  Martinazzoli would not be unwelcome to Occhetto, although even  yesterday the PDS secretary realized how difficult it was to  steer the progressive ship: As soon as [PDS Deputy Secretary]  D'Alema spoke again of [Prime Minister] Ciampi, [Communist  Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, [Rete leader] Orlando, and the  Greens once again confirmed their opposition. An agreement with  the center would enable the PDS leader to offset the weight of  his alignment's extreme wings, and begin to implement his  strategy, namely, setting up a left-center axis. Of course,  such things are not mentioned in the course of an electoral  campaign and, as a matter of fact, Occhetto is not mentioning  them. However, two days ago he explained that, in any case, his  party will be a "central" force within the next government. Was  he thinking in terms of a government including center-left and  center-right?    This is, in fact, the prospect that the pole of freedoms  fears most. Berlusconi is aware that, all things equal, the  center would prefer Occhetto to him. He knows that his only  chance of conquering Palazzo Chigi lies in obtaining an absolute  majority in parliament or approaching such a majority close  enough to "involve" single elected representatives of the PPI  [Italian Popular Party] and Segni's Pact for Italy in supporting  the government. Above all, he knows that only an overwhelming  majority, bordering on 50 percent of the vote, would enable him  to clip the wings of his loathed ally, Bossi. However, it is  unlikely that any of this will happen.    Bossi is an action man, is imaginative, and is convinced of  one thing at least: The alliance with Forza Italy could be  fatal for the League. The prospect of freeing the bandwagon  [League nickname] from Berlusconi's grip is probably becoming  increasingly attractive to Bossi with every passing day.    Therefore, it is not inappropriate to put forward a third  hypothesis: a government formed around a platform, backed by  Occhetto's -- and Bossi's -- votes: a basic platform, including  the introduction of federalist elements, the completion of the  electoral reform, and the beginning of tax reform; a government  which the League might well be prepared to back, particularly if  led by a personality from the north...</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The files on the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najah  Church and the assassination of Dany Sham'un and his family will  be referred to the Judicial Council shortly. The council will  set a date for the trial of the defendants now that the bills of  indictment in the two cases have been issued.    Meanwhile, Lebanon is seeking the extradition of Ghassan  Tuma, head of the Lebanese Forces' Intelligence Department, from  the United States. Ghassan Tuma is accused of assassinating  Sham'un and therefore is an important link in revealing all the  implications of the case.</p>

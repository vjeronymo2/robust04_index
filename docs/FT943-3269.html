			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / High anxiety for Hurd in Hong Kong: UK foreign secretary flies in as China attacks Jardine group China's attack on the Jardine group has ensured that the visit to Hong Kong by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, which starts today will be conducted in an atmosphere of high anxiety. Beijing's decision to turn up the heat on Hong Kong's British administrators is consistent with the gloomy foreign office assessment of the outlook for Sino-British co-operation on the colony's transfer to China. With less than three years before Hong Kong is handed back to China, British officials have told Mr Hurd they expect another period of hard slog with little progress being made on a growing agenda needed to ensure a smooth transfer of power in 1997. There is also a growing view in the colony that China's latest moves have exposed the contradiction at the heart of British policy towards its last great colonial possession. This policy seeks both an honourable withdrawal from Hong Kong, and a smooth transition to Chinese sovereignty for the colony. Yet, the more Britain pursues honour the more it seems likely that Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule will be a bumpy one. The optimism engendered by an apparent thaw in relations - the high-water mark of which was an agreement on the distribution of military land in June  -has swiftly given way to pessimism in the face of a discernible hardening in Beijing's attitude toward the UK and Hong Kong. Two months ago a comprehensive settlement to two of the most important outstanding commercial issues - the financing of Hong Kong's new airport, and approval for the extension of the colony's container port - seemed within grasp. Today they appear as remote as ever. Beijing has already made it known that it expects little from a meeting between Mr Hurd and Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in New York at the end of the month. The best guess by the British foreign office for the abrupt change in China's position is that Beijing reassessed its position in light of the events of June this year. First there was the Legislative Council's vote at the end of June on Governor Chris Patten's plans to liberalise the colony's 1995 elections. During this vote Beijing attempted to persuade LegCo members to vote against the governor, but failed. Beijing concluded from its defeat that that it should have stayed out of the process. Second, the proximity of the defence lands deal to the vote - it came the morning after LegCo voted for Mr Patten - and the optimism over an early airport agreement allowed the governor to claim his policy of standing tough with China on democracy had worked. With conspicuous foreign policy successes elsewhere Beijing could not allow Mr Patten's claim of victory to stand. Indeed over the past months Britain's isolation from the rest of the world in its policy towards China has deepened. The UK is the only permanent member of the United Nations security council in conflict with China. Over the past six months the US, France and German have all moved to repair relations with Beijing by downplaying human rights and emphasising trade and economic development. British officials say they still remain optimistic that at the end of day China will agree terms on airport finance. They are more concerned about the port because Beijing appears to have made its approval contingent on the ejection of the Jardine group from a consortium extending the facility. One senior British official said it would not improve Hong Kong's position as a place to invest if business people had to look over their shoulder to the political master. What concerns the UK more, however, is China's attitude to the work of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a bilateral commission established by the 1984 Joint Declaration to enable a smooth transfer of sovereignty in 1997. The JLG shows every sign of being moribund. Since 1989 it has transacted only two significant pieces of business - the 1991 agreement on Hong Kong's court of final appeal, and the military lands agreement of this June. Mr Patten warned last October, when opening the 1993/94 session on the LegCo, of a legal vacuum in Hong Kong after the resumption of Chinese sovereignty if the JLG did not get moving on 'localising' Hong Kong's law. Progress has been glacial. There is a raft of air service agreements between Hong Kong and the rest of the world awaiting Beijing's approval. Also awaiting the nod from Beijing is the ratification of many international agreements to which Hong Kong is currently bound because of its link with Britain and which will lapse unless China gives its approval. Optimists among the foreign secretary's advisers point to the continuous ebb and flow of Sino-British relations, of which the current period is just another ebb. They foresee a situation where the two agree the main commercial matters outstanding - the airport, port development, big business franchises which need Beijing blessing - later than would be optimal, but nevertheless in time. JLG matters, such as localising Hong Kong's law, may well be left right up until the last months of British rule.</p>

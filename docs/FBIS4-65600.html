			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["eli/ub." report: "Foreign Ministry for Bundeswehr Mission </F> in Rwanda; Defense Ministry Thinks Situation Is Too Dangerous"]    [Text] Bonn -- Within the FRG Government, a new  controversy over the dispatch of soldiers to a region outside  the NATO area is imminent. The Foreign Ministry and the Defense  Ministry take different views on whether one should comply with  a UN request for the dispatch of German blue helmets to Rwanda.  They would mainly be medical soldiers. Last week, the FRG  Government received a relevant inquiry from Kofi Annan, UN  undersecretary general for blue-helmet issues. While the  Foreign Ministry is advocating participation in humanitarian  actions, the Hardthoehe [Defense Ministry] and the Chancellor's  Office reacted reservedly.    On Tuesday [17 May] evening, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) agreed for the time  being only on the dispatch of an Air Force Transall transport  aircraft to the country shaken by civil war. In this way, they  reacted to a request of the United Nations, which urgently needs  a replacement for a defective Canadian plane. However, before  the dispatch of the Transall, the hazards of the situation are  to be analyzed. So far, the Canadians have flown relief flights  throughout Rwanda as well as to the capital, Kigali.    Apparently, the ministers have not yet discussed in detail  the inquiry from the under secretary general of 12 May. It not  only asks for the dispatch of an Air Force transport unit, but  also for a medical contingent. Apparently, the United Nations  is thinking of participation similar to that in Cambodia, where  the Bundeswehr operated a hospital. Since the mission in  Somalia, the armed forces have also been in possession of a  field hospital. In the inquiry the dispatch of 50 armored  personnel carriers is also requested. Thus, the Bundeswehr  would be able to take care of refugees and to attend to a large  number of injured people. After the positive decision on the  dispatch of the Transall aircraft, it was stated in the  Chancellor's Office that it has to be carefully examined whether  the employment of medics is also possible.    On Monday, the Security Council decided to increase the UN  contingent in Rwanda to 5,500 men. Three African states --  Ghana, Tanzania, and Nigeria -- already want to provide  contingents. The United Nations knows from its experience in  Somalia that only armed forces with a highly sophisticated  technology come into consideration for transportation, supplies,  and medical help. Thus, the African states depend on help.    In the Foreign Ministry, participation in the support for  humanitarian aid is advocated. However, details have not yet  been discussed. Foreign Minister Kinkel talked of the  inconceivable figure of 500,000 murdered people. This is a  tragedy of an unimagined dimension. In its rather positive  attitude, the Foreign Ministry also seems to be guided by the  consideration that the FRG, as a candidate for a permanent seat  on the Security Council, must not shirk from helping.  Apparently, however, there is no intention to make an offer  overeagerly either. A quiet environment is important as the  prerequisite for a mission, it was stated.    Kinkel said that he is personally in favor of helping  Rwanda.  Genocide is taking place there. According to his assessment,  however, "boundless disappointment" is prevailing in the states  that might intervene in Rwanda. The outcome of the mission in  Somalia and the helplessness of Europe and the world in  Yugoslavia are depressing. He is noticing "immense caution"  everywhere.    The Hardthoehe, however, reacted to the inquiry with great  reserve. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed again and again  that he rules out another UN mission before the judgment of the  Constitutional Court on the "out-of-area" missions. Military  circles also point out that the Bundeswehr is overtaxed  regarding materiel and staff. Moreover, German interests cannot  be perceived in a mission in Rwanda, since the military  situation is confused and therefore dangerous. For every  medical soldier, three paratroopers are needed as protection.  Their dispatch results in endless unclarified questions that  already caused great difficulties for the coalition before  Somalia or the AWACS mission over former Yugoslavia. After all,  one does not exactly notice any pressure from the United  Nations. Rather, the excitement is homemade, it was stated.</p>

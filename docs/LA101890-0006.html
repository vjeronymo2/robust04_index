			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RODRIGUEZ ON POLICE BRUTALITY  </P> <P> Obviously, no useful purpose would be served by attempting to contradict  Rodriguez's diatribe against law enforcement. However, I can and will dispute  his facts.  </P> <P> In the third paragraph, Rodriguez states " . . . two off-duty Los Angeles  County deputies and a Maywood officer stormed a Maywood city jail cell and beat  Marino D. Castillo. . . ."  </P> <P> In the first place, the precautionary term "allegedly" might be a wise idea to  insert in this statement. I have noted that this is standard practice for The  Times when talking about murderers and rapists, but apparently not when talking  about police officers.  </P> <P> Secondly, if Rodriguez wishes to attack the police, perhaps he should at least  accuse the correct department. In the original account of the incident,  published in The Times, it was very clearly stated that the two deputy sheriffs  allegedly involved were from the Orange County Sheriff's Department, not Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> As a sergeant (and a sworn deputy) on the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department, I feel that by his statement, Rodriguez has incorrectly and  unfairly besmirched my reputation and that of my colleagues.  </P> <P> SGT. DANIEL L. PATZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department  </P></p>

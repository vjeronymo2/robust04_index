The Plan is a defined benefit plan that has been adopted by four Massachusetts-based nursing facilities which are members of a controlled group of corporations. The Nursing Facilities that sponsor the Plan for the benefit of their employees are Abbott, Winthrop/Bay View, Devereux and Greenview. As of December 31, 1992, the Plan had total net assets of $2,060,920. This amount was allocated among the Nursing Facility sub-Plan accounts as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Nursing facility sub-plan accounts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Net assets  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Abbott  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $471,149  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Winthrop/Bay View  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 385,383  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Greenview  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 872,004  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Devereux  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 332,384 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=1 --> Total  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,060,920 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. As of December 23, 1993, the Plan had two remaining participants, Richard C. Bane and his brother, Robert Bane, both of whom participate in the Abbott sub-Plan account. Richard Bane is the Plan trustee and the decisionmaker with respect to the Plan's investments. Both Richard and Robert Bane are 50 percent shareholders of Abbott and Devereux. Their father, George H. Bane, and Gerald Gouchberg, an outside investor who is not related to members of the Bane Family, each own 50 percent of the outstanding stock of Winthrop/Bay View and Greenview.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Plan is in the process of terminating and upon termination, will be replaced with a deferred compensation plan. On April 12, 1993, the Plan received approval from the Internal Revenue Service to terminate as of December 31, 1992 and it made cash distributions to 126 employees of the Nursing Facilities with the exception of the Banes. To provide partial funding for the participant distributions and to provide liquidity while assets were being sold, the Nursing Facilities made cash advances <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  to the Plan during the second and third quarters of 1993 in the following amounts:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 The applicant represents that the loans were interest-free, unsecured and used for the payment of benefits to participants. As such, the applicant is of the view that such loans are in compliance with Prohibited Transaction Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80&hyph;26 (45 FR 28545, April 29, 1980). However, the Department expresses no opinion herein on whether the cash advances have satisfied the terms and conditions of PTE 80&hyph;26.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Nursing facility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Cash advance  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Winthrop/Bay View  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $27,808  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Greenview  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 31,650  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Devereux  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 41,296 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Total  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100,754 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

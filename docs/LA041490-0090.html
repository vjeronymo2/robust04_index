			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE CLEARS WAY FOR COMPOST HEAP'S REMOVAL  </P> <P> The man who calls himself Zeke the Sheik stood Friday in Pasadena Superior  Court with a 3-foot-tall green onion in his hand and pleaded for time to save  the colossal compost heap that he began in 1973. But Judge Harold E. Shabo  issued a temporary restraining order clearing the way for Mountain View  Cemetery to dispose of the 30-foot heap, which sits on a vacant parcel of its  land adjacent to Zeke's home in Altadena.  </P> <P> "This is my creation, my work of art . . . and they're going to wipe me out,"  Zeke, the alter ego of 47-year-old Timothy Dundon, said outside court.  </P> <P> Although the cemetery years ago gave Dundon permission to pile the steamy mass  on its property, the county Department of Health Services says the hill is an  illegal dump and that work to remove it must begin by Monday.  </P> <P> Dundon vowed to have himself nailed to a giant cross atop the mound when the  bulldozers come.  </P></p>

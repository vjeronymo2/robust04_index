			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Jimmy Stewart hasn't acted in about 5 years, but the 81-year-old actor says  he's ready for another movie, if the right script comes along. "Can't play  cowboys anymore," he adds, however. After he came back from the Army in 1941,  he returned to Hollywood fearful of his future, with his contract expired and  wondering if the public would still remember him. "That's why I thank  (director) Frank Capra in prayers every day," he said. " 'Cause he just, out of  the blue, called me up and said, 'I got an idea for a story, and why don't you  come down to the house?"' The result was "It's a Wonderful Life" which was not  successful when it came out but has since become a much-loved Christmastime  perennial. "Looking back over it, I can just see that the picture meant more to  me than any other," Stewart said. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

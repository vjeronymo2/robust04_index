Croatian mortars shelled  Serb villages in the Novigrad hinterland, the R.S.K. army said  in a statement and added that small arms fire had been reported  in the areas of Vrlika and Drnis in the south of the R.S.K., and  in the regions of Lika and western Slavonia. Late last year,  the R.S.K. and Croatia had agreed to observe a ceasefire during  Christmas. The agreement was first extended on January 13, and  again on Sunday. The latest extension was mediated by U.N.  peace-keepers.    The R.S.K. was proclaimed by Serbs in late 1991 within their  ethnic and historic boundaries in parts of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Croatia, in response to Croatia's violent secession  from the former Yugoslav Federation and attempt to downgrade the  Serbs to an ethnic minority. The R.S.K. was placed under U.N.  protection in March of 1992, but this has not prevented Croatia  from attacking it three times since in an attempt to impose its  rule there by force.</p>

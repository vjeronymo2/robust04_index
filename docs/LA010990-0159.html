			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> EAGLES REUNION 'INCONCEIVABLE'  </P> <P> The Eagles, the band that defined the hugely popular "California sound" in the  '70s, isn't planning a reunion despite a report Monday in the Hollywood  Reporter. A source close to several ex-Eagles branded as "inconceivable" a  full-scale reunion by the group which broke up amid considerable bitterness in  1982.  </P> <P> The source suggested speculation about a reuniting may have been triggered by  former Eagles leaders Glenn Frey and Don Henley appearing on stage together  last fall during two Henley concerts in Southern California and by Henley's  subsequent comments that the two may occasionally write songs together again.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Reporter said in its report that the singer-songwriters will  regroup this spring to record an album and, later, a concert tour.  </P> <P> Joe Walsh, Don Felder and Timothy B. Schmit were in the band when the Eagles  broke up in 1981.  </P> <P> Henley, 42, was touring in Japan on Monday in support of his Geffen Records  "The End of Innocence" album. Frey, 41, records for MCA Records.  </P></p>

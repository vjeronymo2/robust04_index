			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Clinton may increase corporation taxes PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's economic package may embrace an increase in corporation taxes and some reductions in government employment, but will almost certainly not include any freeze in the indexation of social security pensions. Seeking to regain the initiative after the controversy surrounding the withdrawal of Judge Kimba Wood as a prospective attorney general, assorted administration officials dropped hints about the composition of the president's new programme, to be unveiled in next week's state of the union message and in his first budget, due for March 23. Mr George Stephanopoulos, White House communications director, said yesterday it was 'very unlikely' that Mr Clinton would freeze pension cost-of-living adjustments. 'That is something he has never wanted to do,' he added, blaming unsubstantiated 'leaks' for implying that this was under consideration. He said increasing income taxes on pensions on wealthier older Americans, another widely canvassed alternative to raise revenue and thus reduce the budget deficit, was 'possible', if it could be made fair. Mr Clinton was also going to call for an extension of long-term unemployment benfits during a meeting yesterday with his economic advisers, Mr Stephanopolous said. Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, also said yesterday that an increase in the corporation tax - now 34 per cent - was under review. She placed this in the context of the need to raise tax rates on both individuals and corporations 'whose incomes went up the most and whose taxes went down' during the 1980s. She added that the administration was also looking into raising the federal minimum wage - currently Dollars 4.25 an hour - but stressed that no decisions had been made. Ms Myers also echoed comments made over the weekend by Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, that substantial cuts might be made in the White House staff, partly to encourage other departments and Congress similarly to reduce their payrolls. Mr Reich had predicted that the White House staff cuts would be 'dramatic', as much as 20-25 per cent. Already some lower-level bureaucrats in the executive offices, handling routine matters like mail sorting, have been given redundancy notices. The thrust of all the comments was on the need to reduce the federal deficit by eliminating waste. However, over the weekend, Mr Reich, Vice-President Al Gore and Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, all spoke of the equivalent imperative to create more jobs in the economy.</p>

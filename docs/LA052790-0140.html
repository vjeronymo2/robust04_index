			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A DISTRICT ATTORNEY WORTHY OF THE TITLE;  </P> <P> OF THE 4 PROSECUTORS ON BALLOT, INCUMBENT CAPIZZI MOST DESERVES VOTERS' SUPPORT  </P> <P> In these days of mounting concern over crime, the designation of "district  attorney" after a candidate's name on the ballot is likely to be considered  pure political gold.  </P> <P> When residents go to the polls June 5 and look at their ballot for Orange  County district attorney, they will find four candidates, all carrying that  rich designation of "district attorney" in some form after their name.  </P> <P> There may be some confusion about what each title actually means, but there  should be no confusion over which candidate to elect. We urge voters to retain  Mike Capizzi as Orange County's district attorney.  </P> <P> Capizzi, designated as "Appointed Orange County District Attorney" on the  ballot, was named to the post by the County Board of Supervisors last Jan. 2.  He was appointed to replace former Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks, who accepted a seat  on the county's Superior Court bench. He is completing Hicks' unexpired term  that ends in January.  </P> <P> Capizzi was Hicks' chief assistant and had his support for the top post. Now,  in his effort to win his own four-year term, Capizzi has strong support from  many areas of the community, including most police chiefs, major law  enforcement organizations, elected officials, labor unions and the association  of deputies in the district attorney's office. His challenge, however, is  coming from three other people in his office, which explains all those  designations on the ballot.  </P> <P> Although the district attorney's office has not been as aggressive as we'd like  in handling last year's still-pending poll guard case involving the election of  Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), it still carries a tough reputation  for dealing with political shenanigans. It earned that renown in the 1970s when  it prosecuted more than 40 Orange County political figures, including three  county supervisors and a congressman.  </P> <P> Capizzi was instrumental in those successful indictments. He has proven himself  as a prosecutor. But the large, urban district attorney's office has many able  prosecutors. What it also needs is an able administrator. With his 26 years of  standout service in the office, ranging from a starting deputy to second in  command, Capizzi has proven himself to be that too.  </P> <P> Of the four prosecutors on the ballot, Mike Capizzi is the most qualified. He  is the right person in the right place at the right time. He was appointed to  the job in January. On June 5, voters should elect him district attorney.  </P></p>

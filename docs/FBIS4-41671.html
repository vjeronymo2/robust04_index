			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- First Vice-Premier of the  Russian Government Oleg Soskovets and commander-in-chief of  NATO's joint armed forces in Europe, George Joulwan, currently  on a visit to Russia in the framework of cooperation between  Russia and NATO, came out for the expansion of cooperation  between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance.    During their meeting today, the first Russian vice-premier  said the "world community pins its hopes on Russia, the United  States and NATO for the maintenance of world peace." Soskovets  pointed out that the participation of Russian peace-keeping  forces in Yugoslavia and Georgia shows that "Russia is making  considerable efforts for promoting peace." Besides, Russia is  responsible for the protection of borders in Tajikistan,  prevention of conflicts in the Caucasus and keeping the  situation on Moldova under control, Soskovets added.    He drew attention to the fact that Russia, in fact, has been  carrying out complex and unilateral conversion practically  without any assistance by foreign partners. He pointed out that  "the policy of conversion would be continued in accordance with  Russia's military doctrine."    For his part, the NATO commander said that after the sides  had signed the partnership for peace programme, possibilities  opened for developing closer contacts. Joulwan said that the  Partnership for Peace is "a road with two-way traffic." It is  not only Russia that can learn something from NATO, but NATO can  take over much of Russia's experience, Joulwan said. "The time  has come to work out concrete documents determining the degree  of Russia's participation in NATO's programmes," the NATO  official said.</p>

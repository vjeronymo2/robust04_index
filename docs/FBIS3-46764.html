Ramos said that the  government's priorities will be enhancing the delivery of  services to the public, advancing the peace process, and  modernization. Ramos added that the service of government  officials will be gauged according to their actions, their  ability to solve problems, and the implementation of new  programs. Overall, he will give priority to five programs this  year.    [Begin Ramos recording in progress, in English] ...further  moves against criminality. Five major commitments government  will undertake in 1994:    First, we will protect the gains achieved in the peace  process so that we can finally put an end to internal armed  conflict. As a parallel effort, we will intensify the campaign  to uphold the rule of law so that we can reduce to the minimum  criminality and corruption, with those in the officialdom, the  scalawags in uniform, and row officials as priority targets. We  will maintain industrial peace and take better care of our  overseas contract workers.    Second, we will institute greater discipline in the  management of our fiscal resources through better coordination  of policies, programs, and projects. We will focus on the  thorough and timely implementation of flagship programs and  projects: Streamlining of government operations, enhanced  private sector participation by way of various BOT  [build-operate-transfer] schemes, and privatization of  government projects and facilities, as well as further  improvements in the tax effort. We will encourage more private  investments by continuing the structural reforms we have started  and by making our exports and other industries more globally  competitive.    Third, we will provide vital infrastructure support from  government in order to mobilize private sector participation.  In this way, we will be able to seize more government resources  towards the provision of basic services and direct intervention  in the reduction of poverty.    Fourth, we will continue to implement our environmental  enhancement, conservation, and protection programs to ensure  that our development will be sustainable for the benefit of our  future generations. This will encompass our land, sea, and air  environment, as well as our bio-diverse ecology.    Fifth, we will continue to make the bureaucracy more  responsive, more transparent, and more service-oriented. Aside  from streamlining our operations, we will upgrade morale and  welfare programs for public servants to increase their  productivity and efficiency. [end recording]</p>

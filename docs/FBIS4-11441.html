			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Georgina Solis] </F>   [Text] Mexico City -- Yesterday, the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] National Political Council decided that the  selection of its candidates for senator, federal deputy, and  assembly member will be made through open conventions with  democratically elected delegates. The procedure will also be  employed to select candidates for governor in the states of  Chiapas and Tabasco, based on the agreement that was unanimously  approved by the 201 council members who attended the 15th  plenary session.    PRI sources indicated the statutory procedure of direct  consultation with rank-and-file members was ruled out, because  the party could be splintered when it reaches the 21 August  elections. They added that requesting the nominations of  candidates, a statutory procedure, will be announced some time  between today (Monday) and tomorrow, and that conventions will  be held statewide next week.    In internal meetings, the PRI's regional and territorial  structure will elect the delegates to the conventions. The  council also agreed that if a convention cannot be held, the  State Political Council or the Federal District Political  Council will choose the candidates. It also agreed that the  state board or Federal District board will seek consensus and  conciliation regarding those people who may be the most faithful  representative of the PRI's ideology and run with the greatest  possibility of winning.    During the 15th plenary session of the PRI's top body, the  delegates approved a report read by PRI National President  Fernando Ortiz Arana in which he said the party will never stop  demanding justice and the clarification of the murder of its  presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. "In view of the  outrage inflicted upon us, today, we are reiterating our demand  that the investigations into the incident that brought mourning  to Mexico fully explain motives and establish responsibilities,"  Ortiz said.    Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza attended this meeting as PRI  secretary general and announced the procedures and conditions  for choosing the candidates for governor, senator, and deputy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chou Jung (0719 2837): "Jiang Zemin Organizes Leading </F> Body for Next Century; Top Leadership Fixes Orientation To  Guarantee Stability"]    [Text] Jiang Zemin Stresses Need To Maintain  Stability and Not To Lower Guard    At the National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese People's  Political Consustative Conference [CPPCC] sessions in Beijing,  obvious hot topics were such questions as the readjustment and  distribution of interests (including investment projects,  development rates, preferential policies, and the ratio between  profits and taxes), the anticorruption drive, the public order  situation, and commodity prices. These are major questions  which have a direct bearing on the success or failure of reform  and on whether or not the overall situation is stable. CPC  General Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed that maintaining a stable  situation across the country is a big question which is bound up  with whether or not the party and the leadership survive and  that we must not lower our guard in this regard.  <H5>  Local Party and Government Officials Hold Radical Views </H5>   One of the main characteristics of the above sessions was  that CPPCC delegates, who had previously held radical views,  mostly supported the CPC's reform proposals. Although they  might not have agreed with the timing or the methods as to how  the reform proposals are to be implemented, they could not put  forward better counterproposals. This was not the case with NPC  deputies from all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions, however. Local party and government officials,  especially, held very radical views.    The CPC top leadership is worried that once the investment  front becomes too long and development is too speedy, China may  once again revert to price raises and inflation which will, in  turn, introduce new instability factors into society. This was  the real focus of concern for officials and the general public  and is also crucial to the success or failure of this year's  reform. The policy decisions were accepted by the overwhelming  majority of NPC deputies and CPPCC delegates. In view of this,  political reform will continue to be postponed, and  maintaining a stable overall situation takes precedence, and has  become a common consensus.    Judging from the current construction plan and the situation  of reform and opening, the CPC is most concerned about  guaranteeing the overall stability of agriculture, commodity  prices, and society.  <H5>  Planning To Form a Leading Group Straddling the Next Century </H5>   As regular meetings of the NPC and CPPCC, the sessions,  given  no outstanding big issues, made comparatively few personnel  changes. Two vice chairmen, Wan Guoquan and Zhu Guangya and a  new secretary general Zhu Xun, were added at the CPPCC session.  Wan is the leader of a democratic party, Zhu is an authority in  science and technology circles, and Zhu Xun is the minister of  geology and mineral resources. The personnel changes appear to  give a clear picture of the pattern. On the other hand, the NPC  Standing Committee elected two members, Zeng Xianzi and Nie Li,  in a by-election and the CPPCC Standing Committee elected Zhang  Yongzhen from Hong Kong in a by-election so that their  compositions are more representative. These were all normal  personnel arrangements.    The top CPC leadership attaches great importance to the  stability of the leading groups of the party, the government,  and the armed forces. At the last NPC session, Jiang Zemin  stressed that the central leading groups are united and  harmonious and so can cope with foreign interference and various  kinds of tests at home. Judging from the trends and signs,  after functioning and working for more than four years, the CPC  leadership, with Jiang Zemin at the core, has already  established a firm position in China. What they are now mainly  planning is to supplement and form a group of young people to  straddle the next century.    Many experts maintain that the 9 percent economic growth and  the 10 percent price increases in Li Peng's Government Work  Report are comparatively appropriate indexes of development and  stability. Economist Liu Guoguang said: For three consecutive  years, China has grown at a rate of 10 percent or more and this  is unprecedented in the world. We should not only see whether  or not China can endure it this year but also consider the  economic efficiency next year and the year after next.  This year's macroregulation and control should control  economic growth slightly so that what should be controlled is  controlled and what should have controls relaxed has them  relaxed appropriately.    Not long ago, Deng Xiaoping said: "China is already a  political power. It will also become an economic power in the  future." The CPC expects to maintain healthy and sustained  growth rates through a careful and mature layout of economic  reform and construction, to succeed in building new market  economic mechanisms and join the ranks of world economic powers.  <H5>  It Is Vital To Guarantee the Stability of Agriculture </H5>   Without grain, there is no stability. This is a saying by  CPC elders, and above all Deng Xiaoping, who have always used it  to remind the leading group.    Since the series of reform plans were introduced earlier  in the year, all localities have vied with each other to  initiate development projects which "require less input, yield  greater economic results, and promise quick returns." This,  coupled with the continually increasing cost of agriculture,  results in farmland being laid waste. The continuously mounting  pressure of "migrant workers" coming into the cities has led, in  some places, to the panic purchase of grain, edible oils, and  foodstuffs and also to prices being driven up. This has highly  alarmed the top CPC leadership. No sooner had the NPC  session finished than the CPC called the Central Work Conference  on Agriculture. There, Jiang Zemin stressed the need to  consolidate the fundamental role of agriculture and guarantee  the steady development of agriculture and the entire rural  economy.  <H5>  Zhu Rongji's Worries </H5>   In order to support agricultural production, the State  Council initiated reform of the grain purchase and marketing  system, whereby the purchasing and sales prices of grain and  edible oils were increased and all provinces, municipalities,  and autonomous regions canceled city and town supply rations and  opened up the grain and edible oils markets. Zhu Rongji said:  Here there is a rational factor, that is, grain prices must be  increased because they are so low that peasants do not find it  pays to grow grain crops. However, he also admitted that it is  both pleasing and worrying to increase grain prices. What is  pleasing is that peasants will have their incomes increased and  what is worrying is that the grain prices in some places are  driven up artificially so that there is the worry that the price  increases do not really go into the hands of the peasants but to  the intermediary links or to those who change hands. Zhu Rongji  said: It is necessary to continue to stick to the orientation  of reform and continue to proceed with the reform of the  purchasing and marketing systems. There is no turning back and  we are unable to turn back. He maintained that it is necessary  to resolve the current problems. He also said that the rise in  grain prices will push up other prices and will lead to panic  among the residents which will, in turn, affect the process of  reform and therefore must be seriously dealt with. The reform  aim is to promote a steady growth in grain production, promote a  brisk and stable market, and protect the interests of peasants.  If the existing salient problems are not properly resolved, it  will be difficult to achieve the goal of grain reform. For this  reason, it is necessary to strengthen macroregulation and  control, establish a grain storage system and a risk fund, and  stick to the protective- price purchasing system.  <H5>  CPC Plans for Future Agricultural Development </H5>   It is learned that the main goals set by the CPC for  agricultural development in the 1990's are: To develop the  rural economy in a comprehensive way, stabilize the output  increases of major farm products, and meet the needs of  achieving comparatively comfortable living standards for the  people throughout the country and of the national economy in  terms of quantity, variety, and quality.    For this reason, China will continue to stabilize contract  responsibility systems, chiefly the contract responsibility  system on a household basis with renumeration linked to output;  perfect the system of unified management combined with  independent management; vigorously develop the collectivized  agricultural services; and gradually enhance the collective  economic strength. It will continuously consolidate the  agricultural foundation, increase agricultural inputs, improve  basic agricultural facilities, and ensure that agriculture is  further upgraded to meet the needs of the development of the  national economy. It will deepen rural reform and strengthen  the development of such basic facilities as the rural markets,  communications, transportation, storage, information, and  consultancy services as well as the development of various  socialized service systems. It will strengthen the promotion of  agricultural scientific research and technology; continue to  arrange for comprehensive agricultural development and  utilization of standby resources; optimize the rural industrial  and economic structures; vigorously develop  foreign-exchange-earning agriculture; integrate crop growing,  livestock breeding, and processing and combine trade, industry,  and agriculture; develop new industries and new fields of  employment in rural areas; and enhance comprehensive productive  capability. It will encourage peasants to increase incomes and  achieve a comparatively comfortable life.  <H5>  The Success or Failure of Reforms in China Today Depends on </H5> Commodity Prices    Commodity prices are a very sensitive nerve in the market  and  society. In the first two months of this year, commodity price  indexes across the country had a startling rise of almost 20  percent. Both Li Peng and Zhu Rongji criticized raising  the prices of such foodstuffs as milk before the opening of the  Beijing Municipal People's Congress session. Zhu Rongji  said: Many large and medium cities around the world grant some  public subsidies in order to stabilize social life. We must  never pass the burden on to the public or concentrate their  money on expanding the infrastructural scale. Guangdong's  economy has been developing speedily in recent years but its  farmland has been seriously laid waste. Some cadres claim they  have money to buy grain even if it is much more expensive, so  they raise grain prices and engage in panic purchases  everywhere, affecting the normal market economy. Zhu  Rongji criticized Guangdong for shirking its responsibilities to  others now that it has so big a population and so much good  farmland. He stressed that stabilizing commodity prices is  vital to the success or failure of reforms.    Zhu Rongji Criticizes Guangdong [as published]    In view of this, the State Council published a special  document appealing for measures to limit commodity prices and an  inspection team, headed by State Planning Commission Minister  Chen Jinhua and two vice ministers, visited various localities  around the country to inquire into the question of commodity  prices. In response to the repeated appeals from various  localities to quicken development, during the NPC session, the  top CPC leadership gave explanations to various deputations and  repeatedly stressed that they had to be realistic, acting in  keeping with their capabilities, and that they should curb the  trend of being enthusiastic about initiating new projects  without considering their conditions. For this reason, they  have to strengthen and improve macroregulation and control and  prevent the recurrence of inflation. Key CPC figures stressed  that macroregulation and control should control economic growth  slightly in light of the actual situation so that what should be  controlled is controlled and what should have its controls  relaxed have them relaxed appropriately.    This is a crucial year for reform say the CPC authorities.  China not only needs to establish market economic mechanisms  but also needs to link the home market with the international  market gradually and strive to rejoin GATT as soon as possible.  Therefore, all reforms, such as the reform of finance, tariffs,  banking, foreign trade, commodity prices, investment, tax  revenue, business administration, and the enterprise systems  embody these two objectives.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin Guard Against U.S. Strategy of </H5> "Westernization and Division"    At the NPC session in March, most of the NPC deputies and  CPPCC delegates from all provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions supported the various reform proposals. On  his visit to Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  did not get what he had anticipated. Deng Xiaoping and Jiang  Zemin will not give way in guarding against the U.S. strategy of  "Westernization and division." On the question of restoring  China's GATT membership, U.S. representative Dorros Dewerszhin  [duo luo xi de wo er si jin 1122 5700 6007 1795 3087 1422 2448  6855] declined to give China a definite date when it can rejoin  GATT although representatives of Japan, the European Union,  Canada, Uruguay, and the Scandinavian countries all hoped that  China, the most populated country in the world, be allowed to  rejoin GATT. At the session, Gu Yongjiang, Chinese  representative and vice minister at the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] deeply regretted that  the question of rejoining GATT remained unresolved, despite  talks for the past seven years. On 18 April, MOFTEC Minister Wu  Yi headed a large delegation for a new round of relevant talks  in the United States. It is now impossible to predict what the  future results will be but, recently, Clinton and some U.S.  Congressmen and prominent political figures have repeatedly  given speeches stressing the need to focus on long-term  U.S.-Chinese relations. Many people favor separating human  rights, economic relations, and most-favored-nation status. Out  of consideration for Sino-U.S. bilateral interests and  development, most observers are still optimistic about the  prospect of the development of relations between China and the  United States, the two big powers.    However, it is very difficult to judge whether or not it is  good for China to rejoin GATT. Mainland China's reform is at a  stage where key problems are being tackled and many economic  relations have yet to be straightened out. Many experts  conclude the fact that if China hastily rejoins GATT this will  have serious consequences and will obviously increase by more  than one-third the losses in its state-owned enterprises. They  hold that the influx of large quantities of foreign products and  their impact will even lead to the bankruptcy of a considerable  number of enterprises, to an increase in the number unemployed,  and to a considerable increase in the instability factors in  society. Therefore, they argue that it is much more conducive  for China to rejoin GATT at a later date. Other experts maintain  that China's rejoining GATT presents a great opportunity to  change itself into a market economy and that the advantages  outweigh the disadvantages. One thing we can be certain of is  that the prospect of rejoining GATT, as the CPC announced  earlier, has not been decided to date.  <H5>  Protracted War Against Corruption </H5>   The problem of power corruption is worrying the key CPC  figures. Jiang Zemin criticized it saying: Corruption has  developed to the point whereby people will not do anything  unless they are given money or presents. Some county-level  cities cannot even pay wages to their staff and teachers while  their party and government departments have money to purchase  deluxe sedans. We must not underestimate the seriousness and  harm of the problem and must adopt resolute measures to resolve  it. We must handle corruption cases strictly in accordance with  the law, thoroughly investigate violations of discipline and  law, dismiss those who should be dismissed, sentence those who  should be sentenced, and sternly punish those who should be  sternly punished. Those who seriously interfere with or  obstruct the investigation of cases should be resolutely  punished. In this year's anticorruption work, we should  concentrate our energies on investigating and dealing with big  and serious cases; resolutely emphasize the investigation of  lawbreaking cases by party and government leading organs,  leading cadres, and judicial departments, administrative and  law-enforcement departments, economic administration  departments, and their work personnel; make it a point to  investigate and deal with the bribery and corruption cases  featuring leading cadres and the malpractices of judicial and  administrative personnel, such as practicing favoritism,  perverting justice for bribes, harboring lawbreakers, as well as  crimes crimes committed by legal persons.    Obstacles to the Anti-Corruption Drive    Since the CPC put forward the five rules regarding how  cadres  should keep their hands clean and exercise self-discipline,  cadres at all levels have launched self-investigations and have  obtained some practical results. However, the top CPC  leadership maintains that the anticorruption work is not  proceeding in a balanced way and that many problems exist in it.  In the self-investigations, some cadres have dealt with  insignificant and overt matters rather than big and covert ones.  They have not even talked about the obvious problems before  them or dealt with the many problems already discovered.  Influenced by the "idea that corruption is inevitable," some  leading cadres argue that "economic development should take the  lead and adherence to the four cardinal principles should give  way" because it will "be smooth sailing to do only one type of  work and attach importance to it" and it will be "difficult at  both ends to do two types of work and attach simultaneous  importance to them." Moreover, they argue that one "is liable to  make an error if one braves it out" and that one "should be  allowed to pay tuition fees [jiao xue fei 0074 1331 6316]." The  cadres in some localities and departments fear they will  register a loss if they do too much anticorruption work while  others are worried that continuing the anticorruption work will  affect reform and opening up and economic development. Being  unclear themselves, some officials fear they will get into  trouble if they continue the work. It has become very popular  that they do not report corruption, do not handle corruption  cases, or do not strictly enforce the law. It still prevails  that their words speak louder than the law and their power  outweighs the law.  <H5>  Resist the "Tendency To Beg For Leniency" and Break the </H5> "Network of Connections" and "Protective Layer"    The top CPC leadership maintains that, as the economy is  growing and reform is deepening, some new circumstances and  contradictions will appear in the readjustment of interests of  all parties and in the change of concepts. People will take  advantage of the loopholes afforded by the unsound legal system  and supervisory mechanisms and continue with their corrupt  practices, seeking private gain by violating the law and  discipline. Therefore, it is necessary to continue with the  anticorruption work in a thorough, protracted, and more  effective way and to concentrate energies on the investigation  and handling of big and serious cases. It is necessary to  resist the "tendency to beg for leniency" and break the "network  of connections" and the "protective layer," and further  consolidate the coordination of the discipline inspection  supervisory organs and the supervisory organs for judicial,  personnel, administrative, and law-enforcement organs, enhancing  their overall capability in dealing with corruption cases.    In order to match the need of thoroughly pursuing reform  this  year, it is necessary to promptly remove those corrupt elements  who symbolize state power and who are in the legal machinery.  Only by doing this can political power and social stability be  consolidated. The top CPC leadership emphasizes that this year's  anticorruption work will begin with three areas: First,  disclose, investigate, and deal with such malpractices as not  carrying out decrees, resorting to uncurbed malpractices, having  one's own way, and seriously violating the law and breaking  discipline in the course of implementing the measures for the  reform of the tax, banking, foreign trade, investment, and  planning systems and for enterprise reform. Second, disclose,  investigate, and deal with such malpractices as fraud, deceiving  the higher authorities and hiding facts from the lower  authorities, and interfering with reform and development.  Third, seriously investigate cases of dereliction of duty and  serious bureaucracy which have resulted in great losses or  deaths and casualties, foster a clean and hard-working  government, and promote the establishment and improvement of the  regulations and systems for the new structure.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Markets: Protectionist standards - Economic Eye The ink was not even dry on the agreement closing the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations before the Clinton administration came forward with a new agenda, one that is entirely its own. At the top of the list, alongside trade and the environment, come labour standards. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's redoubtable trade minister, promptly responded that the linkage of trade with labour standards 'would, in effect, provide a convenient cover for trade protectionism'. Mr Robert Reich, US secretary of labour, has justified US demands in an article in the Washington Post, in which he argues that 'some labour practices simply place countries outside the community of civilised nations. A consensus list of 'core' labour standards will certainly proscribe goods produced by prison or slave labour and by very young children'. To this is added the right to form trades unions and bargain collectively. Action against countries that violate such standards is, he insists, justified on humanitarian grounds. Is it? Slavery is a red herring in this debate. Prison labour sounds equally dreadful, but what of the argument that prisoners need to learn useful skills and help support their families? What better way can there be than for them to produce goods for export? Provided wages and conditions are in line with those in the market, this seems better than for inmates to rot in useless idleness. Should the small children of a destitute Bangladeshi widow be forced to beg or starve, rather than work? Parents want what is best for their children. But if the children of the poor are to be educated, resources must be found to support them and their parents. So one test of US sincerity is the scale of its aid effort. At one fifth of 1 per cent of gross national product, it is, in fact, the worst among all industrial countries, except for little Ireland. This leaves by far the most significant 'right', that to bargain collectively. Stripped of its progressive gloss, however, collective bargaining is merely cartelisation of the labour market. Why is this a fundamental right, to be placed alongside free speech, the vote, or habeas corpus? Mr Reich accuses critics of the sin of 'laissez-faire dogmatism'. On the contrary, they base themselves on experience. The chart shows the astounding rise of real wages in the export-oriented economies of east Asia. Does this perhaps reflect the ability of trades unions to push up wages, thereby producing what Mr Reich desires, 'the emergence of middle-class economies'? The answer is no. As the World Bank says in the study from which the chart is drawn, 'Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, China, suppressed independent unions. Malaysia has independent unions but highly restrictive labour laws. Hong Kong and Japan do not intervene in labour relations. However, in Japan most unions are company based'. Mr Reich talks of the expectation that labour standards should improve as economies develop. So they did, not because of unions, but because of rapid growth, full employment and specialisation on the basis of comparative advantage. In the early stage of development, when massive migration of workers from the countryside to modern industry is required, strong trade unions virtually ensure, instead, the emergence of narrow labour aristocracies. Which country did better in raising labour standards in the 1970s, Korea, which repressed trade unions, but had export-oriented industrial growth at 15 per cent a year, or India, where a highly unionised, but stunted, advanced industrial sector grew at only 4.5 per cent. Mr Reich does more than call for basic rights. He suggests, as a further test of a country's probity, that 'low-wage workers should become better off, not worse off, as trade and investment boost national income'. This is a peculiarly ill-judged suggestion, since the US is one of the few countries to fail this test over the past two decades. Indeed, by continental European standards it falls short on many criteria of how an advanced economy should treat workers. This demonstrates how intellectually fragile labour standards are, not that the US should sink in the European quagmire. If the supposed rights are debatable, action against alleged abuses will be more questionable still. Most of these abuses will, after all, occur in areas that have little to do with trade. Action might be taken against Sri Lanka, but we know it will not be taken against China. Furthermore, before action there must be international agreement on the content of labour standards. Otherwise, it would just be bullying. Is there anyone so naive as to suppose this issue has come to the fore because of concern for the poor? It is, instead, a response to the adjustments imposed by the rapid growth of developing country exports, itself among the most effective ways to reduce destitution. If people doubt that this is the origin of the demand for imposition of minimum labour standards, they need only know that it is being pushed jointly by the US, where real wages have stagnated for two decades, and France, most outspokenly protectionist of major industrial countries. It is a demand that lacks justification, will not be honestly enforced and would not significantly improve the lot of developing country workers if it were to be. Under the pretence of helping the poor, the industrial countries propose either to undermine their competitiveness or impose protection against their exports. From the point of view of developing countries, this appears, inevitably and rightly, to be pure hypocrisy.</p>

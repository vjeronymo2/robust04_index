			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Banks to investigate Euro Disney finances Euro Disney's bank lenders plan to commission a special investigative audit of the troubled leisure group's finances to prepare for negotiations leading to an emergency financial restructuring. Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, presented its assessment of the company's finances this month to the 60 international banks within the lending syndicate. The banks now want to appoint their own team of investigative auditors. 'It's not that we have any doubts about the accuracy of Disney's figures,' said one senior banker in the syndicate. 'But the condition of Euro Disney has changed so dramatically since we first negotiated our loans (in the late 1980s) that we need to have our own numbers.' The team is expected to be named in Paris this week. The banks hope the audit will be completed before Christmas so they can start intensive discussions early next year with Euro Disney and its US parent. Euro Disney desperately needs to restructure its finances. It has been badly affected by the European recession and recently announced a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 606m) for the year to September 3. There are fears that the group could face a cash crisis early next year, but Walt Disney has agreed to support it financially until March 31. The Disney camp hopes to persuade the banks to exchange roughly half their FFr20.3bn net debt for equity, as part of the restructuring package which could also involve a rights issue. The final composition of the package, however, will be influenced by the value of Euro Disney's shares, which has fallen steeply in recent weeks. The price recovered yesterday from FFr30.90 to finish at FFr31.75. The banks, which include Credit Agricole, Dresdner Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank of Tokyo and Midland Bank, are now close to forming a single steering committee to co-ordinate negotiations with the Disney camp. At present the banks are divided into two main groups. One syndicate, led by Banque Nationale de Paris, represents the 39 institutions that helped to finance the construction of the EuroDisneyland theme park. The second syndicate, with Banque Indosuez at its head, includes the 30 banks that provided capital for Euro Disney hotels. Some banks, notably Citibank and Deutsche Bank, are members of both groups. But the banks are believed to have agreed in principle to create a single steering committee, to be led by either BNP or Indosuez.</p>

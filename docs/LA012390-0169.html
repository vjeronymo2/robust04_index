			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SNOOPY CREATOR SCHULZ RECEIVES FRENCH HONOR  </P> <P> Cartoonist Charles Schulz drew lofty praise from the keepers of French culture  today as they lavishly celebrated the 40th birthday of America's favorite  floppy-eared dog, the irrepressible Snoopy.  </P> <P> The beagle was glorified with a giant retrospective at the Decorative Arts  Museum.  </P> <P> French Culture Minister Jack Lang named Schulz a "commander of arts and  letters," one of France's highest awards for excellence in the arts.  </P> <P> "Thank you for being the creator of Snoopy, full of humor and with a zest for  life," Lang told Schulz. "Your character is both mythical and hedonistic and he  has taken over our collective consciousness and become a part of our everyday  lives."  </P> <P> Schulz, 67, beaming but appearing slightly embarrassed by all the fuss, said  that when Snoopy was a World War I flying ace, he asked him how he learned to  speak French.  </P> <P> "He said he had a small tourist phrase book but he told me you only really need  to know one word, and that is merci," Schulz said in English.  </P> <P> The show opens to the public Wednesday and runs through April 22.  </P></p>

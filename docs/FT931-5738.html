			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone shares hit by unexpected charges SHARES IN Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods group, continued to slide yesterday as the company issued a profits warning and revealed unexpected rationalisation costs for its European operations. After a volatile week in which rumours about a possible bid and a profits downgrading from house brokers BZW forced the shares down from 272p, they closed yesterday 18p lower at 149p. The market appeared to ignore Hartstone's forecast of an increased dividend, which accompanied the details of the European rationalisation. In a statement yesterday, the group said it expected exceptional charges of Pounds 8.5m - a substantial part of which related to cost-cutting in France and Spain - in the year to March 31. Before this week, the market had factored in costs of just Pounds 2m relating to reorganisation in the UK. Hartstone also said profits for the year would be 'less satisfactory than was expected at the time of the interims', due to a sharp downturn in European hosiery markets over the last three months. Gearing was also expected to be not less than the 80 per cent reported in November, partly due to the costs and exchange rate movements. Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, said the company had intended to announce the exceptional costs on Monday, after it had informed staff. The reorganisation will entail the loss of 855 jobs, leaving roughly 2,700 employees. Referring to the share price decline he said: 'There are lots of companies coming out with reorganisations and people respond positively because they are actively managing their business. That is all we are trying to do.' Hartstone, which is often cited as an acquisitive company, had not made a purchase in 15 months, he added. Analysts said, however, that the decline reflected the market's dissatisfaction at being presented with a set of costs which it had not expected.</p>

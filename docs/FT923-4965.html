			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: NZSE market value rises 66% THE MARKET capitalisation of companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange jumped 66 per cent to NZDollars 28.89bn (Dollars 16.1bn) in the year to June 30, the highest level since the 1987 stock market crash, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. In his annual report, Mr David Wale, the stock exchange chairman, said the rise was fuelled by price movements, new listings and capital raisings worth NZDollars 4.88bn, compared with NZDollars 1.75bn in 1990-91. Mr Wale added that declining interest rates, a lower New Zealand dollar and an improved domestic environment renewed interest in equities, especially in smaller companies. Larger groups, however, had been affected by their international involvements. Listings fell by 10 per cent to 140 - compared with 280 in 1987 - and the listed overseas companies dropped by 22 per cent to 58. Two more companies were delisted yesterday: Bridgecorp, a former mining company that unsuccessfully tried to run a chain of toy shops, and General Properties, placed in receivership last month after being run by a group of banks to whom it owes NZDollars 11m.</p>

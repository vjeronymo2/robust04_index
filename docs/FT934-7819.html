			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pittards to close clothing division - Exit from fashion business will cost Pounds 6.5m and lose 300 jobs PITTARDS, the leather company, yesterday accepted defeat in its four-year battle to stay in the fashion business with the announcement that it had decided to close its clothing division at a cost of Pounds 6.5m and 300 jobs. The decision will leave Pittards with losses estimated at about Pounds 7m for the 1993 year and has cast doubt on the dividend payment. Pittards said it was unlikely to return to 'a normal level of distribution' in light of the announcement. Pittards, along with its main rival Strong &amp; Fisher, has been struggling to recover from the effects of extremely volatile sheepskin prices in the late 1980s. Strong &amp; Fisher survived only after a rescue cash injection from Hillsdown Holdings, thefood group. Mr John Buckley, finance director, said the costs of closing the Abingdon factory, together with property write-downs and advance corporation tax write-offs, would result in an Pounds 8.5m reduction in the group's net assets to Pounds 22.1m. This would have forced Pittards to breach several of its banking covenants. However, these had been waived after negotiations with the group's bankers. Pittards has debt of Pounds 17.4m, leaving gearing at about 80 per cent. The redundancy programme would push gearing up to 90 per cent by the end of the year. Its banking facilities are up for renegotiation in March. Pittards first entered the fashion business in 1986 with the acquisition of Garner Booth. The closure leaves Pittards with its original businesses of chamois leather, gloving leather and shoe and other leathergoods. Mr Buckley said he was optimistic that Pittards would return a profit next year. The clothing division, which has returned losses for each of the last four years, is estimated to have incurred a deficit of about Pounds 1.5m for the 10 months of this year. Analysts are forecasting a return to profits of about Pounds 2m in 1994.</p>

			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (15): Pioneer for the private sector - Profile: IF&amp;LS PRIVATISATION has not made much headway in India. The government's only major initiative has been to sell an average 8 per cent stake in 30 public sector companies. The government has said as well that it is prepared to sell up to 49 per cent of the shares of public sector enterprises - thus giving the private sector a minority stake but not ceding management control. An institution that is, however, playing a pioneering role in familiarising India with the concept of the private sector financing traditionally public sector projects - roads, bridges, mass transit - is Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IF&amp;LS). A Bombay-based institution set up to attract private capital to projects that central or state governments do not have the funds to finance themselves, it has enough schemes under its belt to demonstrate that this is a field with immense potential. It has arranged the financing and construction of a link road in Indore in Madhya Pradesh between two industrial areas that will pay for itself from toll charges. It is bringing Nippon Kore, a Japanese engineering design company, to do a detailed feasibility study for a bridge and traffic system in Bombay that will equally be self-financing from toll charges. And it is negotiating for the financing and construction of an urban rail link between Hyderabad and its satellite town of Secunderabad in the south. Mr Ravi Parthasarathy, managing director, believes that a sea change has occurred over the last two years in India's acceptance of the concepts of privatisation and of private financing for infrastructure projects. Equally unthinkable two years ago would have been the contracting of a Japanese company to do engineering design for Bombay. But Mr Parthasarathy says that India does not have experience of designing the traffic system needed to accompany the proposed bridge from Worli to Sea Rock. The bridge will much shorten the journey from the airport to the city centre. Established in 1988, IF&amp;LS is an independent institution whose main shareholders are nationalised banks. But the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an affiliate of the World Bank, holds 15 per cent of the shares. It gets most of its earnings from its investment banking, leasing and securities trading business. IF&amp;LS took what Mr Parthasarathy calls a 'buffetting' when its former chairman, Mr M. J. Pherwani, resigned as chairman in the wake of the financial scandal. He had also been chairman of the National Housing Bank which is heavily involved with Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker, in securities trading. IF&amp;LS suffered no losses and was given a 'clean sheet' by the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank). But with the upheaval among heads of financial institutions, it has still to find a chairman. The board has, however, given the go-ahead for a substantial expansion by approving a Rs1bn capital increase intended to give IF&amp;LS the strength needed to raise funds from the multilateral institutions. Much of IF&amp;LS's pioneering work has been to get the central and state governments to pass legislation making possible the private financing of public sector projects. The proposed light transport link for Hyderabad cannot be built without an amendment to the India Railways Act which gives the state a monopoly over railway construction. IFLS hopes that the Hyderabad project will be the forerunner of other privately financed mass transit projects in major cities. The most high-profile project in which it is involved is the construction of a fourth bridge in Delhi across the Yamuna. The project envisages an eight-lane bridge with an integrated system of flyovers and inter-changes to link the industrial estate of Noida with Maharani Bagh in New Delhi. International contractors will be asked to bid. The operators will be allowed flexibility in setting the toll charges themselves.</p>

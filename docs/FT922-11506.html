			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: American Express dips on poor core business AMERICAN Express, the financial services group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent dip in comparable first-quarter net income as a drop in profits from its core charge card business outweighed improved performances from most other subsidiaries. Net income was Dollars 249m, or 51 cents a share, compared to Dollars 264m, or 55 cents, in the same period last year, broadly in line with expectations. However, the adoption of a new accounting standard for income tax boosted the latest income figure to Dollars 465m, or 95 cents a share. The group's core travel related services division, which includes charge card operations and travellers' cheques, saw income drop 23 per cent, from Dollars 162m to Dollars 125m on slightly higher revenues. American Express said the results were helped by lower interest rates and a smaller provision for charge card credit losses. However, these factors were offset by the cost of increased marketing and promotion. The company's cards are involved in a severe battle with Visa and MasterCard credit cards. American Express said it had scaled back marketing activities in early 1991 but increased them in the second half of last year. The number of cards in force dipped from 36.7m a year ago to 36.1m, but business billed rose from Dollars 25.4bn to Dollars 27.7bn. The group's Shearson Lehman Brothers securities arm produced net income of Dollars 71m (Dollars 140m after the accounting change), compared to Dollars 51m a year ago, on revenues 16 per cent higher at Dollars 1.6bn. The IDS financial services unit saw income rise 19 per cent to Dollars 61m, helped by an increase in management fees and net investment income. American Express Bank saw profits fall from Dollars 31m to Dollars 18m, but the First Data Corporation reported an 18 per cent increase in income to Dollars 30m.</p>

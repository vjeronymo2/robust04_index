			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Asylum bill curb imposed by Lords THE government's controversial Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill was dented yesterday as the House of Lords insisted that the streamlining of the asylum system should include a new safeguard for child refugees, Alison Smith writes. Led by Lord Brightman, a former law lord, a cross-party alliance of peers rejected ministerial advice and voted for the setting up of a special panel to advise young and unaccompanied refugees on a range of matters. Lord Brightman said there should be special reception and support arrangements for vulnerable children arriving alone in Britain. But Lord Ferrers, Home Office minister, argued that local authorities were best placed to look after the welfare of children. The scale of the government defeat - by 169 votes to 114 - will make it difficult for ministers to reverse the setback. Earl Ferrers also categorically denied reports that ministers planned to privatise the immigration service. Replying to Liberal Democrat Lord Bonham-Carter, who asked him about rumours that it would in future be run by a security firm, he said the home secretary had never believed this work was suitable for the market outside.</p>

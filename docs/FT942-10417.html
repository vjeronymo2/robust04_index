			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Germans in beef ban row A row between German ministries could delay any decision today on unilateral action to ban British beef imports because of popular German fears about human infection with 'mad cow disease'. The German health ministry insisted yesterday that it was pressing its case for an import ban on public health grounds, but other officials suggested the issue might be postponed pending further negotiations in Brussels. The foreign ministry, economics ministry and agriculture ministry have all expressed doubts over the practicability of introducing a unilateral ban on British beef imports, and over its political and legal consequences. One senior diplomat said the only way of stopping British beef imports - which total no more than 2,500 tonnes a year  -would be 'to close the Channel.' The German farmers' union has also argued that it would be impossible to control. A health ministry official said yesterday that veterinary experts from the 16 federal states had agreed unanimously that the ban - on all cattle over three years old - could be enforced.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar acquires designer for Pounds 17.4m LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics group, has made its second acquisition this year with the Pounds 17.4m purchase of CMB Carton Systems, a designer of packaging equipment. Low &amp; Bonar raised Pounds 50.2m through a rights issue in March for the Pounds 33m acquisition of Cereal Packaging. It will use the balance for the latest purchase, which will make it the UK's second largest maker of high quality folding cartons. Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said the purchase of CMB Carton 'bridged a strategic gap'. He said the expanded company would be able to offer equipment design services to existing clients and would benefit from enlarged purchasing power. CMB Cartons, based in Speke and Swindon, made operating profits of Pounds 2.2m last year on sales of Pounds 28m. At completion it had net assets of Pounds 7.5m, with no debt. The company was acquired from French warehousing group CGP, which in turn bought the company in 1991 from CarnaudMetalbox.</p>

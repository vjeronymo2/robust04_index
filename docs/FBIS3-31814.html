			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Milan Hulik: "The Czech Nation Has Not Come </F> To Terms With its Communist or Nazi Past"]    [Text] NATO does not want us. This issue is being  discussed in our foreign and domestic policy. Let me be frank  and leave no holds barred -- why should it want us? President  Vaclav Havel has expressed his view on the appropriateness of  our incorporation into Western Europe's defense structure. With  all due respect for his views, formulated with the brilliant  reasoning of a great stylist, I can only say that they were  merely a manifestation of an intellectual reasoning with which  it is impossible to disagree, but they have no practical effect.    However, it is impossible to look at Europe (and all the  more  so the whole world) only from the perspective of a country that  in this century has hardly contributed to the defense of  democracy, if we do not count the handful of very courageous  people -- including the members of the small domestic resistance  movement -- who, during the First and Second World Wars, fought  alongside the Allies. The far greater part of the nation -- by  its silent loyalty, its elbow grease, and its participation in  demonstrations -- supported both the throne of the aged kaiser  and the Reich's struggle against Bolshevism and Western  plutocracy. The cottage-beerhouse "resistance" during the  recent totalitarianism is within living memory: Again, a  handful of dissidents and -- apart from them -- the nation. The  former marched with their heads against the wall and the latter  with their faces turned against the May Day platform.  Incidentally, little force was needed to import communism into  the Czechoslovak Republic; it is enough to read the proclamation  "Forward, Not a Step Back" published in RUDE PRAVO immediately  after 25 February 1948. The names that we find there take our  breath away: These names had the same significance and same  symbolism in the later struggle against communism as do the  names we come across, for example, in the list of State Security  collaborators. This is not an accusation, it is a statement of  the fact that the human disposition is changeable, because it is  made up of human experience and sometimes -- sadly -- of human  ignorance.    They do not want us in NATO for several reasons, which can  be  divided roughly into three groups:    1. Technical-military reasons;    2. Psychological reasons;    3. Moral reasons.  <H5>  Technical-Military Reasons </H5>   Even for the Western states it would not -- in the current  economic crisis -- be easy to finance the rearmament of the  Czech Army, as some of our politicians are hoping. Some of our  weapons are so obsolete that the term antediluvian comes to  mind. The once state-of-the-art infantry weaponry, the core of  which was formed by the type-57 assault rifle, is of a caliber  that does not correspond to NATO's 5.56-mm ammunition. The  electronic, radar, and radio-technical equipment does not  correspond to the parameters for modern warfare and the  obsolescence of the Air Force compared with the North Atlantic  Alliance's air forces can be equated with the pre-war situation  against the Luftwaffe. Our tanks, the main strike force of the  armies in World War II, cannot -- even though they are the top  of the range of a series of celebrated Soviet T-types -- compete  with the German Leopard II's or the U.S. AM-I's. Assuming the  financial burden of this rearmament is beyond the current  ability of the Western economy and how our budget would take  care of it, well, that is written in the stars.  <H5>  Psychological Reasons </H5>   Relying on the military power of a partner, a power that --  understandably -- does not only consist of the strength of its  armaments and the size of its army, would be risky for the NATO  forces. This partner has already capitulated without a fight  several times, and that with a well-equipped army. It would be  all the more risky in view of the fact that, not so long ago,  the representatives of the new democratic regime in the velvet  euphoria of their first appearance on the international scene  suggested to Western statesmen that NATO be abolished as a  reciprocal gesture for the abolition of the (disintegrating)  Warsaw Pact. The army of a nation and state that has still not  come to terms with its previous capitulations and has not  accepted them internally cannot be a reliable ally. This nation  has not come to terms not only with its communist past, but also  with its Nazi past.    One phenomenon links these two pasts -- the weakness of the  resistance or, at least, the resistance against the totalitarian  regime! This is borne out by the fact that our domestic policy  is today characterized by quarrels and disputes over whether the  Czech Army should fight for "someone else's" interests. The  strong left wing, and mainly its international communist  militant part, are always trying to undermine any involvement by  the Czech Army on the side of the Western democracies, which  only yesterday were its mortal enemy. (It is possible to ask  Comrade Ortman or Comrade Grebenicek if they still are today.)  In our evaluation by the West, the meager psychological ability  or inability to put up real resistance to violence and  totalitarianism is -- perhaps -- our biggest failing. I can  imagine what the outburst would be in parliament and the  individual political parties (and, subsequently, among the  public) if a request to dispatch our expeditionary force, for  example, to Yugoslavia were to come up on the agenda.   <H5>    Moral Reasons </H5>   If what was written in CESKY DENIK about General Nekvasil,  chief of the Czech Army General Staff, is true, then it is  unnecessary to write more: We really have no business being in  NATO. Here even Vaclav Havel's most effective reasoning loses  its meaning. Even if it were not true, however, it is an  incontestable fact that our generals studied in the USSR. There  is no need to write that no one knows about the list of KGB  agents. It would be illogical to ask the people now enthusing  about democracy (for generals' and colonels' salaries, of  course), people immersed in communist indoctrination, whose  medal ribbons are overwhelmingly red and whose uniforms still  glitter with stars, really to fight for this democracy or even  fight for the democracy of Western countries. They are aware of  this in the FRG, where former East German generals and colonels  today command companies and squadrons as warrant officers and  squadron leaders, if they are still in the army.    An army that, despite all the screenings and performance  reviews, has not been able to purge itself and from which  hundreds of young officers, the least affected by communist  indoctrination (whom no one promoted or appointed to responsible  posts in place of the "most orthodox") have resigned in  disillusion cannot enjoy the confidence of NATO and cannot be  its loyal partner -- all the more so in view of the fact that,  long after the anti-communist revolution, this army was  commanded by a general who had previously served as the  nomenklatura supremo of the communist army and later as the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia's camp spokesman.    If our army is not to play the role of a fifth column in the  future struggle for the interests of civilization and democracy,  many things will still have to change not only in Europe and the  Czech Republic, but -- first and foremost -- in its corps of  commanders. The issue involves making sure that the slogan of a  fallen Soviet soldier in World War II, written in blood where he  fell, also applies to it: "There is nowhere to withdraw to,  Moscow is behind us." Our army still has somewhere to withdraw  to -- to its communist past or to its post-communist present.</p>

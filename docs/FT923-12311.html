			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: A growing trend towards alliances Brian Bollen LIVING together rather than marrying is increasingly popular in international business. Alliances and partnerships which fall short of total commitment but which help contain the costs of research, development and manufacturing are a growing trend, particularly in the global computer industry. Announced last week, the largest such alliance to date sees IBM of the US, Japan's Toshiba, and Siemens of Germany joining forces to research and develop advanced computer memory chips. Meanwhile, Japan's Fujitsu is establishing a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices of the US to manufacture flash memory devices, the current hot product in the sector. Last week's batch of non-core disposals included the sale by UK construction group Tarmac of its Briggs Oil bitumen business to Nynas Petroleum of Sweden. Tarmac wants to cut gearing to 25 per cent, from 51 per cent at the end of last year. The opportunity for UK-based industrial conglomerate BTR to make a strategic purchase of a clutch of businesses in the UK and mainland Europe arose from Pirelli of Italy's decision this year to concentrate on core businesses and cut debt. BTR simultaneously announced the disposal of interests in Richmond Power Enterprise in the US, a peripheral business acquired when it bought Hawker Siddeley last year. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank ended its direct involvement in Cathay Pacific airline by selling its last 10 per cent to China National Aviation Corporation and China Travel Service. Privatisation in eastern Europe continues, albeit at a jogging pace other than in east Germany. The Treuhand privatisation notched up another first - the sale of electronics company Werk fur Fernsehlektronik to Samsung representing the first acquisition of an east German business by a South Korean company. US hotels group Marriott Corporation's purchase of the Duna Intercontinental hotel is being seen as a victory for the State Property Agency's commitment to competitive bidding.</p>

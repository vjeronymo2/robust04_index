			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Discontent over utility charges CONSUMER discontent with charges for public transport, telecommunications, water and gas has grown over the past three years, says a survey for the National Consumer Council published today. British Rail suffered the steepest rise in dissatisfaction since the last survey was held in 1990, with 59 per cent of rail users describing fares as either very or fairly unreasonable. Three years ago the figure was 47 per cent. In industries already privatised, dissatisfaction with pricing has risen but to a lesser extent: from 45 per cent to 55 per cent for British Telecommunications, from 37 to 46 per cent for water, and from 25 to 29 per cent for gas. Dissatisfaction with electricity prices increased only marginally, from 38 to 39 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDO QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS: OWNER REFUSES TO PAY BECAUSE REPAIRS NOT MADE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I serve on the board of directors of a new condominium development  that has just recently been turned over to the homeowners by the developer. One  of our owners is seriously delinquent in paying his monthly assessments.  </P> <P> The delinquent owner refuses to pay because the developer has not completed  some repair work inside his condominium unit.  </P> <P> What can we do?  </P> <P> ANSWER: First, your board must enforce the established delinquency procedures  that should have been adopted as soon as the association was formed. Always  enforce these procedures fairly and consistently with all owners who are  delinquent.  </P> <P> Perhaps a friendly visit between the delinquent owner and the board president  or treasurer will clear up the problem.  </P> <P> It should by easy to reason with the owner, especially now that the association  is no longer under the developer's control. You can explain to him that the  assessment fee pays for common area expenses or common utilities.  </P> <P> For example, the domestic water is probably a common exposure. Ask him if he  thinks that his neighbors should have to continue to pay his share of the water  bill. Another example would by the lighting in the common corridors. These are  services that he is using every day and not paying for it.  </P> <P> The owner has an obligation to pay the assessment regardless of the condition  of his own unit. His "beef" is with the developer, and the association has no  control over when the developer will complete the repair work. In my opinion,  the board should not assume any responsibility to assist the owner in getting  the work done.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Former Board Didn't Stop Noisy Owner  </P> <P> Q: One of the owners in our condominium has been harassing the downstairs owner  by stomping, slamming doors and creating other nuisances. The harassed owner  notified the previous board of directors, and the only action taken by the  board was verbal warning to the noisy owner.  </P> <P> Even though the legal documents prohibit "offensive activity that may be an  annoyance or nuisance," the board felt that the problem should be solved  neighbor to neighbor.  </P> <P> Now the complaining owner is serving as president of the board and has directed  the management company to send the noisy owner a letter reminding him of the  nightly "quiet hours" in our rules. The noisy neighbor now quiets down at 10  p.m. but still is creating disturbances at other times.  </P> <P> The new board president is threatening to sue the prior board members for not  taking action on this matter.  </P> <P> Do you think the prior board members were negligent in not resolving this  problem? What can this board do to resolve it now?  </P> <P> A: This is the kind of problem that no board member wants to have to solve. The  board members may not have been negligent but, in my opinion, they should have  tried harder to settle this issue. They could have sent a written violation  notice to the noisy owner. Then they could have scheduled a hearing if the  noise continued.  </P> <P> If the association's legal documents permit a fine for this kind of infraction,  then they could have levied a fine.  </P> <P> If the current board tries all these methods and fails to get a positive  response, then perhaps only a court order will get the offending owner's  attention.  </P> <P> The complaining owner could file a legal action against the noisy owner. If the  board does not enforce the association's legal documents, any individual owner  has the right to enforce them.  </P> <P> The association board should consult an attorney who specializes in condominium  law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Protect the Board From Lawsuits  </P> <P> Q: Our homeowner association has had numerous conflicts and lawsuits in the  past. Now it is almost impossible to get anyone to serve on the board because  they are afraid of being sued.  </P> <P> I was recently appointed to the board, but I really don't know what my  responsibilities are. What can board members do to limit our liability? What  resources can you recommend?  </P> <P> A: First, you should make sure that the association has directors' and  officers' liability insurance, adequate property insurance, fidelity bond  coverage and worker's compensation coverage.  </P> <P> Make sure that you comply with all the insurance requirements in your  declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs). The  directors' and officers' liability insurance will not protect you if you fail  to adequately insure the association.  </P> <P> Second, read all the legal documents of the association and board meeting  minutes, contracts, financial statements and management reports for the past  year.  </P> <P> Third, educate yourself by attending seminars given by Community Associations  Institute. Check your local phone directory or call directory assistance for  the chapter near you.  </P> <P> CAI has many publications that would be helpful. A basic resource is a booklet  titled "Community Association Leadership: A Guide For Volunteers." Topics  covered include the role of officers, effective meetings, committee operations  and fiduciary responsibility.  </P> <P> The booklet is available from the Greater Los Angeles chapter for $3.50 for  each booklet ordered. Send your check to: CAI, P.O. Box 84303, Los Angeles,  Calif. 90073. Allow six weeks for delivery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Board Uses Reserve Fund for Operations  </P> <P> QUESTION: The previous board of directors in my homeowner association was  frugal and maintained a reserve fund for future repair of streets, tennis  courts and gates.  </P> <P> Our present board has apparently spent all of our operating funds for the year  and now must dip into the reserves. Our assessment fees for the next year will  probably be increased.  </P> <P> I thought the purpose of the reserve study was to determine the amount of money  needed for the future and that none of the money should be used until the full  amount has been accumulated. What does state law say about spending reserve  funds?  </P> <P> ANSWER: California law does not dictate how the funds are to be spent. The law  states that a reserve study must be done to determine the amount of funds that  will be needed for future repair and replacement of association property.  </P> <P> The association does not have to wait until the tennis court reserve is fully  funded before using the money to resurface the court, for instance. Each year,  as money from the reserves is used, the reserve budget for the following year  must be revised to allocate more money as needed.  </P> <P> If the board is using reserve funds to make up the shortfall in the operating  funds for this year, the budget for next fiscal year should be revised to cover  the replacement of any reserve funds that are used to this year.  </P> <P> In other words, if the association is now using reserve funds to pay the  gardener for landscape maintenance, the operating budgets for next year will  have to be increased to reflect the true cost of the landscape maintenance.  </P> <P> Then the reserve budget will have to be increased to replace the funds that  were used for the operating expenses this year.  </P> <P> Reserve funds can be used for emergencies at the discretion of the board, but  in this case, it might have been more prudent to have a special assessment  rather than use the reserve funds. Using the reserve fund for ongoing operating  expenses is a poor way of managing the association's money.  </P> <P> Hickenbottom is past president of the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the  Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit research and  educational organization.

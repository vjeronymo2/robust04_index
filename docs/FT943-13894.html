			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Setback for Balladur as minister goes The French government of prime minister Edouard Balladur suffered a blow last night with the announcement of the resignation of Mr Alain Carignon, the communications minister. A brief communique announcing his surprise resignation said that Mr Carignon had said he was stepping down because he wanted to be able to express himself freely in a corruption investigation involving a press company at Grenoble, the south-eastern, Alpine city where he is mayor. Mr Carignon, 45, is the first minister to resign since Mr Balladur's centre-right government took office in March last year. In stepping down, Mr Carignon has also become the latest figure to be affected by a series of corruption investigations of French politicians and businessmen over the past few months. The minister said that he wanted to be placed formally under investigation in the case so that he would have access to police files for his defence, while minimising embarrassment to the government. Mr Balladur said that he 'saluted' Mr Carignon's decision, adding that he hoped the unfolding of the legal case would allow Mr Carignon to establish his good faith and to be cleared of any blame. The investigation behind Mr Carignon's resignation concerns Dauphine News, a press group which publishes a magazine at Grenoble. In a letter to his ministerial staff, Mr Carignon said that the case did not involve any concealment or diversion of public funds, no personal enrichment or fiscal fraud. 'In withdrawing from the government, I will become a citizen again. In taking my liberty, I am also ensuring that neither the independence of the judiciary nor that of the government can be compromised,' he said. The minister submitted his resignation yesterday, and it was accepted by the prime minister. A statement from Mr Balladur's office said that Mr Carignon's functions would pass, for the time being, to Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister and government spokesman. Over the past few months, various political and business figures in France, on the right and the left of the political range, have been involved in corruption investigations. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, has been investigated for alleged illegal financing of the Republican Party. Mr Bernard Tapie, a left-wing entrepreneur and politician is being investigated for fraud and tax evasion.</p>

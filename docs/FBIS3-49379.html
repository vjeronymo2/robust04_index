			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Jan 7 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal  Kovac, in his statement on the problem of ethnic minorities in  Slovakia published in the independent daily SME today, stressed  that it was in the interest of Slovaks, ethnic Hungarians and  other nationalities and ethnic groups in Slovakia to seek to  prevent irresponsible politicians from southern Slovakia from  artificially creating a conflict situation.    Kovac's statement calls for dialogue and rejects the  expressions of nationalism that appeared in a Hungarian-language  daily on the eve of a meeting of representatives of the  Hungarian minority in Komarno convened by the Association of  Towns and Villages of Zitny Island.    Although Kovac resolutely rejected as unconstitutional a  proposal to create a special province in southern Slovakia, at  the same time he supported as justified demand that the new  territorial administrative division of Slovakia not discriminate  against the Hungarian minority.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fatos Baxhaku: "Expulsions Resume"] </F>   [Text] Tirana -- Tension between Albania and Greece  continues to rise after the 10 April terrorist assassination in  the barracks in Peshkepi. Following mutual diplomatic  recriminations, the two countries have raised the level of alert  for their troops along the border and the first group of  expelled Albanian refugees has now arrived in their homeland.  On 13 April the Greek Defense Ministry ordered the 8th  Division, which is deployed along the southern Albanian border,  to maintain the highest possible level of alertness. The  Albanians have also increased their military alertness on the  other side of the border. "We have our men and units there and  we will not allow such terrorist acts to be repeated," said Agim  Shehu, a high-level Public Order Ministry official in Tirana, at  a meeting organized with journalists.    Meanwhile, the first mass expulsions of Albanian refugees  from Greece after the verification of the terrorist incident  have taken place. On 14 April the Greek authorities expelled  more than 1,500 Albanian refugees. Most of them passed through  the Kakavije border post, only a few km from the point where the  innocent victims were killed.    The bitter diplomatic war between Tirana and Athens  continues. The Albanian Foreign Ministry has decided to cut its  staff in Greece and at the same time has demanded reciprocal  measures from the Greek side. A note delivered to the Greek  ambassador in Tirana has demanded the reduction of the number of  diplomatic staff in Tirana to six. The Greek diplomats must  leave Albanian territory within 10 days. Robo, first secretary  of the Albanian Embassy in Athens, and Iacovou, Greek consul in  Gjirokaster, left their posts yesterday. Tirana made this  decision on the basis of the lack of a reciprocal agreement on  the number of necessary diplomatic staff. Thus, contacts between  Albanian and Greece are reduced to the lowest level since the  establishment of diplomatic relations in 1971.    Albanian experts believe that there is no doubt that special  Greek forces were the culprits in the massacre at Peshkepi, and  that the assassination was planned. Two high-level Public Order  Ministry officials, Shehu and Mucmataj, confirmed this  conclusion once again, showing journalists material proof that,  according to them, demonstrated this. "The commandos' behavior,  the precise selection of the target for their attack, the Greek  military uniforms, and objects found at the scene of the  incident all support our conclusion," Shehu said. Athens  continues to deny this. According to its spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos, the Greek Government is still awaiting Tirana's  response to its proposal for the creation of a joint commission  to investigate the incident. Moreover, Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias has proposed to his Albanian counterpart  Serreqi a meeting in a neutral country to discuss the  possibility of settling the crisis between the two countries.    In the meantime, an investigation of the Albanian servicemen  accused of negligence of military responsibilities has also  begun. According to Mucmataj, three Albanian officers are under  investigation. An inspector of the Border Police from  Gjirokaster and two servicemen in the unit where the murders  took place are to face proceedings, after being released after  two days' detention. "It is up to the procurator to make further  decisions," Mucmataj said.</p>

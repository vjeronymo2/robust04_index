			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Details of first Swedish TV flotation revealed Details of the first public flotation by a Swedish television company were announced yesterday when TV4, the country's only commercial terrestrial channel, published the prospectus for a SKr400m issue of a 20 per cent share of the company. The 4m shares are priced at SKr100 each and TV4 hopes to attract 35,000 new investors. Applications will be taken between March 8 and March 18 and the company will be listed in Stockholm. TV4's biggest shareholder is the Swedish company Kinnevik, which also controls TV3, a commercial cable channel. Investor, the main investment vehicle of the Wallenberg family, also holds 25 per cent. TV4 predicted a SKr175m (Dollars 21.8m) profit in 1994, following a profit of SKr72m last year, but warned revenues could be hit if state-owned Swedish TV, which runs two terrestrial stations, is allowed to run advertising.</p>

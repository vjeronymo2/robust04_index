			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Moldavia [Moldova]: The </F> Leu Is Still Keeping Afloat, But Industry Is Drowning"]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- There have not been that  many successes in the economic life of Moldavia. But there has  been one: The leu, contrary to gloomy forecasts, which  predicted for it the fate of the Ukrainian karbovanets, is still  keeping afloat. Supported by nothing but transfusions from  international financial organizations, the leu is nevertheless  remaining stable. It is the hardest currency among the CIS  republics, the "Logos-press" economic review maintains, citing  specific figures in confirmation. At the beginning of January  the exchange rate stood at 364 Moldavian lei to U.S.$100, and at  the end of March at 399 to $100, i.e. an increase in the dollar  against the leu of just 9.6 percent, which is not that much.    Michael Blackwell, IMF representative in Moldavia, also  makes  an optimistic assessment of the national currency's position.  The rate of inflation has fallen sharply. Whereas it stood at  50 percent in December, in February it was down to 26 percent.  The IMF representative predicts 1-3 percent a month by the end  of the year -- no higher than in other developed European  countries. M. Blackwell sees as the reason for this stability of  the leu the strong reform program chosen by the Moldavian  Government and the rigid control over the financial policy of  the National Bank, which has limited total credit and is abiding  strictly by the memorandum signed with the IMF. If the National  Bank continues to keep to the chosen line, Blackwell believes,  then soon "healthy economic growth will begin" in Moldavia,  while the strong currency will make enterprises adopt "more  rational decisions."    So the leu is stable, which cannot, alas, be said of the  state of Moldavia's industrial potential. It is steadily  declining. The nonpayment of wages for several months in many  sectors has become a chronic illness in the Republic.    Far from everyone in Moldavia shares the IMF  representative's  optimism. In particular, A. Muravskiy, parliamentary deputy  from the Agrarian Democratic Party, believes that the IMF  financial policy resembles the actions of surgeons who treat all  diseases in just one way -- with a surgical operation.  International consultants rigidly apply the same yardstick to  Nicaragua, Poland, and Moldavia, regarding them as some  experimental test bed. But only a few people are familiar with  the memorandum, which the chief program of the financial policy,  and it can be judged only on indirect signs. These are not very  reassuring. "If the optimum point is not seized," Muravskiy  remarked, "a social storm could blow up and sweep aside both  this parliament and this government."    The Moldavian Union of Industrialists believes that it is  the  anti-inflationary monetary policy according to other people's  prescriptions that has put the Republic's industry in a grave  financial position, and it has demanded that the memorandum be  examined in parliament with a view to amending it.    Prime Minister A. Sangheli has reaffirmed, however, that the  government will not alter the chosen course and will take the  path of reforms.    The very near future will evidently show whether Moldavia  will succeed in improving the health of the economy or whether  the leu's stability will remain a local "economic miracle."</p>

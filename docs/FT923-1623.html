			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Meanwhile ..the single market plods on - The lifting of internal barriers on December 31 may give EC leaders a rallying point IN recent weeks the erratic course of the Maastricht hare has inevitably distracted spectators from the plodding progress of the single market tortoise, now less than four months from the finish line. The French Yes is not even on the formal agenda of EC internal market ministers, meeting in Brussels today. But the lessons of the referendum campaign - and of the Danish vote in June - have important implications for the single market programme. First, many of the anxieties are less a response to the Maastricht Treaty than a belated reaction to the 1986 Single European Act, which launched the internal market project. In France, only the most protectionist No campaigners attacked the grand marche itself. But claims of meddling from Brussels - for example, over unpasteurised Camembert cheese - or dark apocalyptic fears of, say, unrestricted immigration, sprang from suspicions of what a barrier-free Europe might involve. Some Brussels officials believe a No vote would have prompted widespread resistance to existing legislation, with subsidiarity as the rallying cry, and national self-interest as the real driving force. 'With a Yes vote, the temptation will now be less great, but nevertheless it is still there,' warned one Commission official yesterday. 'Many people have realised they can indulge in an exercise of Brussels-bashing without really getting kicked back.' Continuing sensitivity about Brussels' image in the EC could still hamper installation of the final pieces of the single market - including some of the controversial and most far-reaching elements. It is worth asking, for example, whether the Commission and the British presidency will maintain the pressure on reluctant member states to open up the energy market. The Commission's plans to encourage wider access to gas and electricity networks, a particular aim of the British government, have already been watered down. But even in their dilute state they brought thousands of French energy workers to the streets of Brussels. Similarly, fragility of the political consensus could temper Commission attacks on public monopolies under Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome. That article - which could be used against energy, postal and telecommunications monopolies - allows the Commission to legislate without approval of member states. Advocates of Article 90 - of whom the most prominent is Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner - say nothing has changed. 'In fact, if you look at it from a positive point of view, (Article 90) opens up previously monopolised sectors to competitions, to the benefit of consumers,' says one competition official. An incomplete and uneven internal market is the gloomy scenario. But it is also possible that having scraped through the French referendum, member states will rally round the project. That would be one way of demonstrating the mutual trust which has recently been lacking in other areas of Community co-operation. Britain, in spite of everything, is still best placed to lead such a rally, given its long-standing support for the internal market. Exactly what will happen at midnight on December 31, let alone beyond, depends on the willingness of national governments to champion the single market. But with the Community still in turmoil, officials say the value of a symbolic, 12-strong lowering of internal EC barriers should not be underestimated.</p>

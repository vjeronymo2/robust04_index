This is the amount of short-term  loans (duration of up to 12 months) that the Federal Government  had covered via the Hermes credit insurance and which are now  having problems or will endure problems by the end of this year.  Since no precautions have been taken in the federal budget's  guarantee account for damage caused by Iranian loans, the  Federal Government wants to avoid a rescheduling of the debts,  which would force it to pay approximately 90 percent  immediately. Ten percent would have to be covered by the  exporters themselves.    Otherwise, an addendum to the budget of DM3-4 billion would  certainly become necessary, Bonn fears -- and right in the hot  stage of the election campaign in autumn. The responsible  ministries (Finance Ministry and Economics Ministry) and Hermes  are, therefore, currently negotiating with the Iranian Central  Bank Markazi about an almost unique refinancing:    A consortium of German banks is to grant a loan for the  entire amount, including the exporters' retention, until 1995  and is to receive a guarantee for that by the Federal  Government. Already approved compensations of approximately  DM420 million are to be included in the transaction so as to  spare the budget.    Since the debts involve around 1,000 indivdiaul demands by  up  to 700 exporters, refinancing could not be coordinated  differently at short notice anyway. Hermes has written to the  exporters that conduct business with Iran and has requested  details on their guaranteed demands. The costs of the unusual  transaction are to be paid by Iran. This was negotiated until  yesterday; the result is still open. [passage omitted]</p>

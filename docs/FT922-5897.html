			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico eases laws on foreign investment THE Mexican Congress has approved changes to make it significantly easier for foreigners to invest in the country's newly privatised banks. The government will allow foreigners to buy specially created 'L' shares with limited voting rights. These can be worth up to 30 per cent of total voting capital, and if the maximum number is issued, 23.1 per cent of total capital. Foreigners have been able to buy 'C' shares, limited to 30 per cent of voting capital, and, through neutral trusts 'B' shares, limited to 19 per cent of voting capital. Foreigners could in theory own equity (with limited voting rights) equivalent to 79 per cent of total voting capital, or 60 per cent of total capital. The legal changes are expected to help Mexican banks planning international equity offerings.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 2 OFF-RAMPS TO CLOSE ON COSTA MESA FREEWAY  </P> <P> Motorists who use the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway are in for a jolt this  month: Heavily used off-ramps at Dyer Road and McFadden Avenue will be closed  because of freeway-related reconstruction work, Caltrans officials said.  </P> <P> Beginning Monday, the eastbound Dyer Road off-ramp will be closed from the  southbound Costa Mesa Freeway for about a month.  </P> <P> A week later, on Sunday, Aug. 13, the old McFadden off-ramp from the southbound  Costa Mesa Freeway will be closed permanently. The new McFadden off-ramp is  scheduled to open by the end of the month, according to Caltrans spokesman  Albert Miranda.  </P> <P> "Because many commuters rely on these ramps, we suggest Edinger Avenue and  MacArthur Boulevard as alternate routes for those commuting in the area,"  Miranda said.  </P> <P> Caltrans officials said they fear negative reaction to the closures because  there has not been much advance warning.  </P> <P> "We found out about this at the last minute from our field staff," said Kristen  Argo, an aide to Miranda.  </P></p>

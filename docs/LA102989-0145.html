			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OUT: WHO WILL PAY FOR A BETTER CITY?  </P> <P> It's an easy piece of logic.  </P> <P> A developer constructs a building downtown. The space is rented, business is  expanded, more jobs are created, the region's wealth is increased. Furthermore,  the city's role is enhanced, its tax base broadened, and the developer, broker  and investment partners are enriched.  </P> <P> Sounds simple, doesn't it? It seems that everyone wins. But the consequent  growth makes the morning and evening rush hours more congested and increases  the demand for city services.  </P> <P> New development also crowds the agenda, sometimes overshadowing our need to  preserve our old buildings, the treasures of the past. The new development  leaves less room for parks, walking spaces, fountains and sky.  </P> <P> Who's going to preserve and recycle those historic buildings? Who's going to  pay for more traffic cops, street lights and public transportation? Who's going  to clean the air we breathe, house the new downtown workers, provide expanded  police and fire protection, schools, child care, cultural facilities and parks?  </P> <P> And who will prime the pump for greater economic prosperity by building new  public facilities such as the larger and more competitive Convention Center?  </P> <P> In other words, who's going to pay to make Los Angeles not just a big city but  a great city? After all, it's the amenities and support systems surrounding  commercial development that give the city the flavor and quality of living that  we're all looking for.  </P> <P> The far-sighted developer understands that the value of his property is  enhanced by the richness of the neighborhood in which he builds. He recognizes  his responsibility to be a primary contributor to community amenities.  </P> <P> The short-sighted critic claims that someone should pay to build a great city  to leave to our descendants, hoping the bill will be theirs, not his.  </P> <P> Will developers, who reap the benefits of growth, help pay for that legacy or  merely pass it on to their clients and the taxpayers?  </P> <P> These are the issues that were skirted in the "Speaking Out" column of Oct. 15.  ("CRA's Fee Bodes Ill for Healthy Downtown," written by commercial real estate  broker John C. Cushman III).  </P> <P> In the article, the writer bemoaned the fact that phenomenal growth has spawned  serious urban problems that threaten the continued prosperity of downtown and  the region. Nothing new there. We're grappling with these problems every day.  He chose not to offer any constructive solutions, but merely to flail once  again at the bureaucratic process.  </P> <P> Redevelopment has been successful in this city. A robust financial center has  bloomed and the assessed property valuation in Los Angeles' Central Business  District has tripled within the past decade.  </P> <P> The developer of 10 years ago took a risk for a lower price. Today's developer  may be paying full market value but his investment is more of a sure thing.  </P> <P> But redevelopment doesn't stop at the edge of a visibly successful commercial  core.  </P> <P> A larger, more complex central city presents an agenda that cries out for  action. Homeless families with no place to go live on the streets of Skid Row.  Some 6,000 dilapidated housing units must be upgraded. An estimated 6 million  square feet of vacant or under-used commercial space in historic buildings goes  begging for tenants.  </P> <P> A viable 24-hour residential community in South Park must be nurtured in order  for it to take root and eventually provide 15,000 to 20,000 units for downtown  dwellers of all economic levels.  </P> <P> These are some of the issues in Los Angeles that developer fees help us to  address.  </P> <P> Pending before the City Council is a proposal prepared by the Community  Redevelopment Agency in response to the council. (Effective June, 1988, a city  ordinance required the CRA to develop a uniform procedure for regulating  density transfers and providing for public benefit contributions.) The proposal  is designed to provide for public benefits without choking new development and  to give order to a previously chaotic and arbitrary system of density  transfers.  </P> <P> There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about this proposal. It is nothing  new for a large project to contribute significant public benefits.  </P> <P> For example, the massive assembling of development rights to allow the  construction of Library Square, which consists of the 73-story First Interstate  World Center and the Southern California Gas Center, is generating upward of  $50 million for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Central Library,  restoration of the west lawn and construction of the Bunker Hill Steps.  California Plaza provided for the Museum of Contemporary Art and for the future  Bella Lewitzky Dance Gallery.  </P> <P> The landmark Bradbury Building at 3rd Street and Broadway was saved from  demolition by the agency's approving the use of its unused development rights  to raise funds for the cost of seismic upgrading. The Home Savings Tower at 7th  and Figueroa will include a major portal into the Metro Rail and Light Rail  station beneath the building. Citicorp Plaza made Seventh Market Place  possible, which, in turn, kept two department stores from abandoning downtown.  </P> <P> The proposal, essentially a procedure to implement a city ordinance to regulate  TFAR, an acronym for transferable floor area ratio otherwise known as  development or density rights, could become one of the most important pieces of  city legislation in recent years.  </P> <P> The procedure is quite simple. It's based on the proposition that if the city  grants additional building rights to a developer that will enhance the value of  his land, then the city can rightfully ask the developer to pay a fee to help  offset the impact of the additional development.  </P> <P> The new proposal, which will get full discussion before the City Council in the  months to come, follows a common real estate practice in cities all over the  United States today.  </P> <P> In downtown Los Angeles, zoning regulations allow six square feet of building  for every square foot of land on a site. A 100,000-square-foot site gives  property owners the right to a 600,000-square-foot building. Developers who  want to build a 1 million-square-foot building must ask the city to transfer  additional unused development rights from another site. This action is called a  density transfer.  </P> <P> The procedure under consideration by the City Council states that everyone who  is awarded additional development rights, or density transfers, should pay a  public benefit fee. This fee can be used by the city to satisfy the needs  brought about by the development itself, such as extra open space, housing and  child care.  </P> <P> A public task force made up of developers, appraisers and real estate attorneys  worked for over a year to design a procedure that supports both the efforts of  the developer and the interests of the community. The Central City Assn., a  civic-minded coalition of private downtown interests, helped shape a proposal  that is sane, equitable and necessary to combat the problems that threaten the  future of our city.  </P> <P> The CRA estimates that the city will garner upward of $209 million over the  next 20 years in public benefit payments resulting from density transfers. And  where will the money go? To support housing for families and individuals of all  income levels who work and live in downtown. To beautify the streets and make  them more secure. To build much needed open space? To save our stock of fine  historic buildings. To provide child care facilities for today's working  parents.  </P> <P> Ultimately, public benefit payments will help create an environment that  contributes to the financial health of a development. A project that enhances  the community reaps the rewards of good corporate citizenship.  </P> <P> With the year 2000 just a decade away, city leaders pondering the future of Los  Angeles are trying to achieve a union between the city's continued growth and a  modern, efficient and balanced urban environment that provides an improved  quality of life for all of its citizens.  </P> <P> Rather than listening to a misplaced solo that may be out of tune, a full  representation of a vast choir of diversity must be heard. All of our efforts  must go forward in full partnership if we are to secure the future.  </P> <P> The problems have received anxious attention. The solutions demand our  thoughtful discussion.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- The Federal Office of  Criminal Investigation (BKA) has rejected information in the new  magazine FOCUS that four members of the Red Army Faction (RAF)  might have escaped during the antiterrorist action of Bad  Kleinen. These assumptions are wrong and do not correspond to  the facts, BKA spokesman Hans-Georg Fuchs said in Wiesbaden on  Thursday. However, the BKA does not wish to initiate any legal  steps against FOCUS, it was stated.    It is true that on 24 June 1993, that is, three days before  the action, the police filmed two persons who have so far not  been identified and who were also at the expected meeting point  of presumed RAF members Birgit Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams.  However, the investigators do not have any evidence that the  man and the woman whom they filmed are terrorists, the BKA  reported.    At the same time, the BKA rejected information from FOCUS  that authorities are meanwhile proceeding on the assumption that  the couple filmed might have participated in the murder of Trust  Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 1 April 1991. A  relevant "internal BKA paper" to which the magazine refers in  its report is not known in the BKA, it was stated.    According to Fuchs, the magazine's assertion that the BKA  investigators had filmed another couple who were only later  recognized as presumed RAF members Daniela Klette and  Ernst-Volker Staub at the Bad Kleinen station five hours before  the antiterrorist action is equally wrong. The BKA does not  have such a video recording, Fuchs said. [passage omitted]</p>

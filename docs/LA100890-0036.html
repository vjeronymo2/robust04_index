			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> TAKE 6 PREACHES A CAPPELLA GOSPEL  </P> <P> Look at the a cappella gospel group's list of credits, and Take 6 takes on the  appearance of a sextet of expert show-biz schmoozers -- what with TV theme  songs, TV talk shows, jazz festivals, movies with Spike Lee, an endless list of  recordings with hotshots. Impossibly friendly and grossly talented, they're the  utter darlings of the industry.  </P> <P> All of which makes it at least a slight surprise when Take 6 comes to their  biggest local headlining gig to date -- a sold-out performance at the Wiltern  Theatre on Saturday -- and is found to be still preaching it -- as in "if you  don't know whether or not you're on your way, it's time for you to decide."  Even those who don't share Take 6's evangelical Christian beliefs might have to  admire their ability to not water down what they do. Industry darlings and pop  mavericks too.  </P> <P> Few among the Wiltern crowd seemed to be hard-core a cappella fans; the  broad-based crowd looked an even blend of black and white, of those born again  and born once. All factions were in equally strong voice in "Spread Love," the  rare audience participation segment that is also a genuinely musical highlight.  </P> <P> Though these Nashvilleans are adept at creating instrumental sounds vocally --  especially Alvin Chea, who for effect plucks his mike cord as if it were bass  strings -- they're also instrumentalists on their own time, and a brief  piano-accompanied segment gave teasing preview of how terrific they might sound  singing non-a cappella R&amp;B and jazz. For now, though, they're sticking to  their original vocal intent almost as strictly as to the original message.  CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (27): Spanish breakthrough in new markets - Analysis, European group initiative / Progress by a conglomerate of companies in the Basque region of northern Spain In late July, Icex, the export promotion arm of Spain's trade ministry, organised a technology fair in Beijing at which 184 domestic companies put their capital goods and machine tool products on show. Danobat, a company specialising in the automotive industry, walked away from Icex's Expotecnia fair with a Dollars 16m order to supply machinery for a joint venture car plant in China that is planned by Japan's Suzuki group. Early next year Fagor, a household white goods manufacturer, will open a plant near Casablanca, Morocco, that, with an initial investment budget of Dollars 6m, will manufacture 80,000 fridges a year for the North African market. Danobat and Fagor both form part of Mondragon Corporacion Cooperativa (MCC), a conglomerate umbrella for 102 worker-ownership companies based in the Basque region of northern Spain. The two of them adhere to the industrial democracy and profit-sharing ideals that for the past 40 years have guided the fortunes of the Mondragon movement. What they also have in common is the strong export culture, and an incessant search for new markets, that fuels much of Basque industry, the back-up of a highly regarded applied research centre run by MCC that helps to tailor products to clients and the supportive backing of a tightly managed, profitable and far-seeing parent company. Danobat supplies mature automotive markets in Europe, particularly in Germany and France, where its sales to Volkswagen, Renault and other car manufacturing groups account for well over half of the company's Dollars 110m annual turnover. Emerging markets, and specifically China, are now poised to become a big earner for Danobat, according to Mr Pedro Corral, the company's export manager. 'Earnings from China should double to Dollars 30m very quickly,' says Mr Corral. Supplying the planned Suzuki plant in China was a breakthrough for Danobat for it had had only minor links with the Japanese and it is now bidding to supply established Danobat clients such as VW and Peugeot who are also seeking to break into the Chinese market. Fagor, the flagship of MCC's industrial empire, with annual sales of Dollars 173m, exports 35 per cent of its production. Its move into Morocco is the most ambitious foreign investment to date by a domestic appliance group that is likewise no stranger to overseas ventures; Fagor already boasts an electronic unit that assembles semi-conductors in Thailand and a plant in Mexico that produces components for household goods. Mr Jesus Ginto of the MCC parent says the Moroccan fridge plant near Casablanca could turn out to be a mere bridgehead for other important business initiatives in North Africa. If the initial investment brings rewards, Fagor will be expanding into washing machines and water heaters. Already it has transferred its home-grown technology in both products to Argentina and to Colombia in Latin America. Several factors lie behind the assault by both companies on the emerging markets. The most important is the resources that they are able to draw on through the MCC group. The Ikerlan applied research faculty, at the MCC's nerve centre in Mondragon (in the case of Danobat, the centre is complemented by the capital goods company's own high tech development unit) is of key importance, but it only partially explains the export succes story. MCC officials stress the added value of the cooperative movement's engineering and business schools which are likewise located at the Mondragon nucleus and provide a constant stream of highly qualified candidates, up to 80 a year, for the corporation's expansion. In their quest to develop an export culture, the schools recruit instructors from other European centres, encourage students to participate in exchange programmes, particularly in the UK, and place a high priority on language skills. Separate tuition courses, adapted to the needs of MCC's different components, provide back-up training for the corporation's executives. Danobat clinched its Suzuki deal at the trade fair organised by the government's Icex export agency. 'Expotecnia was able to show that Spain is not just sunshine, flamenco and fighting bulls,' says a Danobat manager - and the company concedes that it is well covered, as it takes on its European competitors, by Spain's CSCE export credit insurance. But the consensus is that any company that places great store by official export aid will fail to bring in the contracts. By the same token, a competitive currency, as is the peseta which was sharply devalued after 1992, can only provide a degree of support. In the case of Danobat, the currency was a neutral issue as the company imports components for its capital goods equipment. The edge when breaking into competitive emerging markets comes in the surefire combination of price plus quality plus service and for Spanish companies there is a clear challenge in demonstrating the last two items in the well-tried formula. Danobat has worked hard at the Chinese market over the past four years. It has teams of home-side sales people, drawn from its 60-strong marketing staff, spending four to five week periods in relays in China working with locally hired staff to attend existing clients and to search out new ones. Fagor's break into Morocco drew on the resources of a specialised MCC unit that scours emerging markets for joint venture opportunities.</p>

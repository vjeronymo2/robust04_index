			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  CULINARY SOS: FLUTTERING OVER A MEAL OF QUAIL  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: On the way to Palm Springs we found an exciting Italian restaurant in  Riverside called Magnone, which I would have expected to find in Beverly Hills.  They served a marvelous quail stuffed with pancetta and accompanied by polenta  (cornmeal cakes). I would love to have a recipe for the quail. I hope you can  get it, as I think other readers would like to know how to prepare quail in  this delicious manner.  </P> <P>  -- FERN  </P> <P> DEAR FERN: The chef at Magnone graciously sent the recipe. We were delighted to  find that the stuffing also contains wild rice and juniper berries, which you  can find in spice sections of most gourmet food stores. The dried berries can  be left out of the recipe if they are not available.  </P> <P> MAGNONE'S ROAST QUAIL WITH WILD RICE STUFFING  </P> <P> 1 cup uncooked wild rice  </P> <P> 4 cups veal stock  </P> <P> 1/4 cup pancetta, diced and lightly cooked  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon juniper berries, crushed  </P> <P> 12 small quail  </P> <P> Flour  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons diced shallots  </P> <P> 4 ounces gin  </P> <P> 1/4 cup unsalted butter  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Cook rice in 2 cups veal stock with pancetta and juniper berries until tender  and liquid is absorbed. Cool rice. Fill quail cavities with 1/4 of rice  mixture, reserving remaining 3/4 of rice for plates.  </P> <P> Lightly flour quail and cook in olive oil in oven-proof skillet until browned  on all sides. Pour off excess oil and roast stuffed quail at 450 degrees 10 to  15 minutes, or until cooked through.  </P> <P> Remove pan from oven and add shallots. Flame with gin. Remove quail to plates  and add remaining 2 cups veal stock to skillet. Reduce liquid over medium-high  heat.  </P> <P> Add butter, salt and pepper to taste and heat until butter melts and sauce  thickens slightly. Pour over quail. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I was recently told about an ice cream dessert called Mississippi mud  pie, but after searching through all my cookbooks, I have been unable to find  such a dessert. Do you have a recipe in your files?  </P> <P>  -- GINA  </P> <P> DEAR GINA: We have several such recipes in our files. The Chart House, a steak  house chain, was one of the first restaurants in Southern California to serve  the pie a decade or so ago. Their recipe is given here. Mud pies make wonderful  summer desserts because they are cool and can be prepared well in advance to  keep in the freezer until ready to serve.  </P> <P> CHART HOUSE MUD PIE  </P> <P> 2/3 (8 1/2-ounce) package dark chocolate wafers  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened  </P> <P> 1/2 gallon coffee ice cream, slightly softened  </P> <P> 3/4 cup Chocolate Fudge Sauce  </P> <P> Whipped cream  </P> <P> Toasted sliced almonds  </P> <P> Crush wafers and mix with butter. Press into bottom and up sides of 9-inch pie  plate. Chill thoroughly or bake at 350 degrees 7 minutes, then chill.  </P> <P> Pack ice cream into chilled crust, shaping into slight mound. Freeze until  firm. (Freezing before adding fudge sauce is essential to keep fudge from  slipping off.)  </P> <P> Pour Chocolate Fudge Sauce evenly over pie and freeze until ready to serve.  Serve with dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle with almond slices. Makes 1  (9-inch) pie.  </P> <P> Chocolate Fudge Sauce  </P> <P> 5 squares unsweetened Swiss chocolate  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 (5.3-ounce) can evaporated milk  </P> <P> 3 cups powdered sugar  </P> <P> 1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> Melt chocolate and butter in small saucepan. Remove from heat and mix in milk  alternately with powdered sugar. Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring  constantly.  </P> <P> Cook, stirring, 8 minutes or until thickened and creamy. Remove from heat and  stir in vanilla. Store in refrigerator and use as needed. Makes 3 cups.  </P></p>

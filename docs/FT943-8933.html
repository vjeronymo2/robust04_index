			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Bolger to press on in NZ after key poll win New Zealand's National party government yesterday pledged to continue its reform programme following its narrow victory over the left-wing Alliance party in a weekend by-election. A loss in the former National party stronghold of Selwyn would have cost the government its one-seat majority, possibly forcing an early election. The National party's candidate, Mr David Carter, won 8,621 votes against the Alliance's Mr John Wright on 8,275. The result means that the National party has 50 seats in parliament, Labour 45 and the Alliance and populist New Zealand First two each. However, the government remains vulnerable to defections as the country prepares to change to a proportional representation voting system. Several MPs are expected to resign to form new right-wing or Christian fundamentalist parties. Acknowledging this likelihood, the prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, said he would be approaching right-wing Labour MPs in the coming week to secure their agreement to support the government on crucial issues. 'I'm not asking them to form a coalition but to work to retain the stability of the country,' Mr Bolger said. 'Any instability now would be very bad for the economy.' Mr Bolger made clear that the government intended to force further controversial legislation through parliament. This includes shipping deregulation to put New Zealand in the unusual position of allowing international vessels to carry cargo between domestic ports; further asset sales, which are required to meet the government's budget surplus forecasts; and reforms of health and hospital care. In the by-election, forced by the surprise resignation of the former finance minister, Mrs Ruth Richardson, the National party increased its share of the vote by one percentage point to 42.2 per cent, but saw its majority cut from to 886 to 346. But support for Labour collapsed to only 10.3 per cent of the vote, a distant third behind the left-wing Alliance party - a group of five minor parties including the Greens - which won 40.5 per cent. The Labour leader, Ms Helen Clark, said the drop in support reflected tactical voting for the Alliance, which was seen to have the best chance of ousting the National party.</p>

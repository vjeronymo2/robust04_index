			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Fuel switch defended by generators ELECTRICITY companies responded sharply to allegations yesterday that they had contributed to the sweeping closures at British Coal by switching from coal to gas. East Midlands Electricity, which is building a gas plant at Corby, Northants, said: 'We wouldn't enter into developments unless they represent value for our customers and put downward pressure on prices.' The 'dash for gas' was typified only two weeks ago when Mr Ed Wallis, the chief executive of PowerGen, one of the UK's two large power generators, opened a 900MW gas-fired station at Killingholme, Humberside. On the same day, National Power, the other large generator, announced that it was closing 2,700MW of surplus power plant, most of it coal-fired. On the face of it, the position does indeed look absurd. The UK is shutting down long-established power stations using an important national resource which is plentiful and might last for hundreds of years. In their place it is investing billions of pounds in new stations using a fuel that might run out in 50 years. At present, 16 gas-fired power stations are either running or under construction with a total capacity of 11,000MW, equivalent to about a fifth of requirements in England and Wales. They will displace about 30m tonnes of coal a year. A factor driving the change was the lifting last year of an EC ban on the use of gas for power generation, opening up the North Sea's vast gas reserves to a new market. A second was the privatisation two years ago of the electricity industry, which gave the regional distribution companies greater freedom to choose where to buy their power. A third was the environment. At a time when the UK is committed to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and sulphur, natural gas provides a relatively clean source of power. The fourth is economics, although the picture here is murky. The companies investing in the new power stations claim that they make good commercial sense. Mr Malcolm Faulkner, marketing director at Norweb, which is involved in two gas projects, said yesterday that they enabled Norweb to spread its risks across a wider range of fuels and technologies. Others are less sure. The Coalfield Communities Campaign, which is fighting the pit closures, calculates that many gas plants will produce more expensive electricity than the coal-fired stations they are driving out of business. The economics of gas-fired stations are complicated by the fact that British Gas, which is supplying many of them, raised its prices for long-term contracts by 25 per cent last year as the full scale of the dash for gas became clear. That means that companies that signed up early have a much better deal than the late-comers. A further complication is that the cost of generating electricity from coal does not necessarily include the huge cost of installing emission control equipment. That can add as much a 1p to the typical cost of 2.4p a kWh. Under the present price regime, electricity distribution companies are allowed to pass on the costs of power generation to their customers. Large power consumers say that gives them no incentive to go for the cheaper fuels. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, is to examine the gas contracts in a review of the electricity companies' overall supplies. He said he would look for 'a control which provides sharper incentive to economic purchasing'. Top industrial consumers are to test the government's claim that electricity prices are falling. The Major Energy Users Council, which represents the largest organisations using electricity, is to conduct a survey among its members to ascertain how prices have been moving this year. The council said many of its members did not believe statistics which showed lower electricity costs. 'Many of them have faced steep increases,' it said.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 COMPARATIVE POWER GENERATION COSTS                          (pence per kWh)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- under current contracts at Pounds 1.85 a gigajoule            2.4 Coal under new contracts at Pounds 1.50 a gigajoule           1.9 Gas                                                    2.4 to 3.2 Nuclear                                                4.0 to 8.5  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: McCloskey Coal Information  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Yeltsin's year of living dangerously: After an arduous 1992, Russia faces further pain this year if reforms are to continue Boris Yeltsin and George Bush sat bathed in the television lights in the Kremlin's St Vladimir's Hall. They had signed the Start 2 treaty cutting more nuclear missiles than anyone had done before. They assured each other of their place in history, of their triumph in making the world safer for their children. Mr Bush went off to the airport to complete the last days of what he calls his 'watch'. Mr Yeltsin now squares up to a year which promises to be as hard as any he has had to face. Even his successes, like Start 2, bring trouble: he now has to steer it through a nationalist-minded parliament, where many of the deputies see it as a sell-out to an American empire they still regard as evil. His 'friend George', as he called him, expressed faith that Russia's would be 'a future forever free': for Mr Yeltsin, the achievement of that goal will be through the hardest of pounding. It will be most severe in the economy. He has not wavered in his support for the free-market radicalism which Mr Yegor Gaidar, prime minister for much of last year, attempted to practise. He grumbled. In October, he made a speech in parliament so lukewarm in its endorsement of the government that its best line was 'any other would have been worse'. But he never seemed seriously to consider any alternative. He is aware, however, of the risks of continuing a policy so destructive to the living standards of his people: end-of-year figures show wages have risen 12-fold over the past year in nominal terms, but there has been a 20-fold rise in the consumer price index. With the exception of gas, production has plunged in every sector including oil, which last year amounted to a little more than 80 per cent of 1991's output. In his keynote speech to the December Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin sought to assure people that the state would not desert them; that he knew Russians thought it should 'accomplish more for its citizens than is customary in other countries', especially in industrial restructuring and social protection. But how, is the largest question of this year. How, without again churning out credits (curbed in the last quarter of 1992) which threaten hyperinflation? How, without closing many of the no-hoper Russian plants? How, without forcing unemployment way up from its (alarming to Russians) 1.5 per cent present level? The president and his government began last year with some prestige and could have carried through painful changes: there was some pain, but worse must follow if reform is to be pursued. Now it will come, if it does come, with a weaker productive base and a stronger opposition. Like Bush, Yeltsin wrung what solace he could from foreign triumphs: but they were a different kind of triumph. He capitalised, like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev before him, on the shrinking of Russia's power: almost everyone loves a weak Russia, which allows arms cuts, peace dividends and need no longer be feared in tracts of the world where it had dominated. Only the Soviet clients, notably Cuba, Vietnam and the radical Arab states, regret the passing of Soviet power - and they wreak what revenge they can on the defecting 'elder brother' by refusing to pay their debts. The president's foreign trips have been feted occasions for signing trade and friendship treaties, for rhetorical set pieces (such as his well-regarded address to the UK parliament in November) and for western pledges of support. Only Japan has not been wooed: so icy has it remained, indeed, that Mr Yeltsin cancelled a state visit at the last moment rather than be snubbed over Russia's continuing possession of the four Kurile Islands, which Japan insists on getting back before its economic might is turned to Russia's aid. But he has had to conduct two foreign policies: one for the world; one for the 'near abroad', or the 14 former Soviet states that are now Russia's neighbours. This has been a much larger test of his skill, one he has so far passed He himself took the heat out of many of these hotspots. He frolicked on the beach at Dagomys with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine - standing back from confrontation over the Crimean region and the Black Sea fleet. He has been able to persuade the Estonians and (to a lesser extent) Latvians to be more liberal in granting rights to the Russians who have become de facto citizens of their republics. He personally negotiated peace with the Moldovan government after war threatened to erupt between Russian speakers in that republic's Trans Dnestr area and the ethnic Moldovans. He has not bowed to the temptation to rattle his sabre at the little states, where the 25m Russians-out-of-Russia feel under threat; and he has not stinted in his support for Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the liberal and unpopular foreign minister. Keeping the peace in the former Soviet Union has been hard to do and will become harder. Many former supporters - like Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, chairman of parliament's constitutional committee, and Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov, chairman of the international affairs committee - have become hard-edged nationalists, demanding more protection for the 'foreign' Russians and support for the Slav brothers in Serbia. The Yeltsin-Kozyrev line cannot withstand many more wars on the borders - wars which, like those in the Caucasus, have now slopped over inside Russia itself. These will get worse - in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, where the shattered economies are on a war footing: perhaps in other states nervously 'at peace'. The root cause of the tensions with Ukraine were smoothed, not solved: the Crimea and the Black Sea fleet remain flashpoints, as does the Trans Dnestr and, conceivably, the many Russian areas of the Baltic states. Mr Yeltsin's best hand has been the political one. He finessed two Congresses in April and December, in both cases appearing to go down before an assault of hardliners only to snap upright again like a skittle on a spring. Most important, he sustained his reformist cabinet through the year, its very existence proclaiming that Russia was changing. He did this in spite of its unpopularity in the country and the detestation felt for it by most deputies. Though Mr Gaidar was sacrificed in the end, his reform strategy and his team have survived so far. The former premier himself, as Mr Yeltsin made clear in his new-year message, remains on the shelf waiting to be plucked down again for a future 'high post' (a comment that cannot have made Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Mr Gaidar's successor, sleep more securely). The byzantine politics which produces these switchbacks, where no outcome seems consonant with preceding events, is explicable only if one realises that the power of the Russian state still seems to hold. Whoever heads it - tsar, general-secretary or president - has been able to call on vast powers and equally vast submission: enough of both remain for Mr Yeltsin to be able to dictate the forms of government, if not always the substance. This year may be the limit for the efficacy of such power games within a nominally democratic framework. If the rudiments of a pluralistic order are not set down, there will be no alternative for Mr Yeltsin but to turn to a more authoritarian rule. That he still means to try the democratic way seems evident in his naming of April 11 as the day when the people of Russia will be asked to vote on a constitution, in which the powers of presidency, government and parliament are at last codified. Only if some form of this is accepted will the construction of a civil society be possible: only then will the leading institutions and individuals begin to feel constrained - and supported - by laws which they too easily regard as contingent on their own ambitions and positions. All politicians at his level are walkers on tightropes: but Boris Yeltsin's is higher than any other's. Where his fellow leaders generally administer settled societies, he must sit atop a state in which every institution, private and public, is being rebuilt, in which the very individuals are seeking to remake themselves. He cannot know how successful he will be. He has lived dangerously, and will not rest from doing so this year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- YELTSIN: UNFINISHED BUSINESS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Beginning of 1992: possibilities  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Consolidation of democratic institutions Price liberalisation; privatisation; financial stabilisation Convertability of the currency Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) strengthened Ratification of Start 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- End of 1992: achievements  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Presidency, government and parliament continue to work Prices for most products set freely Privatisation of shops and small workshops under way, big privatisations begun Inflation falling from mid-year peaks of nearly 30 per cent per month, budget deficit smaller in last quarter Limited convertability of rouble through twice weekly currency exchanges Start 2 signed; tactical nuclear weapons returned to Russia  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993: dangers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Referendum on new constitution in April may fail Increasing calls for price controls No plans to lift controls on energy and other prices Large-scale privatisation may be stopped or changed in favour of work collectives by parliament Voucher scheme may fail Rouble remains low against the dollar and highly inflationary No formal division yet between Russian rouble and other CIS countries' roubles Start 2 faces difficult ratification process Tension between Russia and other states likely to grow, unresolved disputes with Ukraine could again worsen relations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

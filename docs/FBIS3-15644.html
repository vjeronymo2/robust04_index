Volodin; place and  date not given: "The Crimean Party of Interethnic Trust Finds  Supporters Not Only in the Crimea" -- first two paragraphs are  O. Volodin commentary]    [Text] Recently, the Political Council of the Crimean Party  of Interethnic Trust [KPMD] came forward with an initiative that  deserves our attention and support. The essence of this  initiative is that the activities of the political parties and  movements in the Crimea and outside of it should be coordinated  on the principles of interethnic and civil accord. Permanent  meetings of these parties and movements in their joint  headquarters in the Crimea could become one of the mechanisms  for the implementation of this idea. We queried KPMD Chairman  Boris Sergeevich Balayan on their initiative.    [Volodin] Boris Sergeevich, what specific parties and public  movements would you like to invite to participate in the Crimean  "roundtable"?    [Balayan] Like-minded people, those political parties that  do  not simply speak about the principles of interethnic and civil  accord and about peace but consequently look for opportunities  to implement such noble principles. We negotiate, for example,  with the party of "Russian Unity and Accord," headed by Sergey  Shakhray, and with the popular political association in Ukraine  headed by Vladimir Grinev and Leonid Kuchma. Besides, there are  parties that advocate our principles in other parts of the Black  Sea region, and in the states which are motherlands for many of  Crimeans of various nationalities. These are Armenia, Greece,  Bulgaria, Germany, and many other countries.    [Volodin] The CSCE deals with the issues of keeping peace in  the European home, there are many organizations which deal with  the economy, science, and culture of many countries. How can  you justify the creation of one more center in the Crimea?    [Balayan] Our idea was not born in an empty place. The  Crimea can claim the establishment of such a center on its  geographical location, and historical traditions; we proceed  from the task of turning our peninsula into a connecting link  between the neighboring states, the region of peace and accord.    Independent experts and scientists -- who are not usually  engaged in political competition -- could draft scientific  recommendations, a sort of code of rules on how to pursue a  civilized policy for statesmen and political leaders at the  meetings of parties of various ethnic membership. Of course,  joint consultations of political scientists from Russia,  Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and other states of the Black Sea region  could help analyze the developments and foresee the future. In  other words, we could prevent many negative conflicts so that we  do not act "in a hurry," as it has been common for us until now.    Finally, the setting up of such a permanent international  body in the Crimea would objectively widen our economic,  cultural, and social relations with a wide range of states as an  answer to common interests.    [Volodin] Do you believe in the success of your idea?    [Balayan] Not only because we should believe in the eternal  good. Our proposals have already met with the understanding of  like-minded people from the interethnic parties outside the  Crimea. I hope that the new Crimean president will pay attention  to our proposal.</p>

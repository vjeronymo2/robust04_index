			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government secures majority over Labour backbench amendment LAST NIGHT the government secured a majority of 195 (275-80) to defeat a Labour backbench amendment to prevent Britain joining other members of the EC in January next year in the second stage of economic and monetary union, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, denied that entry into stage two would imply acceptance of stage three, involving the creation of a single European currency and a central European bank. During stage two, he said, monetary policy would remain the responsibility of national governments. He gave an assurance that provisions in the Maastricht treaty ensured that the Bank of England retained its present condition indefinitely 'unless and until we choose to move to stage three'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text of the statement of the CIS Council of Heads of State </F> on the conflict in Nagornyy Karabakh and surrounding territories]    [Text] Taking into consideration the statements of heads  of state of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of  Armenia on the steps being undertaken by them with respect to  cessation of military operations, the CIS Council of Heads of  State acknowledges that the Nagornyy Karabakh conflict is  causing irreparable losses to the Azerbaijani and Armenian  peoples and to the economy and ecology of a large region in the  Transcaucasus, and that it affects vital interests of other CIS  members and the Commonwealth as a whole.    The CIS Council of Heads of States supports the efforts of  Commonwealth member states aimed at a lasting political  settlement of the conflict, including persistent peacekeeping  initiatives by the Russian Federation, and welcomes the  mediating mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS  member countries.    The CIS Council of Heads of States reaffirms its desire to  facilitate in every way a search for the only  possible--compromise--solution. The main priority and imperative  for the settlement is an immediate cease-fire, an end to all  military operations and following that, its firm reinforcement.  Without this, we cannot proceed to eliminate the consequences of  the tragic conflict.    The CIS Council of Heads of States calls on the  international  community, the CSCE, and the United Nations to support the steps  being undertaken by the CIS in the interests of settling the  conflict.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: British Dredging A virtually static second six months left British Dredging, the building materials supplier, with profits of Pounds 2.47m pre-tax for 1991, a 28 per cent downturn on last year's Pounds 3.45m. The figures were helped by exceptional credits this time of Pounds 504,000. Turnover declined from Pounds 34.9m to Pounds 32.6m. A maintained final dividend of 4.8p makes a same-again 7.4p total.</p>

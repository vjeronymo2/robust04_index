Lomonosov; PACS 42.79Qx; 42.68.Wt]    [Abstract] Construction of a Doppler wind lidar using a TEA  (transverse excitation atmospheric pressure) pulsed  single-frequency CO[.sub]2[/] injection laser for coherent  reception and processing of data on winds in the lower  atmospheric layers at altitudes up to 15 km. The design of such  a lidar is based on the fundamental equation relating the  signal-to-noise ratio to parameters of the sounding radiation  pulses and of the atmospheric medium, the solution to this  equation indicating the amount of energy needed for a sounding  radiation pulse to reach the desired altitude. A laser set of  this type with automatic ultraviolet preionization features both  simplicity and reliability. Its one drawback is the sweeping of  the emission frequency caused by presence of discharge electrons  in the active medium, resonance polarization of CO[.sub]2[/]  molecules, and acoustic expansion of heated gas. This sweep is  best measured by optical heterodyning with radiation of a  continuous-wave single-frequency reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser  and subsequent mixing the two signals in a HgCdTe photodetector  for processing with the aid of an analog-to-digital converter.  The results of these measurements were used for optimizing the  composition of the active medium so as to ensure both minimum  width of the emission band and maximum emission energy. The  active medium, a CO[.sub]2[/]:N[.sub]2[/]:He = 1.5:2.5:6  mixture is confined inside a typically 5 m long linear resonator  cavity, this cavity being formed by a spherical mirror with a  typically 18 m radius and a germanium wedge. The cavity contains  also a NaCl wedge through which an external signal is injected  into the active medium and through which some laser radiation is  extracted for mode locking. Mode locking is achieved by noting  the instant of time at which the frequency of the injected  signal coincides with the frequency of the natural cavity mode  and at that instant initiating a discharge in the TEA  compartment. This instant can be recorded by a signal peak  detector as corresponding to the maximum intensity on the  interference pattern, with the cavity mirror oscillating  harmonically at a frequency of typically 180 Hz. Such a TEA  CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and a telescope were included in the  prototype of a Doppler wind lidar, also a continuous-wave  reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and a HgCdTe photodetector with  an output amplifier, a DVK-2 computer, and a CAMAC crate. A  model needed for determination of the signal scattering in the  atmosphere is based on the following premises: 1. scattering is  done by a large number of arbitrarily located identical aerosol  particles moving at the wind velocity, 2. atmospheric turbulence  influences only the wavefront of backscattered radiation, 3.  signal attenuation in the atmosphere obeys Bouger's law. With  this lidar were measured wind velocities along horizontal and  vertical paths, whereupon he data were used for calculating wind  velocity profiles and their dispersions.

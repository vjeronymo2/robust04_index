			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROOM FALCONER -- CIRCA 1903 BY NORMAN DUBIE  </P> <P> Out walking along the river  </P> <P> I still saw the fever with her children  </P> <P> At supper in the coal light. Snow falling,  </P> <P> I climbed up through the wood  </P> <P> To the asylum to visit with Sister  </P> <P> In the locked ward. But hesitated  </P> <P> And went to the cottage to see the insomniac  </P> <P> Rich child who sits naked at the window:  </P> <P> Last night, in kerosene light, her back  </P> <P> Had a quality of milkglass. She curls  </P> <P> In the chair.  </P> <P> Her knees under chin, the room black --  </P> <P> The light at the window is all  </P> <P> Moon and snow. She is at it again:  </P> <P> With the nail of the little finger  </P> <P> She has flayed  </P> <P> The thumb of the same hand;  </P> <P> All but the little finger arthritic  </P> <P> With the procedure: the raw thumb  </P> <P> White like a boiled egg  </P> <P> In an upturned palm; the dead skin,  </P> <P> Bits of shell, not polished by hen straw.  </P> <P> Beyond the window there is a sudden  </P> <P> Convulsion of wind in the blue spruce,  </P> <P> Boughs dumping snow. I imagine  </P> <P> The brass makeweights that lift the other pan,  </P> <P> Of this past summer, dust and pollen  </P> <P> Rising around oxslaughter. A shudder  </P> <P> Passes through the child, taking  </P> <P> Her attention:  </P> <P> She cuts herself for the first time, a trickle  </P> <P> Of blood at the knuckle of the thumb  </P> <P> Like the single red thread  </P> <P> Through the lace hood and jesses  </P> <P> Of the medici falcons.  </P> <P> Her concentration broken, the hand  </P> <P> Loosens: one wing, one stone.  </P> <P> The sun is seeping over the snow.  </P> <P> She greets me with an acknowledgement  </P> <P> One reserves for a ghost.  </P> <P> From "Groom Falconer" (W.W. Norton: $17.95; 62 pp.) 1989 Norman Dubie. Born in  Vermont in 1945, Dubie now lives in Tempe, Ariz., with his wife and their  daughter and teaches at Arizona State University.

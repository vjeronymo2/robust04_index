			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- A number of scholars  Tuesday [31 May] blasted Taiwan Power Company's [Taipower]  decision to increase the generating capacity of the proposed  fourth nuclear power plant as "irresponsibly against the law."    At a hearing hosted by Kuomintang legislator Wang  Shih-hsiung, Prof. Kao Cheng-yen of National Taiwan University  said that Taipower's decision to increase the generating  capacity of the King- liao plant from the originally proposed 1  million kilowatts to 1.3 million kilowatts without notifying the  government and the public was a violation of the law that allows  the building and budgeting of only a 1 million-kilowatt nuclear  facility.    Prof. Wang Tu-fa of National Chunghsing University added  that  Taipower failed to present an environmental-impact assessment  before it decided to enlarge the plant's generating capacity.  [word indistinct] Yung-jen, an official with the Department of  Health, said an environmental-impact assessment report is vital  because the 1 million kilowatt plant will increase the  temperature of seawater near the Kung-liao plant by only 2.8  degrees centigrade, but if the generating capacity of the plant  is increased to 1.3 million kilowatts, the seawater temperature  will rise by 3.16 degrees, which he said would be a costly blow  to the coastal area's ecological system.    The greater generating capacity would also mean larger  governmental expenditures and greater social costs, Ko  Cheng-yen, the vice chairman of the Taiwan Environmental  Protection Union, said.    In response to the criticism, Taipower Chairman Chang  Chung-chien said the 1.3 million-kilowatt reactor is less prone  to accidents than the 1 million-kilowatt reactor, and produces a  lower level of radiation and less nuclear waste.    Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien, who was also  present  at the hearing, disagreed that Taipower's increased capacity  plan is illegal, saying that the original proposal for the  fourth nuclear power plant had a capacity "ranging from 900,000  kilowatts to 1.35- million kilowatts.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHOMEINI SAYS AUTHOR OF 'SATANIC VERSES' SHOULD BE KILLED  </P> <P> As anger over an allegedly blasphemous novel continued to gather force in the  Islamic world, Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said  Tuesday that the author and publishers of the book should be killed.  </P> <P> Tehran Radio said Khomeini issued a statement saying in part: "I inform the  proud Muslim people of the world that the author of 'The Satanic Verses,' a  book which is against Islam, the prophet and the Koran, and all those involved  in its publication who were aware of its content, are hereby sentenced to  death."  </P> <P> Author Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British citizen, told the British  Broadcasting Corp. that he takes Khomeini's threat "very seriously indeed." Not  long afterward, he was reported to be in hiding and under police protection  somewhere outside London.  </P> <P> The London offices of his publishers, the Penguin Group, were also under police  guard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outraged Responses  </P> <P> What Khomeini called a "sentence of death" was the latest in a series of  outraged responses to the "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> Although few in the Muslim world say they have read the prize-winning  allegorical novel about Britain's treatment of its colonial subjects, the book  has provoked widespread outrage. In Britain, where the book was first  published, there have been public book burnings in areas that have large Muslim  communities.  </P> <P> The book has been banned in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South  Africa. In the United States and Britain, Islamic militants have called for it  to be withdrawn from the market and for Rushdie to publicly ask "forgiveness  from Almighty Allah for the great insult which he has brought up."  </P> <P> Publication of the book in the United States sparked two days of rioting in  Muslim areas of India and Pakistan. Over the weekend, demonstrators stoned the  U.S. Cultural Center in Islamabad and five people were killed when riot police  fired at the demonstrators. An Indian was killed Monday at a demonstration in  Srinagar, India, where protests continued Tuesday. Khomeini was quoted as  saying Tuesday that "The Satanic Verses" was written and published "in  opposition to Islam."  </P> <P> "I call on all zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever they find  them, so that no one will dare to insult Islamic sanctity," Tehran Radio quoted  him as saying. "Whoever is killed doing this will be regarded as a martyr and  will go directly to heaven."  </P> <P> The Iranian government declared today a day of national mourning to protest  against the decision to publish "poisonous and insulting subject matter  concerning Islam, the Koran and the blessed prophet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tour Being Reconsidered  </P> <P> Followers of Islam believe that the Prophet Mohammed is God's messenger on  Earth and that the Koran, Islam's holy book, consists of revelations from the  Almighty as given to Mohammed.  </P> <P> In London, a spokesman for Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken, said a planned book  promotion tour of the United States, scheduled to begin later this week, is now  under review.  </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe expressed his "very real concern," and  the British government was generally adopting a cautious stance on the threat  to Rushdie, for fear of jeopardizing the safety of a British citizen imprisoned  in Tehran as an alleged spy.  </P> <P> Iranian Information Minister Mohammed Mohammedi-Reyshahri was quoted by the  official news agency IRNA as saying that a court has completed its proceedings  against British businessman Roger Cooper, held since December, 1985, and had  imposed a "heavy sentence" on him. The minister added, without elaborating,  that final judgment is still under consideration.  </P> <P> Britain and Iran resumed diplomatic relations last November, and the British  authorities had hoped that Cooper might be released as part of an amnesty  announced to mark last week's 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution.  </P> <P> Despite expressing concern about the danger to his life, Rushdie, in his  interview with the BBC, was not in a mood to back down.  </P> <P> "Obviously, at a personal level it's very worrying," the 41-year-old,  Bombay-born author said in a brief film clip shown on the BBC and Independent  Television News here Tuesday night. "But I think, beyond that, it shows this is  a later stage in a campaign which began with smears and vilifications and  distortions of the book which has escalated to all sorts of levels of violence.  And, frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book.  </P> <P> "A religion that is able to behave like this -- religious leaders, let's say,  who are able to behave like this -- and then say that this is a religion that  must be above any kind of whisper of criticism; I mean, that doesn't add up. It  seems to me that Islamic fundamentalists could do with a little criticism right  now."  </P> <P> In a statement distributed Tuesday evening, Penguin's Viking unit, whose  trademark appears on the British and U.S. editions of Rushdie's novel,  commented: "Neither we nor the author of this novel published the book with  intent to offend. We very much regret the distress the book has caused."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tragic Loss of Life'  </P> <P> Referring to six people killed in anti-Rushdie demonstrations, the Viking  statement said, "We are appalled at the tragic loss of life that has already  occurred and deplore calls to future violence."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Penguin Group confirmed that it has stepped up its security  precautions after the Khomeini threat. The spokesman refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> The threat to Rushdie is being taken seriously. Britain has about a million  Muslims among its 55 million people, and they have been an increasingly  militant minority.  </P> <P> The People's Moujahedeen of Iran, a dissident exile group, called Khomeini's  action "absurd" and "hysterical."  </P> <P> Rushdie, who was born in Bombay but came to Britain as a 14-year-old schoolboy,  has described himself as a lapsed Muslim but insists that his book is not  intended to be anti-religious. A British reviewer termed it "a sort of 'Last  Temptation of Mohammed,' " in the spirit of the controversial Greek novel and  American film, "The Last Temptation of Christ."  </P> <P> Rushdie said in an interview last Sunday with the Guardian newspaper that he  was "very upset" by the deaths that resulted from demonstrations against his  book in Pakistan. However, he said: "The deaths are not on my conscience. I am  a writer trying to deal with real issues. I have not arranged any marches on  embassies or arranged for shots to be fired. . . . I am completely horrified.  The idea that people should directly or indirectly be dead as a result of (the  book) is hard to believe."  </P> <P> Wallace reported from Nicosia and Fisher from London.  </P></p>

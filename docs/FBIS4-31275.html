			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "SAR": "A Sluggish Campaign; Not Much Time Left </F> Before Self-Government Elections"]    [Text] On 19 September [date as published], local  communities will elect 52,000 local council members. Research  conducted so far indicates that the level of interest shown in  the elections is not too high, especially in rural areas and  small towns.    It is precisely in those areas that the deadline for  registering electoral lists has been postponed because there  were no volunteers to be candidates to the gmina [small  administrative unit] councils. It seems that coalition  politicians are showing moderate interest in the election  campaign and that they leave its implementation up to local  activists. Most probably they thought that they had carried out  all possible propaganda measures for the sake of their parties  earlier in the Sejm. On the other hand, the efforts of  extraparliamentary right-wing parties are concentrated precisely  on the elections and on warning the voters against an impending  disaster which, according to those right-wing parties, a  potential postcommunist victory would be.    Kazimierz M. Ujazdowski, leader of the Conservative  Coalition, says that the left-wing program is directed against  self-government, while a left-wing victory in the elections may  mean a return to power of people with shameful pasts. He added  that the main goal of the right-wing camp in the communal  elections is to prevent postcommunist forces from taking over  local authority in Poland and an effective fight with the  policies of gmina socialism. These declarations are  characteristic of the election campaign being conducted by the  right wing.    Donald Tusk, deputy chairman of the opposition Freedom Union  [UW], is less emphatic in his warnings against the dangers of  policies of the governing coalition, and he assures that UW will  become a party that will be able to stop state-controlled  socialism, which is resurgent in Poland today, while, in the  self-government elections, UW will demonstrate it can achieve  victory instead of just declaring ideas that are correct and  wise.    Janusz Korwin-Mikke, leader of the Union of Real Politics,  has decided to present a specific program in the campaign, which  his local council members promise to implement in the gminas in  which they expect to score a victory. He is calling for a  repeal of the inheritance tax [podatek spadkowy] and an  enfranchisement of residents of communal apartments. All  religions of the world unanimously prohibit robbing widows and  orphans. The inheritance tax is nothing but an outright  immorality, says Korwin-Mikke.    The Democratic Left Alliance, as Aleksander Kwasniewski said  recently, wants to score electoral success through persistent  implementation of the electoral program, which is about striving  for political stabilization, a reform of social policies that  entails an active battle against unemployment, and using the  international situation for Poland's joining European  organizations. A majority of electoral programs by parties and  coalitions has been voicing slogans that are equally abstract  and hardly intelligible to the voters.</p>

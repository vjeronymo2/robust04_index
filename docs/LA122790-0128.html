			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOPPERS FLEE FIRE, FEAR GRIPS MERCHANTS;  </P> <P> STUDIO CITY: HUNDREDS STARE AT WRECKAGE OF DESTROYED AND DAMAGED STORES AND  MURMURS ABOUT ARSON ARE HEARD.  </P> <P> A fortune in guitars and a neighborhood atmosphere went up in smoke Wednesday  in Studio City, leaving an aftermath of blackened ruins and baffled suspicion.  </P> <P> The day began like any other in the strip just west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard,  with shoppers roaming the quaint storefronts and diners crammed into delis.  Moviegoers took in a matinee of "The Russia House."  </P> <P> The fire brought smoke and screams. Families with small children ran and  frightened pedestrians rushed into restaurants. Shoppers coughed in the smoke.  Overheated windows in burning buildings exploded glass into the street.  </P> <P> Employees of a nearby supermarket scrambled onto their roof, one with a fire  extinguisher, another with a camera.  </P> <P> When it was over, hundreds of people stared at the wreckage of destroyed and  damaged stores, whispering rumors about firebombs and arson and gasoline cans.  </P> <P> Al Carness, co-owner of Valley Arts Guitars, lamented the loss of approximately  400 guitars that he said were worth about $600,000. Many of them were custom  made for well-known musicians, he said.  </P> <P>  He was able to save only one guitar -- a Les Paul model signed by many famous  studio players.  </P> <P> Other than that, "We lost everything up there," said Mark Simon, the store's  purchasing manager. "We didn't have time to save anything. The smoke just  started pouring in. We had to save ourselves."  </P> <P> As he talked with an insurance adjuster, Carness said he was not sure when the  store would reopen. He said he will spend the next couple of days counting  inventory.  </P> <P> "Counting melted picks," said his wife, Fern.  </P> <P> "I feel all right about it," Carness said. "I've had lots of ups and downs. We  can always rebuild and no one was hurt." He pinched the bridge of his nose as  if to stop himself from crying.  </P> <P> As the cleanup began, many pedestrians, apparently content that the trouble had  passed, resumed shopping and eating. But some merchants and shoppers, and  residents who live around the strip, wondered who could have brought this havoc  on one of the last neighborhood-oriented strips on busy Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> "You know what really scares me?" asked Claire Heimler of Hollywood, an  onlooker who had been on her way to an after-Christmas sale at Strouds Linen  Warehouse, one of the stores destroyed.  </P> <P> "I keep looking in the faces of people who are passing by, trying to figure out  who did it. I mean, I would guess that the person would have stayed here. Who  would do something like this and not stay to see it?"  </P> <P> Heimler said she has been shopping on the strip for about 32 years, "when half  the stores that are here now weren't here." She said she enjoyed the quaintness  and hospitality of the area.  </P> <P> "I'll still keep coming here, but it's a little scary," she said.  </P> <P> Some expressed anger. Larry Foster, 47, a hotel designer who lives around the  corner from the stores, said he was pruning roses in his front yard when he saw  the flames above Strouds.  </P> <P> "This is such a quiet neighborhood, but it's changing, and this causes me a lot  of concern," said Foster, who has lived in his house for 10 years. "Now there's  lots of graffiti and homeless walking around. This fire doesn't make me want to  move. I guess something like this could have happened on Rodeo Drive.  </P> <P> "But it does make you think. L.A has sure changed."  </P> <P> Angela Schmeltzer, 17, a waitress at Weby's Dely and Bakery, located across the  street from the fire scene, said she was frightened.  </P> <P> "This makes me more scared, and people are getting paranoid around here," she  said. A nearby newsstand had been robbed the day before, she said, "and folks  around here don't know what's going to happen. If this can happen in the  daytime, then anything can."  </P> <P> The concerns of other onlookers were more personal. Susan Genelin, an artist  and activist with the Sierra Club, anxiously craned her neck in the direction  of Mrs. Fields Cookies, hoping to see her 18-year-old daughter, who works at  the store.  </P> <P> "I was driving along the Hollywood Freeway when I heard about the fire," she  said. "At first, I thought it was in Fryman Canyon, which the Sierra Club has  fought very hard to save, and I was terrified. Then I heard it was on Ventura  Boulevard in Studio City, and I was even more scared because of my daughter."  </P> <P> Genelin later learned from a firefighter that no one in the cookie store had  been injured. "He said that's everything's OK, and that's good enough for me,"  she said.  </P> <P> "But this is so unsettling. Everyone will be scared to come down here now."  </P> <P> Staff Writer Michael Connelly contributed to this story.  </P></p>

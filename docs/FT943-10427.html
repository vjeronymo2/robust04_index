			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Taiwan fishing row ends Taiwan and China resolved a long-standing fishery dispute yesterday as supporters of Taiwanese independence burnt a Chinese flag (right) outside the building where the agreement was reached, Reuter reports from Taipei. The two rivals could sign their first accord in six rounds of talks when the meetings end next week. The breakthrough came on the first of four days' talks. China conceded Taiwan's demand that fishing disputes involving intrusions into each other's territorial waters should be handled by agencies with law enforcement powers, officials said. On Tuesday, China sent a letter to Taiwan, complaining that Taipei's military had opened fire on Chinese fishing boats when they entered waters around the Taiwan-held island of Quemoy, killing or injuring mainland fishermen. Talks over the next three days are expected to focus on repatriation of hijackers and illegal immigrants.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I can't believe people in charge of "Julie &amp; Carol: Together Again" think  that a pie/cake in the face routine is funny today.  </P> <P> It isn't. It is incredible that two such wonderful performers who have such  combustion together would agree to such stupid direction. I was looking forward  to their special and it was a pleasure to see both Julie Andrews and Carol  Burnett but certainly not with the routines they were expected to perform. The  entire show was boring, ridiculous and devoid of humor.  </P> <P> Renee Jones, Granada Hills  </P></p>

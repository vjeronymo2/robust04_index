			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Selling parts of the Body to gratify their souls Gordon and Anita Roddick yesterday sold 3.5m shares in Body Shop International at 240p in order to help two projects dear to their hearts. Of the Pounds 8.4m raised, Pounds 2.1m will go to the development of an inhaler for the alleviation of cold and hay fever symptoms and Pounds 2m towards a film project on indigenous peoples. The company said yesterday that, after tax, the remaining money would give the couple 'a little headroom' for further projects which they are backing. The sale reduced the number of shares held by Ms Roddick, group managing director, to 24.01m and by Mr Roddick, chairman, to 24.2m, giving them a joint stake of 25.4 per cent. The company said the Roddicks had not sold any shares for a number of years. The inhaler - to be known as Virotherm - will use a steam-based therapy to help cold and hay fever sufferers. Its development is being undertaken by The Healthcare Foundation, which Anita Roddick helped to set up in 1987 with Michael Grade and Richard Branson. Its first project was Mates condoms. Separately, the Roddicks guaranteed the bank funding of Millennium: Tribal Wisdom and the Modern World, a television series shown in the UK last year and in North America in 1992. Marketing of the film and the book continues, but any future revenues will revert to Body Shop International. The company stressed yesterday that the Roddicks would receive no financial benefit from either project and did not expect to recover their contributions.</p>

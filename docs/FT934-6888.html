			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Lloyd's agrees payment scheme The governing council at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, yesterday ratified in principle the structure for a settlement of legal claims by loss-making Names, the individuals whose assets underwrite the market. No public announcement was made because a number of details must still be finalised including the exact size of the settlement to be offered and its timing. It is understood, however, that errors-and-omissions insurers, who cover agents against legal awards for negligence, recently agreed to contribute at least Pounds 300m to a deal. Agents in the market have been asked to provide information to the council by Wednesday on the exposure of individual loss-making Names in past underwriting years. Meanwhile, talks continued on the future of two troubled syndicates managed by Merrett Underwriting Agency Management, which in turn could threaten the Merrett Group. Efforts have so far proved unsuccessful to persuade members' agents to provide sufficient new capacity to Merrett's two biggest syndicates, 418 and 1067. The syndicates' problems were aggravated last week by the collapse of a deal under which Travelers, the US insurance company, would have offered support to Merrett. This could mean the two syndicates are too small for their members to write business in 1994. Agents were believed late last week to be offering Pounds 32m or Pounds 33m compared with this year's figure of Pounds 150m and an estimated minimum requirement of Pounds 50m.</p>

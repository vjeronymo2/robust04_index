			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Garza's Cuban venture gives his empire a new look - The Mexican businessman is planning to invest about Dollars 2.2bn in the island's telephone system From his modest offices above a Citibank branch in Monterrey, Mexico, Mr Javier Garza Calderon casually explains how he and his partners plan to invest about Dollars 10bn in Mexico and Cuba over the next few years. About Dollars 2.2bn will be spent on Cuba's national telephone system, 49 per cent of which he bought a couple of weeks ago. Another Dollars 4.2bn will be invested in telecommunications and television in Mexico. The rest will go in mobile energy plants for Mexican businesses, toxic and non-toxic waste dumps, water treatment plants, and other environmental projects. Such talk may seem fanciful, but Mr Garza has plenty of money and is politically well-connected. He is a member of the wealthy Garza family of Monterrey, and he and his father recently sold their 47 per cent stake in Grupo Visa, one of Mexico's largest conglomerates, for a reported Dollars 400m. They disposed of 28 supermarkets, other real estate and agriculture assets, and sold their interest in a cellular telephone company for a reported Dollars 100m. 'We decided to get out of mature markets that my family was in and invest in new-age industries,' explains the 44-year-old Mr Garza. He says his Grupo Domos has about Dollars 1bn of capital, much of which appears to be in cash. Mr Garza has something to prove. He and his father sold the stake in Visa after losing a takeover battle with their cousin, Mr Eugenio Garza Laguera. The two failed to obtain Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), bidding slightly less than the winner (a group led by Mr Carlos Slim) when the utility was privatised. Some suggest Mr Garza is throwing his money around to show that he can be as successful as some of his relatives. 'He is desperate to put his footprint on the Monterrey scene,' says an executive with a rival family company. 'Right now he is just known for being his father's son and a friend of the president.' Mr Garza is looking for partners in his businesses, to provide both equity and expertise. He has signed joint ventures with Houston-based Browning Ferries Industries (BFI), the world's second-largest waste management company; BellSouth, in wireless telephone systems; Southern Pacific, in a private telephone network; and expects to announce soon his partner or partners for a long-distance telephone service. 'What we provide is experience in doing business in Mexico, relations with the public and private sector, knowledge of the labour market which goes back 100 years, and capital,' says Mr Garza. He adds that he has about 200 to 300 people working with him, but says he cannot recall the exact number because the business is growing so fast. The Cuba investment is perhaps the most ambitious. Mr Garza says he first considered doing business in Cuba about four years ago. In January this year, when Iusacell, a Mexican telecommunications company, pulled out of a deal to buy a stake in Emtel, Cuba's telephone company, he agreed to take its place. Grupo Domos agreed to pay Dollars 1.44bn for 49 per cent of the company, of which about Dollars 200m will be obtained in a swap deal liquidating Cuba's debt with Mexico. Domos will invest another Dollars 734m over seven years in modernising the company, a sum to be matched by Emtel. Domos hopes this month to sell 49 per cent of its stake to a foreign partner. Three European companies and one Canadian company have shown interest. Mr Garza claims revenues from international telephone calls will pay for his investment. He says such calls generate about Dollars 400m a year, but will increase once the US, as agreed in principle, lifts the ban on dollar payments to Cuba for telephone calls, and when, as promised, a fibre-optic cable is built between Florida and Cuba. Currently most calls between the US and Cuba are made via Canada. Domos and Emtel promise to install about 1m new telephone lines within seven years, more than double the existing number. Mr Garza says the company will use so-called personal communications systems (PCS), or cellular wireless technology, when installing the lines, which will cut sharply the cost of local networks. 'Cuba will be the first country in the America to have PCS,' he claims. In Mexico, Mr Garza is confident there is room for at least three telecommunications companies the size of Telmex. If given regulatory go-ahead, he plans to invest Dollars 2.5bn in building a long-distance network to compete with Telmex, Dollars 1.2bn in establishing a personal communications system, and another Dollars 340m in building a private network alongside Mexico's railway tracks. Undeterred that at least half a dozen other companies have similar plans, Mr Garza says he is willing to work with rivals. He is in talks about joining forces with Pulsar and Alfa, two Monterrey companies controlled by relatives. He says he is discussing with other rivals ways of avoiding duplicating their investments by sharing cables. After talking about his investments for several hours, Mr Garza compares himself to Isaac Garza, his great grandfather who began what became the Monterrey group, once Mexico's largest industrial concern. Mr Garza has yet to run a large company, and his businesses are mostly plans, but there can be little doubt he is thinking big.</p>

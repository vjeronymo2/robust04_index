			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINDING COMMON GROUND TO END MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS  </P> <P> How hopeful it is to find side-by-side articles by (former) Israeli Gen.  Harkabi and high-ranking Palestinian Hassan -- and to find them in such close  agreement! But Hassan made one disturbing statement.  </P> <P> Defining justice he wrote, "Justice for us is to have a homeland; justice for  the Jews is to live in peace." To my senses this difference is more significant  than mere nuance. Why not say squarely that justice for the Palestinians is to  have a homeland and live in peace; justice for the Jews is to have a homeland  and live in peace!  </P> <P> JAMES SCHERR  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

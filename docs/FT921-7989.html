			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Turkish coalition ready for tax fight A CONTROVERSIAL proposal offering Turkish businessmen a tax amnesty is set for a bumpy ride when it goes before parliament today. The bill, under which all legal action against corporate and individual tax offenders would be dropped, is seen as the first real test of the government's economic programme, and a challenge to Turkey's fragile two-party coalition. The proposal will allow the Finance Ministry to waive the backlog of tax disputes and concentrate on this year's tax collection. Officials hope it will encourage businesses and wealthy individuals to declare their tax liabilities, a move which should boost tax revenues and help the government to reduce the budget deficit, which in 1991 was running at 11 per cent of GNP and is one of the main causes of Turkey's 70 per cent annual inflation rate. On Tuesday the prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, attacked those opposed to the tax amnesty, including deputies from his own True Path party, who last week joined opposition politicians calling for amendments to the bill. The amnesty has been criticised as favouring the wealthy friends of politicians and raises issues of official propriety at a time when the government is publicly investigating corruption charges against the former administration. Turkey remains one of the least taxed economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Economists are calling for more radical measures. The budget forecasts a 13 per cent real rise in tax revenue, but without further reform the target may be hard to achieve.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Andreotti coalition risks collapse THE new government of Italy's caretaker prime minister, Mr Giulio Andreotti, is threatened with collapse even before it presents itself before parliament tomorrow after the decision by the small Republican party not to endorse it, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The upset, which is without precedent even by the eventful standards of Italian coalition-building, follows the sharp downgrading of the Republicans' ministerial representation in Mr Andreotti's new government unveiled on Friday. Last night the leaders of the party, a member of the five-party ruling coalition since the early 1980s, decided by 40 votes to five not to back Mr Andreotti in parliament - although Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the party secretary, said this did not necessarily mean a vote against Mr Andreotti. The decision triggered meetings between President Francesco Cossiga and party leaders in an attempt to resolve the crisis. It is now open to question whether Mr Andreotti will try to soldier on with a four-party coalition or let someone else attempt to form a government. Leaders of his Christian Democratic party, Italy's biggest, said they did not favour a four-party coalition and wished to avoid early elections.</p>

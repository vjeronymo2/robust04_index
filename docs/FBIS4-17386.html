			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 22 April TASS -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  began his official visit to Kyrgyzstan on Friday [22 April].  The guest arrived from Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] to Bishkek in the  evening, and was met by Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev, Prime  Minister Apas Amumagulov and other officials in the "Manas"  airport. Then the motorcade proceeded to the suburban  governmental residence "Ala-Archa."    Among the items included in Li Peng's three-day visit are  meetings with the leadership of Kyrgyzstan and the signing of  several inter-governmental agreements on commercial and cultural  cooperation. These documents are designed to strengthen the  already significant legal basis for bilateral relations between  the two countries. They have already signed approximately 40  treaties, agreements and protocols in the last two years.    President Askar Akayev visited Beijing in January 1993. Li  Peng's return visit, planned for that spring, was delayed due to  his health problems.</p>

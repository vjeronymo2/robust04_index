In a predeparture statement, he said he will participate in  the PLO Executive Committee meetings to discuss the  repercussions of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which he  described as extremely serious.    We cannot imagine that the situation in the occupied  territories will remain as it was before, he said.    Sha'th added: When we said that the real obstacle to peace  is the settlements and the settlers, the Israelis insisted that  Palestinian extremists, so they claim, are trying to abort the  peace process. The massacre has shown who in fact is the  aggressor and who is the victim. The settlement activity is a  flagrant and continuing act of aggression; it is an illegitimate  usurpation of the occupied territories and a Judaization of the  land.    Sha'th stressed that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a  major blow to the peace process and an attempt to foil it.    We will discuss how to protect the Palestinian people in  light of the international developments, and we will ask the  world to ensure international protection for the Palestinian  people through use of UN forces and observers, Sha'th said.    He said the PLO will ask the world to force Israel to disarm  the settlers.    For the peace process to move ahead, Sha'th said, protection  and security for the Palestinian people must be provided until  the Palestinian forces take over full responsibility for the  usurped land.    On transferring the negotiations to Washington, Sha'th said  this is not a magical solution following the massacre. He  added: The Cairo negotiations were not the reason for the  massacre; on the contrary, the Egyptian leadership hosted and  greatly supported the talks, and we were close to signing an  agreement and starting the Israeli withdrawal. I believe that a  transfer of the talks will waste some time.    Sha'th said that the United States must pressure Israel to  achieve a just peace with the Palestinians.</p>

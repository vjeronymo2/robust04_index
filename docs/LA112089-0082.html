			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> 15-Year Home-Stake Case Ends: A federal judge in Tulsa, Okla., ordered five  former officers of Home-Stake Production Co. to pay more than $127 million in  damages to 1,600 people -- including several celebrities -- who were bilked.  The case was initiated when the oil drilling tax shelter went sour in 1974, and  the judgment brought down the curtain on prosecution of one of the largest  Ponzi scheme cases ever. There were originally 39 defendants in the case, but  some settled in 1982 and 1984.  </P></p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (2): New routes to investment - Manufacturing industries have made the economy more resilient FOR MANY years, Tohoku's greatest contribution to the Japanese economic miracle was its people, who left the region in thousands to find work in the industrial heartland of Japan, which stretches from Tokyo to Osaka. Otherwise Tohoku was a scenic spot, rather difficult to get to, and filled with farmers, fishermen and loggers. Completion of the Shinkansen rail express to Sendai in 1982, and later to Morioka, and the gradual expansion of the highway network, however, made parts of Tohoku an attractive area for investment, particularly as the cost of land rose sharply in the Kanto region while the supply of labour became more constrained. As a result, in the late 1980s, Tohoku enjoyed a surge of investment, particularly in the semiconductor and electronics industries, which spread south from Tokyo into Fukushima and Miyaga prefectures. Tohoku Electric Power, the region's electric utility, claims that over 30 per cent of Japan's high-technology production facilities are now located in Tohoku. The trend is clear, and a wide range of well-known technology companies have recently set up shop in the region, including NEC, Fujitsu, Nikon, Pioneer, Sony, Hitachi, and Motorola. These facilities, however, are still linked to the Tokyo region, and depend on the fast train service to maintain their viability. The rest of the region - Yamagata, Akita, Iwate, and Aomori - is relatively remote and less industrialised. The growth of manufacturing industries has nethertheless changed the character of the regional economy, and made it more resilient. Bimonthly surveys by the Economic Planning Agency show that Tohoku was one of the last regions in Japan to succumb to the economic slowdown. It was not until December that the EPA reported the first change in sentiment, six months after the Kanto economy surrounding Tokyo began to slow. By February, however, the slowdown in industrial output was comparable to the rest of the nation, with a 5.1 per cent decline on the previous year, compared with a 4.6 per cent decline nationwide. The late slowdown in manufacturing is believed to have resulted from the relative newness and higher efficiency of Tokoku industrial plant. Companies pulled the plug first on older plant elsewhere in the country. In other respects, Tohoku looks relatively robust. It was the only region in the country to report an increase in automobile sales last year, and the 5 per cent decline in March sales, compared with a year ago, was much better than the national average decline of 7.5 per cent. The increase in bankruptcies is also well below the national average. Companies elsewhere have been driven to the brink by the collapse in land prices. Tohoku never suffered from rampant land speculation, and prices remain firm. Total investment in Tohoku has been brisk, having grown by 13 per cent in the fiscal year to the end of March, compared with a nationwide expansion of 9.1 per cent. In the current fiscal year, the Japan Development Bank expects investment to grow by 11.2 per cent, compared with a nationwide decline of 0.8 per cent. After stripping out special factors, however, the underlying trends are not very different. Much of the increase in Tohoku is accounted for by large and growing investment in electricity generation, particularly the construction of several nuclear reactors. In 1991, at Y799bn (Pounds 3.3bn), this accounted for 44 per cent of all investment, and at Y959bn this year it is expected to account for 47.5 per cent. A 6.8 per cent decline in manufacturing investment last year was caused mainly by a surge in investment in 1990 by Mitsubishi Paper Mills, which cut back sharply in 1991, and is slashing investment again this year. This year's projected decline in manufacturing investment of 0.2 per cent is much better than an expected nationwide decline of 6.6 per cent, but the relatively better performance in Tohoku again stems from the nuclear power industry. Investment in the non-ferrous metals industries will grow by 60 per cent this year to Y167bn in an effort to prepare to meet orders from the nuclear industry. Investment in the electronics industry - the biggest area of manufacturing investment for several years running - fell by 17.3 per cent last year and is set to fall by 24 per cent this year to Y133bn, in line with declining investment throughout the industry. None the less, when the industry does pull out of its slump, Tohoku is likely to be first in line to see a resurgence of spending. With land and labour supply more favourable than in the rest of Japan, and with transport improving steadily, it is fundamentally a more attractive place to invest. This generalisation, however, does not apply to the entire region. The economy in Aomori, for example, has slowed down sharply, from 4.4 per cent growth in 1990 to 2.9 per cent last year - though this stems mainly from the typhoon which last autumn blew up to half the apple crop to the ground. 'There is a very small connection to the rest of the Japanese economy,' says Mr Kiyoei Kobayashi, deputy director general of planning at the Aomori Prefectural Government. 'We have felt no impact of the collapse of the bubble economy in Japan.' Aomori and Akita, in particular, will have to wait for further improvements in transport before they become better integrated with the rest of the Japanese economy and fundamentally more attractive to industrial investors. In the meantime, they can expect to benefit from increased infrastructural investment and the growth of tourism.  -------------------------------------------------------- RESIDENTIAL LAND PRICES  -------------------------------------------------------- Prices in Yen/sq metre      1988       1990  -------------------------------------------------------- Aomiri                    47,900     47,900 Akita                     48,500     47,800 Yamagata                  47,000     47,700 Fukushima                 51,400     58,700 Iwate                     57,900     59,600 Miyagi                    63,200     93,200 Tokyo                    951,300    891,200  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: '1988 Official Land Values' by the National Land Agency  --------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE REGION'S MAIN ECONOMIC INDICATORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Japan   Tohoku   Tohoku/Japan %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Total area (sq km )                    377,835   66,971      17.7% 2 Population                              122.3m     9.8m       8.0% 3 Population employed in industries       58.36m     4.8m       8.2% 4 Employed in primary industry             5.41m  972,000        18% 5 Employed in secondary industry           19.3m     1.4m       7.1% 6 Employed in tertiary industry            33.4m     2.4m       7.3% 7 Gross production (Y bn)                382,078   23,973       6.3% 8 Primary industry                         8,800    1,422      15.9% 9 Secondary industry                     140,800    7,533       5.3% 10 Tertiary industry                     248,000   15,708       6.3%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The prefectures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Aomori     Iwate     Akita    Miyagi   Yamagata   Fukushima 1         9,247    15,277    11,434     7,292     9,327      13,784 2         1.53m     1.43m     1.25m     2.21m     1.26m       2.10m 3       718,000   730,000   619,000     1.04m   653,000       1.05m 4       173,000   185,000   135,000   151,000   131,000     197,000 5       155,000   192,000   178,000   277,000   218,000     360,000 6       389,000   352,000   306,000   606,000   303,000     489,000 7         3,231     3,203     2,797     6,065     2,961       5,715 8           240       267       222       288       184         211 8           722       972       847     1,778     1,040       2,174 10        2,379     2,051     1,801     4,184     1,840       3,454  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Tohoku Bureau of International Trade and Industry  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

L. No. 103&hyph;75, sections 202 (a)(5) and (c) of the International Travel Act of 1961, as amended, and 42 U.S.C. 3151, a total of $3 million is available from the USTTA to the States affected by the major, widespread flooding of 1993, to assist projects to promote tourism within the United States and from the contiguous Canadian market. As used in this notice, ``private or public non-profit organization or association'' means an institution, organization, or association, either private or public, which has tax exempt status as defined in section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These funds are intended to defray the costs of increased tourism promotion needs resulting from the flooding. An applicant may receive no more than one award for this disaster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only eligible applicants from the nine eligible States whose applications receive a final evaluation score of 80 or greater will be considered for an award. No applicant will be awarded funds unless the application includes a project or projects from at least two of the six project areas set forth in section IV.C., below. No applicant will be awarded funds unless the application includes: (1) Documentation demonstrating that all programs set forth in the application are or will be effectively coordinated with other affected entities in the State; and (2) a marketing plan that contains clearly stated objectives for a time period of one year and procedures for credible evaluation and tracking, and that is integrated (in terms of multiple activities) with a generally cohesive approach. Further, no applicant will be awarded funds unless the projects for which funding is sought are aimed at market(s) which have potential for mitigating the tourism-related negative effects of the disaster. The application must include credible market research to support this potential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The maximum amount an applicant from the States of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, whose tourism industries have been most severely affected by the floods, shall be awarded is $400,000 and cannot exceed an aggregate of $400,000 annually for such projects for each State. Applicants from the States of Nebraska, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas and Wisconsin shall be eligible to receive up to $300,000 and cannot exceed an aggregate of $300,000 annually for such projects for each State. The minimum amount for which an applicant may apply is $200,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on individual State funding limitations, applicants will be awarded assistance in descending order starting with the applicant whose proposal has the highest final evaluation score. Subject to the availability of funds, grants will be awarded on a state-by-state basis according to final evaluation scores, State funding limitations, and broad geographic distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The funding instrument will be a grant unless it is anticipated that the USTTA will be substantially involved in the implementation of the project for which an award is to be made, in which case the funding instrument will be a cooperative agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that all funds have not been obligated after the first competition, a second competition will be announced. Applicants from the eligible States that have not reached their maximum limitation, as noted above, will be invited to apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To support the tourism promotional effort financed by this program, a comprehensive national public relations campaign will be developed to encourage recovery of visitation to the affected region. Components of the campaign may include, but are not limited to, public service announcements (broadcast or print), development of a ``1&hyph;800'' number for tourist information, and endorsements by celebrity spokespersons. Applicants are encouraged to utilize the umbrella campaign in their overall effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

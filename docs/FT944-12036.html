			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television If his previous work is an accurate guide, Steve Humphries' documentary series Forbidden Britain will be well worth watching. It looks at 'Britain's secret past from 1900 to 1960' starting with juvenile crime (9.45 BBC2). Remember the famous Channel 4 'remit'? Something to do with being different and catering for minorities, wasn't it? Today they begin a series called Beat That Einstein in which people with little scientific knowledge are required to complete a task with the help of only a few books and garden shed tools (8.00). Reminds you of 'The Great Egg Race'? Me too. Drop The Dead Donkey is not dramatically different from other comedies, but it is welcome since it is often funny (10.00). The programme that best exemplifies the Channel 4 idea is Pagliacci which is transmitted at 2.45 in the morning. This is not the British 1936 coloured film with Richard Tauber, but an even more obscure offering: a monochrome 1947 version starring Tito Gobbi and featuring Gina Lollobrigida in her first movie. She mimes the role of Nedda which is sung by Onelia Fineschi. Set the VCR.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Germans clinch train deal A GERMAN consortium has fought off strong competition from French bidders to win a DM2.2bn (Pounds 880m) contract to provide the German railway system with a new generation of high-speed trains, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The consortium - consisting of Siemens, the Munich-based electricals and electronics company, and AEG, the electronics division of Daimler-Benz - will deliver 60 of the new trains to the German Bundesbahn between mid-1996 and the end of 1998. The new trains will run at speeds of 280km/hour. The German companies will work with Deutsche Waggonbau Aktiengesellschaft, the east German manufacturer of railway coaches.</p>

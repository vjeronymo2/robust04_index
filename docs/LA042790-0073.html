			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT BACKS WOMEN'S MEDICAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> A pregnant patient's decision to refuse medical treatment is almost always  paramount, even when survival of a fetus is at stake, the District of  Columbia's highest court ruled Thursday.  </P> <P> The decision in a widely watched case is binding only in the district, but it  is expected to influence other courts wrestling with questions of maternal and  fetal rights in connection with medical treatment and abortion.  </P> <P> "We hold that in virtually all cases the question of what is to be done is to  be decided by the patient -- the pregnant woman -- on behalf of herself and the  fetus," the D.C. Court of Appeals said in a 7-1 decision.  </P> <P> "We do not quite foreclose the possibility" that the patient's wishes may be  overridden, the panel said, "but we anticipate that such cases will be  extremely rare and truly exceptional."  </P> <P> The court ruled in the case of Angela Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient  pregnant with a 26-week-old fetus. The D.C. Superior Court found it unclear  what the heavily sedated Carder wanted done with the fetus and told George  Washington University Hospital to perform an emergency Cesarean section.  </P> <P> The premature infant died 2 1/2 hours after the surgery; her mother died two  days later. The Cesarean section was listed as a contributing cause of Carder's  death.  </P> <P> Writing for the majority, Judge John A. Terry said the lower court should have  tried to determine what Carder would have wanted to happen had she been able to  make a clear decision.  </P> <P> Instead, the judge wrote, the court proceeded straight to a "balancing  analysis" weighing Carder's rights against the interests of the state -- in  this case the survival of the fetus -- and found for the fetus.  </P> <P> In a separate opinion, Judge James A. Belson said he agreed with the lower  court's decision to weigh the interests of Carder, her fetus and the state. The  judge said an unborn child's interests and the state's interest in preserving  human life are entitled to "substantial weight" when they are in conflict with  a patient's decision on medical treatment.  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women,  which fought the court-ordered procedure, said the appeals court decision  affirmed the rights of pregnant women to control their own medical treatment.  </P> <P> The ACLU said the decision "stands as solid authority" for rejecting the idea  that a fetus has rights superseding those of a person already born.  </P> <P> ACLU attorney Lynn Paltrow, who brought the case, said the lower court treated  Carder as if she were dead. "The bottom line is you can't deny women their  civil rights. You can't treat women as dead just because they're pregnant," she  said.  </P></p>

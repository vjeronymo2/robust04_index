The need cannot be met solely with State and local resources within the foreseeable future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Technical Assistance Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of the Program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board will set aside up to $600,000 of Fiscal Year 1995 funds (in addition to any technical assistance funds remaining from Fiscal Year 1994) to support the provision of technical assistance to State and local courts. The exact amount to be awarded for these grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category and other categories of the Guideline. It is anticipated, however, that at least $150,000 will be available each quarter to support Technical Assistance grants. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient support to obtain technical assistance to diagnose a problem, develop a response to that problem, and initiate implementation of any needed changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Assistance grants are limited to no more than $30,000 each, and may cover the cost of obtaining the services of expert consultants, travel by a team of officials from one court to examine a practice, program or facility in another jurisdiction that the applicant court is interested in replicating, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical assistance must be completed within 12 months after the start-date of the grant. Only State or local courts may apply for Technical Assistance grants. As with other awards to State or local courts, cash or in-kind match must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount. Technical Assistance grant recipients also are subject to the same quarterly reporting requirements as other Institute grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the conclusion of the grant period, a Technical Assistance grant recipient must complete a Technical Assistance Evaluation Form. The grantee also must submit to the Institute two copies of a final report that explains how it intends to act on the consultant's recommendations as well as two copies of the consultant's written report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review Criteria.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Assistance grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: Whether the assistance would address a critical need of the court; the soundness of the technical assistance approach to the problem; the qualifications of the consultant(s) to be hired, or the specific criteria that will be used to select the consultant(s); commitment on the part of the court to act on the consultant's recommendations; and the reasonableness of the proposed budget. The Institute will also consider factors such as the level and nature of the match that would be provided, diversity of subject matter, geographic diversity, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application Procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In lieu of concept papers and formal applications, applicants for Technical Assistance grants may submit, at any time, an original and three copies of a detailed letter describing the proposed project and addressing the criteria listed above. Letters from an individual trial or appellate court must be signed by the presiding judge or manager of that court. Letters from the State court system must be signed by the Chief Justice or State Court Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although there is no prescribed form for the letter nor a minimum or maximum page limit, letters of application should include the following information to assure that each of the criteria is addressed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Need for Funding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What is the critical need facing the court? How will the proposed technical assistance help the court to meet this critical need? Why cannot State or local resources fully support the costs of the required consultant services?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

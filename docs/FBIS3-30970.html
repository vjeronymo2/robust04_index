			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Renata Wisniewska: "Central Bank or Office?; </F> Experts for the PSL and the SLD Suggest A Different Monetary  Policy"]    [Text] On Tuesday, 8 February, experts for the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  presented the management of the Polish National Bank [NBP] with  a draft of the principles of monetary policies for 1994.  According to those principles, the main goals of monetary  policies are: lowering the inflation rate by the end of 1994 to  the level of 23 percent (in relation to December) and to the  level of 27 percent (in relation to midyear), increasing the  growth rate in the economy, limiting the unemployment rate, and  developing exports. The document conflicts in a fundamental way  with a draft of principles presented to the Sejm by the NBP.    The planned goals listed in the document prepared by the  experts for the SLD and the PSL are supposed to be implemented,  among other things, through a "real increase in money supply to  economic units and to households, at least up to the level of  the planned increase in the GDP--that is, up to the level of 169  trillion zlotys [Z]," (the NBP suggests Z155 trillion), "through  an appropriate shaping of the interest rates with regard to bank  deposits and credits in relation to the inflation rate,"  "through a flexible shaping of policies on foreign currency  rates, which would take into account the inflation rate," and  through an increase in the trend to save. The experts think  that the state budget's debt due to financing the budget deficit  cannot exceed Z35 trillion. It will be implemented by  purchasing Treasury notes from the Finance Ministry.    To implement the government proexport policies, the NBP is  supposed to increase its contribution to the Corporation for  Insurance of Export Credits [KUKE] up to the 25-percent level.  In addition, the NBP is supposed to devote part of its foreign  currency reserves for the purpose of financing modernization  investments in small and medium-size companies.    The coalition experts also write that the central bank will  undertake necessary measures aimed at bringing banks back to  health, among other things by devoting for that purpose the  amount of Z3 trillion; by decreasing obligatory reserves; by  purchasing shares, long-term bonds, and bills of exchange; by  providing guarantees for deposits; and by refinancing credits.  The draft also envisages an increase of the trend to save in  zlotys, through the NBP's introduction of the burden of  obligatory reserves on foreign-currency deposits. The experts  assume that commercial banks will be able to get loans from the  NBP mainly in the form of rediscounting credits and pawn  credits. The banks' debts incurred in this way would be  controlled by the NBP, depending on the monetary situation in  the country.    The draft also envisages the NBP's cooperation with the  government while establishing a system of lessening the debt  burden of economic enterprises. This applies to those companies  that are profitable in terms of their productivity. The NBP is  supposed to undertake measures for improving the earnings  situation and for a restructuring of the companies' indebtedness.    RZECZPOSPOLITA has asked Witold Kozinski (first deputy of  the  NBP's chairperson) to comment on the proposal submitted by the  SLD and PSL experts. According to him, an agreement on  increasing the money supply in 1994 and on the NBP's  contribution in financing the budget deficit will not be reached  at this stage of the talks. W. Kozinski said that an increase  in the money supply of Z155 trillion is very large anyway. The  Sejm will be an umpire on this issue. If the Sejm adopts an  increase in the money supply to Z169 trillion, it will have to  bear the responsibility for price increases," Witold Kozinski  said [no opening quotes as published].    According to the first deputy of the NBP's chairperson, the  draft has many drawbacks. For instance, the NBP's management  has already made a decision on increasing its contribution in  the capital of KUKE; it also made an appropriate decision on  introducing obligatory reserves in foreign-currency accounts.  An ordinance on this issue by the NBP's chairperson has been in  effect since 31 January of this year. According to the  provisions now in effect, the NBP cannot devote part of the  foreign-currency reserves to finance modernization investments.  It could do this only by borrowing the necessary means on the  market. In W. Kozinski's view, there is also a contradiction  with regard to basic credits. He stressed that the main goal of  the NBP's monetary policies is to lower the inflation rate by  the end of 1994 to the level of 23 percent, on the basis of the  period from December 1993 to December 1993 [as published], as  well as the kind of cooperation in implementing economic  policies that would make this goal realistic. Going over the  planned increase in money supply to the level above Z155  trillion could take place, assuming the inflation figures will  be implemented successfully. According to W. Kozinski, if the  practical rate of price increases does not exceed 23 percent on  a yearly basis, the NBP will not oppose increasing the money  supply to over Z155 trillion, but decisions on this issue should  not be made earlier than in the second half of the year.</p>

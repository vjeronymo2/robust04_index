			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: TransTec seeks Pounds 24m to expand and cancel debt TRANSFER Technology Group, formerly Central &amp; Sheerwood and headed by the late Mr Robert Maxwell before reorganisation and the decision to concentrate on specialised engineering, yesterday announced three acquisitions and a Pounds 23.9m rights issue. As well as funding the purchases, the cash call will eliminate group debt currently between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m. BEW (Auto Products), Earby Light Engineers and Raycon Corporation - the companies being acquired - would 'contribute significantly to TransTec's planned growth as an important supplier to the automotive and aerospace industries', said Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman. They will cost TransTec a combined Pounds 7.65m, plus dividends of Pounds 1.8m paid on completion to the vendors of BEW and Earby. TransTec is also assuming borrowings of Pounds 9m, resulting in a total bill of about Pounds 18.5m. Up to 6.23m shares will be allotted on a 1-for-2 basis at 400p each, a discount to last night's 485p close, up 2p on the day. Joint underwriters are Charterhouse Bank, the group's advisers, and Credit Lyonnais Laing, broker to the issue. Consideration for BEW, which is a high volume machinist of aluminium and iron castings, is Pounds 4.63m, with Pounds 4.58m in cash and the balance as an unsecured loan note; it is a customer of AL Dunn and competitor to Coventry Apex, the two companies in TransTec's automotive division. Mr Neil Logue, TransTec finance director, said the annual turnovers of BEW and Apex were about Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m respectively. When brought together, he was looking for a combined figure of about Pounds 80m. Although the BEW name would be retained, he said, the company's management would not. This contrasts with Earby, which is keeping its management. The company, which will cost Pounds 2.18m cash, makes high precision components for the aerospace industry and Rolls-Royce in particular. It has no US sales. Mr Logue said the vertical integration of Amchem, TransTec's aerospace subsidiary which has links with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, into Earby would enable the division to manufacture complete engine blades. Raycon is a US-based manufacturer of electro-discharge and laser machining systems for both the automotive and aerospace industries. The consideration is Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 840,000) cash.</p>

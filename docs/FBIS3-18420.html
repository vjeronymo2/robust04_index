			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Joe Quinn, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Four senior Russian military experts today arrived  in Scotland for a snap inspection of the Royal Navy's biggest  amphibious exercise for seven years.    The Russians -- three colonels and a naval captain -- gave  Britain 48 hours notice of their intention to carry out an  on-the- spot investigation of the exercise, taking place in the  Western Isles.    Although the connection is officially denied, the exercise  covers the type of training that would be required if British  troops had to be evacuated from war-torn Bosnia. It includes  1,500 Royal Marines supported by five frigates, a submarine,  assault and landing ships and five minehunters, who have been  making beach landings near Stornoway.    For the first time in Britain, the marines have been joined  by French and Dutch commandos. Both those countries have forces  in the former Yugoslavia and France is the biggest contributor  of troops there.    An army spokesman in Edinburgh said the Russian inspection  request was in line with a 34-nation treaty signed in Paris in  1990. Under the treaty, big exercises are notified in advance,  and nations have the right to carry out inspections to "clarify  any doubts about compliance with the agreed measures."    The spokesman said the exercise, "Royal Dawn," was  unconnected with the Bosnian situation, and was the annual  winter exercise for the 3d Commando Brigade.</p>

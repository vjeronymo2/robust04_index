A senior Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that his country's position and concept of a just and  comprehensive peace were announced very clearly in Geneva, and  that the moment of truth has come for Israel to respond to the  voice of peace, which was announced again from Geneva.    The Syrian official was speaking after President Hafiz  al-Asad's return from Geneva the night before last after his  historic meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Tahir  al-Masri, speaker of the Jordanian House of Representatives,  said the meeting is as important as the Madrid conference from  which the peace process was launched. Maybe in this context,  too, Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi spoke to the Syrian  president over the telephone to agree to hold a summit in  Damascus, to be attended from the Lebanese side -- in addition  to President al-Hirawi -- by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih  Birri, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Faris  Buwayz, and Ambassador Suhayl Shammas, head of the peace  delegation to the negotiations with Israel.    A Lebanese presidential source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that  President al-Asad has asked Lebanese officials to wait two days,  to allow him to rest after his journey to and from Geneva. He  will receive them later. However, the source said that, if  something happens and delays this Lebanese-Syrian summit, Syrian  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' will visit Beirut to brief  officials on the results of the Geneva summit, and the summit  would then be held later in Damascus.    On the significance of the Geneva summit, the Syrian  official  told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the U.S. Administration's renewal of  its commitment -- openly and clearly -- and its intention to do  all it can to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, is another  reason for the optimism about achieving the desired peace.  However the official said that this peace is still surrounded  by caution, because Israel has not yet expressed its intentions  regarding commitment to this peace. It is still maneuvering,  claiming it does not understand the peace proposed by Syria.    The official said: How can the United States, in particular  its President, and the world as a whole understand and support  what Syria has proposed with regard to peace, while Israel still  has not understood the Syrian view? Does that not indicate that  Israel is still acting stubbornly by refusing to accept a peace  based on the known foundations endorsed by the resolutions of  international legitimacy?    The Syrian official pointed out that Syria, which adhered to  full sovereignty over the Golan, also clearly adheres to a  complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. This applies  also to Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the  Palestinians' rights. This was stressed by President Hafiz  al-Asad during his talks with President Clinton in Geneva. The  summit reflected a full U.S. understanding of the Syrian view.  [passage omitted]</p>

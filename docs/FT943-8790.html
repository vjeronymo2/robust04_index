			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Tokyo With investors returning from their holidays around mid-week, brokers are expected to start active stock promotion campaigns, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. 'With trading volumes depressed for the past few months, the salesmen want to pick things up before the September book closing to boost profits,' says Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. The 21,000 level is likely to continue to be a technical resistance point. However, brokers say that many banks and financial institutions are already in their last stages of realising profits on their stock portfolios ahead of September 30, and expect profit-taking to be light.</p>

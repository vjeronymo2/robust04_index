			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Draft insurance law scrapped for exports to high risk countries THE government last night scrapped draft legislation requiring it to continue insuring UK sales to politically risky developing countries for three years after the Export Credits Guarantee Department is privatised. Spurning urgent pleas from exporters, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, won Commons backing to quash an amendment introduced to the ECGD privatisation bill before Easter as the result of a Conservative backbench rebellion. The bill will allow for privatisation of ECGD's Cardiff-based short-term export credit insurance business. Mr Sainsbury's announcement came in the face of lobbying by exporters, the Confederation of British Industry and Labour to retain the clause. He said the amendment was technically deficient and failed to account for the complexity of the export and insurance markets. Goods covered by it accounted for less than half a per cent of Britain's non-oil visible exports. Mr Sainsbury sought to appease exporters with an assurance that the need for a 'national interest facility' for political risk reinsurance would be kept under review. The government's intention was that the facility would continue as long as it was considered 'essential to meet the reasonable needs of exporters.' The amendment, proposed by Mr Keith Hampson, Tory MP for Leeds North West, would have obliged the government to provide insurance or re-insurance against 'political risk' for a minimum of three years after privatisation. It would have mainly covered exports to developing countries where political and economic crises could prevent even creditworthy customers from obtaining foreign exchange to pay their bills. Exporters say they depend on such cover for sales to a range of countries, including important markets such as the Soviet Union, Hong Kong, India and South Africa. The loss of such support would deprive them of backing available to foreign competitors. Some Tory backbenchers fear the decision could sour the government's reputation with exporters.

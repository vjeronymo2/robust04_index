			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Temporary Growth of Deficit"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--The deficit of the state budget of the  Slovak Republic in the first five months of this year developed  more favorably than expected. By 31 May 1994, it declined to  2.29 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] (from Sk3.8 billion at the end  of April). As of 21 June 1994, the budget management of the  Slovak Republic has been showing a deficit of Sk7.9 billion.  This sum will, however, decrease by the end of the month  because the surrendering of proceeds from the crucial taxes--the  value-added tax and excise taxes--starts after the 23d day of  every month. An analysis of the current deviation in the budget  management of the Slovak Republic confirms that it is also  influenced by the changed position of the Slovak Republic in the  fulfillment of the payments agreement with the Czech Republic  because Slovakia has now become the Czech Republic's creditor.</p>

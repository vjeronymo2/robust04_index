			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Bank icons under threat: The response of UK clearers to poor results Mr Brian Pearse is something of an iconoclast, for a lifelong banker. Reflecting on the recent financial results of the English clearing banks - their worst since the 1930s by most measures  - Midland's chief executive wondered whether a clearing bank needed to be involved in the transmission of money. Here speaks the banking heretic. The process of collecting cheques and shipping them to the payee's bank underlies all clearers' mainstream activities. Mr Pearse's question is the equivalent of British Rail's chairman asking whether BR should be involved in managing the national network of railway lines. But Mr Pearse believes that the clearers - Barclays, National Westminster, Midland and Lloyds - have been so shocked by their financial results that they will 'have to re-examine the fundamentals of how they operate'. The spotlight must fall on their money transmission networks, which have huge running costs. The weakness of their performance is shown up by the better figures released yesterday by Abbey National, a much simpler business serving personal customers. An analysis of the clearers' results shows why a re-evaluation of the way the industry operates may be necessary. Last year the clearers lost Pounds 5.6bn on their loans - or to use the technical term, they made provisions to cover loan losses of that magnitude. The bad debt charges were the biggest ever to afflict these banks - a particular humiliation given that they arose in the heart of their traditional business, lending to small companies and individuals. However, the threat to the English clearers should not be exaggerated. They all remained in profit, in spite of the fears of industry observers that NatWest and Midland would fall into losses for the first time since they began to disclose their profit and loss accounts two decades ago. Indeed the clearers pushed up revenues from fees and commission and increased their interest earnings, so they all made record trading profits if the effect of bad debt charges is excluded. The profits picture has prompted complaints from consumer pressure groups that customers are being forced to pay - in higher charges and wider margins between borrowing and lending rates - for the banks' lending mistakes. However, it is arguable that some customers were undercharged in the 1980s. For instance, Midland's charges and interest rates for personal customers were uneconomic for many years. Although there is no doubt that the banks are able to push up prices once or even twice with impunity - because customers are slow to move their accounts when dissatisfied - there is little prospect of their obtaining growth from further such rises. They face too much competition from other financial institutions in all their main markets, except perhaps the business of supplying services to small companies. 'They cannot continue pushing up charges indefinitely, or they will lose business,' comments Mr Robin Monro-Davies, managing director of IBCA, the agency which rates banks' performance. Last year's increase in lending margins should be viewed as a blip in a long-term trend of declining margins. Figures from Lloyds show the margin on UK lending fell continuously from 7.1 per cent in 1982 to 5.11 per cent in 1990, excluding interest lost on loans that had gone bad, before recovering to 5.33 per cent in 1991. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, is equally pessimistic about the prospects of pushing up non-interest earnings. 'We expect revenue growth to be sluggish throughout the 1990s,' he says. 'The key challenge is to adjust the cost base to the lower revenue base - cutting costs is the core of Lloyds' strategy.' Last year, only the running expenses of Barclays rose sharply. In the case of Lloyds and Midland, overheads were static and at NatWest they rose in line with inflation. Savings were mainly achieved by quietly cutting staff, with significant consequences. In total, the banks reduced their worldwide workforces by 22,000 to 339,000 - and are likely to cut up to 15,000 in the current year. But there is a limit to how far banks can cut costs by closing branches and reducing numbers without alienating both staff and customers. Mr Monro-Davies says: 'If banks' profits are to grow significantly over the next few years, they need reductions in the bad debt charge.' Improving the quality of loans is also a personnel issue. The concept of individual responsibility for decisions was eroded by a trend to centralisation in the 1970s and 1980s. In most industries, the disclosure of such poor results would have led to sackings and demotions of the managers responsible. But bankers blame the recession first and foremost for their bad debts. Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, says no one at his bank has been dismissed as a direct result of having lent imprudently. 'The spotlight has not fallen on a person or persons for bad lending,' he says. Mr Pearse, who says Midland has dismissed some bankers for making bad loans, accepts that nonetheless there is a problem in attributing blame to individuals, because big loans were approved by credit committees consisting of several managers and executives. As for the small loans which have gone bad, branch managers were often encouraged by their head offices to increase lending. 'There is no doubt that we put too much pressure on the managers to make loans,' says a senior banker. Midland is reorganising to give more power to branch managers and make them personally responsible for the performance of their branches. A similar process of making individuals more accountable is being examined by NatWest. However, banks also need to be able to keep closer track of individual businesses. Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays, says the bank is trying to develop a management system to allow it to measure the risk and reward of its many different products and services in a much more precise way. But banks' fundamental flaw may be that they have become too diversified and too big. One senior banker recalls that 'a Department of Trade and Industry inspector who was investigating NatWest's role in the Blue Arrow share issue told me he thought the problem was that NatWest had become unmanageable'. Support for this thesis is provided by the superior performance of Lloyds, which has resisted the temptation to diversify into securities trading and has concentrated its resources on a limited number of markets. It has specialised in serving personal customers and medium-sized corporate customers, reducing its involvement in the more glamorous but less profitable business of lending to big companies in the UK and around the world. Although half the size of NatWest and Barclays, it is now more profitable. But Mr Pearse points out that divestments of some bank operations are generally regarded as impossible. Even if, for example, a bank calculated that providing loans and banking services to companies produced far too low a return for the capital employed, it might be impracticable to withdraw from this business. The reason is that the huge fixed costs of a bank's money transmission network are supported by all banking revenues, earned from companies and individuals. Without the revenues from companies, money transmission costs would be carried by the retail banking business alone - and would probably make this business unprofitable. Mr Pearse muses about a possible solution. Banks could merge their money transmission capabilities, so achieving economies of scale and increasing productivity. It might be sensible to demerge this activity into a separate company. Banks would then be free to concentrate on the businesses of manufacturing financial products and selling them. The new transmission company would charge the banks a combination of rent and usage fee. The thought of having a cheque account at a bank with no direct involvement in processing and transporting cheques may seem strange. It would, however, be no more peculiar than buying electricity from a company which plays no direct part in operating the national grid - and that is already a reality.</p>

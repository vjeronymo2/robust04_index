			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grant must be administered in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following regulations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 13 CFR Part 121_Small Business Size Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42 CFR Part 52_Grants for Research Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 CFR Part 46_Protection of Human Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 CFR Part 74_Administration of Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 CFR Part 80_Nondiscrimination Under Programs Receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Assistance Through the DHHS Effectuation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 CFR Part 84_Nondiscrimination of the Basis of Handicap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Programs and Activities Receiving Federal Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 CFR Part 91_Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Age in HHS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Cost Sharing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cost sharing is not required nor will it be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation factor in consideration of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, due to the special nature of the SBIR Program, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant may choose to share the costs of a project. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be done through cash or in-kind contributions. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently, we expect that the applicant will contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more labor or use unreimbursed equipment as the applicant's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice is intended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informational purposes and reflects current planning. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is any inconsistency between the information contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this notice and the terms of any resulting SBIR grant,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the terms of the grant are controlling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before award of an SBIR grant, HCFA may request the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant to submit certain organization, management,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel, and financial information in order to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility of the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal government is not responsible for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monies expended by the applicant before the award of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is not an offer by HCFA and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligate HCFA to make any specific number of awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SBIR Program is not a substitute for HCFA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing unsolicited proposal mechanisms, and unsolicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals will not be accepted under either Phase I or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase II of the SBIR Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant may be required to certify that he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has not previously been paid, nor is currently being paid,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for essentially equivalent work by an agency of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government. If a grant is made under this notice for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project, some of whose elements are being supported, or will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be supported, by another Federal agency, HCFA and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant will negotiate a budget that reflects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elimination of any overlapping support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program is not covered by Executive Order 12372,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Intergovernment Review of Federal Programs.'' Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12372 provides for a State clearinghouse in each State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to review Federal programs. Research grants are exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Research Topic Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice invites SBIR Phase I applications in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following areas. The topics are defined in general terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They are intended to indicate where we believe we can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly offer assistance in the development of innovative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. ORD will consider any idea that is within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general subject of a topic. In addition, ORD will review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any idea that is within the general purview of HCFA, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section I. of this notice. Applicants are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reminded that the overall intent of the HCFA SBIR Program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide assistance to the development of products and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes that have commercial potential and not to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquisition of products for HCFA's own use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. High Quality and Effective Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA invites ideas that would develop products to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist all participants in health care in assessing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring the quality of care and level of care being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished to patients. Projects should aim to develop tools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for health care professionals, providers, and managers that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit them to examine patterns of services being delivered,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the health and social outcome of those services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects that would assist private organizations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing patient guidelines and in conducting technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments are of interest. These tools should provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way to monitor and measure the delivery of health services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the outcomes of those services. They should also make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible a judgment about the quality of the care, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of the care, or both. The technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency with which care is delivered and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriateness of the overall outcome for the patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Management of Ambulatory Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA invites ideas that would develop tools to monitor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess, and control overutilization and underutilization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambulatory services and products at all levels of the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care system. Apart from the inflation in the cost of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, a significant cause of the rising cost of health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care services is excessive utilization. Traditionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilization review techniques have been applied to high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost, acute services, such as surgery and hospitalizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We wish to focus on physician services and other ambulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services and products, for example, drugs, medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, and testing. HCFA invites applications related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to services or products commonly associated with Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients, who are primarily the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aged, the poor, the disabled, and persons with end-stage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renal disease. Techniques to be explored involve systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both for retrospective utilization pattern review and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managing prospective interventions in individual physician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or beneficiary and recipient service or product use. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area also includes broader management tools, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information derived from utilization review, that promote or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure more efficient and effective service delivery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

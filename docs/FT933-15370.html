			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Those who stand to win and lose in the wrangling These are the issues to be discussed in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, to resume on Monday - and a look at the parties with the most to gain, or lose, from them. FARM TRADE: Liberalisation of farm trade is critical to developing countries, frustrated by lack of access to US and EC markets. They are upset at damage done to world food prices by dumping of farm surpluses onto world markets, particularly by the EC. Politically powerful farm lobbies in the EC and the US will fight to maintain existing protection. Winners: Developing countries, and the countries of eastern Europe, who would see enhanced export opportunities and higher world prices. The US, Australia and New Zealand, with efficient farm sectors, should also gain. Losers: The EC, where the Common Agriculture Policy provides secure farm incomes regardless of global competitiveness, and funds the dumping of large farm surpluses onto world markets. COMPREHENSIVE TARIFICATION: Gatt wants to get rid of hidden or easily manipulated forms of protection - including quotas, market sharing arrangements, and other non-tariff barriers to trade - and to replace them with tariffs. These are more transparent, and can be reduced progressively. This is also basically a farm issue, focused on Japanese and South Korean refusal to open their markets to rice markets; the EC's banana import regime; and Canada's farm supply management system. Winners: Developing countries, and leading grain exporters like the US; Latin American banana exporters. Losers: Protected Japanese and Korean farmers; banana exporters in the Caribbean and other former colonies with preferential access to the EC market; protected Canadian dairy farmers. TEXTILES exports are critical to many developing countries, which have had most exports controlled by quotas under the Multifibre Arrangement. The Uruguay Round deal will phase these out over 10 years, leaving national tariffs as the only barriers to trade. Winners: Developing countries, which should see exports to the US and the EC rise; the EC and Japan, where high quality products now kept out of the US market by high tariffs will find new demand. Losers: The US, where producers will in the next decade lose both quota and tariff protection; developing countries, which will have to open markets to imports over a similar period. STEEL: Global over-capacity, and a complex history of subsidy, have led to oversupply in many products. Recession has cut demand for steel. New technology has destroyed the viability of many older integrated steel mills. Producers across the world have fought for protection, and trade management, while struggling to modernise and rationalise. The history of the Multilateral Steel Agreement is tangled in these conflicting forces. Winners: Exporters to the US, now blocked by penal dumping and countervailing duties; efficient mills, particularly mini-mills, which should prosper once an MSA is finalised. Losers: Inefficient, integrated mills anywhere. Mills propped up by subsidies, or protected markets. TRADE IN SERVICES: One big breakthrough of the Uruguay Round would be to attack barriers to trade in services. This covers a broad range such as insurance, banking, securities, construction, distribution, tourism, software and computer services, professional and business services, including consulting, engineering, accounting and legal services. Opening up financial services markets across the developing world has been a high priority for the US and Europe Winners: Financial services companies, professionals and consultants in the US and the EC (particularly France). Losers: Protected and inefficient service providers in east Asia and the developing world. Japan, Korea and the five Asean countries have been targeted in particular for financial services liberalisation. MARITIME SERVICES: The US wants port, and onshore activities linked with shipping to be opened up; for the EC and Japan, an assault on the cartel-like conferences that control much of the world's blue water shipping is the priority. Winners: Shippers outside the conferences controlling particular ocean routes; freight and distribution companies keen to compete in getting cargoes from factory to port. AUDIO-VISUAL SERVICES: Sales of films and TV programmes were second only to aircraft last year as the leading US export. The main market is the EC, where national limits are frustrating export growth. The US wants the EC to drop requirements for a minimum percentage of local-language programming, and of locally produced films and programmes. Cable and satellite developments are making life even more complicated. The EC insists local culture must be protected. Winners: The US, if the EC were opened further. Japanese companies now control many leading US film-makers, so they have slipped alongside the US on this issue. India's film industry generates significant export income. Losers: The EC, in particular France, where US cultural hegemony is unpopular. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS: Protection of copyright and patents is lax in much of the developing world, prompting the US to fight for progress in the Uruguay Round towards enforcement of intellectual property protection - across books and music to videos and computer software. At the same time, many developing countries resent paying high royalties to western pharmaceutical companies for licences to use drugs they need cheaply for their people. Developing countries have linked concessions here to concessions in the US and Europe over farm trade and textiles. Winners: Many companies, mostly in the industrial world, which need effective patent and copyright protection to justify big investments in research and innovation. Losers: Poor consumers of medicines and food preparations in the developing world, who may have to pay more; videos and computer software pirates; plagiarists of designs or other product innovations. DISPUTE SETTLEMENT: The US says the Gatt dispute settlement procedures are slow and fickle but is reluctant to dilute its sovereign dispute settlement laws by handing authority to resolve a dispute over to a multilateral agency like Gatt. They are anxious to strengthen its authority, since they feel it is the only medium in which they can handle a trade dispute with a big trading power like the US or the EC. They want bilateral weapons in international trade disputes - like the US Section 301 laws - eliminated. Winners: All developing countries, and many industrial ones subject to bilateral trade pressure from the US. Losers: The US, which wants to keep Section 301. MULTILATERAL TRADE ORGANISATION: The Uruguay Round was meant to achieve what should have been achieved in 1947, when Gatt was born: a trade body with more authority than now, to embrace trade in manufactures, agriculture and textiles, and the new area of services. It would also embrace the Tokyo Round 'codes' on subsidies, dumping and procurement. Winners: All those who subscribe to multilateral settlement of trade problems. Losers: The US, and those concerned about erosion of sovereign authority, as the MTO would mean some national powers were delegated beyond the courts of the land. SUBSIDIES, DUMPING, PROCUREMENT: These are contentious in their own right. National policies in these areas have increasing impact on trade. They are the subject of special 'codes' overseen by Gatt, to which only a minority of countries backing Gatt are signatories. Signatories want more countries to sign up to the disciplines of these codes. Winners: Developing countries, which can ill afford industrial subsidies and are often victims of dumping actions: the US and the EC, by making more countries subject to disciplines of the codes. Losers: The US, fearing erosion of its sovereign powers; developing countries, many not yet disciplined by the codes; the EC, a heavy user of subsidies and a procurement market coveted by the US.</p>

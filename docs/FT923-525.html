			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: The build-up of Georgian Bath - Architecture Georgian Bath is a work of art and like works of art, needs both love and interpretation. A city conceived and designed like Bath should be seen whole and yet understood in parts, just like a great painting. Recently an important new institution devoted to furthering the understanding of the city opened its doors. The Building of Bath Museum is an intelligent new venture that occupies a mid-18th century building that was formerly the Countess of Huntingdon's Chapel. It stands above the raised pavement of The Paragon, north of Walcot Street and east of The Circus and The Royal Crescent. The object of this new museum, run by the Bath Preservation Trust, is to show how the Georgian city was built. Let me say at once that this new museum is extremely enjoyable to visit and utterly engrossing. Like all the best museums, it is didactic without being tedious. It is small and comfortable, and the architect for the adaptation of this 1765 chapel, Michael Brawne, is to be congratulated on his unobtrusive, economical and ingenious conversion. The displays tell a complex story with clarity and precision. The city of Bath that we see today, although it has Roman baths at its heart, is a Georgian city that was planned and built within the century that spanned the reigns of the four King Georges. Edinburgh, Dublin and London all have Georgian architecture but Bath remains unique. Although the city did grow with the arrival of Brunel's Great Western Railway, and was ignorantly damaged by planners, philistines and architects in the decades following the Second World War, it does still look like a predominantly Georgian city. There are plenty of places in Bath where the views are those seen by its original creators. In the new museum, visitors are led through the construction of the city's houses and on through the planning and growth of the city. I enjoyed the first impressions - portraits of the major characters in Bath's development: John Wood the Elder, Richard 'Beau' Nash and Ralph Allen. And Oliver Goldsmith's writings about a typical day's pleasure in the happy valley between Bath's hills, is both instructive and a joy to read. The flavour of the spa and resort is distinctive and agreeable. The flavour of the architecture is perhaps more difficult to convey. I was impressed by the way one of the first exhibits explains what classical architecture is, and what the language of columns and Orders really means. You understand it was John Wood the Elder's sense of architectural history that made it possible for him to envision a city of great classical compositions in the undulating landscape. He was also intrigued by pre-historic British monuments, and had a sense of the picturesque. The exhibition demonstrates that the early builders of Bath had more than just aesthetic vision: they were business men with an understanding of leases and profit and, above all, they were completely cognizant of all the practicalities of building. One of the most fascinating facts that emerges about the building of Bath is that the 18th century building craftsman was, at his best, virtually an artist. Design at that date did not depend simply upon an architect's effort on the drawing board. It was something that was understood by the best craftsmen at his fingertips. The progeny of that rare and happy marriage of skilled hand and educated eye is to be seen everywhere in Bath. It is the craftsman's skill that prevents this carved and cut stone city from being seen as something uniform and sterile. Everywhere, inside and outside the houses, there are details and elements of elegant variety. The broad consensus of English Palladian architecture to be seen provides the measured frame for individual architectural interpretation. It is possible to understand this variety clearly by a glance at the splendid donation of carved wooden models of the facades of a whole range of Bath houses. They have all the qualities of a room full of human faces. The success of the assembly of all the houses and public buildings into one unified stone city can be judged from the large model of the whole of Georgian Bath. The visitor can also illuminate at the touch of a button the chronological sequences of the city's development and to pin-point individual buildings. There is not space to show the effect of new developments on the precious fabric of the older city, but I was told that from time to time displays about threats to the city will be shown. There are many routes into an understanding and appreciation of architecture and a popular one begins with an enthusiasm for interior decoration. There are several detailed displays about plasterwork, joinery, the composition and colour of paint and the disposition of furniture, that bring the architectural story around to style and comfort. There is no doubt about the elegance of life in the city, and the nature of the interiors helped to shape a degree of formality and manners in the conduct of the long days of pleasure. The Building of Bath Museum is already deservedly popular. It is a newly-cut key to the city, opening doors that will lead to the paths of love and understanding through the glorious architecture. The eyes and brain are stimulated in a way that immediately enhances any walk through Bath. The Preservation Trust and the whole team responsible for this skilled exercise in interpretation deserve great praise. It could be a precedent for similar displays in other historic towns.</p>

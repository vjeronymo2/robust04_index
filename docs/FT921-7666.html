			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Slow motion, but not a standstill: The state of Japan's economy after recent bad corporate results Warnings of losses at Sony, the consumer electronics group. Boardroom reshuffles at Isuzu Motors, the truck maker, and at Yamaha, the musical instrument company. Unprecedented proposals for cuts in research and development spending at Toshiba, the industrial combine. The recent wave of Japanese corporate announcements leaves no doubt that the country's economic slowdown is hurting even the largest companies. The gloom has spread far from the recession-hit financial community into important parts of manufacturing industry. An element of panic is creeping into some businessmen's pronouncements about the future. Mr Masashi Iwasaki, the vice-president of Toyota Motor, the carmaker, is not alone when he says: 'Conditions are worse than in the 1970s when we suffered from the oil shock or the 1980s when we were hit by endaka (the sharp rise in the yen).' And yet the authorities steadfastly maintain that the economy is slowing gently following unsustainably rapid growth in the late 1980s. Mr Hiroshi Yoshimoto, the deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday told a parliamentary committee that there was no risk of a sudden decline in Japanese economic activity. Who is right? Mr Iwasaki at Toyota or Mr Yoshimoto. In a sense both are  - the economy as a whole is in little danger of plunging into recession, as Mr Yoshimoto says. But the difficulties facing individual companies and even whole industries are possibly as severe as Mr Iwasaki claims. The consensus view among private sector economists in Tokyo is that Japan is in the midst of a slowdown that could last until the end of the year. Recovery may be hesitant and modest in scale. But a prolonged recession of the kind which followed the 1974 oil shock is unlikely. Businessmen's anxieties are at least understandable. The stock market is in its deepest slump since the mid-1960s. Banks are burdened with a mountain of bad debt accumulated by stock and property investors who are going bankrupt in record numbers. Insolvent companies left debts of Y8,000bn (Pounds 36bn) last year - double the previous record of 1985. Industrial companies have to cope with low growth, high inventories, and over-extended capital investment and product development programmes. Losses are never to be taken lightly. The squeeze on profits could last a year or more. However, even though many companies will face difficulties, Japanese industry as a whole is well placed to meet the challenge - by drawing on the resources accumulated in the fat years of 1987-90, the longest period of sustained growth since the second world war. Figures put the problems in perspective. Economists polled this month by Toyo Keizai, a business information company, forecast on average that economic growth would slip from 5.7 per cent in 1990-91 to about 3.5 per cent in the year to March 1992 and 2.5-3 per cent in 1992-93. That is a far cry from the oil shock year of 1974 when the economy declined 0.8 per cent. It is, however, similar to the growth of 2.6 per cent achieved in 1986, when business sentiment was at least as bad as it is today. (Then, too, one of Japan's premier companies - Nissan Motor - suffered an operating loss.) Certainly, capital investment is expected to fall in the new financial year  -the first decline in 15 years, according to Nippon Credit Bank. But the bank expects a fall of only 1 per cent with continuing increases in investment by service companies compensating for a sharp decline by manufacturers. Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business newspaper, forecast a decline of 4.5 per cent. However, these declines are from levels so high that Japan has been investing more each year than the US, an economy nearly twice as large. Consumer spending is still fairly buoyant. Spending on luxury and high-cost goods has fallen but purchases of a wide range of consumer goods and services, even including non-essential items such as holidays, remain solid. It is, for example, almost impossible to book a room in a ski resort at the weekend within travelling distance of Tokyo. Exports too have held steady, with orders from the growing economies of east Asia and to some extent from Europe compensating for weak demand from North America. Nevertheless, there is no denying the shock caused by recent corporate announcements. Sony, which this week forecast parent company operating losses of Y20bn in the year to March, has not been in the red since it was listed in 1958. Fujitsu, Toshiba and NEC, giants of the electronics industry, expect profit declines of 40-80 per cent. Toyota, with a June year-end, reported a 30 per cent decline in profits in the six months to the end of December. More nasty surprises can be expected as the great bulk of companies with March year-ends prepare their final accounts. Sluggish sales and falling profits are prompting severe cuts in corporate spending, starting with capital investment. Sony is reducing capital investment by a third to Y280bn. Toshiba says it is considering a reduction of 20-30 per cent. Other electronics group are certain to follow suit. Companies are even making cuts in their current operations. Nissan, the motor group, announced plans to close its assembly plant in Australia. Daihatsu, another vehicle manufacturer, is pulling out of the US market. Toshiba is considering cutting research and development spending - for the first time ever. The most hard-pressed companies are going as far as sacking staff - a rare move in a country where lifetime employment is the norm among large employers. But anecdotes from the corporate battle front need to be put in context. First, much of the bad news coming from manufacturing is concentrated in three industries: motors, electronics and machine-making. These sectors performed particularly well in the 1980s and are now suffering a sharp cyclical downturn. Cars, electronics and machines account for more than half of Japan's exports but only about 10 per cent of total output. Factories still dominate large swathes of Japan's urban landscape, but they now produce less than 30 per cent of the nation's output. Fully 60 per cent of output services. Next, even within these industries some groups are much better off than others. Sony is worse hit by the downturn in demand than some of its rivals because of its relatively heavy debt. Matsushita Electric Industrial, with cash in the bank, has more room for manoeuvre. Some industries have so far been untouched by the downturn, notably shipbuilding where order books are so full that companies are rehiring retired workers. Demand also remains buoyant in food processing and toiletries and other non-cyclical industries. 'Our sales are good,' says an official at Lion, a leading soap manufacturer. Even Lion may yet feel the pinch. Some supermarket chains, notably Jusco, one of the largest operators, are preparing price discounting campaigns. As one Jusco executive says: 'Consumers are more worried about their money in a recession.' That is true. But Japan is still a long way from a true recession, when the economy contracts for two successive quarters. Moreover, while some negative influences, such as cuts in capital spending by electronics companies, have still to exert their full impact on the economy, benign forces are also at work, such as the effects of last year's three cuts in the Official Discount Rate, taking it from 6 per cent to 4.5 per cent. In the last resort, it is not forecasts, which could prove too optimistic, but the ability of the authorities to react to bad news that gives confidence. The Bank of Japan has room to cut rates further and is widely expected to do so in the next two or three months. After a decade of fiscal self-restraint, the government could also launch an economy-boosting increase in public spending. Should a real recession appear on the horizon, the government has adequate room for manoeuvre.</p>

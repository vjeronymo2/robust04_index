Commenting on Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's idea of introducing the national welfare  tax, Mori stated: "The goal of the financial authorities is to  increase the consumption tax. That counters our demand that  income tax reductions be implemented to stimulate the slumping  economy. The proposed rate of 7 percent for the welfare tax  means the government will make clear gains after stop-gap  national bonds are reimbursed." The LDP secretary general thus  expressed his opposition to the idea of introducing a national  welfare tax. Regarding the procedure for deciding on the new  tax plan, Mori severely criticized the government stance,  saying: "The problem is the government is being led by the  Ministry of Finance. We see the weakness in deciding on the  policies of the Hosokawa administration which fails to assert  that the consumption tax should not be increased at the expense  of implementing tax reductions."    On the LDP's future policies toward the Hosokawa  administration, Mori said: "At the recent meeting with Prime  Minister Hosokawa, Kono did not accept the prime minister's call  for holding such meetings repeatedly." Thus he denied the  possibility of taking a cooperative line with the coalition  administration. At the same time, Mori said: "Boycotting the  Diet sessions last time did not prove to our advantage, and we  have lost trust in the LDP. Taking the stance of opposing all  policies and fighting against them is inappropriate." Mori  stressed that the LDP would take a free and unbiased stance  depending on the policies, while maintaining a certain distance  from the coalition administration for the time being.</p>

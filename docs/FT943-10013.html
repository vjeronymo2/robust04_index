			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Business Travel (Update): Aircraft freeze India's decision to freeze importation of large aircraft by newly-licenced private airlines will stall the entry of new carriers, aviation industry officials are warning. Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, India's civil aviation minister, has told parliament the government will freeze large aircraft imports because of congested air corridors and airports. But he says imports of smaller aircraft will be encouraged. Thirteen private airlines have snatched 25 per cent of Indian airlines' passengers by offering better services.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / EU priority transport projects lack cash Only five of the European Union's priority transport public works have the necessary financing in place, and budgets for the other nine are far from complete, Mr Henning Christophersen, the commissioner responsible for economic affairs, revealed yesterday. Presenting a report on the EU's cross-border road and rail projects - part of the trans-European networks project - Mr Christophersen said only three transport schemes out of a list of 14 were completely ready, and a further two were almost there. Mr Christophersen was urging foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday to accept or reject plans for the 14 priority projects - valued at a total Ecu91bn (Pounds 71bn) - at the forthcoming summit for heads of state in Essen, Germany. The report, drawn up by experts from across the Union, also proposed the adoption of 10 international energy network projects plus pan-European air traffic control measures. Its recommendations amount to an updating of last December's white paper on jobs, growth and competitiveness which is to be tackled by the heads of state at Essen. The disarray in the finances of most of the transport projects represent a setback for the desire of Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to boost European competitiveness. He had urged the use of so-called 'Euro-bonds' to fund gaps in financing, but this has been resisted by some member states, notably Britain. The UK argues that four key sources of finance - national exchequers, private finance, loans from the European Investment Bank and designated EU funds - should be sufficient to support the projects and that no additional funding instruments are necessary. Yesterday, Mr Christophersen said no doors should be closed when it came to financing. The report included a recommendation that 'measures will be taken, if proven necessary, in order that priority projects do not run into financial or other obstacles which would jeopardise their implementation'. However, the British contributor to the report distanced himself from suggestions that the Union could agree in the future to 'new' forms of financial support. The three projects for which financing is complete are: development of Malpensa airport at Milan; the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Stranraer rail link; and a fixed road and rail link between Denmark and Sweden. Finance is almost in place for development of Greek motorways and a motorway between Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, and the Spanish city of Valladolid. The report stressed that the biggest obstacles to trans-European networks were administrative. It said governments had to work to change regulations that differ from country to country and to ensure co-ordination to avoid basic problems like different electrical systems.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Accountants face BCCI inquiry PRICE Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young will be scrutinised as part of an investigation into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International launched yesterday by the accountancy profession's disciplinary body. A committee of inquiry into the collapse of BCCI has been appointed by the Joint Disciplinary Scheme, operated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, its sister institute in Scotland, and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. The committee will examine 'the conduct and competence of members and member firms' in relation to the collapse of the bank, which was closed by the Bank of England on July 5 last year. The remit is wide-ranging but is likely to examine the work of Ernst &amp; Young, auditor to BCCI until 1987, and Price Waterhouse, which took over as auditor to the worldwide group. It also has powers to examine the role of any chartered accountants who were BCCI employees. Such investigations are rare and launched only into serious issues that command a high level of public interest. The only other current investigations are into the circumstances surrounding Barlow Clowes, the disgraced fund management company, and Alexander Howden and Minet, the insurance companies criticised in a 1990 Department of Trade and Industry report for diversion of reinsurance funds. Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'From our own review, we are extremely confident about our role in BCCI. I don't feel we have anything to hide.' Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner at Price Waterhouse, said: 'There is a certain inevitability to this investigation. We will co-operate as far as the law allows. Our conduct was exemplary and our competence is of the highest order.' The investigation comes as the profession's disciplinary procedures are being hardened. The most recent finding of the scheme was a Pounds 100,000 fine against Arthur Young for its role as auditor to Millbury, the collapsed house-building group controlled by Mr Jim Raper.</p>

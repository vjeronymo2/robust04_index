			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUT SERIOUSLY, FOLKS, KLOS-FM DEEJAY BRINGS 4 COMEDIANS TO THEATER  </P> <P> The "Five O'Clock Funnies," a regular radio segment on KLOS-FM (95.5) in which  disc jockey Geno Michellini airs excerpts of comics' routines, comes to life --  and to Orange County -- in a show Saturday at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Emceed by Michellini, the show will present four comedians -- Tim Allen, John  Mendoza, Pam Stone and Dr. Gonzo -- each performing about 25-minute sets.  </P> <P> Though none is a household name, all four have been toiling on the stand-up  circuit for many years; collectively they have amassed a slew of television  credits, including "The Tonight Show," "Late Night With David Letterman" and  "George Schlatter's Comedy Club," as well as stints on HBO and Showtime cable  networks.  </P> <P> Detroit resident Tim Allen is probably one of the freshest, best comedians most  people on the West Coast haven't heard of. Early in his sets, Allen typically  sets up the premise that "men are pigs," which he punctuates with a pig snort.  </P> <P> This idea -- and the attendant pig snort -- then becomes a running theme,  usually commingled with another running theme: that men love tools. Or at least  Allen does, to the extreme that he rewires everything from the vacuum cleaner  to the garbage disposal to make them more powerful.  </P> <P> This approach may sound more strange than amusing, but it's both distinctive  and very funny, which is why Allen has been known to bring down the house in  such disparate locales as New York, Las Vegas and Pasadena.  </P> <P> New Yawker John Mendoza opts for more standard stand-up, although his act is  far from plain or generic. His material is sharp and succinct, and he rarely  lingers long on any subject before moving on to some similarly concise comment.  </P> <P> In fact, one of the strongest parts of his act is when Mendoza shifts into a  breezy hit-and-run mode, forgoing segues altogether: "Ever wonder if illiterate  people get the full effect of alphabet soup?" . . . Pause. . . . "I saw an ad  in the L.A. Times that said 'If you have a hard time making decisions, call us  at 279-8483 or 569 . . . ' " . . . Pause. "You know what the abbreviation for  July is? J-U-L. You've gotta be in a hurry."  </P> <P> Willowy Pam Stone is a native of Atlanta, where she was working as a cocktail  waitress in a comedy club when she decided to try her hand at telling jokes. It  worked.  </P> <P> Now, a few years later, she's living in Los Angeles and working as a headliner  at clubs across the country, dispensing with a slight drawl observational  comedy about assorted topics. Stone was recently nominated in the Best Female  Comedy Club Stand-Up category of the American Comedy Awards, which will be  announced later this month.  </P> <P> A longtime fixture on the Bay Area comedy scene, Dr. Gonzo (given name: John  Means) has been dubbed "The Doc of Comedy Rock." Bringing an added shot of  variety to Saturday's bill, Dr. Gonzo specializes in song parodies, which he  not only performs when headlining clubs, but as a frequent opener in arenas for  another Bay Area act, Huey Lewis and the News.  </P> <P>  The Celebrity Theatre is at 201 E. Broadway St., Anaheim. Show time: 8 p.m.  Tickets: $17.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.  </P> <P> </P></p>

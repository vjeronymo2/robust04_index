			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso says  there is no peace in Angola for the present, because the  Angolans themselves are blocking the process. The foreign  minister also says that he is pessimistic about the future of  negotiations between UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] and the Luanda government:    [Begin Barroso recording] There was an extraordinary  international investment in Angola; however, if the Angolans  themselves or part of them want to continue the war, we cannot  avoid it. We continue searching for a solution and continue  encouraging both sides to make an effort and be more flexible.  While there was somewhat more optimistic news in the past few  days, we continue to be rather pessimistic about a global,  definite solution being found for the Angolan problem. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4 TEEN-AGERS ARRESTED IN SHOOTING AT ATM, ROBBERY;  </P> <P> CRIME: A TOW TRUCK DRIVER IS WOUNDED AND A WOMAN'S PURSE IS STOLEN. SUSPECTS  ARE ALSO LINKED TO A BELLFLOWER HOLDUP.  </P> <P> Police arrested four Long Beach teen-agers early Thursday morning in connection  with the shooting of a tow truck driver at an automated teller machine and the  robbery of a woman at a 24-hour supermarket.  </P> <P> William E. Riley, 18, and three juveniles, ages 14, 16 and 17, were arrested on  suspicion of attempted murder and armed robbery, said Buena Park Police Sgt.  Terry Branum.  </P> <P> Investigators believe the four were also involved in the robbery of a man at a  Bellflower pool hall earlier in the night.  </P> <P> "These guys, I guess, were all over the place," Branum said.  </P> <P> Ronald Fuller, 44, of Westminster, was listed in fair condition at UCI Medical  Center in Orange with a bullet wound in his lower back, hospital spokeswoman  Fran Tardiff said.  </P> <P> Fuller was returning home from work shortly after 11:30 p.m. Wednesday when he  parked his tow truck at the Beach Boulevard branch of Home Savings &amp; Loan  to withdraw money from an ATM, Branum said.  </P> <P> Once he completed his transaction, Fuller was approached by four teen-agers who  demanded his money, Branum said.  </P> <P> When Fuller refused and began running, one of the youths pulled out a handgun  and fired once, wounding him, Branum said. The four fled without taking any  cash from Fuller.  </P> <P> Four minutes after Fuller was shot, the suspects drove their 1976 Cadillac  Seville into the parking lot of a 24-hour supermarket at the corner of Lincoln  and Knott avenues, Branum said.  </P> <P> As they "cruised the parking lot," Branum said, the suspects saw two women walk  out of the store and get into a car, Branum said. But before the women were  able to drive away, one of the suspects got out of the car and robbed one of  the women of her purse.  </P> <P> They drove off, heading west on Lincoln Avenue.  </P> <P> About 10 minutes later, Branum said, a Cypress police officer spotted the  Cadillac near the intersection of Cerritos Avenue and Moody Street.  </P> <P> Tailing them a few blocks, the officer pulled the Cadillac over and detained  the four occupants for Buena Park police.  </P> <P> The victim of the supermarket robbery, a 38-year-old Rancho Dominguez woman,  was able to identify the four teen-agers, Branum said.  </P> <P> A search of the car turned up a .22-caliber pistol believed to be the weapon in  the shooting of Fuller and two credit cards that belonged to the woman, Branum  said. The pistol was reported stolen in Arizona two years ago.  </P> <P> The woman's discarded purse and other personal belongings were found at the  intersection of Valley View Street and Los Molinos Drive.  </P> <P> In addition, officers searching the Home Savings &amp; Loan parking lot found a  wallet belonging to a Bellflower man who had earlier reported being robbed at a  Bellflower pool hall.  </P> <P> The wallet was being checked for fingerprints to compare them to those of the  four suspects.  </P></p>

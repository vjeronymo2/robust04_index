			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Curfew' society will need help Sir, Re the government's justification for road pricing and higher motor fuel taxes, research might well show that the 'social costs' of road use amounted to between Pounds 23bn and Pounds 26bn in 1991, twice the amount raised in road taxes ('Fading blueprint for a greener world', January 26). But without a corresponding improvement in and subsidy for public transport and alternative travel, does research show what the social costs will be for a locomotively circumscribed 'curfew' society?

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (4): Christians lose their dominance - Politics IT will take decades for a political system to evolve in Lebanon which could be seen by most Lebanese as both representative and equitable. The arrangements bequeathed by the French in 1943 were designed to perpetuate the constitutional, political and therefore economic dominance of the Christian community. It was a system which, as Christian leaders rarely fail to assert, enabled Lebanon to emerge as arguably the most affluent, cosmopolitan, and sophisticated nation in the Middle East during the three decades after the end of the Second World War. One of the most frequent, rhetorical questions asked of visitors to Lebanon is whether they knew the country before 1975. It was in that year that the fundamentally flawed system began to unravel, under the pressures of those who were substantially excluded from political and economic participation, and by the country's inability to isolate itself from the wider political turmoil. In the 17 years of intercommunal warfare and invasion that followed, the balance of power in the country has certainly changed. But rivalries and suspicions still run deep and can all too readily be fuelled by developments in the Arab-Israel conflict, in the Gulf and the current growth of Islamic fundamentalism. The core of Lebanon's political difficulties is the fact that its communities are defined primarily by religion and that each one is a minority. Worse, each of the largest broadly defined communities - essentially, Christian, Moslem and Druze - is itself sub-divided. Within those sub-divisions are powerful, often family-oriented factions which are themselves often in conflict. In turn, these rifts have made Lebanese society uniquely vulnerable to external intervention, sometimes imposed, but at other times requested. Israel, Syria, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia have been, and some still are, substantial elements in the Lebanese political equation. Among the Western nations, the US and France have also played significant roles. The biggest loser of the past decade has unquestionably been the Christian community, Maronite and Orthodox. Demoralised and fragmented, the Maronites in particular have seen their strength whittled away and, while still vital for the political and economic reconstruction of the country, feel increasingly marginalised. Their high point came in 1982-83 when Israel invaded again in an attempt, with US co-operation, to rid Lebanon of a Palestinian military presence and ultimately force out the Syrians. The Israelis succeeded in pushing out the Palestinian fighters, but could not break the Syrian grip. Bashir Gemayel, who had violently sought to unite the Christian forces, was himself assassinated soon after being elected president and the Israeli-Maronite dream was effectively at an end. Since then the Maronites have tried, mostly in vain, to stem the ebbing tide of influence, often exacerbating the trend through their own miscalculations. The latest and most serious error was the partial boycott of the general elections called last year under the terms of the Taif Agreement, which was hammered out in 1989. The agreement provided for a 50-50 Christian-Moslem representation in Parliament (in place of the 6:5 pro-Christian arrangement), the eventual termination of official appointments on a confessional basis, and formalised a Syrian role in Lebanon. The effect of the boycott was to deny a presence in Parliament for the most representative Maronite leaders, while creating a generally more pro-Syrian assembly than would have otherwise have happened. Another important side effect was to open the Parliamentary door more widely to candidates of Hizbollah, the militant Shia organisation, and the most closely watched and discussed political faction in Lebanon today. Hizbollah grew out of the politicisation of the country's poorest minority, a development provoked both by economic disparities and by the impact of Israel's invasions in 1978 and 1982. Its growth has been fostered by Iran which provides funding, estimated at close to Dollars 100m a year, and by the provision of weapons to continue the armed conflict with Israel and its Lebanese surrogates (the so-called South Lebanon Army) along the southern border. Hizbollah is the only militia not to have been ordered by the restructured Lebanese Army to hand in its heavy weapons in the wake of the Taif agreement. Although other militias are assumed still to have retained some fighting capacity, including mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, Hizbollah is by far the most potent of the irregular forces. At the same time it has established a presence in the newly-evolving political structure, while developing grassroots support through an extensive social welfare programme involving hospitals, schools, medicare and food shops for the poorest sections of society. Hizbollah appears intent on being ready for every political eventuality. Its eight members of parliament carry out their tasks assiduously, study issues closely and contribute to the committees of which they are members. The militia in the south maintains pressure on Israel's self-declared security zone, thereby reinforcing its opposition (and that of Iran) to the Middle East peace process. Its social programme meanwhile provides benefits that the central government cannot yet match. Hizbollah's future may depend heavily on external factors. Supplies can only reach it through Syria, which currently tolerates Hizbollah's military activities. If Israel and Syria ever reached a peace agreement, including an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, Hizbollah would be required to hand in its weapons. It would then have to choose whether to opt substantially for a constitutional political role, or resist the forces ranged against it. Hizbollah's leaders are also well aware of the political hostility it faces  -from within the Shia community, particularly from the Amal, the faction led by Mr Nabbih Berri, the speaker of Parliament who is closely allied to Syria; by almost the entire Christian community; and by many Sunnis and Druze. The success of the Hariri government in alleviating the worst of the country's economic ills would also in time work against Hizbollah, by undercutting many of the social services currently provided with financing from Iran. The extent to which Hizbollah tries to undermine the government by seeking to stir popular feeling against individual policies, such as the plan for the redevelopment around the airport and southern suburbs where many Shia live, could provide an early test of its intentions. Hizbollah is not, however, without its own internal divisions and almost certainly mirrors the political structure of Iran where competing groups vie for influence. Optimists in Lebanon like to be believe that ultimately the Shia community, and the Hizbollah leadership, are Lebanese nationalists at heart. They suggest that, given a sustained period of stability, Hizbollah's supporters, and the affluent members of the community, will come to feel part of the reformed political system. Pessimists, however, insist that Hizbollah is intent on the creation of an Islamic state. These elements of Hizbollah may not be alone. There are also a plethora of other radical and fundamentalist groups, Shia and Sunni, some of which may be allied to Hizbollah, others in competition, but which all are opposed to the return of what they see as government by a narrow, wealthy elite. The cabinet itself is composed of three distinct groups: first, the technocratic associates of Mr Hariri; second, men who were chosen primarily to reflect Syrian interests; and third, leaders of the former militias (except Hizbollah and the Lebanese Forces). Somehow they have to work together on the enormous task of avoiding any widening of the political stresses within the country, while pushing ahead rapidly with their ambitious but potentially divisive economic programme. What they need above all is swift progress towards a Middle East peace settlement and the enthusiastic and generous support of allies in the Arab and Western worlds. Mr Hariri is aware that time is a critical factor. The longer his government takes to produce a tangible improvement in living standards, the greater the risk of his political opponents resorting to violence.</p>

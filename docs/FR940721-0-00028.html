			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> UM&hyph;CPP commented on the issue of the flexibility of the seat assembly's seatback for testing booster seats. The commenter believes the specified seatback is too flexible to represent real-world vehicle seats, and that the flexibility unrealistically affects booster test results. In the March 1994 dummy NPRM discussed above, NHTSA announced that its research has shown that rulemaking does not appear warranted on changing the flexibility of the seatback. The research evaluated the performance of booster seats when restrained under both conditions of flexible and rigid seat back test assembly. The research findings indicated that the flexibility of the seatback is not a factor that affects the test dummy's performance during compliance testing of shield-type booster seats. These findings were summarized in a report titled, ``Evaluation of Effects of FMVSS 213 Seat Back's Flexibility on Booster Seat Responses,'' October 1992 (VRTC&hyph;82&hyph;0236, ``Child Restraint Testing (Rulemaking Support),'' DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808006.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In commenting on this issue, UM said that the research was too limited. The commenter also did not agree with the conclusion not to undertake rulemaking: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A very limited investigation of the issue concluded that shield boosters that had passed compliance tests with the flexible seatback also passed with a rigid seatback. What the report did not acknowledge was the fact that, with the rigid back, knee excursion increases were significant, and rebound in every case saw the dummy rise well above the cushion and its head well above the seatback. The VRTC film footage is more dramatic than the still frames in the report, and it also shows the impacts of the dummy's head with the structure behind the seatback. *&blank;*&blank;* I recommend that the rigid seatback be adopted now at least for the 3-point belt test procedure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA does not dispute that the flexibility of the back of the test seat assembly can affect a dummy's performance during compliance testing of shield-type booster seats. NHTSA also recognizes that there are good reasons to further evaluate the representativeness of the standard's test buck, concerning current vehicle seats. Moreover, NHTSA believes there might be other reasons that may justify changing the Standard 213 seat back, such as possible cost reductions due to not having to change the flexible pin in the seat hinges of the standard seat assembly after each test. The agency has an on-going feasibility study at VRTC to determine if a need exists to upgrade the current FMVSS 213 test buck with regard to these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, NHTSA disagrees that the agency's research was too limited. NHTSA evaluated films and test reports for all (seven) available FMVSS 213 compliance tests on child booster seats that were performed in 1990 and 1991. In addition, sled tests were conducted on each of the booster seats that showed forward movement and contact with the dummy during the compliance testing. There were four of these seats. When the seat back was fixed (rigid), the dummy's knee excursion increased. However, the increased values for knee excursions did  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exceed the 36-inch limit of FMVSS 213. In view of a lack of a safety need to revise the seat back, the agency has decided to complete the VRTC feasibility study before deciding whether to undertake rulemaking on the matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UM&hyph;CPP is correct that the dummy rose above the seat cushion when tested with the rigid seat back, and did impact its head on the structure located behind the test assembly. However, that finding is inconclusive because the impacted structure was placed on the test buck for the research and evaluation program on belt-positioning booster seats, and will not be part of the seat assembly used in FMVSS 213 compliance testing. Thus, the dummy's head will not impact the structure in an FMVSS 213 compliance test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c. Performance Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule adopts performance requirements for belt-positioning seats. This rule requires belt-positioning seats to meet the structural integrity, excursion, and injury criteria requirements of Standard 213 when dynamically tested. Those requirements include maintaining the structural integrity of the seat, retaining the head and knees of the dummy within specified excursion limits (limits on how far those portions of the body may move forward), and limiting the forces which the head and chest of the dummy may experience during the test. Compliance with these requirements better ensures that a child using the seat will not be injured by the collapse or disintegration of the seat, or by contact with the interior of the vehicle, or by experiencing intolerable forces. Commenters overwhelmingly supported dynamically testing belt-positioning seats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule does not adopt additional performance requirements for belt-positioning seats. The NPRM asked for comments on the merits of additional performance requirements, and commenters disagreed with each other on the issue. UM&hyph;CPP and Solutions Unlimited believed that the weight of the booster seat should be limited in order to limit loading the back of a child occupant. Cosco said that it is unaware of any data that indicate a safety problem with the loads that could be generated by booster seat backs. Cosco said excessive back loading would result in either higher HIC's or higher G forces, and possibly greater excursions. The commenter believed it may be unnecessary for the agency to try to measure seat back loading, unless NHTSA has research showing this phenomenon is of potential concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advocates also believed that Standard 213's dynamic test would detect problems relating to booster seat backs. The commenter urged NHTSA to_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Carefully monitor and investigate defect complaints and manufacturer data related to special design features. These aspects of booster seats can be dealt with through future rulemaking specifically addressing a problem identified by manufacturer testing and consumer use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has decided not to specify limits on seat back loading at this time. There is a lack of data indicating a safety problem. Further, there is no procedure at present for measuring or determining a threshold value for the loads imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

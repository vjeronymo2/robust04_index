			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURCHASING RAILROAD RIGHTS OF WAY FOR TRANSIT  </P> <P> I am in favor of fixed-rail transit, having been in L.A. since 1920.  </P> <P> With reference to the possible purchase of facilities from Santa Fe and  Southern Pacific, let me suggest a little investigation.  </P> <P> I suspect that those right-of-way were grants without cost to the railroads. If  such is the case, wouldn't it be nice if the railroads just turned them over to  the people at the same cost? Or a 99-year lease at $1.00 per year would be  nice.  </P> <P> A .I.

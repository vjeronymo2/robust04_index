"The incidents that took place can be divided into two  categories. The first involves people wanting to put political  pressure on the government, while those responsible for the  second category are terrorists," Chawalit said at a press  conference after a 90-minute meeting with senior police officers.    Chawalit said the March 3 grenade assault on Social Action  leader Montri Phongphanit's home, the March 8 bomb attack on a  train in Songkhla's Chana district, the March 9 grenade attack  on Deputy Permanent Secretary for Interior Sawai Phramani, the  March 13 grenade attack on the Nakhon Phanom governor's  residence and the March 20 blast in downtown Hat Ya in Songkhla  province fell into the first category.    The truckload of explosive materials which was believed to  be  aimed at the Israeli Embassy last Thursday was the work of  international terrorists the interior minister said.    "I call on the public to remain calm and analyze the  situation carefully to arrive at a rational conclusion. I have  told you before that I will take responsibility for everything  that happens," he said. But he claimed the attacks carried out  by disaffected political elements with the aim of destabilizing  the government were not of national significance.    "For example, the grenade attack in Nakhon Phanom (at the  provincial governor's home) may be a mistake on the part of the  assailants," he said.    "Acts of terrorism usually intensify and eventually lead to  armed struggle, which is exactly what happened in our country in  the past," he said.    Chawalit said his meeting with senior police officers, led  by  Police Director General Pratin Santipraphop, was to review the  political implications of the incidents and to find ways to  effectively deal with them.    He said he was satisfied with police investigations into the  incidents. But he could not set a deadline for the cases, which  he described as difficult to be solved because those involved  are not "common criminals".    "Bringing the perpetrators to justice is not beyond the arm  of the law," the minister said.    Chawalit said he was summoned by Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai  yesterday morning for a briefing on the latest developments in  the investigation into the cases.    Police sources said the interior minister imposed a code of  silence on all senior police officers except Pol Gen Pratin.    Pratin, asked to comment on criticism that police always  failed to catch people committing terrorist acts, said: "I  think we will fail to arrest any of them again this time."    Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the  National Security Council, said he briefed the prime minister on  the terrorist attacks during a two-hour meeting yesterday.    "Thailand should not be made a target of terrorist attacks.  We denounce all acts of international terrorism that affect our  internal security," Khachatphai said.    Deputy Chat Thai leader Sano Tianthong said Chawalit should  show responsibility for the violence by stepping down because  the Police Department under his ministry had failed to solve  serious crimes, particularly acts of terrorism.    "It is interesting to note that there have been many bomb  attacks since Chawalit took office as interior minister. The  interior minister is not supposed to shirk his responsibility  now," Sano said.    The deputy Chat Thai leader said he believed the violence  could be attributed to local disaffected political groups as  well as international terrorists.</p>

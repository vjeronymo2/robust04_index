			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / TUC expects flexibility in public-sector pay policy THE TUC believes that the government's new public-sector pay policy based on a cash-limits freeze for the next financial year may prove flexible enough to defuse the danger of an co-ordinated showdown between the government and public-sector unions. Union leaders representing most of Britain's 5.5m public-sector workers are due to meet at the TUC tomorrow to try to co-ordinate a response to the policy, due to come into force in November. Statements by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, have suggested to the TUC that there may be enough ways around it to prevent an over-rigid pay strategy. The magnitude of future resistance to the government's public-sector pay strategy may be evident later this week. On Thursday Fire Brigades Union leaders are due to meet the local authority employers in what they describe as a 'last chance' to secure a wage rise in November based on the 15-year pay formula that links firefighters' pay to the upper quartile of pre-tax male manual earnings. If the local government employers continue to insist that they cannot operate the pay formula this year and must act within the government's current public-sector 1.5 per cent pay limit policy, delegates to the union's planned recall conference are expected to vote for a strike ballot. Contingency plans are in place to provide emergency firefighting services if there is a strike, the Home Office said. It is understood that under certain circumstances these could include deploying troops and Green Goddess fire tenders. Voting on strike action would start next Monday with the result due on November 1. Possible disruption could start at fire stations on or after November 8 but the employers believe the firefighters will not back the union's strike call. They point out that the government's new pay policy does not prevent a return to the firefighters' pay formula in the autumn of 1994. The result of the strike ballot of 500,000 white-collar local government staff belonging to Unison, the service union, is due on Friday. The members have been asked to back six one-day strikes over six weeks.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Dental service faces shake-up Ways of extending the purchaser-provider structure of the 1991 health reforms to the dental service are being considered by the government. A green paper published yesterday envisages introducing a system under which health authorities would purchase dental services at local level. They would agree contracts with dentists to obtain services reflecting specific local conditions and the state of oral health in the area. Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said: 'The government believes that there would be clear advantages if the system of payment for dentists could be made more sensitive to local needs and priorities for dental care. That was the thrust of our changes to the wider NHS, and the benefits there are now tangible.' The dental service costs about Pounds 1.5bn a year - about 4 per cent of NHS spending - and the government says it wants to target these resources better. Reform of the current system of dental remuneration, under which dentists are paid a fee for each item of service, is envisaged by the green paper. It might be replaced by sessional fees based on the time dentists spend treating each patient. The government plans to establish pilot studies to evaluate its ideas for an alternative dental service. Such studies and a new fee system would both require legislation. There will also be consultations on ways of improving the present system of charging patients. Dr Mawhinney said a reduced examination charge, to encourage people to have regular checks, was a possi-bility.</p>

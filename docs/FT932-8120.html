			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Socialism' and human nature As no worthwhile comment on the course of the British economy can be made before today's unemployment figures, I am leaping in to fill this space with a more fundamental argument: namely why 'socialism' - in the original sense of comprehensive state ownership and direction of the economy - has proved a delusion. The most popular argument, especially among businessmen, is some version of the incentive argument. Socialism would be wonderful, it is said, but people do not work for idealist motives and require something more tangible. The whole avuncular approach is encapsulated in the awful saying: 'Anyone who is not a socialist before 21 has no heart. Anyone who is still a socialist after 21 has no head.' This kind of critique must have been heard by generations of students; and it makes little appeal. It generalises too freely about human nature and ignores many humdrum types of unpaid work, such as routine charitable and social work, regularly and competently performed by thousands. The basic argument against full-blooded socialism has little to do with selfishness. It is that without a functioning 'capitalist' market even the most noble-minded would lack the information to go about their jobs effectively. The reason can be put into a few sentences. Efficiency is not just a technical concept. There is an unlimited number of ways of producing anything: skilled workers with complicated machines can be employed, or unskilled workers with simple machines. Should word processors or typewriters be used, and which type? Should desks be of wood or steel? Is a head office a good idea, or can managers link up from their homes? There is no end to such questions. But without a pricing system, which tells us about the relative scarcity of these different inputs, a manager cannot begin to act rationally. Nor are the resulting losses trivial. The capital intensive, but wildly unsuitable and heavily polluting, industrial plants dotted about the landscape of eastern Europe are testament to the costs of an inadequate pricing system. Although the above critique is sometimes called the 'problem of socialist calculation', it is not a dry accounting matter. The price system - by which is meant not the rate of inflation but relative prices - incorporates the dispersed knowledge of millions of people, which is fed into the economic system in terms of the prices they are prepared to pay for different resources - or charge for their own inputs. A command economy throws this data away. The main originator of this informational critique of socialism was Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian-born economist who lived from 1881 to 1973. But after enjoying a vogue in the 1920s and 1930s Von Mises faded out of the view of mainstream economists who wrongly believed he had been answered. A new book makes a comparison with Karl Marx. Both thinkers 'combined erudition with a combative, frequently vituperative style of presentation, displaying in their writings little patience with critics. They each attracted a small, industrious band of dedicated disciples prepared to brave  -and reciprocate - the disdain of conventional thinkers.' This is a passage in From Marx to Mises by David Ramsay Steele (Open Court, La Salle, Illinois). Steele was a British Marxist in the 1960s, then became a Mises disciple. He is now a Chicago publisher and more sceptical of both teachers but still impressed by the 'socialist calculation' critique. He is thus well qualified to summarise the debate and put it into perspective. The Mises critique does not apply to many who call themselves socialist but really believe in welfare capitalism. Although Mises was opposed to this as well, his critique, as Steele rightly says, fails to demolish it. But for most of his lifetime, fashionable ideas went much further. They included the view that factor markets and financial markets could be replaced by conscious planning, as in war, and that intervention could be made at will, for example, by fixing any and all prices at any level the government chooses The easy rejoinder to Mises is that full-blooded socialism could not be impossible in view of the Soviet Union's 74 years of existence. A sympathetic reading of Mises is that he meant that rational calculation was impossible under socialism. What he really tried to disprove was the claim of socialism in its heyday that it would not only be more just, but would also provide at least as high a level of welfare. Indeed Mises conceded that socialism might work in a very static society, where techniques changed little, so that the discovery function of the price system was unimportant. It might also work for ascetics not too worried by material prosperity. As for the Soviet economy: it could function as well as it did because it made use of the prices established in western markets. Indeed there was a late book by Stalin urging the comrades to follow the commodity markets more closely. Eventually, however, revisionist socialists in the west and reform communists in the east embraced prices and markets. In recent decades most students of political economy have been taught not to refute the Mises critique, but to say that socialist economies both need and can have functioning markets and that ownership is irrelevant. The approved answer in a multiple choice question for students devised in the early 1970s in relation to Soviet bloc reform was: 'A freely-operating market system can perform efficiently the function of allocating scarce resources to satisfy competing wants under socialism as well as under capitalism.' This glib approach still governs most of the debate on privatisation. Why then were the reform communists of the 1970s and 1980s mistaken and why could not effective markets be created among largely state-owned industries? Mises' most convincing answer was the absence of financial markets - including a market in ownership - to determine who should control existing assets and to what uses new savings should be put. It was the absence of any mechanisms for placing ownership and control with those who could make most effective use of the assets at their command, which was probably the fatal blow to reform communism. Hence the present emphasis on privatisation. As Steele says: 'Human kind doesn't yet know of any feasible way to elicit, transmit and to bring to bear this information in a technologically-advanced society other than by substantially free financial markets in the milieu of substantially private ownership of the means of production.' From Marx to Mises is not a perfect book. Its main fault emerges in the preface where Steele writes: 'In all essentials this book would be the same if the Soviet debacle had been complete in 1921; or if it had been delayed for another 20 years after 1989.' The length of time the USSR existed and the nature of its collapse matter for assessing the importance of the fundamental weaknesses, which no amount of general argument can replace. By far the best section is that in chapter 10, summarising the modern analysis of property ownership as bundles of rights which may change their composition. Ownership is a matter of degree. Just as restrictions in capitalist countries (for example rent control) may dilute the content of ownership, so de facto property rights can emerge in a nominally socialist country, as the managers of enterprises acquire more and more rights, whether legally or otherwise. If Steele had followed up this line of thought he might have reached interesting conclusions on whether, for instance, 'nomenklatura capitalism' is better than slow privatisation in the former communist world. The author's own ending is quite different. It is a call for more rather than less utopian speculation. Although socialism has ineradicable flaws, there may be better conceived alternatives to capitalism. If Marx and his followers had not arrogantly dismissed as 'unscientific' all speculation - other than their own asides - about the society of the future, we could have been spared some misery.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE IN THE TV PRESSURE COOKER  </P> <P> Kim Le Masters calls it "the civilian equivalent of war."  </P> <P> Fred Silverman calls it "a constant merry-go-round."  </P> <P> Tony Thomopoulos calls it "a terrific opportunity for anyone to have."  </P> <P> Brandon Stoddard just called it quits.  </P> <P> The unexpected resignation of the ABC Entertainment president Tuesday served to  put the spotlight on one of the most powerful yet pressure-packed jobs in the  entertainment industry -- the television networks' chief programmers, whose  responsibility it is to try to satisfy not only their medium's insatiable  appetite for thousands of hours of television shows a year but also their  bosses' constant hunger for bigger ratings and even bigger profits.  </P> <P> But is the job itself satisfying? Stoddard, ultimately, decided no.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that "it's been a joy and a privilege in the last 19 years  as a broadcaster to put television shows on the air that hundreds of millions  of people have enjoyed and learned from," the 51-year-old executive concluded  that along with the power came too much frustration and aggravation. In short,  he said, "it's just no fun anymore."  </P> <P> Stoddard, who has been at ABC since 1970 and will remain there as president of  its in-house production division, said that the job is more difficult now than  ever before because of the "new realities" of network television, in which  audiences and profits are harder to come by as the competition for cable TV,  independent stations and videocassette recorders increases.  </P> <P> Past and present programming chiefs agree.  </P> <P> "I know exactly what he's talking about," said Kim LeMasters, president of CBS  Entertainment for the past year. "There are days when it looks so dark and  gloomy that it's not fun to even get out of bed."  </P> <P> And Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment since 1981, admitted  Wednesday that, "If you catch me on the wrong Tuesday in February, I'd complain  far worse than Brandon Stoddard did in the press about how hard these jobs are.  It does get to you. But the thing that gets you into your car early in the  morning is some of the shows you work on and some of the people you get to work  with."  </P> <P> With all this complaining, it's hard to believe that Martin Starger, who was  head of programming at ABC from 1970-1975, recalls that he didn't feel that way  at all. "I never thought of it as horrendous. Not at all. It was very exciting  for me. I have to say I had fun," he said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Starger was quick to admit, however, that his tenure "was a little different in  those days than it is now. I don't know if it was worse. But it was a different  world in the sense that in the '70s there were three networks in competition  with one another and you programmed only against your two competitors. Cable  was still in its infancy, and videocassette was a phrase that no one used at  that time. Now, the competition is a lot more than two networks."  </P> <P> Another difference, Starger noted, is the fact that as an executive he probably  had more autonomy than his counterparts today (when it is reported that even  CBS Inc. president Laurence Tisch sometimes overrules his executives on  programming decisions).  </P> <P> "The people I worked for rarely interfered with the programming department's  recommendations," recalled Starger, now president of Marstar Productions.  "Sure, there were the usual problems with budgets and money. But never  autonomy."  </P> <P> In addition, the programming departments themselves were smaller and less  bureaucratic. "They were very vital, very exciting places to work, with  one-third and one-fourth the executives that networks have now," said Starger,  whose staff included Barry Diller (now chairman of Fox Inc.) and Michael Eisner  (now chairman of Disney). "I think that's part of the frustration."  </P> <P> Another change has been the increasing attention that the news media has paid  to television and its top entertainment executives.  </P> <P> Fame has its price, LeMasters noted. Now, instead of journalists simply  reporting that a CBS or ABC program failed, "we hear that it was Kim LeMasters'  dumb idea, or Brandon Stoddard's dumb idea -- and that does wear and tear on  you."  </P> <P> "The job is more identified with the person, or the personality of the guy who  runs the entertainment division," he said. "The irony of ironies is that,  although we who run the division may want to think we are the Il Duce, we all  work off committees. But people can be quite vicious, and if you have any  sensitivity at all, it plays on you."  </P> <P> Tony Thomopoulos, president of ABC Entertainment from 1978 to 1982, pinpointed  the start of the fame game as 1975, when Fred Silverman jumped from CBS to ABC  and landed on the cover of Time magazine.  </P> <P> "When he went on the cover of Time, the whole function of the job changed," he  recalled Wednesday. "Before, we'd gotten exposure within the entertainment  community but never on a national basis. All of a sudden we were media figures  rather than just guys or gals doing a job."  </P> <P> And with the new interest in the personalities of the executives came a new  interest in the work they did. "All of a sudden, the ratings games became a way  of life not only for industry people but for the general audience. Just pick up  a newspaper and you can find Nielsen overnights. For many people, it's like  reading the box scores in sports."  </P> <P> Harvey Shephard, who was senior vice president of programs at CBS from 1980 to  1986, called this phenomenon "one of the great spectator sports in our country.  Even my father in New York one day said to me, 'Boy, did you bomb on Tuesday  nights!' "$  </P> <P> NBC's Tartikoff said he only recently has found a way to deal with being  written about -- he's now reading a book byt Richard Nixon instead of reviews  by The Times' Howard Rosenberg. "I've adapted a little bit," he shrugged. "I  don't read everything I get my hands on anymore."  </P> <P> One thing that hasn't changed about being programming chief over the years is  the hours it requires. All 24 of them.  </P> <P> "The worst thing about the job is that it never ends. You solve one problem and  three more take its place," lamented Fred Silverman, who was head of  programming for CBS from 1970 to 1975 and then president of ABC Entertainment  from 1975 to 1978. "You're living to work instead of working to live."  </P> <P> Silverman recalled with horror those days of the constantly ringing phone and  the constantly filled appointment calendar. "Once," he said, "I was flying on a  plane to somewhere, and a (program) supplier bought a seat on the flight so he  could sit next to me and sell a show."  </P> <P> Thomopoulos agreed: "It's the kind of job that, to do it properly, you must  live, breathe and sleep with it. The sheer magnitude of it becomes all  time-consuming."  </P> <P> Another is the constant pressure created by having that "report card" of  ratings follow you day in and day out.  </P> <P> Shephard, now president of Warner Bros. Television, recalled said that even for  the five years when CBS was No. 1, "People would say you must enjoy it, but in  reality, you couldn't. It was expected that the following year, you would have  to repeat that success, and you couldn't even look to weekends to unwind and  relax, because there was no hiding from the ratings."  </P> <P> Thomopoulos, former president of United Artists, believes the stress is greater  in television than in motion pictures because of the ever-present Nielsens. "In  the final analysis, you're also judged by the quality of the product and the  box office results. But it comes in better intervals so you have time to  regroup."  </P> <P> Given all this, the burn-out factor associated with the job is considered high  by most standards. LeMasters, for instance, said that while he wants to "savor  this for awhile," he knows that in three years' time he'll be looking in the  mirror "to see if the psychological damage is too great, or can I stand some  more and go on from there."  </P> <P> Of course, he noted, "people would argue that in my case it was six months."  </P> <P> Tartikoff, for his part, admitted that being programming chief is "like  relationships -- you fall in and out of love."  </P> <P> So what keeps him going? "I think that what you've got to have motivating you  at all times are two things. One, you've got to have a love for the medium of  TV. And, two, you've got to have some sort of vision that you're hoping to  accomplish, and if you accomplish that vision, you're leaving it a better  place."  </P> <P> Stoddard did all that, but still the job began to close in on him. "Frankly,"  he said, "it's like swimming faster and faster in a pond that's getting smaller  and smaller."  </P> <P> What happened to Stoddard might have been similar to what Silverman felt in the  final analysis. "You turn around one day and say, 'A piece of my life is gone  and there isn't a hell of a lot to show for it.' "  </P></p>

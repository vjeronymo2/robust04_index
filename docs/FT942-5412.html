			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: House prices rise and fall - At a Glance Homeowners were given conflicting views of the housing market by two of the main building societies this week. Halifax, the largest society, said that UK house prices fell a seasonally adjusted 1.6 per cent during May, while Nationwide said that its index showed a rise of 1.4 per cent. The monthly fall in the Halifax index left prices unchanged from a year ago, but Nationwide reported an annual rise of 3.3 per cent from last May. Halifax said the 1.6 per cent fall was unexpected, but added that there was evidence that total housing market activity had fallen in May. It said this could be due to the April tax increases and higher fixed rate mortgages.</p>

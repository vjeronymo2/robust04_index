			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: M Clark fortified for expansion - The drinks group's most ambitious deal yet Matthew Clark's expansion this week of its fortified wine and cider interests has focused attention not only on two contrasting markets, but also on one of the industry's most acquisitive companies. The Pounds 109m acquisition of Gaymer, which included the QC British sherry and Olde English Cider brands, marked Clark's sixth purchase in less than four years. It has spent Pounds 177m and launched four rights issues to transform itself from a small drinks distributor into the UK's largest independent wholesaler, and a significant producer in its own right. The change in strategy followed the arrival of Mr Peter Aikens as chief executive from Courage in 1990. In the restructuring which followed, the Clark family took a back seat and eventually withdrew altogether. 'My task was to change a paternalistic agency business into a forward-looking drinks company, which generated revenues from its own brands,' says Mr Aikens. Investors have so far agreed. The share price has doubled in just over two years, outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 61 per cent and the industry sector by 70 per cent. Following the latest issues to pay for Gaymer, the number of shares will have increased nearly fivefold to 45.8m in less than three years. The group's market value will have risen 10 times to about Pounds 250m in four and a half years. Mr Aikens says: 'We have offered investors a clear agenda of our strategy, pure and simple. We have then delivered those expectations in full and on time.' This week's deal, the most ambitious so far, has still to receive the seal of approval from City analysts. The Pounds 109m purchase price will pay off Gaymer's debts, but in addition Clark will incur Pounds 38m of reorganisation costs, as well as a Pounds 15m write down of assets. On the positive side, the company says it expects property disposals to yield about Pounds 12m, and stresses that there will be 'substantial annualised cost savings'. Mr Aikens says there will be rationalisation at both the production and distribution levels. The enlarged product range, numbering some 600 lines, would be cut by about a third, while the number of retail and wholesale customers would also be curtailed. 'Fifteen of our customers take 80 per cent of our volume, so there's definitely room for manoeuvre there,' said Mr Aikens. Analysts said the provisional restructuring costs indicated some substantial rationalisation of facilities. There was also speculation that the Warninks business, based in the Netherlands, would be sold. Mr Aikens refused to comment on where the cuts would fall. One analyst said: 'Those costs coming out are vital to the success of this venture.' Analysts say the deal should be earnings neutral for the current year and mildly enhancing in 1996. Clark said the purchase price was struck at less than 10 times Gaymer's historic earnings, although this figure was disputed by analysts who, taking into account the group's debts, put the figure nearer 20. This would be more in line with other recent deals in the industry, such as the Allied-Lyons purchase of Domecq. However, that deal involved some of the best-known brands in the industry, and some analysts questioned the value put on the likes of Babycham, QC British sherry and Olde English cider. Following the Gaymer deal, Clark will have about 45 per cent of the UK fortified wine market, and 12 per cent of the cider sector. The former market, which includes Spanish sherry, British sherry-style drinks and port, has been in decline - although the share of the lower-priced British sherry-style brands has risen. There are some signs, however, that the market may have bottomed out. 'Although the typical British sherry drinker tends to be older, female and C2, younger people are being drawn into the market because of the cheaper prices,' said Mr Robin Cooper, a drinks industry consultant. The cider market, which has been expanding at about 6 per cent a year, is facing margin pressure as consumption falters in the face of a welter of new brands. Mr Aikens said: 'Margins will come under increasing pressure and probably come down to the same sort of levels as the rest of the branded drinks business. We will not be starting a price war in the cider trade - but we will fight to protect our market share.'</p>

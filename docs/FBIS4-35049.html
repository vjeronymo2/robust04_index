			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by former Central Bank President Rodolfo </F> Rossi]    [Text] Buenos Aires, 24 Jun -- The rise in the prices of  nearly all raw materials on international markets (as well as  those of commodities [preceding word in English] of basic  manufactured goods) poses the question of whether we are  witnessing a generalized bout of worldwide inflation.    The surge in prices is seen in commodities such as coffee,  the price of which has gone up 66 percent so far this year;  wool, up 45 percent; and cotton, a 35 percent increase. As for  crude oil, the WTI [expansion unknown] currently is being quoted  at more than $20 per barrel rising from $14 in March.    Grains have recorded heavy gains. Wheat jumped to the  forefront in Chicago, rising 21 percent in the last 12 months.  Corn increased 32 percent in the same period, and soybeans were  up 18 percent.    Argentina's exports stand to benefit from this surge in the  value of grains and oil seeds. This year export earnings will  be $600 million higher than last year. It also will benefit  from the increase in the value of oil, and its exports will  total at least $1.25 billion.    Notwithstanding this, within an international context  characterized by great volatility in quotations, the drop in the  value of the U.S. dollar over the last few days leads one to  forecast an increase in international interest rates (not only  in the United States, but also in Europe) on account of the need  for attracting capital and also as a move to defend their  respective currencies (the U.S. trade deficit grew 22 percent in  April compared with the previous month, amounting to $8.4  billion).    The "climax" of the increase in interest rates, also  prompted  by the inflationary syndrome -- a rise in the value of raw  materials and commodities [preceding word in English] --  probably will offset the benefit derived from better export  prices.    The negative effect for our country would be the incidence  of  higher international prices on domestic prices, which would  adapt to the increase in prices.</p>

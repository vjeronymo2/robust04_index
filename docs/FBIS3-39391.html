It is a question of our taking the initiative."    Professor Risto Orava, head of the Research Institute of  High-Energy Physics at the Helsinki University (SEFT) admits  that the skeptics are mainly to be found within the scientific  community.    "Experts are divided into two schools of thought: those who  have no faith in the project, and those who believe that the  linear accelerator will pull Finland out of the depression."    The accelerator project was first debated in 1991 at a  conference of experts in Saariselk. This is where key  international people from the World Particle Physics Laboratory  are to meet next fall. The final decision on the construction  will be made between 1995 and 1997.    Risto Orava explains that the decision will be made on the  basis of a feasibility study. Japan and the United States, who  have competed with Finland, have in practice lost out, due to  the earthquake sensitivity of their regions.    "The particle accelerator at Stanford University in  California broke in two in a tremor that preceded the major  earthquake this week. It is unlikely that the Americans would  again invest millions just to ensure that the institute is  installed in their own country.    "Finland's strong points are its solid bedrock, technical  infrastructure, and stable political situation. The World  Laboratory of Particle Physics, which may be ready as early as  2005, will be dedicated to basic physical research and the study  of elementary particles. The world's sixth largest particle  laboratory, which is to be financed by the international  community, will cost 40 billion Finnish markkas [FMk].  Finland's share of the investment is in the order of 1 percent,  i.e., we are in practice only expected to contribute with the  required land area.    "The laboratory's operating costs will be about FMk1 billion  per year. The research institute will employ thousands of  researchers and technical experts, in total about 10,000 people  including families. The 40-km-long accelerator will be built at  a depth of 100 mt under the ground. The worldwide annual cost  for the prestudy of the linear accelerator is at the present  FMk300 to 500 million. In order to establish its credibility as  host country, Finland is expected to contribute about FMk4 to 5  billion."    Risto Orava maintains that Finnish research in particle  physics is on a high international level. "We are members of  CERN [European Center for Nuclear Research], where we rank third  after Switzerland and France in terms of our ability to exploit  the results of the work carried out. Finland has several  ongoing R&amp;D projects related to the construction of a linear  accelerator. Research institutes and industries take part in  these projects.    "The potential benefit from the design, development, and  construction of the components is enormous. The electron  source, the positron source, the damper ring, the particle  bundler, the preaccelerator, the main accelerator, the focusing  system, and the test station offer work opportunities for  researchers and the industry."</p>

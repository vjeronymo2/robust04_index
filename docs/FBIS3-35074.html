			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, chairman of </F> the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation and a member of  the Palestinian negotiating team to the Arab-Israeli peace  talks, in Jerusalem, by Fayiz al-Miliji, in Cairo; date not  given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Miliji] Welcome to our program.    [Abu-'Ayyash] Thank you.    [Al-Miliji] Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli  Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres signed an agreement in Cairo, which was  followed by talks in Taba. Do you feel the Palestinian issue is  on its way to a final settlement?    [Abu-'Ayyash] As brother President 'Arafat said, the name of  Palestine has been placed firmly on the map. What our  negotiating teams are doing in Taba, Washington, and elsewhere  is to confirm this political right. In my opinion, the  Palestinian issue is on its way to a solution. This is true,  despite the numerous difficulties and the obstacles still facing  the two sides and holding back a final settlement.    [Al-Miliji] The entire world, East and West, has long  provided the Middle East with weapons. Now the Middle East  region is looking forward to peace. What do the Palestinians  expect from the world in time of peace?    [Abu-'Ayyash] I believe the road toward creating a Middle  East region that enjoys prosperity, peace, and security will be  full of challenges. One such challenge has to do with the  weapons to which you have just referred. The world must provide  the various countries in the region, particularly the  Palestinian people, with expertise and massive economic support.  This aid is needed if the Palestinians are to rebuild their  infrastructure and cope with the fast-paced economic changes in  the world.    Peace is more than signing a paper or agreement. It is the  translation of these agreements into tangible facts and into  measures enabling the regions' nations to live in peace and  security. Peace involves security, justice, and rights for  everyone.    [Al-Miliji] As the moment of Palestinian self-determination  in the transitional phase draws near, how do you see future  Jordanian-Palestinian relations?    [Abu-'Ayyash] My dear friend, the relationship between the  brothers in Jordan and the brother Palestinians is long and  special. Due to the Palestinian tragedy, the Palestinians  blended with the Jordanians to form one family. I think future  Palestinian-Jordanian relations will be special. The  Palestinians also have warm relations with other Arabs,  particularly the Egyptians, and their relationship with Syria  and Lebanon is one of cooperation.    But specific and clear political programs must be  formulated.  I think the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples should be left  free to determine the shape of their relations once the  Palestinian people are free from the yoke of Israeli occupation  and have restored their rights, which, I believe, is just a  matter of time.    [Al-Miliji] In the latest meetings of the  Palestinian-Jordanian Committee, did the two sides discuss the  future relationship between the Jordanians and Palestinians once  the Palestinians get their right to self-determination?    [Abu-'Ayyash] Yes they did. There are several committees  that meet occasionally, such as the Jordanian-Palestinian Higher  Coordination Committee, which will draft things like economic  ties, the refugees issue, the crossing points, and other issues  relating to the daily life of the Palestinian and Jordanian  peoples. I believe that all these relations and drafts worked  out by the PLO institutions and the Jordanian Government will  necessarily put things in focus for the Palestinian people once  the final status of their political future, in the form of an  independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil, is determined.    [Al-Miliji] This leads us to another topic, namely,  relations  with sisterly Egypt. Palestinian police cadres recently  received training at the Egyptian Police Academy. As chairman  of the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation, what are  the avenues for prospective cooperation between you and the  Egyptian Radio and Television Union [RTU]?    [Abu-'Ayyash] It has been my honor to meet with the brothers  in Egyptian radio and television and with some production  circles. I was particularly pleased that Information Minister  Safwat al-Sharif gave us all the necessary facilities to train  the Palestinian cadres, such as the police cadres.  Approximately 60 Palestinian media cadres from the occupied  territories and from the diaspora are due in Egypt on 23 March  to receive a six-week training course along with their Egyptian  colleagues at the Egyptian RTU. Once this course is over, we  may say we have cadres who are well versed in the established  Egyptian school of media, which could benefit us. Our relations  with the brothers in Egypt are very close, fraternal, and long,  not just in the form of agreements, but also in practice, going  back even before 1948.    [Al-Miliji] Abu-'Ayyash: Thank you very much.    [Abu-'Ayyash] Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / RICK HAZELTINE: ABBOTT MOVES UP AND KEEPS WINNING  </P> <P> Kyle Abbott was a successful pitcher at UC San Diego for two years. But whether  he could carry that success from the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  Division III Tritons to a Division I program was another question.  </P> <P> Abbott seems to have answered the question with ease after transferring from  UCSD to Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Abbott played his freshman and sophomore seasons at UCSD, helping the Tritons  to the Division III World Series his freshman year. But after two years, Abbott  decided to see if he could carry that success to the Division I level.  </P> <P> So far he hasn't had too much trouble. Abbott, a 6-foot-5 left-hander, is 5-0  with a 1.70 earned-run average. Abbott has victories over Pepperdine (4-3),  Arizona (8-6), Loyola Marymount (9-0), USD (11-5), and St. Mary's (15-0).  </P> <P> "I watched a lot of Division I players on ESPN over the summer," Abbott said.  "I always thought I could do it, but I didn't know how well I'd do."  </P> <P> Abbott, from Mission Viejo, was 3-1 with two saves and a 1.70 ERA his freshman  year as the Tritons advanced to the World Series for the first time. His  sophomore year, Abbott was 5-1 with three saves and a 1.88 ERA.  </P> <P> He had to sit out a month during his sophomore season because he had  insufficient academic units and he admitted he was struggling with his classes,  carrying a 2.5 grade-point average.  </P> <P> Those factors and his performance last summer combined to help him decide to  try the Division I level.  </P> <P> "I had a great summer league and that's what convinced me," said Abbott, who  played in a summer league in Los Angeles with a number of Division I players.  </P> <P> But facing Division III hitters most of the season is different than going  against Division I athletes.  </P> <P> "I wasn't worried about it," Abbott said. "The only thing keeping me from  leaving was my friends. But I thought the opportunity to play was worth it."  </P> <P> Baseball is nothing new to Abbott. His father, Larry, was a pitcher in the  Oakland Athletics' organization for seven years, reaching the triple-A level.  Abbott also thought he would have a better chance at being drafted higher with  good numbers from a Division I school as opposed to a Division III program.  </P> <P> U.S. International University's Demetrius Laffitte finished his basketball  season a little early, suffering a slight ligament tear in his right knee  Saturday against San Diego State.  </P> <P> Laffitte, who played at Monte Vista High School, played at Cal State Long Beach  and Grossmont College before transferring to USIU.  </P> <P> He had a fine junior year this season, leading the team in scoring and  rebounding. Laffitte, a 6-5 forward, averaged 18.5 points and 10.4 rebounds per  game. He also shot 55.4% from the field.  </P> <P> He averaged 10.4 rebounds during the season, the second-best total in school  history. (Don Robinson averaged 11.8 in 1981-82.) His season shooting  percentage of 55.4 was also second to Steve Frederick's school-record 57.9 in  1983-84.  </P> <P> Guard Steve Smith set the single-season assist record with his first assist  against San Diego State last week, finishing the season with 127. The record  was 121 set by Joe Yezbak in 1986-87.  </P> <P> The University of San Diego men's tennis team is ranked No. 21 nationally.  Freshman Jose Luis Noriega is ranked No. 78, senior Mark Farren is No. 81 and  junior Dan Mattera is No. 86 in the individual rankings. Noriega and senior  David Stewart are the No. 32-ranked doubles team.  </P> <P> The UC San Diego women's basketball team finished a record-setting year. The  Tritons were 19-6, breaking the school record for victories set when the  1982-83 finished 17-9.  </P></p>

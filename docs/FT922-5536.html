			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: Pension funds should be shared equitably Sir, Barbara Ellis argued ('Pensions hit by backdoor raids', May 16) that, in a pension scheme with a healthy surplus, to exercise augmentation powers to help employees being made redundant harms the expectations of members remaining in service. Those suffering the shock and longer-term hardship of redundancy might not agree. The other side of the argument is that such an exercise of augmentation powers - normally powers given to the employer subject to the consent of the trustees - is a good way of utilising surplus consistent with the scheme's objects of providing retirement benefits for employees and ex-employees and their dependants. The duty of the trustees is to see that the fund is used equitably between members (whether still in service or not) and not necessarily equally. Those continuing in employment will accrue further years of pensionable service and can expect that their pay will at least keep pace with inflation. Barbara Ellis quoted two trade union opinions. I am disappointed that Bryn Davies did not express a more rounded view. The article seems to hark back to the historic union standpoint of being predominantly concerned with those members still in employment at the expense of those made redundant or already retired. Since surpluses are often attributable to funding for the future service of employees who did not in fact complete that service, its use to improve redundancy packages should not be attacked in such a general and partisan manner.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Petrovac, June 3 (TANJUG) -- A member of the forces  of the autonomous province of western Bosnia was killed Thursday  [2 June] in attacks by forces loyal to Bosnian Muslim leader  Alija Izetbegovic, local Muslim media reported. According to  Radio Velkaton in Velika Kladusa, the capital of the province,  the heaviest fighting was reported in the Liskovac region and  the forces of the autonomous province tried to prevent  Izetbegovic's forces from penetrating their defense lines.    The same source says that Izetbegovic forces continued with  heavy shelling of Pecigrad. Muslims in the western part of the  former republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina declared their autonomy  last September standing up against the war-mongering policy of  Izetbegovic and disassociating themselves from the decisions of  the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo.    Since then, Western Bosnia-Herzegovina has been the scene of  fierce intra-Muslim clashes, where Izetbegovic has sent his  troops against his countrymen instructing them to stifle the new  autonomy `with all available means'.</p>

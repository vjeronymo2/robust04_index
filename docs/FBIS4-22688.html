			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major General Viktor Filatov: "Army, Save </F> Russia! Outlines of a Secret Plan"]    [Text] Amnesty and freedom--are they the same thing? One  time I happened to be in Surgut and I could not restrain  myself--I visited a famous site there--the hard labor colony. In  terms of the number of "personnel"--1,600 people--it was no  different from a full-fledged motorized infantry regiment! I  know barracks: from those of flyers and people serving on  submarines to those special forces and construction battalions.  In the sleeping quarters, the dining room, the recreation  facilities, and the work places in the Surgut hard labor colony,  at least externally, things were better than in our units and  subdivisions. The prisoners in the camp looked more cheerful and  sharper than the soldiers in our garrisons. The commander of the  colony was a colonel, just as colonels are at the "helm" of our  divisions almost everywhere....    The "outside" and "demobilization"--what is the difference?  If they were "taken" or "called up"--how are these different?  "There" they begin with being "arrested" by the militia, and  "here"--"recruitment" to the military commissariat. "There" they  begin with the "agenda" and "here"--the same thing. "There"--"a  training school" and "here"--"a training school"...    But the soldier does not have such a benefit as--amnesty.  For  the soldier it is all the way, as for murder. This is true: Our  army is constantly being threatened with cutbacks, but this does  not affect people serving their stint on active duty, but for  officers it means banishment, falling to the bottom. In any case  amnesty is to the benefit of the government--the benefactor!--it  always adds those who receive amnesty to the ranks of its  supporters. The part of the army that is cut back is always an  army against the government.    Today, in addition to everything else, the army knows that  on  4 October 1993 it was drawn, through deceit, into the dirty and  bloody affair against its own people. With its help the regime,  albeit only apparent and implied, held on--and this is called  "digging in its heels." The army would not be likely to make the  same mistake again.    Now Yeltsin has a problem--how to get back the written order  he gave to Grachev for the tanks to fire on the House of  Soviets. It turns out that Pasha is not that simple--he...took  it and "lost" it. The entire Ministry of Defense and General  Staff are "looking" for it today.    Amnesty has always been declared in honor of victory and the  victors. The present amnesty is in honor of the new  constitution, which essentially legitimizes the regime of  occupation and plundering of the country. Whose victory is it,  who is the victor? The new constitution, like any constitution,  must be defended. But who will defend this one? Logically, if it  is in honor of the new constitution, the criminals will walk  through the gates of the camps, and from the moment of their  release they will defend it. In general has anyone thought about  the words "the government took advantage of criminals and  criminal elements for its own interests"? What does this mean  concretely?    It took approximately two years to prepare the army for war  against fascist Germany: In 1938 it was a standing army, like  the Germans', and in 1939 a law was adopted concerning universal  military service, just as the Germans had. Today the Moscow  rulers are shouting to all the world: A terrible internal enemy  has appeared in Russia--Russian nationalism. The  internationalists have a precise formula for this: If the enemy  does not give up, destroy him. And such things require a strong,  well-trained army.    Approximately two years ago Yeltsin headed up a commission  on  fighting crime. All the jails are now overflowing. There are  three or four people for every bunk. But crime is growing  immensely. Why? Did they arrest the wrong ones? They "arrested"  the ones they needed--young people who had been in Afghanistan,  who had served in the army, former militiamen, workers of the  Committee on Security--in a word, the military commissariats  were working, and they were "drafted into the army."    Now 220,000 criminals are free. A "small but modern  army"--the "Kremlin sergeants" say now. The only thing is that  it is "small" in mind as well.    The authorities already purport to be concerned that in  April-May there could be a "social upheaval." Could this not  happen at 0400 on 22 June? Why April-May? Is it not because by  that date it will be possible to "release from the ranks" those  220,000 amnestied "demobilized" people, to "relocate" them, to  station them so that they will be able to look around the  localities, go on "reconnaissance" missions, look over the  future "battlefield"?...    Two years these young people who are supposed to be  criminals  have spent in "training school." The brigade--the platoon, the  shop, section--the battalion...every platoon, every battalion  has its number. The "battalion of defenders of the Kremlin No.  666"...throughout the entire world they are called "death  squadrons."    But that will come later; first--the circles of prison camp  hell. The masters there since the times of the NKVD [People's  Commissariat of Internal Affairs] People's Commissar Iyeguda,  for Russians Yagoda. He was the organizer and inspiration for  the GULags of 1931-1938. Among the GULag chiefs was his  kinsman-Berman.    During this period the main thing is to be able to crush a  person as an individual, to frighten him to the point of animal  terror so that it seems to him that there is no way out, and if  there is, there is only one--the noose. It is impossible to  bring the present-day criminal to such a condition in the  camp--he is at home there, he is his own person there. But it is  the criminal--the sadist and the pervert, the drug addict and  the tuberculosis patient, the psychiatric patient and the  torturer--they perform this "educational work" under the wise  leadership of the "citizen boss." The criminal is like the  division commander, the senior man in a regiment of new recruits.    In the language of criminals, a person who has committed a  "minor offense" and is in jail, not knowing what for--this  person is an "ox." And after the "ox" is already beginning to  try the noose on his neck for size, suddenly the "citizen boss"  says to him approximately the following: "A new constitution has  been adopted. It has been signed by President Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin. According to this constitution Yeltsin is fighting for  your amnesty. Pray for Boris Nikolayevich because out there, on  the outside, he has many enemies. They do not want you to have  amnesty but our president is a go-getter..." and he gives the  person, as they say nowadays, a light at the end of the tunnel.  The "ox" goes around to everyone explaining that "our own  father, the savior Yeltsin" must be protected, and there is  nobody on the outside except him to stand up for the "ox" and  there are enemies out there: fascists and nationalists. "Do you  agree?"--This is how the "government has taken advantage of  criminals for its own purposes."    In the colonies and camps this or approximately this was the  way they asked the people they needed right after Yeltsin pushed  his constitution through. But this question was raised  especially pointedly after 4 October 1993. At that time Gaydar  called out into the streets of Moscow those same "oxen," but  they were "demobilized" in a different way: "For good  work"--ahead of schedule. As they say: "Master, the assignment  has been carried out."    In April-May of this year a real "small but modern army"  will  be put to work. They will think long and hard, for example,  about such a "special case" as when the military general and  hero of Afghanistan Gromov suddenly, when Yazov was still in  office, became deputy minister of internal affairs. As a  counterbalance to the patriot and statesman Yazov? To train a  regular professional army against the internal enemy, about  which we had not heard a single thing at the time?    A few more than 220,000 people are now being released--not  many more than there were in the 40th Army with Gromov as  commander. The regimental horizons were calculated and taken  into account.    The patriots: "Hoorah! Our victory!" It is not much of a  victory when criminals grant freedom to honest people and seem  to change places with them. The patriots must clarify: This  amnesty is the beginning of a large-scale operation. It was  begun by forces that fired from tanks at the House of Soviets.  Then there was a concrete task--to destroy soviet power.    Lieutenant Colonel Yushenkov--a teacher of Marxism-Leninism  at the Academy imeni Lenin and now one of the fiercest  supporters of the occupiers, does not conceal the fact that  amnesty will be the beginning of a civil war in which they, the  "democrats," will destroy "Russian fascism," meaning everything  that is national and Russian from time immemorial.    They planned this amnesty way back two years ago. "Taking  advantage" of the Duma's patriotism, they released about a dozen  of "our" people. Anpilov, for example, immediately took up his  "atom bomb"--the microphone...but "they" used this amnesty to  create and mobilize an entire army. It went through its "combat  training" in such model-demonstration hard labor camps as I saw  in Surgut.    In April-May everything will be like in training sessions  where they choose up sides: The "reds" will be ardently in favor  of...the Kremlin, the "blues" will persistently defend and  protect...the Kremlin. For a large combat training maneuver they  usually plan for 15-20 corpses, and the causes of death vary,  but, as a rule, they are caused by carelessness and drunkenness.  The "reds" and the "blues" are only conventional designations  for soldiers of the same army of "Kremlin sergeants." Each only  depicts the opponent, the enemy.    More than 15 or 20 corpses are planned for the Kremlin walls  during April-May. Everything is envisioned, even what Yeltsin  will say at the funerals. In addition to everything else, he  will announce an edict there concerning the introduction of a  state of emergency throughout the country for two years.    "Victory!" Yushenkov will shout heart-rendingly. And the  appointees will rush to their places. To all the posts and  positions. For two years. And "our people" will be returned to  their cubicles.    The journalists and Poltoranin are worried that there will  be  no money for paper. How Poltoranin toys with them! He knows that  in a month or two all these problems will evaporate because all  that will be left will be two or three occupation newspapers  like IZVESTIYA and MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, and there will be  plenty of paper for them.    And they should not delude themselves and placate themselves  with the idea that confusion and even panic, incoherence and  even hostility will constantly reign in the Kremlin's corridors.  This will occur on the floors housing the uninitiated. That is  the way it is designed. You must know Yeltsin. When he was first  secretary of the Moscow City Committee he had two party city  committees: One was his own personal one, almost his family,  which did all the work, and the city committee which all  Muscovites knew--it signed papers and hung flags throughout  Moscow on revolutionary holidays.    And today there are two Kremlins: One Kremlin makes the  decisions and the other one runs around making stupid  announcements, conducts pointless news conferences, squabbles,  intrigues, they scheme against one another, and, looking  intelligent, make predictions and produce models. But all these  are people "researchers." But they are not allowed within  machine gun range of Yeltsin's holy of holies. So "that Kremlin"  works, like a finely tuned mechanism, without interruptions and  failures. Ultimately to hell with them, with this "second  Kremlin," if there were any improvement in the country. But,  after all, it is quite the opposite.    Is everything calculated? Have we been sentenced? Is there  no  way out? But...and again the last hope--our national army. Even  today it must know that in April-May or a little sooner or a  little later under the walls of the Kremlin the "reds" released  under amnesty from the prison camps and the "blues" from the  same place will earn their "ransom." They will have no  "refuseniks," there will be none who are timid. Each has placed  his life on the line--freedom or back to the hell of the  criminal zone. If there is a person--an article will be  found!--everybody who has received amnesty knows this is true.    They will burn and slaughter, take scalps and disembowel  people, as in the House of Soviets on 4 October 1993. The  reason? Luzhkov will permit Anpilov to hold a rally. Luzhkov  will permit the National Liberation Front to picket the Kremlin,  etc., etc.    Army, save Russia!    Three months is all the General Staff will need to bring  order to the country's economy. It has all the specialists,  departments, and administrations needed for this. Three months  is all the army will need to bring order into the country, to  put an end to the civil war, even that which is blazing in the  outlying regions, the mafia, and gangsterism in the cities.    What next? Next--that is no longer a problem for the army,  but for the nationally elected Duma. Armies have a task: To pull  the cart out of the swamp, to put things on a firm basis--and  then back to the barracks. The clock has been set, the time has  been checked. The operation against the Russians has entered its  final phase....</p>

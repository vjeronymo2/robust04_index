			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 13 May -- The Democratic People's Republic of  Korea [DPRK] is for a political settlement to the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula, a settlement based on the  agreements reached with the USA, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister  Aleksandr Panov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today after the  consultations between the deputy foreign ministers of Russia and  the DPRK, which took place 12-13 May. Representing the DPRK was  Deputy Foreign Minster Yi In-Kui. For the first time, Aleksandr  Panov said, North Korea has stated quite firmly that it welcomes  Russia's initiative on holding an international conference on  security in, and a non- nuclear status for the Korean peninsula.  Pyongyang is interested in the Russian initiative and is  studying it.    The issue of the DPRK's special status in the Treaty on Non-  Proliferation of nuclear weapons could give rise, and is giving  rise, to some concern, since this path could in the end damage  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons regime. The Russian  side took account of this during the political consultations,  Russia's deputy foreign minister said.    North Korea said it did not want to drag out its term under  this status, but wanted to settle the problem.    Moscow expressed its concern at the situation that has  developed with the armistice -- in existence since 1953 -- now  that the DPRK has decided to give up this whole system and start  direct talks with the USA.    Pyongyang explained the situation by saying this system is  not operating anyway and is even being used to hide a build-up  of American military presence in South Korea.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago del Estero -- A group of nearly 50  provincial pensioners have been peacefully evicted by Infantry  Guards from the Social Security Institute. The pensioners  entered the premises early in the morning. Then they urged the  administrative personnel to drop what they were doing and join  their protest against the possible transfer of the institute to  the nation.    Interior Security Secretary Brigadier Andres Antonietti and  Police Chief Superintendent General Omar Abdala, who came to the  institute to learn what was going on, ordered the police to  evict the protesting pensioners, who left without resistance but  did shout, chant, and hurl insults.    The federal trustee, meanwhile, has been broadcasting a  public message stating that the provincial pension fund is  running a deficit of 5 million pesos per month.    The message says the government could order the construction  of many infrastructure projects in one year with that money.  The message also says pensioners will not have their acquired  rights trimmed if the service is transferred to the nation.  <H5>  Resignation in Catamarca </H5>   Catamarca (TELAM) -- Yesterday, Governor Arnoldo Castillo  said Economy Ministry Aldo Nieva resigned because of the  provincial decision to transfer the social security system to  the nation. Nieva was at his post for only 60 days, but from  the very first he opposed the transfer of the Social Security  Institute to the nation.  <H5>  Alert in Entre Rios </H5>   Parana (TELAM) -- The Entre Rios Civil Servants Association  (ATE) has declared a state of maximum alert given the possible  provincial decision to transfer the local pension fund to the  nation. The union issued a communique saying that in view of  "the imminent risk of the transfer of our pension fund, it is  necessary to immediately coordinate resistance actions with  pensioner associations and sister organizations."    Provincial Governor Mario Moine said "for the time being, we  have not made a decision to transfer" the pension fund.  Pensioner associations, however, have demanded a clear  definition of the funds' future.  <H5>  Cordoba Opposed </H5>   Cordoba -- Economy Ministry Jorge Caminotti said "the  province is not thinking of surrendering its pension fund"  despite pressure from the national government to transfer.    He said the nation has promised to respect pensioners'  acquired rights if the fund is transferred, but it has not made  any promises about people who will retire from now on.    Caminotti said "for us, the point is not negotiable. This is  because in Cordoba, legal contributions and retentions have  always been correctly paid. We take into account the entire  salary, and not just half of it, as is customary in other  jurisdictions."    Caminotti added: "This means we are not ready to put people  who have made sacrifices for many years on an equal level with  people who have not fulfilled their obligations."    Caminotti recalled that when the province told the nation  about the need to have different treatment for new pensioners,  "the national government harshly rejected our proposal. For us,  the transfer involves a very important injustice, which we are  not ready to accept."</p>

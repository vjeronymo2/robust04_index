			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Armament: The Apache Missile </F> Flies"]    [Text] Two air-to-ground Apache missiles, developed by  Matra-Defense, were carried for the first time under the wings  of a German Tornado aircraft of the Luftwaffe. The Apache, a  French version of the cruise missile, employs stealth technology  and flies at a low altitude. Moreover, the Apache is equipped  with navigation systems that allow exceptional precision  targeting. The version ordered by the Luftwaffe and which is  being developed in the framework of a 2.2-billion French franc  [Fr] contract (with Fr600 million for adapting the missile) is  the "antiship submunitions dispenser." The objective is to equip  the 180 German Tornado planes with those missiles within the  framework of a modernization program. The final contracts could  then involve several billion French francs.    The development of the Apache, which was initiated in 1989,  has reached the stage of in-flight testing. The French version,  intended to be used by the Mirage 2000 D first and then by the  Rafale, will be operational in 1997. Right now, Matra is  planning to propose an even more effective version.</p>

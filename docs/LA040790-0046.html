			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOURNALIST FACES NEW 'HACKER' CHARGES  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors dropped charges Friday against a free-lance journalist who  was arrested for allegedly trying to steal information from the computers of  Fox Television's tabloid show "A Current Affair," but hours later he faced  similar "computer hacking" charges in state court.  </P> <P> Stuart Goldman, 44, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Los Angeles  Municipal Court and was released on his own recognizance.  </P> <P> Goldman was arrested March 8 at his Studio City apartment, where Los Angeles  police confiscated his personal computer and floppy disks.  </P> <P> The next day, federal and state officials announced that Goldman had attempted  to steal sensitive information from Fox computers in New York and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Fox officials told authorities that someone had been trying to gain access to  their computers and that the hacker used the same computer password in both  cities.  </P> <P> Goldman had worked briefly for "A Current Affair," a show that offers a mix of  gossip and news. Goldman also worked for a competing show called "Hard Copy."  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors filed an affidavit in U.S. District Court in New York last  month stating that Goldman had attempted to gain access to sensitive files  regarding news stories worked on by Fox journalists.  </P> <P> Neither law enforcement nor Fox officials have said what information they  believe Goldman was seeking.  </P> <P> Goldman recently tried to sell an inside story on so-called tabloid television  shows to the Los Angeles Times. On Friday, Goldman said the research on his  article was complete, but declined to say if he had found someone to publish  it.  </P> <P> Goldman's attorney, Alan Rubin of West Los Angeles, said Friday morning that he  had persuaded the U.S. attorney's office in New York to drop the federal  charges there.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors would not comment on why the charges in New York were  dropped. Fox spokesman Dennis Petroskey also declined any comment on the case.  </P> <P> Friday afternoon, the district attorney's office charged Goldman with seven  felony counts of violating the California Penal Code section prohibiting  unauthorized access to computers. Goldman used another person's access code to  gain entry to a Fox television computer at Channel 11 in Hollywood, according  to Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. She said  Goldman used telephone lines to extract material from Fox computers and place  it into his home computer.  </P> <P> Goldman, who has written articles for National Review magazine and the Los  Angeles Times, among other publications, faces a maximum six-year prison term  if convicted on all charges, Gibbons said.  </P></p>

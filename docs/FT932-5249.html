			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Cap Gemini blames losses on overstaffing CAP GEMINI SOGETI, the French-based computing services company in which Daimler Benz of Germany has a 34 per cent stake, yesterday blamed its 1992 losses on the economic situation coupled with management failures to deal early enough with overstaffing and sluggish marketing. Mr Serge Kampf, chairman, said there had been an appreciable decline in the number of orders produced while across the group there had been delays in cutting staff numbers to match lower levels of revenue. Cap Gemini lost FFr72m (Dollars 14m) last year compared with taxable profits of FFr560m in 1991. Revenues grew 18.5 per cent to FFr11.9bn but the increase came entirely from acquisitions. The group is looking for further equity partners, with an emphasis on telecommunications, and Mr Kampf expressed considerable exasperation over the failure of the French government to indicate whether France Telecom would be allowed to take a stake in the company. The two companies have been talking for more than a year but complications following Daimler-Benz's acquisition of a 34 per cent stake in Sogeti, the CGS holding company, had delayed a deal. CGS is Europe's leading computer services company and fifth in the world rankings. Mr Kampf said he now believed that no computing services company could afford to be all things to all clients and that in the future the company would be selective in its choice of activities. He was gloomy about the prospects for the current year, saying he could see no clear signs of a revival in mainland Europe, although there were brighter indications in the UK where the company owns the computing services group, Hoskyns.</p>

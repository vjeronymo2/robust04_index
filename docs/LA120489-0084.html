			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'BLUE-COLLAR' SCHOOLS CHIEF CHANGES SANTA ANA IMAGE  </P> <P> Rudy Castruita swept into the Santa Ana Unified School District  superintendent's office a year ago last week with a flurry of activity, egging  on students with the force of his boisterous personality and assuring parents  that he would tackle overcrowding and other district problems.  </P> <P> Now, with one school year behind him and a second just under way, the  self-described "blue-collar superintendent" already can point to some  noteworthy accomplishments: During his short tenure, Santa Ana has held its  first peaceful salary negotiations in nearly a decade, pursued an ambitious  land acquisition and school construction program, and forged strong ties to the  city and state governments.  </P> <P> "It's been a fantastic year, a great experience with great opportunities," the  personable superintendent said in an interview last week. "We're doing  something special, and we're going to achieve great things."  </P> <P> Castruita's pitch is so animated that he makes it easy to forget the challenges  he faces. Already Orange County's largest district, Santa Ana grows  exponentially, never failing to exceed planners' expectations. When he took  over last November, Castruita inherited the state's ninth-largest district.  Today, he presides over the eighth-largest, and it's growing almost every day.  </P> <P> What's more, most of the district's 43,000 students have limited English  skills, and 36% are immigrants, speaking close to 40 different languages and  dialects, with Tagalog and Farsi-speaking students rounding out classes of  youngsters who speak Spanish or Vietnamese. Test scores improved for  eighth-graders last year, but fell or held steady for third- and sixth-graders,  tracking state trends. And dropouts continue to confound educators' efforts to  keep their students in school.  </P> <P> "It's an amazingly difficult district because of its size and fast-changing  demographics," said Kenneth Hall, president of School Services of California, a  private educational consulting firm based in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Still, if there's one thing that nearly all local educators agree on, it's that  Castruita is up to the task of managing the melting pot district.  </P> <P> Raised by his grandparents in El Monte, the 45-year-old superintendent entered  elementary school not knowing English and became the first member of his family  to graduate from high school. He went on to college, then earned a doctorate in  education administration from USC. Castruita served as a teacher and  administrator in the El Monte Union High School District and as principal of  Los Alamitos High School before joining the administrative ranks of Santa Ana  Unified four years ago as assistant superintendent of the secondary division.  </P> <P> Last year, Castruita replaced former Supt. Edward S. Krass, who resigned for  health reasons. Castruita received a three-year contract at $85,000 per year --  $15,000 more than Krass was paid.  </P> <P> Castruita's appointment made him only the second Latino superintendent of an  urban school district in California, and he has offered himself as a role model  for Santa Ana's predominantly Latino student population, which previously had  few high-ranking officials of Latino heritage to admire.  </P> <P> By his example and his enthusiasm, Castruita, a man with a firm handshake and  fiery devotion to education, has taken Santa Ana Unified by storm.  </P> <P> He had hardly been superintendent for a week before he was touring schools,  shaking students' hands and chatting with them in English and Spanish. Since  then, he's made it a practice to drop in on at least one school a day.  </P> <P> Castruita also wasted no time in courting public opinion and political leaders,  meeting with City Council members and other leaders and granting frequent  interviews in the English and Spanish press. That propelled him into the  spotlight but at the same time drew attention to changes in his district.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to create self-esteem for our students," he said. "To begin to  change the image of the Santa Ana Unified School district to one of the finest  urban school districts in the country."  </P> <P> Joan Bissell, an education expert at UC Irvine, is among the legions of  observers who sing Castruita's praises.  </P> <P> "He is doing remarkable things," Bissell said, citing improvements in the  district's computer education, bilingual instruction and other areas. "He is  making Santa Ana one of the finest school districts in the state, if not the  nation."  </P> <P> Under Castruita, the district has initiated new bilingual education programs,  including one that helps bilingual aides pursue college degrees and teaching  certificates while they work for the district. That program has become a state  model, and the district has received grants for its bilingual programs as well  as its high-technology studies.  </P> <P> In addition, Santa Ana has updated its science curriculum and organized a peer  assistance program to combat drug abuse. More than half a dozen new schools  have opened, and others are in the works.  </P> <P> Locally, Castruita has waged a spirited local campaign to earn teachers greater  respect and to imbue parents with a sense of responsibility for their  children's education. While that campaign gets rolling, he also has pursued an  inside track with Sacramento.  </P> <P> He appears frequently at the elbow of Bill Honig, the state's superintendent of  public instruction, and is one of a select group of educators who will join  Honig at the state's education summit conference this month.  </P> <P> "The consensus here is that Castruita is a very effective leader, and he's very  well respected," said William L. Rukeyser, special assistant to Honig.  </P> <P> In a district that is used to hearing the worst about itself, there's nary a  negative word uttered about Castruita. Teachers seem to love him and school  board members praise him. Students, too, are stirred.  </P> <P> "I've never seen it so good here," said Rick Bryan, president of the Santa Ana  Educators Assn., the union that represents district teachers. "From our  perspective, Rudy Castruita is one of the best things that's ever happened to  the Santa Ana Unified School District, or to education, for that matter."  </P> <P> It's a sign of the changed times that Santa Ana's union, which has earned a  statewide reputation as one of California's hardest bargaining groups, is  praising a superintendent. For years, the union and the school board fought  furious wage disputes, usually bogging down for months at a time.  </P> <P> This year's contract was settled early -- and with hardly a trace of rancor.  </P> <P> Which is still not to say that everyone was satisfied. Jim Richards, a school  board member who lost his reelection bid at the polls Nov. 7, said he believes  that the contract gave away too much to the teachers.  </P> <P> "The community really is not adequately represented," Richards said. "I do not  think they got the best deal."  </P> <P> Under the three-year contract, Santa Ana teachers are guaranteed raises of 1%  more than the average of their counterparts in other Orange County unified  school districts. That will make planning difficult, Richards said, because it  will be impossible for district officials to know in advance how much they'll  be paying out in salaries.  </P> <P> But even Richards is impressed by Castruita's inaugural year.  </P> <P> "He's an extremely valuable asset to Santa Ana," Richards said, rattling off  adjectives like responsible, rewarding and aggressive. Despite his auspicious  start, Castruita will need all those attributes to turn Santa Ana's fortunes.  Change in education tends to occur over long periods of time -- Castruita  compares it to manning the helm of an aircraft carrier. And Santa Ana's  troubles are myriad.  </P> <P> School Board President Audrey Yamagata-Noji, another outspoken Castruita  supporter, worries that the superintendent will be tempted to do too much too  fast. "The one weakness with Rudy Castruita is trying to do it all," she said.  "A person gets burned out."  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine Castruita burned out. The superintendent plans a full  agenda for the coming year. More new schools, better English instruction, more  lobbying for money and more parent involvement are all on the superintendent's  slate.  </P> <P> All of them, he adds, come under the heading of ways to help Santa Ana  students. Says Castruita: "If you keep the bottom line that you always do  everything you can for kids, you can't go wrong."  </P></p>

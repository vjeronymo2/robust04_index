			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS OK ACTION TO END ROMANIA PROTEST  </P> <P> The newly elected lower house of Parliament voted today to allow the police and  army to move against anti-government demonstrators who retook a public square  they were driven from last week.  </P> <P> A senior opposition leader demanded that Parliament investigate the events that  led President-elect Ion Iliescu to call coal miners in to put down last week's  unrest.  </P> <P> Hundreds of people gathered for a second day in University Square to demand the  ouster of Iliescu, and students said they will go on strike Tuesday.  </P> <P> Several miles away, another 300 people staged a pro-government demonstration  outside Parliament, which was guarded by dozens of soldiers and police with  machine guns.  </P> <P> Iliescu's inauguration had been scheduled for last week but has been postponed  amid the turmoil.  </P> <P> Of the lawmakers present in the 377-member House of Deputies, only 72 voted  against the motion to have "the forces of law and order" end the University  Square demonstration. Seven abstained.  </P> <P> The vote split generally along party lines, with deputies of Iliescu's National  Salvation Front supporting the motion along with splinter parties loyal to the  front and the three main opposition parties against.  </P> <P> Passage was virtually certain in the Senate, where the National Salvation Front  also holds a clear majority.  </P> <P> The unrest began last Wednesday when police broke up an anti-Communist sit-in  on the square. When the unrest continued, Iliescu called thousands of miners  into the city, and they used clubs and iron bars to beat anyone they suspected  of being anti-government.  </P> <P> Six people were killed and more than 500 injured in the unrest, the worst since  the December uprising that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> Student leader Marian Munteanu was moved today from the Emergency Hospital to a  police hospital after being charged with "instigation and participation in  violence," according to his opposition group, the Students League.  </P></p>

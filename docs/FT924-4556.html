			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Schlesinger criticises ERM: D-Mark gains as Bundesbank chief denounces 'incentive for speculation' FRESH uncertainty was cast over the future of the European exchange rate mechanism last night after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, said one of the system's key mechanisms was 'a powerful incentive for speculation'. In a development likely to put further strains on some of the ERM's weaker currencies Mr Schlesinger repeated that the conditions for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates in the near future had still not been met. Mr Schlesinger's comments came at the end of a tense day on currency markets in which the D-Mark gained ground against the dollar and the Bank of France was forced to intervene heavily to support the French franc against the German currency. The D-Mark gained 1 pfennig against the dollar on Mr Schlesinger's comments, as investors switched funds into the German currency on the grounds that the Bundesbank was unlikely to cut interest rates for some time. Mr Schlesinger, who has always put combating inflation in Germany ahead of support for the ERM, denounced the way in which central banks are obliged to intervene to support weak currencies in the European Monetary System as ineffective and a powerful instrument for enriching speculators. Citing the case of a speculator who made Dollars 950m (Pounds 618m) during the recent turbulence over sterling, he said: 'Unlimited obligatory interventions . . . make no contribution to the stability of the system. On the contrary, they are a powerful incentive for speculation.' In an unusually outspoken address to university economists in Cologne, Mr Schlesinger said there was no need for a fundamental reform of the EMS, but 'details' should be reconsidered with the aim of hardening the system. Central banks had suffered heavy losses. 'This is not only expensive for the taxpayer, but in the final analysis purposeless.' He also appealed for central banks still under government control to be given their independence in the interests of exchange rate stability. In some countries, exchange rate policy was bound up too much with political prestige, he said. While he could appreciate the political problems, independence for central banks could help 'stabilise the expectations of financial markets'. He also said he found it hard to detect signs that the Bonn government was commited to cutting public spending, and rejected charges that the independent central bank ignored other countries' needs in its policymaking. In response to repeated appeals from mainly non-German political leaders for easier German interest rates, Mr Schlesinger claimed that to bring moral pressure to bear on a country which had a strong currency, but which lacked the conditions necessary to allow it to soften its policies, reinforced doubts about monetary union. The dollar fell as low as DM1.5705 in New York before finishing at DM1.573. It closed in London at DM 1.580, from a close on Monday of DM1.5935. The French franc was quoted at FFr3.4105 against the D-Mark, within 2 centimes of its ERM floor, after European trading had ended. Earlier, it had come under heavy selling pressure.

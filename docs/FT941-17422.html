			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Rights group damns both sides in Algeria The Algerian government and the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) are both to blame for a human rights crisis gripping Algeria, Middle East Watch said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The North African nation 'is now mired in a virtual civil war in which the rights of no one are inviolate and the democratic process has been all but abandoned,' the human rights watchdog group said. The report by the organisation, a division of Human Rights Watch, was timed to coincide with the second anniversary of the cancellation of Algeria's last elections. The country has been gripped by political violence since January 12 1992, when the authorities cancelled the general election which the FIS was poised to win. The FIS was later banned, and since then at least 1,800 militants, security officers and civilians have died in politically related violence. Middle East Watch said the human rights record of Mr Redha Malek's government 'has done little to distinguish itself from the FIS-led repression and human rights violations the coup-makers claimed to have acted to prevent.' It singled out for criticism the government's special court system, accusing it of subjecting fundamentalist suspects to mistreatment, torture and other judicial abuses and urging that all those convicted by these courts be released or given new trials. It also blamed fundamentalists for political violence and urged FIS leaders to condemn unequivocally all such violence and to use all means at their disposal to end violent attacks on civilians by fundamentalist groups. Middle East Watch said the FIS and the government also share the blame for muzzling Algeria's media.</p>

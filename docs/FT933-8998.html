			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Clydesdale Bank to shed 800 jobs: Reorganisation designed to cut costs and boost services CLYDESDALE BANK, the Scottish subsidiary of National Australia Bank, disclosed yesterday that it intends to cut 800 jobs by 1995. It will remove most processing work from its 350 branches, becoming the latest retail bank to announce large job cuts. The transfer of cheque processing and telephone inquiries to three processing centres will eliminate 1,400 jobs, mainly from branches. It will create 600 new posts at the centres. The bank employs about 7,500 people. The announcement follows a series of restructuring efforts by UK banks to cut staff while delivering services through new forms of technology. Barclays intends to cut 9,000 jobs by 1995, while Royal Bank of Scotland is cutting 3,500. Mr Charles Love, chief executive, said the move was aimed at reducing costs and improving services. It would enable the bank to go on serving customers in some rural areas which might otherwise have lost their branches. Mr Love said the bank would try to maximise the number of jobs lost through natural wastage, and avoid compulsory redundancy. However, the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union said it would seek a guarantee of voluntary redundancy. Clydesdale wants to cut its relatively high ratio of costs to income from the last financial year's 66 per cent - the highest among Scottish banks - by 3 to 4 per cent a year over the next two years. Its target is a ratio of 50 per cent. It is setting up two paper processing centres employing over 500 staff, one in Glasgow and another possibly in Aberdeen. A third centre for handling telephone inquiries will be set up in Glasgow, and will employ 70 staff. Mr Sandy Boyle, Bifu's deputy general secretary, said the union was 'shocked' at the number of job losses because the bank had already cut 600 head office staff. But he welcomed the bank's willingness to negotiate. The bank said it did not intend to close any branches, but Mr Boyle said the union was sceptical that it could cut the number of jobs it wanted within two years without closures or damaging service in other ways. The restructuring matches moves by other banks and building societies to centralise back office operations. Mr Love said it was based on experience gained at National Australia Bank. Clydesdale's main strengths are in the west of Scotland and north-east Scotland, based on Aberdeen.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Exercise in reassurance at Nippon Credit Bank - Officials dismiss talk of restructuring despite problems with property loans EXECUTIVES at Nippon Credit Bank have tired of reassuring clients and financial partners who have been made wary by a flurry of Japanese media coverage suggesting that the long-term credit bank is buckling under the weight of bad property loans. Further reassurance was needed following the announcement this week that a former Finance Ministry official, Mr Hiroshi Kubota, will become NCB's president later this year. Not surprisingly, the appointment was widely interpreted as a sign that Mr Kubota will preside over a restructuring of the bank, which has by far the largest ratio of property loans to total loans of Japan's leading banks. But a senior NCB manager said the choice of Mr Kubota was simply a conventional case of amakudari (literally, descending from heaven), the term given to the transfer of senior bureaucrats to corporate posts at the end of their government careers. NCB insisted he would not preside over a restructuring 'because we don't need a restructuring'. The bank says its loan portfolio has attracted attention, and inspired concern, simply because the institution has taken action to deal with non-performing property-related loans at three affiliated finance companies, while other leading banks have yet to confront their mounting bad loans. The three leasing and credit companies were large property-related lenders, either accepting property as collateral or providing funds to developers, leaving the institutions with non-performing loans estimated at 20 per cent of outstanding loans. In response, NCB persuaded other banks to take cuts in interest rates on loans to the trio, and made clear that it would ensure their survival. 'We have resolved our problems. Our capital adequacy ratio is over 9 per cent, and we have a three-year restructuring plan for the three companies. In Japan, we have a very co-operative way of solving our problems,' a senior NCB manager explains. NCB was formally established in 1957 with the aim of providing long-term capital to industry, though it traces its ancestry to the Bank of Chosen, which was the central bank of Japanese-occupied Korea from 1909 to 1945 and was responsible for issuing bank notes in Manchuria, in northern China. From 1957 to 1977, it was known as the Nippon Fudosan Bank, or the 'Japan property bank', with property-related loans still accounting for 23 per cent of lending at the end of the last fiscal year. This is twice as high as most leading Japanese banks, with Bank of Yokohama next in line at 14.3 per cent. Like other Japanese banks, NCB is profiting from falling interest rates, which are creating favourable margins. This resulted in a 108.7 per cent rise in operating profits to Y57.4bn (Dollars 458m) in the six months to the end of September. However, the costs of Japan's financial and property market collapse were more evident below the operating profit line. Pre-tax profits were down 48 per cent to Y22.5bn, with Y23.8bn of the difference due to losses on securities holdings, while there was Y11.1bn addition to loan loss reserves. Salomon Brothers Asia calculates that these reserves are only 0.9 per cent of total loans, which, taking into account Japanese taxation regulations, is equal to a 1.8 per cent cover on an after-tax basis. Japanese banks say it is a mistake to focus only on those reserves as they also have a large pile of unrealised gains on securities holdings which could be used in emergency. In NCB's case, the continuing weakness of Tokyo stock prices left that pile 52 per cent smaller at Y439bn over the year to the end of September. Tapping all the unrealised gains would mean selling strategic holdings in leading corporate clients, and the threat of rupturing these relationships puts a limit on stock sales. Large sales would also undermine the bank's capital adequacy ratio, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements. NCB's impressive capital adequacy ratio - 9.08 per cent at end-September, well above the 8 per cent BIS threshold and higher than most other Japanese banks - has raised questions about the effectiveness of that measure. One bank with a better BIS ratio, at 9.15 per cent, is Nippon Trust Bank, which reported a 47.3 per cent fall in net profit to Y1.1bn, without booking hefty appraisal losses on securities holdings. Japan's Finance Ministry has given banks enough flexibility in asset valuation regulations to enable them to write off non-performing loans gradually, and still report profits. Mr David Marshall, senior analyst at IBCA, the rating agency, says auditors and regulators in the US and Europe would force institutions to recognise potential losses more quickly. 'In Japan, the point in prepearing accounts is not necessarily to recognise losses. Most important of all from the regulators' perspective is to maintain confidence in the financial system,' Mr Marshall says. A more accurate measure of the troubled loan exposure of NCB and other Japanese banks may come at the end of the fiscal year in March, as the Finance Ministry says individual institutions will announce figures for non-performing loans. All that has been officially released is a lump figure of Y12,300bn for the largest 21 banks at end September, a 54 per cent rise over the first half. NCB says changes have already been made to its management style of the late 1980s, when banks, and their affiliates, competed feverishly for new customers as stock and property prices rose sharply. Another manager at the bank explains that risk analysis has been reviewed, though Japanese companies generally may need to alter views on who is ultimately responsible for loans. 'It is true that we have become more cautious, perhaps over-cautious, in lending. Japanese have always looked at who is the ultimate backer of a loan, rather than at the hard collateral, so people thought we were backing these three companies, even though our links to them were not so great,' he says. 'People should look at more than a company's name in doing business.'</p>

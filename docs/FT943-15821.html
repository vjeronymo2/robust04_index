			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / G7 attacked for failing to cope with global monetary reform Reform of the global monetary system is urgently needed to reduce exchange rate volatility, an independent group of experts headed by Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said yesterday. The group criticised the consultative process of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries for failing to cope with the task and suggested that it should be done instead by the International Monetary Fund with redefined responsibilities. The recommendations came in a report released yesterday by the Bretton Woods Commission, which includes former senior ministers, central bankers and private sector representatives. It urges sweeping reforms of the IMF and the World Bank to reflect big changes in the financial environment. The group said a long-term goal should be to establish 'a flexible system of exchange rate bands' - or currency target zones - between the dollar, yen and D-Mark. However, a more stable exchange rate system would be feasible only if the leading industrial countries reduced macroeconomic imbalances and achieved greater economic convergence - for example, on inflation rates. The experts said the costs of exchange rate misalignment and volatility were high and had contributed to a halving of the long-term growth rate of industrial countries to about 2.5 per cent a year from 5 per cent before the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system in the early 1970s. The alternative to reform was 'to continue the present non-system of loose ad hoc co-operation, dominated by the G7 process'. That was unlikely to lead to 'economic policies that are sound internationally as well as domestically'. While the impetus for reform had to come from the leading industrial countries, the G7 process was not the best means to support the sustained reform effort required. 'The G7 process is not an institution, a continuing body, or an executive entity.' Its representation was narrow and it did not even have a secretariat. The experts said the task of devising and implementing a reform of the global financial system should be entrusted to the IMF, which had 'much of the necessary expertise'. They said the IMF should concentrate on its global monetary responsibilities and stop acting as a development agency - a role in which the World Bank had a greater comparative advantage.

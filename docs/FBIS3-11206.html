			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine </F> Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation  Army in Mexico City on 15 March]    [Text] 15 March 1994    To the Mexican people, the world's peoples and governments,  the national and international media, brothers:    The Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General  Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation  Army] addresses all of you with respect and honor.    First -- The Federal Government, which usurped the people's  will yesterday, is again lying about the dialogue in San  Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. The bad government claims that  "agreements" were reached when there was only dialogue. The  powerful usurped the truth, and they are trying to deceive the  people by saying that peace is only a matter of a signature.    Second -- There are attempts to forget the main reasons that  provoked our uprising by replacing the truth of a dialogue with  the lie of an "agreement." The CCRI-CG of the EZLN has made no  deal with the Federal Government and has negotiated nothing  other than the way in which the dialogue is taking place.  Moreover, it has not reached any agreement with the bad  government that has been lying for so long.    Third -- The CCRI-CG of the EZLN points out that concluding  the first phase of the dialogue with lies is the best way to  make peace fail. We cannot trust a government that lies, even  to make proposals. If the supreme government wishes to present  the San Cristobal document as "agreements," then let the list of  EZLN demands be the "agreement" and let democracy be guaranteed  in the upcoming elections with the resignation of the federal  executive.    Fourth -- The CCRI-CG of the EZLN respectfully urges the  honest national and international media not to play into the  crooked game of the usurper and to report, truthfully and  objectively, what is happening in the current phase of the  dialogue.    Liberty! Justice! Democracy! Respectfully yours from the  Mexican Southeast.    [Signed] CCRI-CG of the EZLN    [Dated] Mexico City, March 1994</p>

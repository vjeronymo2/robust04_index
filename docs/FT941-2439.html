			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Jobs conundrum that must be tackled Sir, Your leader ('Summit for good jobs', March 16) rightly points out that the cyclical and structural unemployment considered at the G-7 jobs summit is not the whole story. Fine tuning existing concepts will not generate ideas needed to cope with the third type of unemployment, 'conceptual unemployment'. Such areas as non-commercial values, low risk entrepreneurship, non-transferable wealth and the protectionism of local currencies need thinking about. At every point technology, design and competitive pressures will produce more value from fewer people. Within a few years full employment will produce more value than can possibly be absorbed by those who can pay for the value. There is as much need for fundamental new thinking about economic habits as there is for new ideas about employment. The maximising mission of capitalism and the distributive mission of socialism are only the opposite sides of the same coin. We need new coins involving pluralism and parallelism in which different values have their own economies. I suggest that the EU sets up a commission to do some seriously creative thinking about these matters now that the Detroit parade has elevated employment to the level of international concern rather than domestic housekeeping.

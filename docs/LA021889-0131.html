			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: NOVELIST RECALLS LIFE AS AN EDITOR  </P> <P> When novelist Gwyneth Cravens served as a fiction editor at The New Yorker in  the mid-'80s, she worked with such literary lights as Milan Kundera, Susan  Sontag, Deborah Eisenberg, Bruce McCall, Tama Janowitz and dozens of other  writers of similar wattage.  </P> <P> "It was just wonderful to work there," said Cravens, a visiting writer at UC  Irvine this quarter. "And it was interesting to work with different kinds of  writers with different styles. I can't think of anything more different than  Milan Kundera ("The Unbearable Lightness of Being") and Tama Janowitz ("Slaves  of New York"), but it was very rewarding."  </P> <P> How much editing each author needed varied, Cravens said. "One author will turn  in a completely perfect story: You don't have to change one comma. Another  author will turn in something that needs work: You send it back and say,  'Please rewrite this.' You work with them. The New Yorker was sort of known for  that, that between copy editing and the editing, the author could improve the  story."  </P> <P> As a Visiting Writer at UCI, Cravens is teaching a writing workshop for  students in the graduate writing program. She also is teaching an undergraduate  English literature course in the short story. "It's time-consuming," she says,  "but I find it stimulating to my own writing."  </P> <P> Cravens, who is renting a house in Laguna Beach, holds her campus office hours  on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. She's finding, however, that the office  hours often run into overtime as a steady stream of graduate students stop by  to discuss their writing.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to find out what they want from me," she said. "That is, what can I  say or suggest or do for them that will help their writing. They're probably  more interested in how to get published, but I'm more interested in how they  can be good writers because you can be a wonderful writer and not necessarily  get published.  </P> <P> "You know, Kafka published almost nothing during his life. No one saw any of  Van Gogh's paintings while he was alive, but he must have gotten some  satisfaction out of his work. If I could teach one thing, it would be how to  live as a writer and be happy in your vocation as a writer no matter what the  fate of your work is."  </P> <P> When Cravens moved to New York from New Mexico in 1965 to attend New York  University on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, she thought she'd wind up an English  professor. But while working on her master's degree in literature, she began  meeting the writers and poets living in Greenwich Village. Although she had  ambitions of one day becoming a writer, she said, they were "secret ambitions."  </P> <P> "At the time, it was odd for a woman to think about being a writer," she said.  "Even from my background, to think about being an English professor was quite a  leap. So I secretly wanted to be a writer and secretly admired Katherine  Mansfield and Virginia Woolf and other women writers, but I was too shy to  really describe myself a writer. But I wrote all the time, and I began to meet  these other writers and I thought, 'well, you could write, you could get  published and so on,' and I began to write and get published."  </P> <P> She began selling articles to Mademoiselle magazine, and in 1966, a few months  after earning her master's degree, she landed a job as an editorial assistant  at The New Yorker.  </P> <P> Cravens, who was married at the time, left The New Yorker after a year to  indulge in a typically '60s fantasy: Using their savings, she and her husband  "dropped out" to go live and write in Europe.  </P> <P> They lived in Spain and Germany for a year until their money ran out. During  that time, Cravens gave birth to a daughter, Dovie. When they returned to New  York, she got her old job back at The New Yorker.  </P> <P> Wanting to be more active as a writer, she left The New Yorker in 1971 and got  a job writing and editing for Seventeen magazine. "It was a woman's magazine  with all the limitations that implies," she said. "By then, I was publishing  articles in Harper's and I was invited to be an editor at Harper's, and I wound  up doing a lot of writing for them."  </P> <P> Cravens became an associate editor there, but left in 1974 to write full time.  Teaming up with Dr. John Marr, director of the New York City Bureau of  Infectious Disease Control, she co-wrote a thriller, "Black Death." That was  followed by another thriller, "Speed of Light."  </P> <P> "The thrillers were my ticket to freedom," she said. "They financed my being  able to stay home and write more serious kinds of fiction, which was what I had  always had my eye on doing and had done for some little magazines and literary  anthologies. The thrillers were very good training in plot and pacing, and I  just learned a lot about the mechanics of novel writing."  </P> <P> In 1983, a year after her third book, "Love and Work," was published, Cravens  was invited to become a fiction editor at The New Yorker. And there she  remained for 4 1/2 years until the magazine's legendary editor William Shawn  was fired by Samuel I. Newhouse Jr., who had bought the magazine.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons I had decided to go back to work was I wanted the privilege  of working with Mr. Shawn, who was just one of the most remarkable people I  have ever met," said Cravens, who also contributed fiction and nonfiction to  the magazine. "It was the most wonderful place to work, just idyllic."  </P> <P> But it just wasn't the same after Shawn left, and 2 months later, Cravens left  the magazine to devote all of her time to novel writing.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that a writer can write anywhere, Cravens finds living in  New York particularly conducive to being a writer.  </P> <P> "For me, it was because to be around other people who are doing what you are  doing -- and to be able to talk shop -- is very exciting," she said.  </P> <P> As she sees it, a university writing program is a way of creating a similar  literary environment.  </P> <P> "Writing is such a lonely, isolated business that to just meet with other  people and discuss (that) you might be having the same problems, or having the  same confusion about something, you can really help each other. Or, if you get  a rejection and feel like it's the end of the world, and someone else says,  'No, no, I got 10 rejections from that editor before I got accepted.' It's just  a way of keeping yourself going, and it can be a very supportive atmosphere."  </P> <P> Despite her teaching schedule, reading student manuscripts and holding extended  office hours to talk to her students, Cravens has found that her stint at UCI  has not really cut into her own writing schedule.  </P> <P> At the end of the winter quarter, Cravens will return to New York, where she  has lived the past 14 years with humor writer Henry Beard, co-founder of the  National Lampoon.  </P> <P> Beyond completing her novel, however, she has no long-range plans.  </P></p>

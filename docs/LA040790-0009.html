			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> YOUNG READERS JOIN A STORYBOOK PARADE  </P> <P> Hundreds of elementary students, dressed as their favorite storybook  characters, marched in a colorful parade Friday marking Justin School's first  "Living Literature" festival.  </P> <P> The parade was the culmination of a four-week reading program aimed at  increasing parent-child interaction and inspiring a love of reading in the  youngsters.  </P> <P> Students were also treated to punch and cookies while attending the "Mad  Hatter's Tea Party."  </P> <P> For the past month, students were encouraged to turn off their television sets  for at least 15 minutes each night and spend time reading with their parents.  Those participating in the program signed contracts to make their commitment  official.  </P> <P> Leading the crowd was Principal Patt Guthrie, appearing as "Granny Goose."  </P> <P> "It's a great way to build better family relationships," Guthrie said.  "Children tend to associate reading with good feelings. It's almost always a  positive experience for them since you can't be angry with someone while you're  reading to them."  </P> <P> Family reading sessions also give parents something new to talk with their  children about. But the key to it all, Guthrie said, "is teaching kids to love  to read." JONATHAN GAME  </P></p>

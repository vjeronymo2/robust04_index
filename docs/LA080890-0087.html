			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRANSTON URGES LARGER U.S. ROLE IN MASS  TRANSIT  </P> <P> Saying "intolerable traffic congestion is choking" the state, U.S. Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.) told a Senate hearing in Los Angeles Tuesday that the  federal government "must play a more active role in helping develop mass  transit systems."  </P> <P> At a hearing conducted by the Senate Urban Affairs subcommittee, which Cranston  chairs, the senator said he hopes to make the Urban Mass Transit Act -- up for  reauthorization next year -- "the basis for shaping the nation's mass transit  policy over the next decade.  </P> <P> It is unrealistic to expect state and local governments to shoulder the full  costs of our public transportation needs."  </P> <P> Damage caused by automobile air pollution and economic losses caused by traffic  congestion are local problems, "but they have a national impact," Cranston  said.  </P></p>

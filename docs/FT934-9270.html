			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Observer: Jones keeps up Why has the London Stock Exchange swallowed its reservations about the dangers of fragmentation, and allowed London's established derivatives exchange Liffe and the Swedish-owned tiddler OMLX to have a go at trading derivatives based on the FT-SE Mid 250 equity index? Both exchanges had wanted an exclusive licence, and it had been more or less assumed that Liffe would win it. But a degree of mutual suspicion appears to persist between the stock exchange, on the one hand, and Liffe, which now trades the equity derivatives that the exchange itself failed to get off the ground, on the other. Surely Throgmorton Street is not trying to spoil Liffe's fun? OMLX boss Lynton Jones, himself an old stock exchange hand, is more interested in what potential customers will think. 'The question is whether they are Pro-Liffe or Pro-Choice,' he quips.</p>

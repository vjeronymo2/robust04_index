			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Sport: Going to the dogs This Saturday, one of the great English sporting events will take place in Wimbledon. It will not be set upon the green rectangles of the district's heartland, but in the urban streets which stretch beyond into unlovely south London. It will receive no front-page spread in Monday's newspapers, but a mere paragraph. It will last for less than half-a-minute. Its winner will be feted by no more than a few thousand fans. Yet this winner will have been proved perhaps the greatest in the world in his or her sport; as surely a Wimbledon champion as that infinitely more celebrated one up the road. The Greyhound Derby - the final of which is being run this Saturday night at Wimbledon stadium - is still a great sporting occasion to those that follow dog racing. But beyond them it does not resonate at all. Yet the Derby still carries within itself the memory of its more glorious past and the knowledge that it is worth as much as any other test of excellence. It remembers when it was reported in newspapers with the unquestioning respect given to all great sporting occasions; when it was watched by crowds of up to 70,000; and when the dogs that won it were heroes to millions because people who scarcely understood the sport itself could still understand its importance. The memories within the Derby reach back to 1927, when the race was first run at White City stadium (remaining there until it was demolished in 1984). Just a year earlier, greyhound racing itself was first staged in England. It was the remarkable fortune of both the race and the sport that they should have been almost immediately hijacked by a dog named Mick the Miller. Plain and workmanlike, with a streetwise glint in his eye, Mick's success was such that he became a national celebrity, instrumental in raising annual attendances at race meetings from 5.5m in 1927 to over 20m in 1932. He was so famous that he was subjected to a rudimentary marketing campaign: he made a film and had his face embossed on the back of powder compacts. He also won the Derby in 1929 and 1930, a double that was not emulated until 1973; and won 19 races in succession, a record which was not broken until 1974. The definition of excellence that he described has never been re-written. Above all, he gave to greyhound racing, very early in its history, an almost unlooked-for focus. The assortment of spectators that had followed the sport in the first couple of years had been woven together by Mick the Miller into a bewitched entity. This entity grew ever-larger as the sport, polished by its brushes against the world of fame, gradually assumed its familiar and seductive image of earthy, urban, English glamour. By the late 1930s, everyone was going to the dogs: aristocracy, film stars, bohemians - all of them helplessly desirous of inhabiting that rich, real world of fun and money. By 1945, attendances at race meetings had reached 50m. From that dazzling peak they could only fall, as they did almost every year thereafter; they are now barely one-tenth of that magical figure; but the image of the sport had coalesced into something less destructable and the Derby, which would never again be attended by the crowds of the immediate post-war boom, would never lose the power that those nights had bestowed upon it. However, the demolition of White City threatened to cut the links with the past contained within the race. Would it remember still how Mile Bush Pride had won by an inch in 1959 or how the anti-post favourite, Hi Joe, had been kidnapped in 1965, or how Prince Philip's winning dog had been booed in 1968, or how Tartan Khan had won at 25-1 in 1975? Would it remember Mick the Miller, who had turned the race and himself into the stuff of myth? It would - because it is through the dogs themselves that the grandeur of the Derby persists. That is Mick's final legacy. From the moment that he revealed his greatness, followers of his sport knew what a greyhound could be, should be, like; and from then on they have always been looking for another one like him, or better than him. His peculiar fascination was to have a great, unconscious speed which he controlled by a great and conscious intelligence. To see the desire to run being transmuted into a desire to win is still, 65 years later, the most thrilling sight in greyhound racing, and one of the most thrilling in sport. Most dogs cannot create such a sight. And most of dog racing is workaday stuff, betting shop fodder, an endless sequence of numbers from which gamblers can formulate their meaningless equations. Yet the strange thing is that one never thinks of it in that way, once one has been to the Greyhound Derby.</p>

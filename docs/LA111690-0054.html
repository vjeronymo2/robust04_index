			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $1-BILLION AUSTERITY PLAN URGED AS STATE REVENUES DIVE;  </P> <P> BUDGET: THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES CUTS IN VOTER-APPROVED GUARANTEES FOR  SCHOOLS AND A HIRING FREEZE.  </P> <P> With state tax revenues falling far below expected levels, Gov. George  Deukmejian on Thursday proposed an instant $1-billion austerity program in  California that would include the suspension of voter-approved guarantees for  schools.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's surprise announcement put a damper on what had been expected to be  a congenial meeting with Gov.-elect Pete Wilson to begin the transfer of power  leading to Wilson's swearing-in on Jan. 7.  </P> <P> In addition to cutting school funding by $526 million, Deukmejian's plan would  freeze state hiring, cut all state budgets except higher education by 1%, and  reduce the renters' tax credit. Most of the plan would have to be approved by  the Legislature, which earlier this year rejected Deukmejian's attempt to  suspend Proposition 98's requirement that about 40% of the budget go to  schools.  </P> <P> The governor ruled out any tax increase, saying that voters on Nov. 6 made it  "plainly clear" by rejecting several expensive ballot measures that they "don't  want to pay higher taxes."  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he and his top fiscal aides briefed Wilson on the problem  during a luncheon and three-hour meeting Thursday afternoon. The governor-elect  spoke briefly with reporters before leaving the Capitol but addressed the  budget only in generalities, deferring to Deukmejian whenever pressed to  comment on the potential deficit.  </P> <P> Deukmejian told reporters that Wilson believes the current Administration  should resolve the budget crisis.  </P> <P> "He did indicate to me he thought it was very prudent of me to make a proposal  now to try to get on top of this new developing situation just as quickly as  possible," Deukmejian said of Wilson.  </P> <P> The proposal to cut school money drew a sharp reply from state schools Supt.  Bill Honig, who has battled Deukmejian over the education budget for several  years. Honig said many of the state's school districts are in bad fiscal  condition and can ill afford budget cuts halfway through the academic year.  </P> <P> "It's not surprising," Honig said of the proposal. "Deukmejian has been against  education consistently. I suppose with his last breath in office he'll keep  trying to take money away from school kids."  </P> <P> The dire budget situation became clear Thursday when the legislative analyst's  office reported that tax collections during October dropped a whopping $250  million because of the downturn in the economy. When revenue shortfalls in  July, August and September are added in, it means that state officials now are  short by $408 million.  </P> <P> "It is too early to hit the panic button, but there definitely are some  problems, some black clouds on the horizon," said Elizabeth G. Hill, the  nonpartisan legislative analyst.  </P> <P> The day began with a cordial luncheon meeting between Deukmejian and Wilson,  the first for the two Republican leaders since the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> For a while, at least, the budget problems were set aside when Deukmejian and  Wilson got together for their first face-to-face meeting since the Nov. 6  election.  </P> <P> "I couldn't be any happier," said a smiling Deukmejian, noting it has been 36  years since governors from the same party served consecutively. Gov. Goodwin J.  Knight, formerly lieutenant governor, succeeded fellow Republican Earl Warren  in 1953 when Warren was appointed chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> When Deukmejian took office, the state faced a $1.5-billion shortfall and he  has said he would not leave his successor with a similar budget problem.  Deukmejian until Thursday had contended that despite the drop-off in revenues  the state would finish this year in the black.  </P> <P> As for the report from budget analyst Hill, it showed that the largest decline  has been in the sales tax, which is down $168 million over the last four  months. Personal income tax collections are off $111 million, followed by bank  and corporation tax receipts, off $92 million. Various other tax collections  are down a total of $37 million.  </P> <P> The hard numbers released Thursday come on top of earlier estimates from Hill  that the state will be $1.1 billion short of what it will need during the next  budget year to provide state services.  </P> <P> The October drop must be added to the $1.1-billion estimate because the two  figures combined represent a shortfall that Wilson will have to deal with both  to get through the current budget year and to prepare his first budget as  governor.  </P> <P> What's more, the problem could get larger in the coming months if the economy  does not improve. October is one of the lowest revenue-producing months. Almost  twice as much money comes in during December, reflecting the Christmas shopping  season, and nearly three times as much in April, when income taxes are due.  </P> <P> Times staff writer William Trombley contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by the Industrial News Department's Hidoshi Takeda; </F> fourth in the series "Field Report on Market Opening"; this  installment entitled "Government Procurement (Medical Equipment  and Telecommunications Gear) -- U.S. Distrusts Japan's Business  Practices"]    [Text] A senior employee with a medium-sized medical  equipment manufacturer in Tokyo has disclosed, "There is a  tacitly condoned rule under which medical equipment is supplied  by wholesalers who are doing business near university  hospitals." The Japanese medical equipment market is dominated  by a unique business practice, and even Japanese medical  equipment makers are hard-pressed to gain access to the market.  The only way for foreign medical equipment manufacturers to  climb over the invisible barriers is to forge business tie-ups  with Japanese businessmen who are well versed in the sales  know-how of medical instruments.  <H5>  Human Relationship Holds the Key </H5>   A staffer in charge of sales at a foreign-affiliated visual  diagnostic equipment company has expressed his discontent,  saying, "We cannot compete against Japanese medical equipment  companies that have a close relationship with doctors even if  our medical instruments' performance is a little better than  theirs." On many occasions, he has been unable to meet doctors  to brief them on newly developed medical instruments because he  lacks a personal relationship with them.    Medical equipment has only recently surfaced as a trade  friction between Japan and the United States. The United States  raised medical equipment as a bilateral trade issue for the  first time at the Tokyo summit last July, and the issue was  later taken up for discussion at the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks.    Unlike automobiles, Japan registers no huge surplus in the  medical instruments trade with the United States. According to  a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan exported  100 billion yen worth of medical appliances to the United States  in 1992 while it imported 234.1 billion yen worth of medical  equipment from that country. In this way, in the field of  medical equipment, Japan bought 134.1 billion yen more than it  sold to the United States in that year.    Unlike plate glass products, the share of foreign medical  equipment in the Japanese market is high. A U.S. Government  estimate shows that U.S. medical equipment manufacturers hold a  20-percent share of the Japanese market, but the U.S. Government  has maintained that this market share is still low compared to  their 40-percent share on European markets. In response, the  Second North American Division of the Foreign Ministry comments,  "The figure presented by the U.S. Government does not include  the share held by U.S.-invested medical equipment companies  operating in Japan and the fact that there is instead only a  small difference between the U.S. shares in the Japanese and  European markets."    Hiroichi Kimura, president of the Association of Medical  Equipment Manufacturers, has said, "I wonder if the United  States fully understands the actual state of the Japan-U.S.  medical equipment trade."    It is quite natural that both Japan and the United States  have been unable to find areas of agreement at the end of their  discussions. What the United States has made an issue of  concerning medical equipment is not a trade imbalance but rather  Japan's business practices. The United States has focused its  attack on the procurement of medical instruments by national  hospitals as a symbol of the closed medical equipment market in  Japan.    Japan has asserted that the tender system adopted by  national  hospitals is open, but an official with a medical instrument  manufacturer has pointed out, "Wholesalers, who are well aware  of the collusive practices, have sometimes asked doctors in  advance to set conditions for tenders that can be met only by  the medical instruments that they deal in." The collusive ties  between doctors and suppliers have become a hotbed of  corruption, thus deepening European and American businessmen's  distrust in Japan's business practices.  <H5>  Strong Discontent With Administration </H5>   There is a great deal of discontent with Japan's  administration. A staffer with a medical appliance manufacturer  has said, "There are no official procedures, but administrative  guidance is rampant. Even Japanese manufacturers face  difficulties." For foreign firms, each type of administrative  authority held by the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry  of Education is troublesome.    It seems that the United States has cited medical equipment  as one of the goods to which the Japanese market is closed with  the aim of establishing its hegemony in a high-technology field  in which it holds the upper hand.    Morimichi Fukuda, professor at Sapporo Medical College, is  eager to introduce advanced medical technology from the United  States and European countries. The professor says, "Japanese  medical equipment companies lag their U.S. counterparts in the  field of visual-processing technology." Japan lags far behind  the United States in the visual-processing software used to  diagnose patients.    Hospitals link to computers such state-of-the art digital  diagnostic equipment as PAC's [visual management system], MRI's  [magnetic resonance imaging] and CT's (cable transfer). Doctors  have free access to databases containing information on patients.    One university hospital is expected to purchase advanced  medical equipment worth billions of yen, and U.S. medical  equipment companies are looking to Japan for sales of their  products. The medical communications system linking hospitals  with homes will be put into operation in the future, and U.S.  firms are certainly laying the groundwork for participating in  building the system.  <H5>  Japan Is Under Pressure To Change Market Structure </H5>   The United States has pressed Japan to open the government's  procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications gear,  the procurement of which is expected to grow in the future.  There is a model for defusing the medical equipment frictions  between the two countries--telecommunications gear. The issue  of NTT's procurement of telecommunications equipment has been  raised incessantly even after it was privatized. The United  States is now stepping up pressure on Japan to set numerical  targets for NTT's procurement of U.S.-built telecommunications  equipment.    NTT's international procurement office has reacted to the  pressure by saying, "We are sharply increasing our budget for  the procurement of foreign telecommunications equipment in  accordance with an agreement concluded between Japan and the  United States." NTT has steadily been increasing the amount of  its procurement from the United States by purchasing digital  switchboards from Nozan Telecom [name as published] and digital  transmission equipment from AT&amp;T.    While NEC Corporation, Fujitsu, Ltd., and other Japanese  firms have increased their sales in the U.S. telecommunications  market, foreign firms in Japan still have difficulty gaining  access to the Japanese telecommunications market, especially  NTT, because the market gives priority to Japanese firms at the  stage of developing products.    B. Farrell, managing director of the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce  and Industry in Japan, has stated, "U.S. manufacturers know that  if their businesses are to be successful in Japan, it is  important for them to offer their products on the Japanese  market at reasonable prices and to provide after-sales service."    He also has asked Japanese firms to work to open the  Japanese  market, saying, "I hope that such major firms as NTT, NEC, and  Mitsubishi will buy more foreign goods." It will take time  before Japan changes its market structure. Nevertheless, the  United States is likely to continue its offensive targeting  procurement by the government and major firms of U.S.-made  telecommunications equipment for the time being.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Poland urged to raise import tariffs to protect its industry POLAND must raise import tariffs to protect domestic industry, Mr Andrzej Zawislak, industry minister, told a Warsaw conference yesterday. The statement marks the emergence of significant policy differences within the government. 'No country has ever had as liberal an import policy as we have at the moment and something has to be done,' Mr Zawislak told a conference organised by the Finance Institute, an academic body affiliated to the Finance Ministry. He also asked if the austere monetary policies agreed with the International Monetary Fund by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister, should be modified. 'Has this policy not passed the point when it is still useful?' he asked. 'I don't have an answer to that yet.' The minister's remarks run counter to Mr Balcerowicz's economic policies, which aim to force state companies to become efficient through external competition and tight credit controls. Industrial sales in the first quarter were 3.5 per cent lower than at the same time in 1990. Mr Zawislak was speaking a few days after the government bowed to pressure from farmers, angry about imports of food subsidised by the EC, and increased food tariffs by an average of 10 per cent. Mr Zawislak told the conference: 'The invisible hand is taking out the wrong firms; the best companies, not the worst ones are being ruined.' High interest rates had cut access to credit for modernisation, while companies which had invested recently in new plant were having to pay a tax on assets to the budget. The stable exchange rate was also hurting export earnings as domestic costs rose. The Swiss Bank Corporation is planning to launch a fund next month worth around Dollars 100m (Pounds 59m) designed to invest in Poland's privatisation programme. The Poland Fund is to be managed by Polish Investment Partners, a subsidiary of the Polish Investment Company, in which the SBC holds a 23 per cent share.</p>

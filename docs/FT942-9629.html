			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pearson thought to have pulled out of library deal Pearson, the media and entertainment group, is believed to have pulled out of a deal to buy the ITC programme library - an acquisition that would have been worth about Dollars 175m (Pounds 120m). Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, was favourite to buy the library which contains many of the programmes made by Lord Grade, such as The Prisoner and films such as On Golden Pond. ITC, with more than 10,000 hours of programmes and films, is owned by Morgan Private Equity, in turn a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. The apparent failure of the deal comes in the same week that Pearson announced a 'global strategic alliance' with the BBC to launch jointly satellite television channels in Europe and the rest of the world. The purchase of such a library would have fitted in well with Pearson's stated strategy of expanding in the media and entertainment sectors and concentrating on the acquisition of intellectual property rights. It has already acquired a significant programme library through the purchase of Thames, now the largest independent production company in the UK. Pearson could not be contacted last night to comment on the ITC deal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source has denied reports  broadcast by the news media of the gang of mutiny and secession  to the effect that two aircraft belonging to our Armed Forces,  the forces of unity and legitimacy, fired missiles at the Aden  oil refinery. The source said these reports are false and  baseless, and that they constitute an attempt to cover the  crushing blows inflicted by the heroic Armed Forces men on the  dens of the secessionist gang inside the Aden Governorate.    The source said that the air strikes targeted the camp the  secessionists are using as a stronghold west of Aden, and that  the civilian and economic installations and residential areas  have not been and will never be targets for the forces of unity  and constitutional legitimacy.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: S African blacks offered stake in Metropolitan Life METROPOLITAN LIFE, South Africa's seventh largest life insurer, is to invite the country's black community to take a stake in the company. More than 90 per cent of Metpol's new business is sold to blacks and 84 per cent of existing policyholders are black. Under the R137m (Dollars 43m) deal, a new company, Metlife Investment Holdings (Methold), to be controlled by black shareholders, will buy from Sankorp, the company which manages the strategic investments of the Sanlam group, 10 per cent of the equity of Metpol. Methold will also have a five-year option to buy a further 20 per cent of Metpol's equity, less one share, from Sankorp. The transaction is the most far-reaching yet taken with the aim of increasing the role of blacks in an economy that remains overwhelmingly dominated by whites. Giving more economic power to blacks will be a priority of any future government in South Africa. Significant, too, is that Sankorp is behind the deal. Sankorp played a decisive role in promoting the unbundling of Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining house, announced earlier this week. Unbundling and black economic empowerment are both key aims of the African National Congress, which will be the dominant partner in a future government. Taken together, the two initiatives cast Sankorp in a politically progressive light. Explaining the deal yesterday, Mr Marinus Daling, chief executive of Sankorp, said: 'It is imperative that a larger part of the South African population be given the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the economy.' It was Sankorp's aim, with the Metpol transaction, 'to make a positive contribution towards the important structural changes that are required in the South Africa economy'. He added that there were considerable other benefits, especially marketing, which should make the deal a financial success for Metpol. The transaction makes Metpol the first quoted company in which the black community plays a dominant role. It is being financed by the Industrial Development Corporation, which will be repaid as money is generated through the sale of Methold shares to the black community. The 40 per cent of Metpol shares held between Sankorp and Methold is the basis for a voting pool agreement between these two parties where the 'leading role' will rest with Methold. The underlying principles of the agreement are that Metpol will retain its listing, policyholders' interests will not be prejudiced and existing management will not be disrupted. Metpol has a market capitalisation of about R1.6bn and total assets just short of R5bn.</p>

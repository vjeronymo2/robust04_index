			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets: Inflation sours the mood at bulls' party - Wall Street Put the bubbly back on ice, deflate the balloons and cancel the catering: it looks as if Wall Street's late-summer / early-autumn market rally may never materialise. Two weeks ago, share prices began an ascent which took the Dow Jones Industrial Average up from around 3,750 to over 3,900 in eight trading days. Although stocks subsequently stumbled, they rebounded nicely this Thursday as the Dow again climbed above 3,900. With mutual funds reporting rising cash inflows, bond prices seemingly stable, and Federal Reserve monetary policy possibly on hold until the end of the year, there was a spring in the step of investors and traders not seen since early February. Now, however, any optimistic thoughts Wall Street might have had about a sustained rally in share prices may have to be shelved. Yesterday, following disturbing inflation news, bond prices plummeted - pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond up to 7.68 per cent - and stocks dropped sharply. In the first half-hour of trading, the Dow fell more than 40 points, and although the average recovered slightly later in the morning, the damage to the market's psyche had been done. The cause of the stock and bond markets' losses was the producer prices index, which the Labor department said yesterday had climbed 0.6 per cent in August. That was the biggest increase in the PPI in four years, and well above the 0.4 per cent forecast by most analysts. Just as troubling, the 'core' PPI (a measure which excludes the volatile food and energy prices) rose by 0.4 per cent, again more than expected. For an inflation-sensitive bond market, the August PPI - which put the annual rate of producer price inflation at 2.9 per cent - was too much to bear. Inflation has remained relatively low throughout this year, and some analysts had expressed confidence that the Fed's five policy tightenings would ensure it remained that way, but fixed-income investors have been unable to shake their concern that at some point, economic growth would feed through into higher prices. Consequently, they have been ready to sell bonds at the first hint of rising inflation. To the inflation-fixated, yesterday's PPI report was more than just a hint. As James Solloway, chief analyst at Argus Research in New York, put it: 'This should again raise fears that the Fed has not done enough to nip inflation in the bud. Inflation is not dead by any stretch of the imagination.' The breakdown of the PPI data was particularly disturbing, as it showed rising prices across a range of goods. Coffee prices soared 12 per cent, tobacco climbed 1.4 per cent, energy 1.7 per cent, and cars and food prices both rose 0.7 per cent. Analysts can explain away the occasional jump in a PPI component, but when a broad group of prices are rising, it becomes more difficult to ignore. David Jones, an economist at Aubrey Langston, said yesterday that inflation was 'certainly building up in the goods production chain. We saw it a year or so ago in commodities and now it's worked its way down to the finished goods level, and we still see inflation in in the pipeline at the crude and intermediate goods level.' What this means for the stock market is that investors cannot relax their guard against further increases in short-term and long-term interest rates. If next week's August consumer prices index is anything like as worrisome as the PPI was, then bond prices could tumble further, and the Fed could quickly be forced to break its current holding pattern on monetary policy. That would spell trouble for share prices. There is a possibility, however, that the Fed will not make another move on interest rates soon because the increase in the PPI may have been exactly what it was expecting. The central bank has raised short-term rates five times in the past six months in what has become a sustained round of policy tightening. Although it drew fire for its actions - most notably from politicians worried the rate increases will reverse the recovery which began in 1992 - the Fed may have known, or at least suspected, all along that the economy was growing to fast for inflation to remain dormant forever. Given that interest rate increases do not have an immediate effect upon economic growth - the time-lag is variously judged to be between six to nine months, depending upon the vigour of the economy - the Fed may well be untroubled by yesterday's disturbing PPI data, secure in the knowledge that this year's policy tightenings will soon begin to take its toll on the economy and inflation.  ----------------------------- Monday      closed Tuesday    3898.70  +  13.12 Wednesday  3886.25  -  12.45 Thursday   3908.46  +  22.21 Friday     3874.81  -  33.65  -----------------------------</p>

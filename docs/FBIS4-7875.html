			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kalina Stancheva on a meeting of Council of </F> Ministers in Sofia on 7 April]    [Text] After his month-long illness, Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov appeared today at his workplace. The ministers marked  this fact by drinking a glass of cognac to his health, and the  prime minister thanked them for their efforts during his absence.    In a meeting behind closed doors, the cabinet heard a report  by Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov, chairman of the  Government Foreign Debt Commission, regarding the upcoming  negotiations with the Paris Club, which a delegation will leave  to attend on Tuesday [12 April]. The cabinet approved the  position to be put forward by the Bulgarian delegation. No  comment was made on the issue of personnel changes in the  commission's membership following the resignations of two of its  members. According to information obtained from the Council of  Ministers, the changes will be made after Antonov and Kunchev  have appeared before the cabinet to explain the motives for  their resignations.    Because of speculative increases in certain prices, the  government decided to add another 12 items to the existing list  of 11 kinds of goods and services monitored by the government.    The government decided to follow the course of setting fixed  prices for the sale of tobacco products on the domestic market.  Keeping in mind the foreign exchange rate and the Customs Duties  Act that has recently come into force, the maximum new price of  (?45) leva for a pack of cigarettes will apply to imported  Rothmans, Marlboro, and Kent cigarettes, while the Bulgarian  brands Viktori and Welcome will cost 24 leva a pack, and  cigarettes in normal packaging for mass consumption will cost  between 7 and 12 leva.    Following the introduction of the 18-percent VAT rate,  domestic telephone calls will now cost private subscribers 90  stotinki per unit, and business subscribers -- 1.18 leva.</p>

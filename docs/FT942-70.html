			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Corning sales growth tops expectations Corning, the US manufacturing group, beat market expectations with strong sales growth in its second quarter, writes Richard Waters in New York. The group lifted post-tax profits to Dollars 111.4m, or 54 cents a share, compared with Dollars 89.8m, or 47 cents a share, in the same period in 1993. Revenues in the three months to June 19 were Dollars 1.1bn, up 22 per cent from a year before. However, around half of the growth stemmed from the acquisition last year of Damon, a medical testing company.</p>

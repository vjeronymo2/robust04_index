			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / US to set training standards: National vocational standards considered THE Clinton administration yesterday announced a series of educational and training reforms including plans for a new national system of vocational qualifications along European lines. The Dollars 420m package, known as Goals 2000: Educate America Act, is intended to help the US achieve 'world class' educational standards by defining more precisely what students need to learn, improving assessment techniques and introducing new forms of certification for non-graduates. It differs from initiatives launched by the Bush administration mainly in putting no emphasis on efforts to increase parental choice or competition between schools. Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, said he was setting up a national skills standards board consisting of business, labour and educational leaders to 'identify essential occupational skills and create a voluntary system of standards, assessments and certification'. The plan was to bring the US into line with other industrialised countries by creating a set of nationally recognised credentials for the three quarters of the population that lacks college degrees. Mr Richard Riley, the education secretary, announced the formation of a national educational standards and improvement council to oversee school reforms. The council would set 'contents standards' defining what students should know and be able to do in each subject area and devise assessments to measure student achievement and school performance. The standards and assessments would be voluntary, reflecting states' primary responsibility for education under the US constitution.</p>

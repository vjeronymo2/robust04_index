			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kathy Evans report: "Congregations Run `Charity' Gauntlet"] </F>   [Text] As the main prayers of the week end on a Friday  lunchtime, the departing congregation at Regent's Park mosque in  London has to run the gauntlet of dozens of young men raising  money for holy wars against foreign governments.    "Fight the Algerian junta!" A bearded man in his 20s stands  beside a grisly montage of photographs portraying, he says,  victims of torture by the Algerian government.    One youth says he comes from Nubia and is raising money for  the overthrow of the Mubarak government.    "Help the jihad in Egypt," he cries, trying to out-shout  another youth who says he is collecting for Palestine.    Giving money to charity is a religious obligation for  wealthy  Muslims. The past five years have seen an explosion in the  number of Muslim charities not dedicated to purely humanitarian  aims, say Western counter-terrorism experts.    In almost every mosque in Britain, Muslims are being  encouraged to "Spend in the name of Allah." Nothing is said  about who receives these donations destined for Bosnia,  Palestine, Iraq, Algeria and other places.    Islamic organisations with overseas connections include:  <H5>  The Young Muslims </H5>   Has headquarters in Nottingham and branches around the  country. Organises charter trips to Sudan and Iran for young  Muslims. Also offers summer holiday camps featuring lectures  from Sudanese politicians, Kashmiri mojahedin and black American  Muslim leaders.  <H5>  Al Muntada al Islami </H5>   Based in Parsons Green, west London. Has its own mosque and  school. Appears to function as a haven in London for the Middle  Eastern Salafi movement, known for strict religious orthodoxy.  Said to be popular with Gulf radicals as well as Algerians and  Lebanese. Has nearly &pound;250,000 in the bank and gave nearly  &pound;160,000 in "overseas relief" last year.  <H5>  Muslim Welfare House </H5>   One of the oldest Muslim organisations in London, based in  Finsbury Park. Said by the Algerian government to be a  fundraiser for the Algerian Islamic group FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front], transferring money to activists subsequently convicted  of terrorism. Its director, Syrian-born Mahmoud Khani, is said  to be "ill overseas." Acting director says the organisation does  not permit political activity in the mosque and has been  regularly visited by Scotland Yard.  <H5>  The Murabitoun -- Soldiers of Liberation </H5>   Run by Abdul Qadir al Sufi, a former Scottish librarian, bit  part player in Fellini films and now a convert to Islam.  Campaigns for British Muslim community to be self sufficient,  with its own banking system and courts. Very active during  Rushdie affair.  <H5>  Palestine and Lebanon Relief Fund </H5>   Said by Israel and Arab press to be a principal conduit of  funds for the Palestinian Hamas movement. Israeli officials say  much of the money is spent on weapons. Fund officials say the  money goes to the zakat committees in occupied territories for  orphans, widows and hospitals. Other Palestinian charities say  zakat committees are controlled by Islamacists.  <H5>  Islamic Foundation </H5>   Headed by Professor Kurshid Ahmed, known in Pakistan as the  vice-president of Jamaat Islami, the country's largest radical  party, which has connections to extremist parties in Afghanistan  and Kashrnir. Jamaat activists were said to be behind the  original burning of Salman Rushdie's book in Bradford.  According to last published accounts in 1990, the foundation  gave nearly &pound;90,000 to a fund for Kashmir: no details of  expenditure. Has seven-acre compound in Leicester which hosts  Islamic conferences.  <H5>  Islamic Studies Centre </H5>   Birmingham-based, said to be the base of Surour  Zeinabbidine,  a senior ideologue of a radical movement opposing the Saudi  regime. The Syrian-born cleric reportedly introduced a number of  the leaders of the kingdom's opposition movement to the idea of  political Islam.</p>

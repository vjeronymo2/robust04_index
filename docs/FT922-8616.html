			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-sceptics threaten rebellion TORY 'Euro-sceptics' say more than a dozen Conservative MPs are prepared to vote against the government over the legislation ratifying the Maastricht agreement. Such a move might put the government's majority at risk. The Euro-sceptics believe that the debate on the European Community has moved on since just a handful of Tories voted against the Maastricht deal when MPs debated it last December, and point to the much greater prospect of putting the government under pressure than when it had a majority of more than 80 before the election. They say that now that MPs are not under pressure to show pre-election loyalty, some colleagues who abstained then will vote against the government this time. The MPs are discussing tactics and organising themselves in preparation for the first debate on the bill, which is due to come before the Commons next week. The committed will now try to persuade colleagues who have expressed some concern about the agreement. Leading campaigners are said to include former energy minister Mr Michael Spicer (Worcestershire South), Mr James Cran (Beverley) and Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow). Although no one has been excluded, the campaigners have little hope that many of the new Tory MPs will join the rebellion, because they recognise how hard it is for newcomers to defy the whips so soon after arriving at Westminster. One new Tory said he would probably vote for the government reluctantly and would make his unease known to the whips. The Labour party has not yet agreed how it is likely to vote on the bill. One likely course is to put down and vote for an amendment in favour of the social chapter, from which the UK 'opted out', but the party might abstain on the bill itself. The Euro-sceptics emphasise that although the government may get its majority on the bill, Europe will remain a controversial issue. The Tory MPs who voted against the Maastricht deal last December included former leader of the Commons Mr John Biffen (Shropshire North); Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton South West); Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills) and Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North). Mr Ian Lang last night dampened expectations of imminent moves towards constitutional reform for Scotland, saying that the Scottish Conservatives had fought the recent general election 'above all else as a unionist party.' The government remained willing to 'consider' ways of improving present mechanisms, as long as they did not 'jeopardise' the integrity of the UK, Mr Lang said.</p>

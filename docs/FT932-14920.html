			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Miners defy NUM on pit closure MINERS at Easington colliery in County Durham have voted overwhelmingly not to challenge the closure of their pit in order to safeguard their redundancy payments. In defiance of National Union of Mineworkers national policy, the men have decided their colliery - flashpoint of some of the biggest confrontations in the 1984-85 miners' strike - should not be put into the consultative colliery review procedure. British Coal announced yesterday that Easington and the Westoe colliery, in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, will cease production on May 7. Both are to be mothballed in case there is interest from the private sector in taking them over. Mr Alan Cummings, Easington NUM secretary, said a mass meeting had instructed union officials to negotiate the best possible redundancy payments with British Coal. The miners had turned Easington around from loss to profit but felt it was futile to challenge closure. He added: 'They've recognised what's happened since 1985, no pit which has gone through the procedure has been saved. People have said, why pile on the agony?' Behind the decision lies the fear that, should the pit go to review, the miners would be kept on the payroll on basic pay. This could affect their redundancy payments, since they are calculated on the final 12 weeks' pay. Productivity bonuses can boost earnings by as much as 30 per cent. Redundancy payments for workers with long service could reach Pounds 37,000. Easington, which now has 1,050 workers, dates back to 1899. Mr Cummings said geological problems had caused some production problems recently.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ilija Ilijevski, chairman of the Human </F> Rights Party of FYROM, by Galya Nikolova; place and date not  given: "Our Party Was Banned Because of Its Good Relations With  Bulgaria"]    [Text] [Nikolova] Mr. Ilijevski, when and why was your  party banned?    [Ilijevski] It was banned a month and a half ago. The  decision of the Okrug Court in Stip became binding over a week  ago. Its sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].  It is interesting to note that the court in Stip banned us  because we were described as a threat to the country's  constitutional order. However, we think that the old  constitution is not binding any longer, because there is a new  Constitution. It bans violent anticonstitutional actions, but  our party has not been accused of any such actions. When  Macedonia's Supreme Court discovered this paradox it amended the  legal basis of the ban. We were accused of fanning  international and interethnic hatred. We cannot even utilize  our constitutional right to appeal against this judgment any  longer because the reason for it has been changed, and our  appeal was based on the previous reason.    We sought the protection of Macedonia's chief prosecutor and  demanded that the Constitutional Court cancel the ban because it  violates the Constitution. We have informed international legal  organizations and the governments of many countries. We most  fervently appeal to official Bulgaria, because we think that it  has the greatest reason to help us. Our party was banned  because of its good relations with Bulgaria.    [Nikolova] How did the Bulgarian authorities react to this?    [Ilijevski] Unfortunately, before and after 10 November 1989  Sofia's policy toward the Bulgarians in Macedonia did not  change. We were left in the hands of the Serbian state and  Serbian denationalization. After 50 years of oppression we  hoped that under the new conditions of pluralism we would have  the opportunity to state our rights clearly. However, this did  not happen. We think that it is high time that Bulgaria took  care of its children outside her borders. There will be nothing  unusual in this, because all the countries in the world do it.    [Nikolova] Have you met any official Bulgarian  representatives to discuss this issue?    [Ilijevski] Over the last six months I have had many useful  contacts in Sofia. I have had talks with [National Assembly  Chairman] Aleksandur Yordanov and with President Zhelev's  advisers. I have also had meetings at the Agency for Bulgarians  Abroad and many political party leaders. However, most of my  meetings have been with journalists. Thus, the problems of the  Bulgarians in Macedonia have been presented to the Bulgarian and  world public. Unfortunately, official Bulgaria continues to keep  silent. It is high time that Bulgaria announced its position on  the so-called Macedonian issue.    [Nikolova] Our country was the first to recognize  Macedonia's independence. Do you think that Sofia is afraid to  declare openly its support for the Bulgarians in the former  Yugoslav republic?    [Ilijevski] There is no reason to be afraid, but I think  that the old understandings still prevail. Unfortunately, the  good relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia are at the expense  of the Bulgarians who live there. There used to exist an  unwritten treaty between Sofia and Skopje that there are no  Bulgarians in Macedonia. Good relations between the two  countries could and can exist only if Bulgaria does not look  after us.    I do not think that this is either good or moral. If I may  use a metaphor, it means that the Bulgarians in Macedonia have a  mother who is alive but does not look after them. Let me ask  the following: If a mother does not think about her children  across the border, how will it help those who live here?    [Nikolova] Bulgaria offered Macedonia its ports when Greece  announced its trade blockade. How do you think the conflict  with Greece will develop?    [Ilijevski] I cannot forecast anything, but I think that  there could be a positive result. Both Greece and Macedonia  could make concessions. However, it is a different matter as to  whether Greece is right. Many states throughout the world have  already denounced it, while its neighbors are keeping silent in  an attempt to maintain good relations with it.    It is true that official Macedonia, led by Kiro Gligorov,  defends Macedonism. However, this involves twisting historical  facts and distorting the history of Bulgaria and Greece. In  such a case it was normal on the part of the Greeks to react in  such a sharp manner.    [Nikolova] How will the Yugocrisis develop and will there be  a war in Macedonia?    [Ilijevski] I do not think that there will be war if there  is no military intervention and the problems are peacefully  resolved, unless we ourselves do something to ourselves. In  order to avoid this, the Balkan states are called upon to be law  abiding and democratic states and respect human rights. In this  way international conflicts could be avoided.</p>

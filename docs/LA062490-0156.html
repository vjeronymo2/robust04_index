			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT THING  </P> <P> It is not hard to understand why the Young Americans for Freedom see both the  government and business interests as enemies of the people.  </P> <P> The HUD scandal is just one example where big business, and big government,  under the guise of being "custodians of the poor," conspire to feed at the  public trough.  </P> <P> I am still a Republican, so as to remain socially acceptable. However, a large  part of my heart and mind goes out to the Young Americans for Freedom, as I  become increasingly disgusted and disillusioned by the liberal values of our  society.  </P> <P> PATRICK J. MANSHARDT  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

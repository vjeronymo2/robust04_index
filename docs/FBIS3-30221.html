			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["B.J."-initialled report: "The Nation-Building State in </F> Focus -- According to Csurka, the MIEP Is a `Resolute Force'"]    [Text] On 29 January the Hungarian Justice and Life Party  [MIEP] decided on its election program at its national meeting  of deputies. Cochairman Istvan Csurka summarized the program by  saying: The MIEP is a resolute force.... The deputies accepted  the party's election program, according to which the corporate  tax would be reduced and, at the same time, the tax authorities  would be given powers of investigation, and a secret police of  economic crimes would be set up. In place of the discredited  enemy image, they plan to set up a rank order of risks regarding  our neighboring countries.    "We have to see that, according to the plans, the suit of  power [as published] is to be put on the alliance between the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP]. However, to make this suit look good, the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], that has by now collapsed,  would also get a duffle coat and the Federation of Young  Democrats [FIDESZ] would get a jacket!" [sentence as published]  This is how Istvan Csurka summed up the future of Hungarian  domestic politics in his speech setting the program.    According to him, the real change of the regime has to be  started, therefore, the power must not be left in the hands of  those who have, up to now, been the rulers. This change of the  regime would only actually affect 5,000 to 6,000 subordinates,  and the army of 50,000 to 60,000 servants lined up behind them  would immediately adjust to the new situation. Through this,  those people who are ready to sell out Hungary without any  principles at any minute would be removed from power straight  away. Csurka did not leave any doubt in his audience as to the  fact that the MIEP wishes to totally upset the current  "pseudo-order" because the time for "real order" has come. The  simple thesis that everything is based on lies in Hungary is the  basis for this grand development of society. For this reason,  the party declared fundamental changes in the order established  by the [former Prime Minister] Antall era, and this might even  mean that they will again start to fight against communism.    "What else could be meant by the apportioning in the left  wing but the fact that they share out the fat jobs and the well-  functioning economic areas between themselves. However, in the  past four years, they have been doing the same, namely they have  been distributing the areas that make them rich," Csurka said,  and he set the direction of the MIEP's program as follows:    "We want to break with the state administration of [former  Finance Ministers] Lajos Faluvegi, Laszlo Bekesi, and [Finance  Minister] Ivan Szabo, and with the foreign policies of [former  Foreign Ministers] Frigyes Puja, Gyula Horn, and [Foreign  Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, which destroy the nation. We are  different from the other Hungarian political parties in the  sense that, in addition to criticizing the disorders of domestic  conditions, we actually do something against them. Therefore,  our election program helps us to get into power, and the power  is only a means for us to help implement our program that will  improve the situation of the Hungarians! We can confidently say  that we are the resolute force that will implement the real  change of the regime."    Csurka said the following in conclusion:    I have to end my speech with the slogan of officers of the  so- often cursed [former governor] Horthy 's army: Ladies and  Gentlemen, victory or Siberia!    The first contribution was made by Lajos Posze, the sacked  chairman and director general of the Szerencsejatek Rt.  [gambling enterprise], and he suggested, among other things,  that the state should take gambling under its own authority for  at least five years, because it is an untenable situation that  50 to 70 billion forints a year go into the pockets of the mafia  people operating one-armed bandits while, lately, families have  been brutally murdered for the income from gambling machines.  According to Co- Chairman Lajos Horvath, quite a few of the  high-ranking military leaders still continue to lead a double  life.    He summed up the future of Hungary's foreign policy as  follows:    We have been here for a thousand years and we want to stay  for at least another thousand years. Therefore, it is an  unnecessary and irreparable decision to sacrifice the Hungarian  minorities for a hoped-for European Community membership.  Foreign Minister Jeszenszky is still working against the  Hungarians living beyond our border who are desperately seeking  autonomy!    Horvath said that we must be clear about the current  geopolitical situation, therefore, in place of the outdated and  discredited enemy image, he suggested that responsible Hungarian  politicians grade Hungary's neighbors according to risk.    Finally, let us read a section from the MIEP's election  program.    "The chaos of the Antall era, with its quagmire and pact,  appears to prove that it is impossible to create order because  the group of leaders from the past period are stronger and will  prevent this. Thank God, this is not true, either!    "This will was lacking in the Antall leadership.    "If the democratically elected political power has the will  to create order then, with the support of the majority of  people, the foundations of an order based on justice can be  established in a short period of time.    "Where should this be started?    "People coming from the soft or hard one-party system  dictatorships are weak and vulnerable, and only have the  strength to empower someone through secret voting, in the  privacy of the voting booths, to represent their interests, but  have no time themselves to create the institutions,  organizations, and constitutions of their just order.    "Therefore, the democratically elected new power and new  government will have to create a new state whose primary goal is  to put the disadvantaged strata of the Kadar-Aczel [former party  chief and cultural minister] period into a good position, and to  solidly represent their interests, at the cost, if necessary, of  squeezing out the favored people of the former period. In the  Antall period, exactly the opposite happened. Therefore, our  program essentially contains the methods of implementing these  tasks.    "This is why the nation-building state is the focus of our  ideas."</p>

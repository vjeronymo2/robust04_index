			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Threat of dividend cuts haunts chemicals sector - The European companies at risk Continued difficulties in the global chemicals industry have increased the possibility of a round of dividend cuts among European chemicals companies this year. Those with the greatest exposure to bulk chemicals, such as Germany's BASF and DSM of the Netherlands, appear to be most at risk. A gloomy announcement from the German chemical industry association earlier this month led to a rash of broker downgrades of earnings and dividend forecasts. Mr Wolfgang Hilger, the association's president and also the head of Germany's Hoechst, said that profits of German chemical companies plunged by more than 30 per cent in the first nine months of 1992, and that there were still no signs of improvement in the sector. Most chemicals analysts had been cautious about the sector since the beginning of the year, but Mr Hilger's statement was pitched below even their low expectations, and confirmed their fears that dividends would have to be cut. BASF, whose earnings are the most vulnerable of the three German majors because of the severity of the commodity chemical downturn, is widely expected to cut its dividend again this year. The company's plans to reduce its employee bonuses and cut 9 per cent of the workforce at its troubled magnetic recording division were both taken as indications that a cut was in the offing. Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt and Goldman Sachs in London expect BASF to cut its dividend to DM9 from last year's DM12. CSFB and Robert Fleming are forecasting a DM2 reduction to DM10, while Hoare Govett is more optimistic with its forecast of DM11. Regarding Bayer and Hoechst, DB Research expects a fall of DM2 for both companies to DM11 and DM10 respectively. UK brokers polled are expecting Bayer to hold its payout steady or only to drop it by DM1, owing to the defensive qualities of its pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals divisions. However, for Hoechst, which has the biggest exposure to the US of the three, a fall of up to DM2 is predicted. The German stock market has already started to discount the possibility of dividend cuts in the chemical sector, athough the companies themselves are unlikely to announce the 1992 payout until early 1993. This has been reflected in the shares of all three, which fell back to their lows for the year in late September. Analysts say that the dividend issue is likely to grow in importance if the companies' third-quarter results, due in the second half of November, are weaker than expected. Although the sector's outlook remains bleak, some analysts believe that the downside risk of shares in BASF, Hoechst and Bayer is limited to 10 per cent, since the prospect of lower interest rates in Germany will make their dividend yields that much more attractive to investors, especially domestic holders who benefit from a tax credit. Indeed, their shares recovered recently on signs that the Bundesbank was about to ease money market rates. The axe is also hanging over the dividend of Holland's DSM, although at a recent analysts' meeting the management indicated strongly that it would like to maintain the dividend if at all possible. CSFB believes that the company might well do so, although it remains a close call and would mean paying an uncovered dividend in 1993. Robert Fleming warns that if DSM keeps its dividend at last year's Fl 8, its payout ratio will rise to a high 84 per cent of earnings. This, and the company's vulnerability to the petrochemicals cycle, has prompted the broker to reduce its dividend forecast for DSM to Fl 5, which would bring the ratio down to 53 per cent. Akzo, on the other hand, is expected to keep its 1992 dividend steady at Fl 6.50, and CSFB, Robert Fleming and Goldman Sachs expect the company to raise it to Fl 7 next year if it achieves an increase in earnings. Akzo's pharmaceutical operations, as well as its specialty chemicals, coatings and fibres activities, give it a higher gearing to an economic upturn than DSM. Similarly defensive qualities have made the share price of Henkel, the German consumer-oriented, applied chemicals company, one of the best performers in the sector this year. Consequently, Henkel may be the only one to raise its dividend.</p>

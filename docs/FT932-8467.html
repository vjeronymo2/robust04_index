			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / BR asbestosis award is cancelled A RECORD Pounds 440,000 damages award to the widow of a former worker at British Rail's Swindon works who died from asbestosis was cancelled by the Court of Appeal yesterday. The court allowed an appeal by BR and ordered a rehearing of the compensation claim, which was launched by Mr Percy Coombs after he became ill and taken over by his widow Sally after his death in 1989. Three appeal judges held that Mr Justice Johnson wrongly refused to allow BR time to amend its written defence so as to challenge over Pounds 100,000 of the losses put forward by Mrs Coombs's lawyers in her statement of claim.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Socialists ahead in Hungarian elections Former communists continued their comeback in eastern Europe yesterday, taking a commanding lead in the first round of Hungary's parliamentary elections. With nearly all the votes counted, the Hungarian Socialist party (MSZP) had 33 per cent. This was three times its tally in 1990 when the electorate delivered its verdict on four decades of communist dictatorship. The left relegated the ruling right-wing Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) to a humiliating third place with just 12 per cent of the vote, as Hungarians punished the government for the one-fifth decline in GDP since the collapse of communism. But the third force in Hungarian politics, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), benefited from a surprising last-minute surge and took 20 per cent of the vote. The Hungarian elections establish as a firm trend the resurgence of former communists on a tide of public disillusionment with the pain of economic transition. Socialists are back in power in Poland and Lithuania, and only in the Czech Republic have the ruling conservatives maintained their popularity. Foreign investors and the stock market reacted calmly, expecting Socialist technocrats to continue or even accelerate economic reform. The party's domestic opponents warn, however, that the Socialists will also come under pressure to meet their supporters' expectations of an immediate improvement in living standards and employment. 'Maybe we have reason to be happy, but we should not be too confident because it will be difficult to govern,' said Mr Laszlo Bekesi, a former Socialist finance minister likely to hold the same portfolio in the new government. The liberal revival may be sufficient to force the Socialists to look for partners to form a government. The Free Democrats, their preferred allies, say they would insist that a coalition follow the liberals' tough economic programme. Surprisingly, Socialist technocrats admit they would welcome the opportunity to share responsibility for painful economic measures. As in Poland, the Hungarian ex-communists may offer the premiership to the leader of their coalition partner, the Free Democrats' Mr Gabor Kuncze. The composition of parliament, in which six parties are expected to win seats, will only be decided after the second round of voting on May 29. Extrapolating from yesterday's trends, the Socialists would emerge with more than 200 of the 386 seats in parliament. About 60 seats would go to the Free Democrats and the MDF would get 30. But the liberals believe it has narrowed to a two-party race and suggest that fear of an ex-communist landslide will draw voters to them, denying the Socialists an outright majority.

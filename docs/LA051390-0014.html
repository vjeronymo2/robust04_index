			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Let's get "Hunter" back to Saturday night! We always looked forward to NBC's  Saturday schedule in our house.  </P> <P> Not anymore, however. We will be turning to Connie Chung on CBS at 10 p.m. so  long as "Carol &amp; Company" and "Down Home" air in "Hunter's" old time slot.  </P> <P> Ann P. Hall, San Antonio, Tex.  </P></p>

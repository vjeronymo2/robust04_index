			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUYER PLEASED TO GET VAN GOGH AT $82.5 MILLION  </P> <P> The manager of the Japanese gallery that bought Vincent Van Gogh's 1890  painting "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" at a New York auction for a record $82.5  million said today he got a good deal for his money.  </P> <P> "I figured people would be surprised by the price, but I think it was not  really that expensive," said Kazunori Tanabe, the manager of the Kobayashi  Gallery, which purchased the painting Tuesday for a major Japanese company that  has not been identified.  </P> <P> The painting, consigned to auction at Christie's by the estate of Siegfried  Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker, was valued at between $40 million and  $50 million before the auction.  </P> <P> The sale price of $82.5 million far eclipsed the previous world art auction  record of $53.9 million paid in 1987 by the Getty Museum in Malibu for another  Van Gogh work, "Irises."  </P> <P> "Such an exquisite painting rarely appears on the market," Tanabe said.  </P> <P> Tanabe would not say which company bought the painting or whether the company  intends to show it publicly. Japanese companies often display famous works of  art at their headquarters.  </P> <P> Japanese companies have purchased many major works of art since the value of  the Japanese yen began to rise in 1985, making purchases in other currencies  cheaper.  </P> <P> Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. bought Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" in  March, 1987, for $38 million and displays it in its head office.  </P> <P> Earlier story on A1.  </P></p>

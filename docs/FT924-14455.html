			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Technology: Farewell to the Teddy bear - Emiko Terazono finds that Japanese children want electronic office goodies for Christmas With less than three months left until Christmas, Japanese toy companies are preparing to stock the country's toy shops with high-tech goodies, rather than the traditional Teddy bear or wooden bricks. While many manufacturers have returned to making simpler products as the current recession has forced consumers to go back to basics, toy makers are defying the trend and presenting children with expensive high-technology electronic products. Recent surveys have indicated that electronic toys are in strong demand among Japanese children. Toy makers have also discovered that high-tech gadgets bring in fatter profits than conventional toys. When Takara, the leading toy maker, introduced its word processor for children two years ago, the demand was so high that the company created new sophisticated versions during the following years. 'Children want the same things as adults,' says Tomoko Matsue of Takara. My First Sony, a line of kid's audio equipment from the big electronics manufacturer, was created in 1987 on a similar concept. Japanese toy makers are feeling the impact of demographic changes, as the decline in the number of children per household squeezes sales. But the trend has also made Japanese parents willing to spend more on a child. Toy makers have responded by introducing 'higher value added' toys to their ranges. The industry rule that high-priced toys will not sell was proved wrong by brisk sales of Takara's Y39,800 (Pounds 185) word processor, co-developed with Sharp, the office automation maker. The most recent version, launched this year, costs Y55,000 (Pounds 260), but is seeing strong demand. Takara expects to sell 40,000 units this year. The word processor has many of the same functions as the kind sold to adults, but includes a simpler instruction manual and illustrated keys. Takara has targeted the mid-primary school age group. 'The children, especially girls, use the word processor to write letters and make greeting cards,' says Matsue. Some adults, who find the sophisticated models from leading electronics makers too complicated, are also using the children's version. Other electronic gadgets for children offered by Takara in its 'Kid's Electronics' range include the electronic diary and cordless phone. Other than the usual address and schedule modes, the electronic diary has a fortune-telling function, a recent hit with children. The cordless phone has a time-limit function which prevents long conversations by children, and a function which limits the telephone numbers the phone can dial. Takara's success has prompted other toy makers to follow suit. Bandai, the largest toy maker, and Sega, the video game company, have also entered the scramble in the high-tech toy market. Sega will next month launch its word processor, targeting children at the pre-school level as an 'introductory' model. 'Children demand the same functions as the real thing, but simpler operating modes,' says Sega. Sega's word processor 'Kan-Tan' - meaning easy in Japanese - is cheaper than the other makers. At Y15,800, it consists of a small, light keyboard where the functions can be changed by spreading different letter sheets on to the keyboard. The computer games have helped children grow accustomed to knobs and function keys. 'Children are more adaptable to high-technology products,' says Sega. As the Japanese government intends to introduce computer science as a compulsory course in junior high-schools, an increasing number of parents are keen to see their children learn to use computers. Sega says it is developing a new range of high-tech toys to be launched within the next few years. Although toy makers are the main manufacturers of children's high-technology products, the market holds great potential for the leading electronics makers as well. 'In a few years, we will probably meet high competition from the large consumer electronics companies,' says Sega.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MOST WANTED TOYS OF JAPANESE 7-12 YEAR OLDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

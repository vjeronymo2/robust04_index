He further said that to foil terrorist attacks,  officers and soldiers have to be alert and vigilant. An instant  reaction by a soldier who finds himself on the scene of an  attempted attack can make all the difference between a  successful or a foiled attack.    Our correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that the chief of  staff inspected the preparations for the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.</p>

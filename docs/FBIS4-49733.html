			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Shi Hwei-yow, deputy  secretary-general of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF), said here today that his group has  preliminarily increased knowledge about the Qiandao Lake  incident after the mainland experts' answers to the questions of  the SEF group.    Shi said that at present, his group is only raising  questions  and listening to the answers for further understanding of the  incident.    This morning, Li Yafei, deputy secretary-general of the  mainland Association for the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS), invited the SEF group including experts and relatives  of the victims of the Qiandao Lake incident to attend a meeting  for introducing the incident and the process of discovering the  murder case.    At the meeting, the SEF group watched a slide and video show  about the incident.    In the afternoon, the mainland experts answered the SEF  group's questions and provided them with maps and sketches of  the tour boat titled "Hairui", where the murder case occurred.    Shi said that the mainland experts answered all the  questions  raised by his group, which includes some experts.    The questions mainly involved the murderers' background,  devices used in the robbery, murder and arson, the unfolding of  the crimes, and the process of discovery in the case.    Shi said that the questions raised by the SEF group and  experts are the questions for "understanding", not for "doubts".    He said that his group still hopes to speak directly to the  witnesses and suspects in the murder case.    But the mainland law experts said that according to the law  and related regulations on the mainland, only personnel of the  judicial department and assigned staff can meet the murder  suspects.    The mainland experts invited by ARATS included Ma Guangwu,  director of the Zhejiang Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office, Cai  Yangmeng, deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Public  Security Bureau, and some other officials, senior engineers and  senior legal medical experts from the Ministry of Public  Security and Judicial Departments of Zhejiang Province and  Hangzhou city.    According to arrangements, the SEF group will travel to  Chun'an County tomorrow to inspect the site of the incident.</p>

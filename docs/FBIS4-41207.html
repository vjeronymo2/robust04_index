			<p>BFN     [Text] A U.S. Defense Deparment delegation led by Brigadier  General Baumann, the head of training for the 7th Army, is  visiting Georgia.    [Correspondent] The visit was agreed upon last spring in the  United States, when the visiting Georgian head of state met  Defense Secretary William Perry. The Pentagon delegation has  already met the leadership of the Georgian Defense Ministry.  The delegation was briefed on the process of army construction  in Georgia and the problems being encountered.    Today, the guests were received by Eduard Shevardnadze. He  told them that the cooperation agreement signed last spring is  already working and that this visit by military experts is a  testimony to that. Today, when the Georgian Army is still in  the early days of its development, learning from the Pentagon's  experience would be a priceless opportunity for us.    Discussing Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative, which  our republic was among the first in the CIS to join, Eduard  Shevardnadze said that the introduction of peacekeeping forces  to Abkhazia would signal the beginning of a new stage in  settling the conflict there.    At the end of the meeting, Brig. Gen. Baumann said that the  delegation came to Georgia on the instructions of Defense  Secretary Perry. We arrived here to meet officials from the  Georgian Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs and members  of Parliament, said the general. We would like to discuss  venues for cooperation and to determine our common interests.    Answering a question about his vision for cooperation, the  general said: First of all, we should study issues relating to  the training of the Georgian Army. It would be interesting to  learn how Georgia intends to develop its Army. We would like to  share with you our experience in this sphere.    The meeting was attended by Defense Minister Varden  Nadibaidze; U.S. Ambassador Kent Brown; Petre Chkheidze,  Georgian ambassador to the United States; and officials from the  office of the head of state.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statistical communique on Liaoning Province 1993 national </F> economic and social development issued by the Liaoning  Provincial Statistical Bureau]    [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of the provincial  party committee and the provincial government, the whole  province conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th  party congress, extensively carried out all tasks on the "second  pioneering work," and succeeded in effecting a sustained and  rapid growth in the national economy. Based on initial  statistics, the gross national product [GNP] of the year  totalled 180.45 billion yuan, showing an increase of 13.9  percent over the previous year if calculated in terms of  comparable prices. Of this, the GNP of the primary industry  reached 22.3 billion yuan, up 9.1 percent; the secondary  industry, 109.22 billion yuan, up 16.5 percent; and the tertiary  industry, 18.93 billion yuan, up 11.7 percent. The momentum for  economic development was strengthened, new changes took place in  the economic pattern, the people's living continued to improved,  and gratifying results were made in all undertakings.  <H5>  1. Agriculture and Rural Economy </H5>   All localities across the province conscientiously  implemented the party's various economic policies in the rural  areas, unceasingly deepened rural reform, further readjusted the  rural industrial structure, accelerated the development of the  "high- yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming" and  township enterprises, and achieved breakthrough progress in  agriculture and the rural economy. The total product of the  rural society amounted to 182.95 billion yuan during the year,  up 55.6 percent over the previous year, and its proportion in  the whole province's total product of society rose from 36.6  percent to 39.2 percent.    Agriculture continued to comprehensively develop. The annual  agricultural output value totalled 39 billion yuan, up 9.4  percent over the previous year if calculated in terms of  comparable prices. Of this, the output value of crop cultivation  totalled 20.81 billion yuan, up 15.1 percent.    Grain production continued to set an all-time record on the  basis of reaping bumper harvests three years in a row. The  annual grain output totalled 16.96 million tonnes, an increase  of 1.276 million tonnes; and the output of major economic crops,  such as oil-bearing crops, beets, and vegetables, except cotton  which suffered a decline in production, all increased by varying  degrees. A bumper fruit harvest was reaped. Of this, the  output of apples broke the record of 1 million tonnes for the  first time and reached 1.196 million tonnes.    The output of major farm products was as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |Percentage increase over |  |                         |                         |1992                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grain                    |16.95 tonnes             |8.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |of which: paddy          |3.896 million tonnes     |-6.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |corn                     |9.891 million tonnes     |14.4                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |wheat                    |665,000 tonnes           |1.5                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |soybean                  |522,000 tonnes           |61.1                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cotton                   |19,000 tonnes            |-32.1                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oil-bearing crops        |218,000 tonnes           |23.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Beet                     |538,000 tonnes           |2.9                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cured tobacco            |32,000 tonnes            |the same                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Silk Cocoon              |36,000 tonnes            |38.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vegetables               |11.627 million tonnes    |15.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fruits                   |1.888 million tonnes     |23.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      New progress was made in forestry and afforestation. The  annual forestry output value reached 870 million yuan, up 10  percent over the previous year; the new afforested areas reached  162,000 hectare (2.43 million mu), up 8 percent; the average  tree survival rate was 84.4 percent; and 160 million trees were  planted and 12,000 hectare (177,000 mu) of saplings were  cultivated on a voluntary basis. New progress was made in the  five major protection forest systems and the four major  afforestation projects, and the management of forestry resources  was further strengthened.    Animal husbandry production grew steadily. The annual  animal husbandry output value totaled 11.16 billion yuan, up 11  percent from the preceding year. Meat output totaled 1.404  million tonnes, up 19.1 percent; of which pork output was 1.022  million tonnes, up 11.8 percent, and beef and mutton output was  132,000 tonnes, up 59 percent. An increase was registered in  all the year- end number of pigs, cattle, and goats and sheep in  stock, which stood at 12.283 million, 1.92 million, and 2.644  million heads, respectively.    Fishery continued to development. The annual output of  aquatic products totaled 1.517 million tonnes, up 14.7 percent  from the preceding year. Of the total, seawater products came  to 1.397 million tonnes, up 13.9 percent; and freshwater  products 120,000 tonnes, up 25 percent.    Investment in agriculture increased and conditions for  production improved continuously. The annual local financial  allocation for the expenses on agricultural production totaled  1.34 billion yuan, up 25.3 percent from the preceding year; and  the year-end remaining sum of the agricultural loans of  agricultural banks and credit cooperatives was 10.08 billion  yuan, up 9.8 percent from the year- end sum of the preceding  year. Technology on scientific farming was disseminated  continuously. More than 95 percent of Liaoning's total  cultivated land was sown to fine-strain crops; standardized  cultivation of corn and rice was applied to 1.225 million  hectares (18.37 million mu) of farmland, an increase of 158,000  hectares (2.37 million mu) over the preceding year; and rational  application of fertilizer, plastic sheet mulching, interplanting  of mixed crops, and other applicable technology were applied.  Water conservation construction was intensified, and farm  mechanization was upgraded continuously. In the whole year, 410  million cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed,  2,100 km of river dikes were improved, water and soil  conservation areas increased by 177,000 hectares (2.65 million  mu), and effective irrigated land increased by 52,000 hectares  (780,000 mu). The year-end power of farm machines totaled 9.946  million kw; acreage farmed by machines 2.567 million hectares  (38.498 million mu), up 49.2 percent; amount of chemical  fertilizer applied (100 percent effective content equivalent)  951,000 tonnes, up 5.1 percent; and rural consumption of  electricity 7.37 billion kw hours [kwh], up 12 percent.    Township enterprises, as new growing points of the economy,  achieved a new leap and simultaneous increase in growth rate and  economic efficiency. According to the statistics of pertinent  departments, township enterprises' annual output value totaled  146.4 billion yuan, up 67.6 percent from the preceding year in  terms of comparable prices; their profits 10.62 billion yuan, up  47.3 percent; and the sales taxes and income taxes they should  pay 5.06 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent. By the end of the year,  the towns and townships whose output value exceeded 100 million  yuan had increased from 236 in the preceding year to 360, those  whose output value exceeded 1 billion yuan from 7 to 10, and  those whose output value exceeded 10 million yuan from 1,065 to  1,700. Major problems in agriculture and rural economy were the  rapid growth in the prices of the means of agricultural  production and the rather low profits from farm products.  <H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>   In industry, guided by the market, enterprises deepened  their  reform, accelerated the transformation of the operating  mechanism and structural adjustment, and notably accelerated  their production rate thanks to the growth in investment and  consumption. The total industrial output value of the  enterprises at and above the township level came to 267.6  billion yuan, up 14.8 percent from the preceding year in terms  of comparable prices; and that of all the enterprises, including  those at and below the village level, was 349.98 billion yuan,  up 25.9 percent, the largest annual growth rate since reform and  opening up started.    Industrial enterprises of different ownerships  comprehensively increased in number, particularly the nonstate  industrial enterprises. The annual output value of the nonstate  industrial sector amounted to 166.08 billion yuan, up 50.6  percent over the previous year, and its proportion in the  province's total industrial output value rose from 43.2 percent  to 47.5 percent. Of this, the output value of collective  industry in the urban and rural areas topped 100 billion yuan  for the first time and reached 111.23 billion yuan, up 68.4  percent; that of industrial enterprises of other ownerships with  Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and  exclusively foreign-funded enterprises as the mainstay totalled  19.06 billion yuan, up 43 percent; and that of private  industrial enterprises in the urban and rural areas totalled  35.79 billion yuan, up 70.7 percent. The output value of state-  owned industrial enterprises during the year totalled 183.9  billion yuan, up 5.3 percent over the previous year. A great  number of large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  entered the market to seek survival and development in the  course of changing the operational mechanism, and their vitality  was strengthened. The output value of large- and medium-sized  industrial enterprises during the year totalled 184.49 billion  yuan, up 6.5 percent over the previous year.    Motivated by investment demands, the heavy industrial sector  maintained a rapid growth in production. The annual industrial  output value totalled 277.17 billion yuan, up 28.1 percent over  the previous year; the production of light industry began to  pick up steadily, and the annual light industrial output value  totalled 72.81 billion yuan, up 20 percent.    The product mix was further readjusted and the product  quality improved. Industrial enterprises organized production  in line with market demands, increased the output of products  that can find a ready market, and strengthened the development  of new products. During the year, 5,733 varieties of new  products were developed, of which, 4,211 varieties were put into  production; the output value rate of new products rose from 8.2  percent from the previous year to 8.5 percent; and the product  quality steadily improved. A sample survey and examination of  553 batches of industrial products during the year showed that  384 batches of products were up to standard. The rate of  up-to-standard products was 73.8 percent, up 4 percent over the  previous year.    The output of major industrial products was as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993

The  profits and taxes of the independent accounting industrial  enterprises reached 26.35 billion yuan, an increase of 59.5  percent. Of this, profits accounted for 10.37 billion yuan, an  increase of 1.8 times. The index of the overall economic  results of the industrial enterprises was 95.6 percent. Of  this, the industrial product sales rate was 95.6 percent, the  capital profit and tax rate was 10.1 percent, the added value  rate of industries was 30.7 percent, the per capita labor  productivity (calculated in terms of added value) was 13,708  yuan, all showing increases in varying degrees. Due to the big  increases in the prices of such intermediate products as raw  materials and energy resources, the blocked sales of some  products, and the poor management of some enterprises, the  number of money-losing enterprises and the amounts of deficits  still remained high. A total of 4,399 or 19.6 percent of  industrial enterprises suffered losses and the deficits reached  5.33 billion yuan.    State enterprises made new headway in reform. At the end of  last year, 553 state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises  carried out the method for management of five kinds of assets,  47 large- and medium-sized enterprises organized shareholding  corporations, the small state-owned enterprises made new strides  for reforming the property right, 121 enterprises carried out  the shareholding system, 2,323 town enterprises carried out the  shareholding cooperative system, 72 enterprises carried out the  leasing system, 241 enterprises carried out the system of state  ownership and civilian management, 14 enterprises were auctioned  off, and six enterprises were closed down and declared  bankruptcy. Enterprises promoted the change of the managerial  mechanism through reform and accelerated the pace of sending  enterprises to markets.    The production of the construction trade was noticeably  accelerated. The total output value of the construction trade  reached 39.09 billion yuan, an increase of 45.8 percent. Of  this, the output value of the state-owned construction  enterprises reached 16.93 billion yuan, an increase of 36.9  percent; and that of construction enterprises -- other than  those state-owned -- reached 22.16 billion yuan, an increase of  53.5 percent. The construction areas of the state-owned  construction enterprises reached 23.463 million square meters,  an increase of 18.4 percent. The per capita labor productivity  (calculated in terms of the total output value) was 31,046 yuan,  an increase of 33.7 percent. The quality of construction  projects was improved.  <H5>  3. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>   The speed of investment in construction items was  accelerated. The investment in fixed assets was 68.14 billion  yuan, an increase of 56 percent over the previous year. Of  this, the investment in local projects reached 49.08 billion  yuan, an increase of 60.1 percent. Of the investment in fixed  assets, the investment of state-owned units reached 58.03  billion yuan, an increase of 59.9 percent; and that of the urban  and rural collective units reached 6.66 billion yuan, an  increase of 54.3 percent. Of this, the investment of the rural  collectives reached 4.38 billion yuan, an increase of 69.3  percent; and that of the urban and rural individuals reached  3.44 billion yuan, an increase of 11.8 percent.    The investment in capital construction increased by a big  margin. The investment structure was further readjusted. The  construction of key projects continued to be strengthened. The  state-owned units invested 26.88 billion yuan in capital  construction, an increase of 57.3 percent. The investment was  focused on basic industries, communications and transportation  industries, urban public service facilities, reconstruction of  urban districts, infrastructural facilities, and tertiary  industry. Of the investment made during the year, 13.25 billion  yuan was used by energy resources and raw materials industries,  an increase of 77 percent over the previous year; 650 million  yuan was used by agriculture, an increase of 36 percent; 1.87  million yuan was used by transportation and communications and  postal and telecommunications industries, an increase of 60.3  percent; 3.12 billion yuan was used to build urban public  service facilities and reconstruct urban districts, an increase  of 1.2 times; and 6.25 billion yuan was used to build catering  service, scientific research, cultural, educational, public  health, and social welfare centers, an increase of 56.9 percent.  Among the 68 large- and medium- sized capital construction  projects under construction, nine were completed and  commissioned, and three single-item projects were commissioned.  Investment in key construction projects totaled 12.4 billion  yuan, equivalent to 98.8 percent of the annual plan, and its  proportion to the investment in capital construction grew from  43.3 percent to 46.1 percent. However, shortages of  construction funds and the low rate of the funds in place  remained conspicuous.    Technical transformation of enterprises was accelerated. The  annual investment of state-owned units in replacement of  equipment and technical transformation totaled 17.63 billion  yuan, up 52.9 percent from the preceding year. The investment  was made mainly in industry, transportation, and post and  telecommunication. Of the total, 1.66 billion yuan was invested  in electronic industry, up 6.9 times from the preceding year;  1.91 billion yuan in energy industry, up 1.4 times; 2.27 billion  yuan in machinery industry, up 1.1 times; and 2.77 billion yuan  in transportation, post, and telecommunication, up 82.5 percent.  Judging from the structure of the investment, investment in  purchases of equipment and installation projects totaled 9.29  billion yuan, accounting for 52.7 percent of the investment in  replacement of equipment and technical transformation; that in  productive projects totaled 14.05 billion yuan, accounting for  79.7 percent, of which 2.94 billion yuan was invested in energy  conservation, increase of variety and patterns, improvement of  product quality, and treatment of "three wastes," up 10.8  percent; and that in reconstruction projects totaled 7.58  billion yuan, up 25.3 percent. Among the 78 key equipment  replacement and technical transformation projects whose  investment was above the stipulated norms, which were built in  the year, 11 were completed and commissioned. The Dalian Hualu  Electronic Industrial Company and the China Hualu Electronic  Limited Company established the annual production capacity of  150,000 video recorders and 1.5 million video recorder fuses,  becoming China's largest production base for video recorders and  major components.    Investment in construction of commercial houses increased  substantially. The annual investment totaled 11.17 billion  yuan, up 1.5 times from the preceding year; and 9.179 million  square meters were completed in the year, up 45.6 percent. Of  the total investment, that in residential houses came to 8.69  billion yuan, up 1.1 times; and 8.08 million square meters were  completed, up 37.2 percent.    In the whole year, 4,019 projects of state-owned units built  with fixed asset investment were completed and commissioned, of  which 1,516 were capital construction projects, and 2,503 were  technical transformation projects. These state-owned units  built 21.767 million square meters of houses of various types,  up 23.2 percent from the preceding year; and increased their  fixed assets by 37.75 billion yuan, up 48.5 percent. New  production capacity and efficiency included 42,000 kw of power  generation, 2.15 million tonnes of crude oil extraction, 1.5  million tonnes of iron ore mining, 33,000 tonnes of steel  smelting, 654,000 tonnes of cement, 115,000 tonnes of ethylene,  10,000 motor vehicles, 1.35 million color kinescopes, and 3,470  km of microwave communications lines.  <H5>  4. Transportation, Post, and Telecommunication </H5>   The increase trend continued in transportation. The annual  volume of cargo transportation by various means totaled 830  million tonnes, up 2.5 percent from the preceding year. Of the  total, cargo transported by railways within the boundary was 147  million tonnes, down 1 percent; that transported by highways 620  million tonnes, up 3.9 percent; that transported by waterways  18.82 million tonnes, down 0.6 percent; and cargo and mail  transported by civil airways within the boundary 23,000 tonnes,  up 9.5 percent.

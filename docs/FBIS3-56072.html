			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Foreign Affairs Ministry Press Center of the  Republic of Latvia reports that the Foreign Affairs Ministry has  submitted a note to the Russian Federation embassy in Latvia.    In the note, the ministry apologizes for the incident of 10  January, and explains that preliminary investigation has been  made into the case and the person guilty of it was dismissed  from office. As the above-mentioned incident happened on the  very eve of the interstate talks, Latvia considers it as an  attempt by certain circles in Latvia to hamper the progress of  the talks and complicate interstate relations.    The note says that the Latvian Government will do everything  possible to ward off such provocations in future, and stresses  that in future all the issues related to the withdrawal of the  Russian Army will also be tackled by way of talks.</p>

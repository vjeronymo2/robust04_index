			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLEEK CHIC  </P> <P> Hey, Barbara Foley, how about joining the '90s? I found it dismaying that you  considered only women who work outside the home to be "successful Southern  California women." What about those women that have foregone the social  acceptability of outside employment to stay at home raising our next  generation?  </P> <P> Why is it so hard for our society to recognize this group of working women, and  why do we continue to be stereotyped? You may not believe this, but there are  some housewives out here that are educated, intelligent and, yes, chic.  </P> <P> JULIE LANGLOIS  </P> <P> West Covina  </P></p>

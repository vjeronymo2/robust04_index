			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] TV and radio programs from Moscow and Chita TV and  Radio company went off the air throughout the entire territory  of Chita Oblast early this morning. Vyacheslav Shirokiy, our  correspondent, reports:    [Shirokiy] Chita communications workers have finally carried  out their threat. Having found themselves practically isolated  today they decided to stand firm till the end. The point is  that Viktor Malakiyev, head of the local territorial radio  broadcasting center, received a telegram from the Communications  Ministry to the effect that as a result of talks, an accord was  reached with the government on a stage-by-stage repayment of all  the existing debts.    However, the Transbaykal communications workers could not be  satisfied with this kind of response -- all too often in the  recent past they received similar promises that usually remained  nothing more than just so many hollow gestures.    Currently, and due to the fact that the TV and radio company  has failed to pay its debts to the communications workers, they  owe almost 1 billion rubles to the Transbaykal power engineering  people alone and they, in turn, constantly threaten to pull the  plugs at the main relay stations in Chita Oblast.    There have already been several instances of this kind, when  the radio fell silent in the eastern Transbaykal area for more  than 24 hours at a time. Today, too, almost 2 million  Transbaykal people are left without up-to-date information about  events taking place in the country.    In his short interview for Radio Rossii, Viktor Malakiyev,  the head of the territorial Radio Broadcasting and  Communications Center, noted that we all became hostages of the  economic chaos caused by the government itself that prevaricated  till the last moment with the financing for the country's TV and  radio companies, and that never bothered to repay the existing  debts in good time, end of quote.    Whatever the merits of this case are, people in Chita Oblast  now understand that the present stoppage in TV and radio  broadcasts being put out represents the first and a completely  real step toward destroying the country's unified information  space. One would like to believe that the government will, at  long last, reach the same conclusion.</p>

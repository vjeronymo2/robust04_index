			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> FAMILY TO GET SHARE OF SAILOR'S INSURANCE  </P> <P> Sailor Kendall L. Truitt will share a $100,000 life insurance payment with the  family of a crew mate who the Navy concluded probably had set off an explosion  in a gun turret of the battleship Iowa that killed 47 men, Truitt's attorney  said in Miami. Gunner's Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, who died in the April 19  explosion, had named Truitt as beneficiary of the insurance policy, but payment  was held up by claims filed by Hartwig's family. That impasse has been  resolved, Truitt's attorney said, but he would not give details. He did say  that part of the payment will be spent for a memorial to the Iowa's dead  crewmen.  </P></p>

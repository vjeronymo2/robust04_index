			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 11 (XINHUA) - King Norodom Sihanouk  of Cambodia announced suddenly today that he will leave for  China on May 18 to resume chemotherapy treatment for cancer.    A statement released by the royal palace said the reason the  king is going to China earlier than planned is because he has  been "slandered" over his latest proposals for peace.    Some local newspapers have recently accused the king of  seeking to regain power by proposing new elections.    "From now on, I quit concerning myself with this tragic  problem between the royal government and the Democratic  Kampuchea Party. I don't want people to continue to slander  me," the king, who repeatedly sought a peaceful solution to the  civil war, said in a written statement.    In order to end the civil war and realize peace and national  reconciliation in the country, Sihanouk proposed holding an  early election to give the Democratic Kampuchea Party a chance  to join the government.    On May 9, Khieu Samphan wrote to Sihanouk saying that he  supported the proposal, but the government did not give a  positive response. Some officials expressed the view that the  term of the present government has yet expired, and that there  are no fund available for another national election.</p>

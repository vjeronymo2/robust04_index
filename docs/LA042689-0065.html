			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO DIRE EFFECTS FROM THE LACK OF SEX  </P> <P> Question: Suppose that for one reason or another a man does not have sexual  relations for a long time. What happens to the semen? Can going without sexual  relations affect his health?  </P> <P> Answer: A lack of sexual relations over an extended period of time does not  necessarily affect a man's physical or emotional health. After a while, there  is a reduction in the amount of semen produced and, eventually, the sperm die.  </P> <P> Q: Suppose a woman who is in the menopause has been told that she is not  supposed to use estrogen, but she still gets symptoms of the menopause. What is  she supposed to do? Is there anything she can take or is she just supposed to  suffer?  </P> <P> A: If your question refers to a particular person and is not of a general  nature, I would strongly urge the woman to see a physician. Of course there are  treatments that can be used if estrogen use is contraindicated as, for example,  in the case of breast cancer.  </P> <P> If a woman experiences hot flushes, for example, there is medication that would  alleviate the condition. If the problem is vaginal dryness, lubrication may  prove helpful. And even in the treatment of osteoporosis, for which estrogen  replacement is the treatment of choice, other therapies are available.  </P> <P> Women with menopausal symptoms should not suffer in silence. The first step is  to see a physician.  </P> <P> Q: Is there any treatment for a child who walks in his sleep, or is it just a  matter of letting him outgrow it?  </P> <P> A: Treatment for sleepwalking must be pursued on a number of levels. For  example, from the standpoint of safety, it would simply be common sense to make  certain that there are no sharp objects and no glass in the child's room. If a  sleepwalking episode does occur, the parent or other caretaker should not  awaken the child but should calmly lead him or her back to the room and into  bed.  </P> <P> External factors, such as excessive fatigue or sleep deprivation, can trigger a  sleepwalking episode; therefore, these aggravating factors should be  eliminated.  </P> <P> More formal treatment approaches, such as psychoanalysis, have not been  uniformly successful. Some authorities recommend traditional psychotherapy only  for adults who sleepwalk and who have a definite psychiatric disorder.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, 25 Apr (PETRA)--Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has stated that there is no political  dimension in the call of His Highness Prince Hasan, the regent,  for reconsidering the valid procedures for the residence of West  Bank citizens in the kingdom. He added that this procedural  issue was aimed at facilitating measures for citizens arriving  and departing across the bridges because of the growing pressure  on state organs at the bridges. Thousands of citizens, he said,  cross the bridges every day.    During his meeting with the representatives and  correspondents of Arab and foreign news agencies and newspapers  accredited in Jordan, Dr. al-Majali asserted that nothing  decisive and final has been issued so far regarding the siege of  al-'Aqabah.    The prime minister denied that there were U.S. conditions  for  lifting the siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, noting that Jordan  has announced that it will send a very low-level delegation to  the multilateral negotiations to express its dissatisfaction  with the contradiction between the objectives of the  multilateral negotiations, which have economic and social aims  in the region, and the maintenance of a siege or punitive  measures on one of the parties. This, he said, will destabilize  the national economy that should be improved as a result of  these negotiations.    The prime minister appealed to the fraternal Arab countries  to reschedule their political differences just as they  reschedule their economic debts. He also said that the recent  accelerating events in the region, particularly the Hebron  massacre and the situation in the Port of al-'Aqabah, have  contributed to halting the peace process, pending positive signs  on outstanding issues. He added that Jordan's decision to enter  the negotiations had nothing to do with the siege of al-'Aqabah  but was due to Jordan's firm strategy toward peace. Jordan, he  added, was among the states that first carried the torch of  peace in this region.    Following are the proceedings of the prime minister's  meeting:    Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said that  there is no political dimension in the call of His Highness  Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, for reconsidering valid  procedures for the residence of West Bank citizens in the  kingdom, adding that it is simply a procedural issue at the  bridges and the kingdom's other border points. The continued  pressure at the bridges makes it incumbent on the state organs  to change and improve many of these routine procedures.    He added that are no procedures and instructions that can  satisfy everybody and cover every case. Therefore, an issue  requiring certain measures emerges from time to time and new  developments have to be considered.    Speaking about what is new concerning the al-'Aqabah siege,  the prime minister said that so far no decisive and final  decision has been made on this issue. However, he noted, there  is an inclination to remove this cloud and that the preparations  for that are underway. Perhaps a statement on this issue will  be made following His Majesty King Husayn's meeting with the  U.S. secretary of state.    If the situation remains the same, then the Jordanian stand  is clear. We have announced that our representation at the  multilateral negotiations will be minimal as an expression of  how we feel toward the contradiction between the objectives of  the multilateral negotiations, which have economic and social  aims in the region, and the maintenance of a siege or sanctions  on one of the parties, which will destabilize the national  economy that these negotiations seek to improve.    Speaking about the options Jordan presented as solutions to  the al-'Aqabah siege, the prime minister said that Jordan  proposed that a nonpolitical and nonprofitmaking party carry out  observation rather inspection operations at the Port of  al-'Aqabah while Jordanian customs personnel inspect the  containers which arrive on board the ships.    He added that the recommended party is Lloyd's Register,  whose task will be confined to observation and inspection of  shipping documents. It will then present reports to responsible  parties on the implementation of resolutions which deal with  sanctions on Iraq.    He said that Jordan made it very clear that it will not  allow  any foreign party whatsoever to encroach on Jordan's sovereignty  over its own soil. Al-Majali said this in response to reports  that Jordan had agreed to replace naval inspections by U.S.-led  multinational forces with ground inspections.    He noted that the United States had made inquiries about  parties to carry out inspection operations and that it presented  a report to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who may  brief His Majesty King Husayn on some details and  recommendations of this report during their anticipated meeting  later today.    He said that the U.S. side had almost accepted this  Jordanian  proposal and that the details concerning the action plan and the  financing of this party are currently under discussion.    Al-Majali noted that Jordan had explained to the  international quarters its stand that al-'Aqabah is Jordan's  gate to the world and not to Iraq only. He added that if the  alliance forces want to make sure that Jordanian goods are not  being exported to Iraq, then inspection and observation should  take place at the Jordanian-Iraqi borders.</p>

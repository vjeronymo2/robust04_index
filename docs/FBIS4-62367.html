			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 16 ITAR-TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin has named a new minister of nationalities and regional  policy after dismissing Sergey Shakhray, the presidential press  service reported today.    The new minister, Nikolay Yegorov, is an ethnic Cossack, who  had made a lightning career, moving from a collective farm  chairman to the leader of Russia's largest territory to the  ministerial office.    Economist Nikolay Yegorov is 42-years-old and his last post  was the leader of Kuban, Russia's southern frontier region. He  is reputed to be a rational politician, capable of keeping  stable the situation in a multinational border territory. He  enjoys considerable authority not only in that territory but  also among the leaders of Russia's north Caucasian republics.    Yegorov favours a tougher executive discipline as people are  tired from disorder and irresponsibility and want authorities to  be authoritative and not sideline dispassionate observers.    President Boris Yeltsin began his brief vacation in the  south  last March with a five-hour conversation with Yegorov, who was  the head of administration of the Krasnodar territory. Their  discussion of Kuban's problems as Russia's southern frontier  territory, including migration of people from the flashpoints of  ethnic tension in the Commonwealth must have impressed the  president. Their discussion of migration and inter-ethnic  relations continued later and may have prompted the present  appointment.</p>

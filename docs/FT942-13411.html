			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Noranda back in the black A weak Canadian dollar, lower interest rates and improvements in some commodity prices helped Noranda, the Canadian resources group, return to profitability in the first quarter, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Earnings were CDollars 44m (USDollars 31.8m), or 18 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 31m loss, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 1.4bn from CDollars 1.25bn.</p>

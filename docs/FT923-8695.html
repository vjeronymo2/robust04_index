			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Backing into a grim future 'What I say three times is true' - the slump draws visibly nearer every week. For what he and the prime minister have said three times (and it must be 30 times by now) is not true; and his obedient echoes in the more thuggish parts of the gilt and currency markets are equally misguided. They are all living in the recent past; but it is not like the present, which resembles a nastier and more distant past. You don't believe it? Compare their key assertions against the facts. On the strategy: the French strong-currency route is the only way. 'And there is absolutely no reason why we cannot do the same,' says Mr Lamont. Fact: we are not following the French route at all. The franc was devalued several times after the policy change of 1983. In spite of this, it took nearly a decade of sub-normal growth in a world boom, topped off by a German inflation, to make the franc half-credible; and French unemployment is still rising. We are trying to repeat the experiment with no devaluation, no boom, and no hope. There is every reason why we cannot follow the French route, even if it might have been the right one 10 years ago. On the alternatives: a devaluation would raise inflation (this assertion is simply built into the model which has got everything else wrong), and so have no effect. Again, it sounds half plausible if you are insular enough; but it is wrong. Devaluing in a depressed economy does not have this effect. The French devaluations did not raise inflation, nor did the massive US devaluation since 1986, or the 10 per cent Irish devaluation of that year. Nor, for that matter, did the much larger British devaluation after the 1981 Budget. And after all of them, even within the ERM, interest rates soon resumed a falling trend. About the objective: fast reliable growth requires low inflation. Look at Japan, for example. Well, look at Japan. Through its most dynamic period, inflation averaged more than 7 per cent a year. But this did not undermine competitiveness, for the prices of traded goods made in Japan did not rise at all. The inflation was an internal adjustment to a productivity explosion in manufacturing. This is a path Britain actually could follow, thanks to the genuine Thatcher productivity revolution. But not if the economy remains in slump. On the constraints: all the alternatives are ruled out, because the markets would never permit them. I hear similar nonsense from arrogant young puppies in the gilts market every day; and US bond dealers used to make similar threats about funding the Dollars 400bn US deficit. They are all guilty of closed-market thinking. Nowadays we work in a world capital market, in which a few billion more or less on British government borrowing is barely noticeable. And we have indexed gilts. Crowding out in the London market, if it ever existed (the term 'buyers' market' is much more accurate), it ended a decade ago. And worst of all, what they don't say: that at some stage, and it could be a matter of weeks rather than months, the markets will wake up before the government does, conclude that the present policy will break down anyway, and plunge us into a sterling crisis that really could close most of the sensible options. This scenario is beginning to appear in some of the more thoughtful brokers' circulars (especially the more monetarist ones). Is anyone in the Treasury even thinking about the pre-emptive action which could be needed if this threatens to become the majority view? If not, they should be thinking about the past; not the dead days of the 1970s, but the last financial slump in the 1930s. The path Mr Major is treading is not that of President Mitterand, but that of the pre-war Labour government, which wrecked the party for three Parliaments; or that of the equally anti-inflationary Chancellor Bruning of the Weimar republic, which wrecked German democracy. If policies must be borrowed from the past, choose the relevant past.</p>

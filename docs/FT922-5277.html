			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Sport ban 'will make average guy think' ONE immediate psychological blow to Serbia of UN sanctions was the international sports ban, Our Foreign Staff reports from Belgrade and London. 'Banning the Yugoslav football and basketball teams makes the average guy think,' said a sports official in Belgrade, as he awaited last night's confirmation of the suspension by the international football association (Fifa). 'It is a crushing blow to the man in the street.' The ban prohibits the Yugoslavian team, reckoned among the world's best, taking part in the European championship finals starting in Sweden on June 10. The team will be replaced by Denmark. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) meets next week to discuss whether to exclude Yugoslavia from this summer's Barcelona Games. The International Tennis Federation banned Yugoslavia from the Davis Cup and similar competitions. Mr Juan Samaranch, IOC president, said his executive commission would meet in Lausanne to analyse the UN resolution.</p>

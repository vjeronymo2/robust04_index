			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKAWAY CHURCH SEEKS TO RECRUIT EX-ARCHBISHOP;  </P> <P> RELIGION: CATHOLIC OFFICIAL WHO RESIGNED BECAUSE OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH A  WOMAN IS URGED TO JOIN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONGREGATION.  </P> <P> The breakaway church of George Stallings on Friday said it is recruiting former  Archbishop Eugene Marino, who was the highest-ranking black U.S. Roman Catholic  until he resigned because of a relationship with a woman.  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Church officials said this week that Marino resigned last month  after the disclosure of his two-year relationship with a lay minister, Vicki R.  Long. The church previously said that Marino left because of a health problem.  </P> <P> Long, 27, who has filed a monetary claim against the archdiocese for an  undisclosed amount, has refused to comment about the relationship.  </P> <P> In Washington, Stallings, the priest who founded the African-American Catholic  Congregation, said that Marino's resignation proves the "folly" of mandatory  celibacy. He asked Marino to join his congregation.  </P> <P> "Roman Catholics intuitively know that Archbishop Marino's dark night of the  soul is not a personal failure but a failure . . . on the part of the Roman  Catholic church to deal realistically with the issue that a call to ordained  ministry is not synonymous with celibacy," Stallings said in a statement.  </P> <P> He said that his congregation "would welcome a dialogue with him about a  collaborative ministry within a viable Catholic alternative to Rome."  </P> <P> Stallings would like to install Marino as an archbishop of his new  congregation's western diocese in Los Angeles or southern diocese in New  Orleans, Stallings' spokesman, William Marshall Jr., said Friday.  </P> <P> Richard McBrien, theology chairman at Notre Dame University, said that the  Marino affair could have a harsh impact on black Catholics, who make up 2  million of the 53 million American Catholics.  </P> <P> "What I fear is that people are going to say, 'Well, he is black and . . . they  have different sorts of urges and needs,' " McBrien said. "That's racism of the  worst kind, but it will be an effort on the part of certain figures in the  church to gloss it (Marino's resignation) over."  </P> <P> Terrence Dosh, a married priest who runs a national support group for priests,  echoed that fear.  </P> <P> The incident will "hurt black Catholics in the sense that any leader of a group  who falls, they're (the church hierarchy) ashamed about it," he said.  </P></p>

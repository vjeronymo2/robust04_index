			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> FRUSTRATION ABOUNDS, SO SEIZE THE DAY;  </P> <P> THE LIBERALS' UNCERTAIN TRUMPET FINALLY MUST SOUND A BLAST THAT CAN BE HEARD.  </P> <P> One of the political hallmarks of economic frustration is that it can go either  left or right.  </P> <P> Today, our political compass is spinning. The public is increasingly  disillusioned with the conservative panaceas of the 1980s. Yet liberals are  still offering, at best, an uncertain trumpet. Public opinion mistrusts  politics in general.  </P> <P> One-time Klansman David Duke won 44% of the vote for a Louisiana U.S. Senate  seat not because nearly half of the voters are incipient Nazis, but because the  economy there is in chronic depression and mainstream politicians have few  answers. He is an omen that the political center had better heed.  </P> <P> In Massachusetts, where I live, economic grievances have caused a tax-revolt  proposition to be placed on the November ballot. It would roll back tax rates  to the point of leaving state government nearly bankrupt. And Democratic voters  here have nominated for governor John Silber, the thinking man's David Duke.  </P> <P> Just to the north, in the Canadian province of Ontario, the voters for the  first time elected a socialist government for much the same reason: frustration  with how established politicians were handling pocketbook issues. The socialist  New Democratic Party program is strongly environmentalist and proposes a more  progressive tax system, as well as expanded social services.  </P> <P> Jill Marzetti, secretary of the Ontario NDP, admits that it wasn't only the NDP  program that attracted Canadian voters. It was widespread disgust with the  cynicism and corruption of the previous centrist government, fear of a  softening economy and a desire to vote for the outs.  </P> <P> Pocketbook grievances translate into spasms of populist protest whenever times  are hard and the public feels incumbent politicians aren't responding. Voters  go left or right depending on where convincing leadership arises.  </P> <P> Where I live, the legitimacy of much of the political system is in tatters. The  Boston Globe recently ran a remarkable series about corrupt judges. Many  judges, it seems, are in the pockets of legislators who practice law on the  side. Hire the right politically connected lawyer, and a felony can be fixed  just like a parking ticket.  </P> <P> This is happening at a time when the courts are so clogged that serious  criminals wind up on the streets. Fear of crime has contributed to a voter  backlash and a new vogue for tough-on-crime conservative politicians. Yet the  last conservative governor was the very fellow who appointed many of these same  judges -- and he was elected by the same working-class voters who are mad as  hell about crime.  </P> <P> In Washington, you will recall, a conservative Administration was elected in  1980 by voters eager to restore budgetary balance. They didn't get exactly what  they bargained for, either.  </P> <P> With the broad discrediting of the policies of Reaganomics, this ought to be a  moment for an effective progressive alternative. After all, north of the  border, programs pioneered by the Canadian New Democrats are genuinely popular  -- universal health insurance, expanded child care, tough controls on  pollution, fair taxation, affordable housing.  </P> <P> In America, polls show that voters want these things, too. However, the  political system hasn't been able to deliver them. Unless somebody breaks  through this deadlock, the voters will be right to grow ever more cynical.  </P> <P> Taxing the rich, politically unthinkable two weeks ago, is now the consensus  position in the budget debate. For the first time in a decade, liberals have  set the agenda, and they seem almost stunned. It remains to be seen whether  they will be bold enough to build on this success and offer genuinely popular  alternatives. The polls show that voters truly want a health system more like  the Canadian one. They want less spending on the military, effective services  to meet the new needs of family life, and they want re-regulation of liberated  industries that went a little haywire in the free-wheeling '80s, such as banks  and airlines.  </P> <P> At long last, the Democrats in Congress are behaving a little like an  opposition party and less like the weaker half of a coalition government. In  politics, moments like this don't come around that often. Today voters express  their pocketbook frustration by staying home, voting to dismantle government or  electing know-nothing leaders -- and then wake up even more disgusted when  things get worse.  </P> <P> If liberals don't seize this moment to stake out real alternatives, they will  have themselves to blame.  </P></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Some kind of misunderstanding . . . Surprisingly few companies actually declined to take part in the survey. There were, however, one or two notable replies, writes Paul Taylor. For example, the chairman of one large British building materials group said he could not complete the questionnaire because he did not know enough about his competitors across Europe. Meanwhile, the chief executive of another British-based company said it was group policy not to take part in such surveys. Nevertheless, a completed questionnaire was received from the same group's finance director. Response rates, both positive and negative, also varied quite markedly between sectors. The highest response rates - of up to 50 per cent - came in the beverages &amp; tobacco and automobiles/auto trucks &amp; parts categories. But response rates in the steel &amp; metals processing and household, textiles &amp; clothing sectors only made it into the mid-teens. In addition, with almost 2,000 senior executives from Europe's largest companies asked to 'vote' on their peers, there were a few misunderstandings. For example, several returned questionnaires were ruled invalid because respondents voted for their own companies.</p>

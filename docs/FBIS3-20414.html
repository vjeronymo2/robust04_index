During  the last dozen years, the tax systems have undergone continuous  reform and development and their record of successes has  attracted much attention. They meet the requirements of the  development of a SEZ market economy and have done much to boost  the rapid growth of SEZ economies. By providing national tax  development with valuable experiences, they have fulfilled their  role as a laboratory. To further boost the development of the  socialist market economy in the SEZ's, we must continue to  deepen the reform of their existing tax systems.    I. Development Of Market Economy in SEZ Requires Deepening  Of  Tax Reform    SEZ market economies have the basic attributes of other  market economies, of which I think the three most important ones  are: 1) Competitiveness. Competition lies at the heart of the  market mechanism, which essentially involves the use of the  price lever to adapt to changes in supply-demand relations in  accordance with the demand of the law of value in order to put  pressure on and motivate the principal players in the economy.  Survival of the fittest steers resources to those sectors of the  economy where they can be utilized most efficiently; 2) Unity. A  market economy implies a unified market where all capital goods  can circulate freely, putting the competitive mechanism to work  on a national scale and achieving the optimal allocation of  resources; 3) Openness. This means more than dismantling the  regional barriers and bringing about interregional openness  within a country. Even more important, it requires a nation,  proceeding from national interests, to admit foreign funds and  open up its domestic market, on the one hand, and promote the  entry of its products into overseas markets, on the other, thus  taking part in competition on the international market and  bettering the efficiency of resource allocation. The development  of the SEZ market economy is premised on a unified and open  market that encourages competition. This requires the SEZ to  design a tax system, possibly a uniform one, in accordance with  established international practices and create a tax environment  that treats everybody equally in order to spur competition and  enhance efficiency. Furthermore, since the development of a SEZ  market economy entails improving economic regulation and  control, we should make the most of taxation in a SEZ as a  regulator and controller of the market economy while minimizing  its distorting effects on the market mechanism.    In China, SEZ market economies have their uniqueness as well  as the basic attributes of other market economies. Their  uniqueness is that they draw upon the success stories of market  economies around the world and carry out bold experiments to  better serve as a model for the rest of China as it develops a  socialist market economy.    Surveying existing SEZ tax systems, we can readily discover  many problems. There is an urgent need for reform deepening in  several areas, notably the following.    First, the existence of "two systems, internal and external"  and "one tax, several systems" constitutes a major barrier to  fair competition. In the early days of reform and openness, when  SEZ's were first set up, we adopted two different tax systems,  one for domestic enterprises, and one for foreign enterprises.  Take the income tax payable by a SEZ enterprise, for instance.  Although they all pay income taxes at the uniform rate of 15  percent, there are actually different rules for calculating  taxes. In effect, the "one tax, multiple systems" rule still  obtains, depending on the economic nature of the enterprise in  question. The existence of "two systems, internal and external"  and "one tax, multiple systems" makes the tax system of a SEZ  more complicated and harder to understand than it should be. The  taxpayer has trouble figuring it out. Foreign businessmen, in  particular, find the system unfamiliar. Moreover, when the  distribution of the tax burden is highly inequitable, it  strongly militates against the full utilization of the market  mechanism in the SEZ and the promotion of fair competition on a  level playing field.    Second, the existing SEZ circulation tax system is sharply  at  cross-purposes with the requirements of economic construction  and development in the SEZ's. Both the combined industrial and  commercial tax and the "three taxes," namely product tax,  value-added tax [VAT], and sales tax, run counter to the drive  to develop an export-oriented economy and a better market  economy in SEZ's. To begin with, the raison d'etre of a SEZ is  primarily to develop an export-oriented economy. Yet the current  circulation taxes clearly fall short as a regulator of imports  and exports. The combined industrial and commercial tax and the  product tax neither accurately and thoroughly channel drawbacks  back to exporters nor tax imports fully; as such they have not  stimulated export growth as strongly as they should. They have  also failed to play a strong part in regulating imports. Second,  as a window for China's four modernizations, the SEZ is supposed  to play a special role by importing foreign funds and technology  and entering into economic cooperation with units in the  interior. The current circulation tax system, however, hinders  lateral economic cooperation and specialized production as a  result of double taxation. Furthermore, under the existing  circulation tax system in SEZ's, the tax is built into the price  of a commodity. In a socialist market economy, commodity prices  are mainly determined by the market. When the tax is a built-in  component of a price, taxation becomes much less effective in  regulating production and consumption. Sometimes the flawed tax  system may even have adverse effects on market allocation. Also,  when a tax is built into a price, there is often the false  impression that enterprises are bearing the burden of the  circulation taxes. In addition, enterprises are driven to pursue  reduction in or exemptions from circulation tax, which works  against enterprises carrying out production and other operations  in accordance with the law of market competition. Finally there  is the urban preservation and construction tax, actually a  surtax on the "three taxes"-- product, VAT, and sales -- imposed  to raise funds for urban preservation and construction. But not  only is this tax inherently unscientific, it also dilutes the  regulatory effects of the "three taxes," which does not bode  well for development of a market economy in a SEZ.    Third, tax breaks in SEZ's have not been totally successful  in putting into effect the industrial policies of the central  government or the SEZ concerned or making full use of taxation  as a regulator. Among the array of preferential tax breaks, a  socialist market economy relies primarily on income tax breaks  to realize its industrial policy. In China's SEZ's today,  however, income tax breaks, particularly those offered to  foreign enterprises, have not been as successful as expected in  implementing the industrial policy and adjusting the industrial  structure or product mix. For example, the SEZ offers  preferential tax breaks to all foreign companies which invest in  production industries, including industry, agriculture,  transportation, and communications. This is the centerpiece of  preferential tax treatment for foreign-owned enterprises, yet it  does little to help steer foreign investment dollars into the  right areas. This is particularly true at a time when an SEZ is  trying to upgrade its industrial structure. To do that, a SEZ  needs to develop new industries utilizing new and high  technology and creating a critical mass of such industries as  the engine of industrial development. Yet preferential tax  breaks for high-tech industries remain very limited at the  moment; not enough to meet the requirements of optimizing the  industrial structure of the zone.    Fourth, tax construction and tax reform still fail to keep  pace with the actual developments in an SEZ economy. The SEZ  economy has been developing by leaps and bounds and new economic  phenomena have been occurring continuously, such as land sales  and appreciation in land value, the boom in real estate  transactions, and the creation and maturation of a stock market.  Besides tinkering with the system here and there, however, the  SEZ has not deepened its tax system in line with the new set of  realities. How do you properly tax the capital gains derived  from the resale of land and other real estate transactions, and  the trading of securities, for instance? That question has yet  to be answered, which has prevented tax collection from  regulating SEZ economic development effectively. As for the  experiment in tax reform, we should go in for useful experiments  in light of what is actually happening in the SEZ economy. For  instance, as the economy grows, inheritances and gifts have been  on the rise steadily and it is common for SEZ's to levy an  inheritance tax or gift tax. Or take the issue of social  insurance. Social insurance is a relatively simple thing in  SEZ's, which should facilitate the experiment of levying a  social insurance tax. Thus far, however, the Shenzhen SEZ has  not departed from the nationwide tax system by embarking on bold  experimentation in this area.    The gratifying thing is that the Shenzhen SEZ has gone one  step ahead of others in solving these problems, achieving  enormous successes and gaining useful experiences. Not only has  it set uniform rates for calculating income taxes payable by SEZ  enterprises and preferential tax breaks, but it has also  basically standardized the circulation tax system and totally  unified the local tax system. In so doing, it has greatly  speeded up the development of a market economy, setting an  important example for other SEZ's. At the same time, we should  see that there are still problems in the Shenzhen SEZ's existing  tax system, notably the following. Neither the circulation tax  system at the import end nor the personal income tax system have  been made uniform, the circulation tax system still seems to  fall short on the whole, the corporate income tax system needs  to be optimized, and more needs to be done to deepen tax  construction and tax reform in light of the reality in the zone.  More reform is needed in all those areas.    II. Deepen Tax Reform in SEZ's, Spur Development of Market  Economy    A. To deepen tax reform in SEZ's, we must straighten out two  sets of relationships.    In view of the fact that the tax system of a SEZ is an  important part of the nation's tax system and that there are  considerable objective differences between the tax systems of  the various SEZ's at the moment, I believe deepening tax reform  in SEZ's requires us to straighten out the relations between SEZ  tax systems and the national tax system as well as relations  among the tax systems of all the SEZ's.    1. How to straighten out relations between SEZ tax systems  and the national tax system?    The tax systems of the SEZs should be relatively independent  of the national tax system, a conclusion arrived at after  considering a host of factors including the reality in SEZ's and  the inherent requirements of tax construction. As far as the  reality in the SEZ's is concerned, SEZ's make up the most unique  economic belt in the whole nation with an objectively existent  special economic foundation. As part of the superstructure, the  tax system must be compatible with such an economic foundation.  For this reason, the tax system of a SEZ must be independent of  the national tax system. A SEZ calls for a special tax system,  justified by the model of development for the economy of a SEZ,  by the demands of developing an export-oriented economy, and by  the intrinsic needs of the operating mechanism of the SEZ  economy. Turning to the internal requirements of tax  construction, the uniqueness of taxation determines that there  be an essentially unified national tax system. The need for a  uniform tax code and the centralization of taxing authority is  even greater when we are trying to develop a socialist market  economy. In tax construction in China, the central government  will assume decision-making responsibilities at the highest  level. So even if the SEZ's adopt a special tax policy different  from those of other places, consideration must be given to  striking a regional balance. It must be pointed out that today  the open policy has created in China a situation in which  technology and funds are diffused from one level to the next,  starting with the SEZ's through opened coastal cities, economic  and technical development zones, and economic open zones to the  vast hinterland. In tax construction, therefore, one must make  choices that are based on comprehensive considerations and in  line with the idea of joint development across the nation.  Accordingly, even though SEZ's take the lead in establishing a  new tax system suited to their own objectives, they must see  that their tax systems are consistent with the unified national  tax system so that the tax systems of different regions are  organically in harmony with one another within the framework of  national legislation and that the basic uniformity of the  national tax system is ensured. Furthermore, tax construction  must abide by specific laws. Since the core of tax legislation  in China is made by the central government, the SEZ's as class  one local lawmaking bodies must obtain authorization from the  highest lawmaking body of the land before they can make laws on  taxation. Thus the independence of SEZ tax systems can only be  relative; the fact that a SEZ has an independent tax system does  not put it beyond the restraint of the nation's lawmaking  system. In short, straightening out the relations between the  SEZ tax systems and the national tax system should be guided by  the notion of relative independence for the former. Overall, a  SEZ tax system should organically dovetail with the national  system. Take the exercise of tax collection jurisdiction, for  instance. A SEZ tax system should exercise jurisdiction over  place of origins, on the one hand, and jurisdiction over  residents, on the other, based on the need to preserve national  interests. Also, a SEZ tax system should be flexible in choosing  from among an array of taxes, taking special care to fulfill its  role as a tax reform laboratory. In the new era, the idea behind  economic lawmaking is to try out local lawmaking in some places  first before a law is adopted nationwide. In accordance with  that idea, the supreme lawmaking body of the central government  may authorize local lawmaking bodies in the various SEZ's to  make laws on taxation so that local lawmaking bodies in the  SEZ's can do a better job in tax lawmaking to provide a full  legal guarantee for deepening tax reform in SEZ's.    2. How to reconcile the tax systems of different SEZ's?    Judging from the tax systems in the various SEZ's, that of  the Shenzhen SEZ is more advanced while its counterparts  elsewhere are more backward. This raises the issue: How to  straighten out relations among the various tax systems? China's  five SEZ's are components of an organic whole. While differing  in the extent of development, a quantitative difference, they  share qualitative similarities. For example, their economies are  the same in nature and they all follow the same economic model.  This determines that their tax systems be basically the same.  Having said that, since the five special economic zones do have  different development focuses, they should formulate their own  appropriate tax systems based on their own characteristics and  the development of their lead industries. For this reason, the  SEZ's should be allowed to adopt disparate tax breaks freely to  reflect their individual priorities. The Xiamen SEZ, for  instance, may adopt some tax policies befitting a free port.  Surveying the situation on the tax front in the various SEZ's  objectively, we see that the Shenzhen SEZ has been most  successful in tax construction, so the others should generally  try to emulate it in tax reform. Specifically, the other SEZ's  should seek to duplicate the Shenzhen tax system by achieving  the following before proceeding to deepen tax reform by moving  in tandem with Shenzhen: 1) Unify income tax breaks for  enterprises and the standards for calculating taxes; 2) unify  the SEZ circulation tax system; and 3) unify the SEZ local tax  system.    B. Deepening tax reform in Shenzhen SEZ: Detailed Thinking    To deepen tax reform in the Shenzhen SEZ, we should zero in  on the major problems in the existing tax system, at the same  time considering how the tax system of Hong Kong would fit into  it after Hong Kong is returned to the motherland. It would be  advisable to deepen reform in the following areas:    1. Reform the circulation tax system in the SEZ in light of  the actual needs of economic development in the zone. The first  step in deepening the reform of the circulation tax system is to  unify the circulation tax system at the import end and totally  abolish the combined industrial and commercial tax. Secondly,  adjust the existing "product, value-added, and sales" taxes by  broadening the scope of the VAT to replace the product tax and  in part the sales tax (in the area of commodity circulation) as  well. With the VAT as the principal circulation tax, we will be  better able to avoid double taxation and utilize circulation  taxes as the regulator of exports and imports. At the same time,  we should cut the VAT rates and establish a uniform system of  three tax rates: standard rate, higher rate, and lower rate.  Once that is accomplished, we should impose a separate  consumption tax, the principal targets being certain consumer  goods and consumption behavior. As for the sales tax, it should  essentially be aimed at the tertiary sector (excluding commodity  circulation). As the tertiary sector grows, we should extend the  reach of the sales tax to include a number of up-and-coming  trades. Sales tax rates too should be adjusted as appropriate by  raising the rates for a number of highly profitable trades to  make the tax a better regulator. Finally, create the conditions  for replacing price inclusive taxes with extra-price taxes. When  that comes to pass, circulation taxes can play a supplementary  role in regulating production with consumption in a market  economy while avoiding the negative effects of price-inclusive  taxes.    2. Regularize the SEZ income tax system and adjust corporate  income tax breaks. In the Shenzhen SEZ the deepening of the  reform of the income tax system must begin by regularizing the  tax system in accordance with established international  practices. First of all, the SEZ must basically unify its  personal income tax system. In the wake of rapid economic  development in the SEZ, the gaps between Chinese citizens and  foreign personnel in income and consumption have been narrowing  by the day. Therefore, it should consider applying the personal  income tax law to both Chinese and foreigners by lowering the  exemptions enjoyed by the former appropriately. That would  create a basically uniform personal income tax system in which  the personal income tax and personal income regulating tax are  merged into one. Secondly, be it the personal income tax system  or corporate income tax system, a stringent body of tax laws  should be developed to reduce and close loopholes. Also, China  should formally promulgate the "Anti-Tax Avoidance Law" without  delay to provide a legal basis for the SEZ's campaign against  tax cheats.    Another aspect of income tax reform in the Shenzhen SEZ as  the zone makes the transition from infancy to its formative  stage is to replace its present practice of offering tax breaks  uniformly "across the board" with new industry-specific tax  breaks. The core of the new policy should be to adjust income  tax breaks for enterprises in the zone. By industry-specific tax  breaks, we mean using the industrial policies of the nation and  the zone to determine the tax breaks to be offered to investors.  In light of the demands of national economic development on the  industrial structure in the future, the Shenzhen SEZ should  concentrate on developing industries using new and high-tech to  upgrade its industrial structure. Accordingly, the corporate  income tax system should also shift to high-tech enterprises as  the principal beneficiaries of tax breaks. Other recipients of  corporate income tax breaks should include enterprises which  invest in the infrastructure, which make large-scale  investments, or which export their output to earn foreign  exchange. The result is a system of industry-specific corporate  income tax breaks dominated by tax breaks for high-tech  industries and supplemented by other tax breaks. It needs to be  emphasized here that industry-specific tax breaks are applicable  to all enterprises regardless of their economic nature. Of  course, other special tax breaks may be made available to  foreign-funded enterprises and foreign enterprises, but only if  they are justified by the characteristics of a particular  investment and meet the criterion of attracting foreign  investment. Also, the latter kind of tax breaks must remain a  supplementary part of the system of tax breaks overall. For  instance, corporate income tax breaks may be offered to a  foreign investor who reinvests his after-tax profits. Only by  doing so can the zone both achieve the goal of attracting  foreign capital and effectively use taxation to steer foreign  investment into particular industries.    3. Intensify local tax construction and deepen tax reform  experimentation in the zone. As far as the Shenzhen SEZ is  concerned, intensifying local tax construction mainly involves  levying a number of new taxes in light of the economic reality  in the zone and its objective requirements. A real-estate VAT,  for instance, may be slapped on the enormous appreciation in  land value realized from the sale and resale of land and other  real estate transactions. A capital gains tax may be levied on  the capital gain realized by an enterprise or individual by  selling capital goods (stocks, real estate). An inheritance or  gift tax may be imposed on the inheritances and gifts of  enterprises or individuals. In addition, a social insurance tax  may be imposed depending on the economic development needs of  the SEZ. That way not only can we make better use of taxation to  regulate the SEZ economy, but we also can experiment with  certain types of tax in the zone to provide experience for  nationwide tax reform. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the  current urban protection and construction tax is not generating  enough funds, it should be abolished and replaced by an  independent new urban protection and construction tax. Other  ways also exist to raise urban development funds, such as  adjusting as appropriate the scope and rates of the stamp tax,  property tax, vehicle and boat use tax, and land use tax. (It  would be advisable for the Shenzhen SEZ to abolish land use fees  in favor of a standardized land use tax.)</p>

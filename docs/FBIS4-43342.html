			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Justice Minister on Justice </F> Issues"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- The prospect of extending  plea bargaining to help dismantle the backlog of business and  political corruption cases, overcrowded prisons and the  management of organized crime figures who have turned state's  witnesses were the key issues discussed here by Justice Minister  Alfredo Biondi in his first address to the full assembly of the  Supreme Council of Magistrates (CSM).    On state's witnesses, the new minister stressed the need to  strengthen the area of the law covering "the objective  verification of their accusations aimed at guaranteeing (their)  total reliability and, at the same time, avoiding tampering and  discrediting."    For this purpose, Biondi reported to the self-ruling body of  the nation's judiciary that in cooperation with the Interior  Ministry, a panel had been formed for work on "judiciary  initiatives necessary so that state's witnesses know the  consequences they are facing" if their testimony sidetracks  investigations or is slanderous.    In this connection, the minister said he intends to return  to  the Parliament a bill submitted to the Senate during the  legislature just past for enhancing the defense of defendants  facing criminal charges. This package includes new measures on  the application of preventive custody and the use of the  advisory warrant, sent out to formally notify the recipient that  he or she is under investigation.    The minister said he would like to avoid having the advisory  warrant, "an essential judiciary safeguard instrument, become a  source of serious prejudice against the person investigated."    On the sensitive issue of attacking the mountain of pending  corruption trials, without applying coats of whitewash, Biondi  said, "The solution studied by my ministry is not a political  solution, it is judiciary. This is a matter merely of expanding  the concept of plea bargaining already provided for in our laws  and already proposed by my predecessor, Giovanni Conso, in the  preceding legislature."    He explained that the measures under examination would be  applied strictly at the time of trial and that plea bargaining  would be available to all defendants, not only the politicians  facing trial. "So, there would be no unequal treatment and no  requests of constitutional illegitimacy."    He said he had addressed himself to this issue in his  statement to the CSM "to calm those who have shown worry about  possible disparity of treatment of people."    Moving on to what he said was of special concern to him, the  new minister cited "excessive overcrowding in the prisons" in  the nation with a prison population of some 56,000 in facilities  designed to accommodate 30,000 prisoners.    "The steep increase in the number of detainees is a complex  phenomenon," he said and confirmed that it would be difficult to  imagine a "spontaneous reversal of the trend" in the near  future. "It is necessary, therefore, to act to curb this process  and to make the structures of the penitentiaries administration  adequate," he declared.    He also disclosed the government is weighing such steps as  "extending the application of measures on the expulsion of  foreign nationals" and replacing "detention in prison with  alternative punishment for minor crimes" and for short terms  remaining of sentences which have been almost completely served.    Biondi told the magistrates he intends to "strongly raise"  in  the cabinet the matter of a bigger budget for justice and will  devote careful attention to the administration of civil justice.  In this connection, he recalled that the colossal backlog of  civil cases wending their slow ways through the courts has led  to serious problems for Italy before the European Commission and  the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.    Before the introduction of two changes pending, adding a new  sector made up of justice of the peace and a revised civil law  code, the minister said he intends to confer on the real  prospects for the application of these reforms. For this  purpose, he reported he will meet tomorrow with the National  Association of Magistrates and the National Forensic Council.    He also promised to carefully assess recommendations  recently  drafted by the CSM on the elimination of a number of "useless"  offices within the nation's judiciary.</p>

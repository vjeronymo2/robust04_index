			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: NYSE firms post record results WALL Street is enjoying unprecedented prosperity, according to figures released yesterday. They reveal that New York Stock Exchange member-firms earned record after-tax profits of Dollars 1.36bn in the first quarter of this year. The profits were 42 per cent higher than in last year's strong first quarter, when the NYSE's 316 member-firms that do business with the public earned Dollars 957m. The firms' record profits and revenues (which reached Dollars 16.5bn in the quarter) were achieved on the back of rising stock prices, large new issue volume and low interest rates, which continued to lure investors into equities from low-yielding financial assets such as certificates of deposit and money market accounts. The NYSE firms also benefited from their efforts to control costs. Total expenses rose just 0.1 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 14.4bn. The earnings of the NYSE's specialists (the market intermediaries who bring buyers and sellers together) fell during the quarter, however. This was an indication that activity on the exchange floor was lower than the first three months of last year, when volume was temporarily boosted by heavy trading during and after the Gulf war.</p>

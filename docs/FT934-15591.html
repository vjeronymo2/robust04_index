			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Eonomics Notebook: Two examples of pomp and circumstance Two countries, two central banks, and each with new men at the top. Ten days ago, Mr Hans Tietmeyer was installed as Bundesbank president in the nearest thing to a coronation that the Federal Republic has to offer. The handover of power at the Bundesbank was marked by a ceremony attended by 800 guests from European central banks and German government, politics and business. Among the seven speeches (punctuated by passages from a Schumann piano quintet and Beethoven's trio for clarinet, cello and piano) was one by Chancellor Helmut Kohl declaring his support for Bundesbank independence. Three months earlier, on July 1, Mr Eddie George took over as the new governor of the Bank of England and Mr Rupert Pennant Rea, the former editor of the Economist, as his deputy. Mr George travelled into Threadneedle Street from his Dulwich home as on any normal working day. Mr Pennant-Rea moved into a new office. Otherwise, there was no change in the Bank's long-established routine. At first sight, the Bank of England's approach to the change in its top management was reassuringly low key. It seemed to express the very British idea of 'business as usual'. But the pomp surrounding the elevation of Mr Tietmeyer to the presidency of the Bundesbank was more than Teutonic self indulgence. The gathering in Frankfurt's elegant Palmengarten marked out Mr Tietmeyer as one of Europe's most powerful men. It also was an act of homage by Germany's political class to the Bundesbank as an institution, and a reminder that the person who happened to be at its top was merely a steward. In a world of rapid economic, social and political change, there is a growing interest among policymakers in building and nurturing institutions to support economic policy goals. The absence of strong economic policymaking institutions is keenly felt in Russia. The existence of a central bank that saw control of inflation and monetary conditions as its vocation would have made a huge difference to the process of transformation from a command to a market economy. Israeli policymakers are conscious that Gaza and the region around Jericho will need more than money if they are to have effective self government. In a recent conversation, Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Central Bank of Israel, underlined the vital need for the Palestinians to set up effective institutions for controlling public spending and managing taxation in the areas that they will govern. Otherwise, the territories could become dependent on outside aid. In Britain, institutions such as the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange and the Treasury have seen their influence slip over the past decade in the face of the growing power of financial markets. Perhaps because the British establishment has generally made a mess of running the economy over the past 40 years, the pendulum has yet to swing back in favour of building these institutions up again. But there is a case for having a thorough look at the current state and objectives of the Bank of England. The Bank's present position is the result of a typically messy British compromise. It has, since Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, been given more explicit responsibility for the control of inflation. Although both Messrs George and Pennant-Rea would like more autonomy, it is nowhere near having the independence that would make it responsible for price stability. When Mr George was named as governor in January he was given a mandate 'to support the government in its determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'. Shortly before, the government had set as a target a 1 to 4 per cent range for the underlying rate of inflation (retail price inflation minus mortgage interest payments) during the life of this parliament. Since July's change at the top, the Bank seems determined to create as much freedom of manoeuvre as it can. It seems to have won a battle to prevent the Treasury interfering with the writing of its quarterly inflation report. This document, introduced in February, is intended to provide an independent signal if inflation is threatening to burst through its target ceiling. Last week, Mr Pennant-Rea unilaterally redefined the government's inflation target to 1 to 2.5 per cent by 1996 or 1997 in place of the previous vague statement by Mr Norman Lamont when chancellor that 'by the end of the Parliament we need to be in the lower part of the (1-4 per cent) range'. The present chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, seems happy to let the Bank flex its muscles. In an interview with Crossbow, the magazine of the Tory Bow Group last week, he said the Treasury would no longer have a hand in the Bank's inflation report. He also promised not to tamper with monetary policy for political ends. 'It is important that monetary policy is taken objectively, openly and is certainly not buffeted about by short-term political considerations to assist the party in power,' he said. But although the chancellor said he had a 'fairly open mind' on the subject of Bank independence, there was nothing to suggest that he wanted to give up ultimate responsibility for the Bank and monetary policy. Mr Clarke believes strongly in the Westminster parliamentary system. 'I think people would get fed up with me telling parliament that the most important features of economic policy were practically beyond my control,' he told Crossbow. But Mr Clarke's word will not be the last on the issue. The House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee has been holding hearings on the Bank's future. Its report, expected either late this year or early in 1994, could boost pressure for greater Bank independence. The Bank itself will be celebrating its tercentenary next summer and has commissioned an opera for the occasion. It is unlikely to symbolise the power of the institution in the way that this month's ceremony in Frankfurt buttressed the Bundesbank.</p>

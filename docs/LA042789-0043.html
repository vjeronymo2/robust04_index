			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE PROBES DONATIONS TO ASSEMBLYMAN  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office has launched an inquiry into Assemblyman  Pete Chacon's receipt last year of $7,500 from the California Check Cashers  Assn., which opposed legislation he was carrying to regulate the industry's  charges, a top state Department of Justice official confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> Chacon reported receiving $4,000 from the trade group on April 14, 1988, the  same day the bill was shelved, with his acquiescence, by the Assembly Finance  and Insurance Committee. Chacon has said the timing was a coincidence. He  received another $3,500 from the group in July, 1988.  </P> <P> Nelson P. Kempsky, chief deputy attorney general, said the office has been  reviewing the case for about three weeks in what he called a "preliminary  inquiry," which could lead to a full-blown investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To 'See What We Have'  </P> <P> "We are taking a look at this to see if anything improper occurred," Kempsky  said. "We are going to look at the reports filed with the Fair Political  Practices Commission and other reporting agencies, interview the people who  gave the money and the assemblyman, and see what we have."  </P> <P> The probe could "bloom into a broader and deeper investigation" or it could be  dropped, he said.  </P> <P> Kempsky said the attorney general's findings will be forwarded to the district  attorneys in San Diego and Sacramento counties, who will decide whether  prosecution is warranted.  </P> <P> Chacon, a Democrat from San Diego, reported receiving the money on his annual  statement of economic interests filed March 1 with the FPPC. He has said he  took the money as compensation for touring several check-cashing stores in Los  Angeles and then meeting with the check cashers group's Board of Directors.  Chacon could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Tom Nix Jr., president of the check cashers' group, said the association paid  Chacon "to show our thanks" for the assemblyman spending time learning about  the industry. He said the bill, as it was introduced by Chacon, could have put  many of the association's 300 members out of business.  </P> <P> There is no law prohibiting state lawmakers from receiving money from a trade  group supporting or opposing their legislation, Kempsky said. But the parties  could be prosecuted if they agreed to exchange the money for some sort of  legislative action, he added.  </P> <P> "Whether there was wrongdoing in this case depends on the intent and the  understanding of the parties," Kempsky said. "If the money was given with the  intent to influence a legislative outcome or vote, or an action such as  dropping a bill, there would be evidence of a crime. If it was accepted for  that purpose, that would be improper."  </P> <P> As it was introduced Feb. 18, 1988, Chacon's bill would have limited the fees  the check cashers could charge to 1% on government checks, payroll checks,  traveler's checks, money orders or cashier's checks. Fees for cashing other  checks would have been limited to 1.5%,  </P> <P> </P> <P> Amended the Bill  </P> <P> Chacon amended the bill April 11, three days before it was scheduled for a  hearing in the Finance and Insurance Committee. The amendments raised the  allowable fees to 1.75% and 3%, depending on the kind of check being cashed.  </P> <P> The committee voted 19 to 0 to send the bill to an "interim hearing" -- a  special hearing held between legislative sessions where members hear about a  particular issue in detail. But no further hearing on the issue was held,  according to Will Brown, a former consultant for the committee.  </P> <P> Brown said he attempted to schedule the hearings several times but Chacon's  office never responded to his phone calls regarding the bill.  </P></p>

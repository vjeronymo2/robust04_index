			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REFORMERS IN RUNNING FOR SOVIET POSTS;  </P> <P> LITHUANIA THREATENS BOYCOTT, CHARGES RIGGING OF NOMINEES  </P> <P> Maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and several prominent reformers in the new congress  were nominated today for a smaller, full-time legislature, but some charged  that senior officials rigged the nominee list to stay in power.  </P> <P> Lithuania threatened to boycott the elections to the new legislature if  delegates from other republics are allowed to vote on the Lithuanian slate.  </P> <P> The Lithuanians and other Baltic reformers want to protect their small reform  slates from being lost in an all-congress vote. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  called the boycott threat "a crisis situation."  </P> <P> The moves came during the second day of debate in the 2,250-member Congress of  People's Deputies, the first competitively elected national assembly and the  latest step in the Soviet experiment with democratic reform.  </P> <P> Only one member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo appeared on a  congressional list of nominees for the smaller law-making body, the Supreme  Soviet, assuring an overhaul of its traditional makeup.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bickering Persists  </P> <P> Procedural bickering today mirrored the disputes that slowed the first day of  activity in the congress, which was elected this spring in the first nationwide  multicandidate balloting in 70 years.  </P> <P> A list of 573 members of congress selected by their home regions was prepared  for 542 seats in the Supreme Soviet, giving deputies few choices but setting up  tough races for lawmakers from Moscow, home to many of the reformers.  </P> <P> "The party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the Supreme Soviet  according to the old system," complained deputy Vladimir Shevlyuga of Rostov.  </P> <P> Vladimir Zolotukhin of Tashkent said top party and government officials in  Uzbekistan had themselves nominated without consulting other deputies from the  republic.  </P> <P> Reformers lost an attempt to force top party officials to choose between their  party jobs and serving in the Supreme Soviet, as a way of easing the grip of  the party bureaucracy on the country's legislature.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned editorial] </F>   [Text] Generals Lagos Lidimo and Mateus Ngonhamo were this  week sworn in as commanders of the FADM [Mozambique Defense  Armed Forces]. It is, therefore, time to demand that both of  them renounce all commitments of a partisan nature.    That is prompted by the following:    1. The public remarks Ngonhamo made to promote Renamo's  [Mozambique National Resistance] standpoint are still very fresh  in one's mind. (Hopefully, these were his last remarks.)    2. Although there are no facts known to the public, many  observers of our peace process feel that they are right to fear  that Renamo has not confined all its men and surrendered all  weapons.    3. In 1992, MEDIAFAX reported the transfer of thousands of  FAM [Mozambique Armed Forces] men to the police. At the time,  official comments on the issue fell short of answering the  questions that were raised. Information given to us by reliable  sources, but which require official confirmation or denial, says  those men, who were issued with police uniforms, are now in  Magoanine, believed to be under the command of Lagos Lidimo.    The government owes a clear and final explanation on the  matter.    Does Lagos Lidimo or does he not anything to do with the  Magoanine force?    What is the purpose of that force? Is it to replace the PRM  [Mozambique Republic Police]?    If in fact it is a police force, does Compol [National  Commission for Police Affairs] have any control over it?    The country's stability depends on the nonexistence of any  hidden army, either in Magoanine or in the bush.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe's Dollars 225m platinum deal signed The largest foreign investment in Zimbabwe for a quarter of a century was given the go-ahead yesterday when the government signed a mining agreement with BHP Minerals and Delta Gold of Australia to develop the Hartley platinum project. The total cost of the project, estimated to contain the largest undeveloped resources of platinum group metals outside South Africa, will be USDollars 225m. The mine, in which BHP will have a 67 per cent stake and Delta Gold 33 per cent, will employ 2,700 people, including 100 expatriates. Underground development starts next month with the first ore being mined late in 1995. This will be stockpiled until processing facilities are completed late in 1996. At full production in 1997 the mine will process 2.16m tonnes of ore annually, to produce 150,000 troy ounces of platinum 110,000 ounces of palladium, 23,000 ounces of gold and 11,500 ounces of rhodium. Hartley will also produce about 3,200 tonnes of nickel and 2,300 tonnes of copper. It has ore reserves sufficient for a 20-year mine life with the potential to double production at a later date. The mine agreement signed yesterday signals a new regime for major investment projects worth more than Dollars 100m. Zimbabwe's Minister of Mines, Mr Edison Zvobgo, said the agreement guaranteed investors security of tenure and stability of fiscal terms. Although little was said about the controversial issue of marketing, it seems the Zimbabweans have agreed to allow BHP to market the platinum-group metals directly rather than going though the state-owned Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe. Gold will be sold by the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe, but the nickel and copper will be handled by the MMCZ. This concession is an important one and could attract other major investors to Zimbabwe. On-site facilities at Hartley will include the mill, a concentrator, smelter and base metals refinery. The refinery will produce nickel and copper cathodes while platinum-group metals will be toll-refined in Europe. The promoters say the mine will be a low-cost producer, with unit costs of about Dollars 225 an ounce, putting it below South African producers such as Rusplats and Northam and on a par with Lonrho, but substantially more expensive than Pprust. Speaking at yesterday's official signing ceremony with the government, Mr Peter Vanderspuy of Delta Gold predicted that by the turn of the century a number of platinum projects producing 600,000 ounces annually would have been established on the Hartley complex and Zimbabwe would become the world's second largest platinum producer, after South Africa, accounting for some 12 per cent of global output. Mr Vanderspuy predicted also that platinum would earn double the foreign exchange provided now by the tobacco industry and could generate investment in downstream activities such as the manufacture of exhaust catalysts for the motor industry.</p>

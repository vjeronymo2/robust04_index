			<p>BFN     [Text] For Hmong people living in areas where a town  centre is two days' walk away, opium is certainly a much more  attractive and practical commodity than peanuts.    The Lai Chau provincial cadres have tried, in vain, to  persuade them to grow peanuts instead of poppies.    The Vietnamese authorities find themselves increasingly  helpless to deal with opium plantations and severe drug  addiction among ethnic minorities in mountainous regions  especially Lai Chau and Son La.    At the same time, increasing drug abuse in major lowland  cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Hai Phong have pushed  up demand for raw materials from the mountainous areas.    Vietnam has just encountered scenes familiar in northern  Thailand and is trying to deal with a whole set of issues  through the similar approach of crop substitution programmes and  rehabilitating drug addicts while boosting law enforcement.    But the absence of laws relating to illicit drugs, combined  with corruption among law enforcers, an erratic judicial system  and a generally crumbling law enforcement situation, raise the  question of how effectively the government will handle this  issue for which a national programme, as well as an  anti-narcotics bureau, have only been recently set up.    "We have a surplus of decrees and resolutions but what's  been  accomplished so far shows a lack of resolve. Police in Cao Bang  province found 2.8 kilogrammes of opium but the trafficker was  released after posting a bail of US$20. This is not to talk  about some depraved policemen receiving bribes from other drug  traffickers," said a critical article on this issue carried by  Lao Dong (Labour) which is published by the Confederation of  Trade Union.    It was not until September 1990 that the Lai Chau provincial  authority took its own initiative to ban opium growing, smoking,  trade and storage.    "We had to introduce the ban because our education campaign  had failed," said Mai Thi Ly, deputy governor of Lai Chau  province. She is of ethnic Hmong origin and these people form  the largest group of opium growers in the region.    Last year, the Vietnamese government passed another  resolution on illicit drugs which prescribed penalties for drug  abuse and trafficking.    "That had very little impact," on the thriving situation in  Lai Chau, said Mrs Ly in an interview.    "We have resorted to different methods of persuasion, urging  people not to grow opium. The villagers who turn to cash crops  said it was difficult for them to sell their products. The  budget we received from Hanoi is strictly for seeds, but there's  no money for road access," she said.    Opium addiction among ethnic minorities in remote provinces,  especially in the north of Vietnam, is such that "in some  places, the whole villages smoke opium, the whole families smoke  opium including some children under 15," according to Deputy  Minister Phan Thanh Xuan of the National Committee for Ethnic  Minorities and Mountainous Areas.    The Vietnamese government said there were 150,000 drug  addicts nationwide. Of the 12,000 drug addicts officially  discovered in Lai Chau province, 1,600 of them were treated.    "Drug abuse is much more difficult to do away with than  poppy  fields. Of those rehabilitated, we found that most of them  later return to the habit," said Mrs Ly.    In Lai Chau, the local authorities are grappling with the  budgetary and logistical questions of relocating the provincial  capital from Lai Chau to Dien Bien Phu. On the fringe of the  town's only main road construction of the province's only drug  addicts rehabilitation centre is under way.    The centre, located on what used to be the site of a herbal  medicine clinic, began service in January this year and, so far,  it has come across one intravenous drug user, according to  Nguyen Duc Thien, director of the centre.    The opium area in Lai Chau province was more than 1,000  hectares before 1990. Officials put the current estimate at 300  hectares. Poppy field annihilation squads would roam the region  during harvest time in September to wipe them out.    In the past, opium production and movement had been internal  in that it satisfied small-scale needs within the province. But  officials were alarmed to have intercepted for the first time  last November 190 kilogrammes of opium from Laos en route to  destinations outside the province. Early this year, another 230  kilos from across the border was intercepted in Lai Chau.    "That stuff was on transit in Lai Chau, destined for Hanoi  and Hai Phong. Until last November's case, we never found  locals who moved more than five kilos of opium. In the 230 kilo  case, the traffickers came from Hai Phong. They started  operating some rackets here," said Deputy Governor Dy.    This is what causes the gravest concern for her.    "Local people here don't go to Hanoi to sell, but the people  from outside, for instance, Hanoi come here to buy."    Vietnam is pondering accession to an international treaty on  illicit drugs. Tracking down international drug cartels has  been possible so far with cooperation from Interpol. The  country has recently participated in two ASEAN programmes which  will be implemented in Vietnam: Antinarcotics information; and  the parents and children against drug abuse campaign.    Vietnam, which has no diplomatic relations with the US,  hoped  that one day it could hook up with the vast pool of resources  and intelligence network of the US Drug Enforcement  Administration, said Deputy Minister Xuan.    "We believe that cooperation with the US DEA would help  reduce narcotics supply to their country," he said.</p>

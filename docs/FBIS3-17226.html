The talks were broken in December, 1993 when SOCAR  rejected the draft of the agreement prepared by Manafov's group  of independent experts.    The same month the Consortium rejected the variant of the  draft of SOCAR due to unfavourable conditions. The Western  companies were surprised that Azerbaijan rejected Manafov's  draft since he is official representative of Azeri government.  On February 4 President Aliyev ordered SOCAR to work out a new  variant.    Last week President of Russian Oil Company Lukoil, Vahid  Alekperov, signed the agreement in Baku. Under the agreement  his Company will get the share of 10 per cent. Lukoil will get  one third of Azeri oil which amounts to 80 per cent of the whole  extracted oil. As is known, total reserves of oil in Chirag and  Azeri fields amount to 450 million tons.    According to experts, since world prices for oil decreased,  the consortium will try to achieve advantageous conditions in  the contract. Western companies intend to change the world  price for oil which presently totals $18 for 1 barrel. In the  nearest future Azerbaijan will have to pay a great volume of oil  for Western investments. It means that the share of the  Consortium will change from 20 to 23 per cent and the share of  Azerbaijan in the contract will decrease.</p>

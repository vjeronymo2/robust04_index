			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W promises year of action CABLE AND Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, has been in the shade lately. While BT, its UK rival, launched glamorous bids for global mastery in alliance with the MCI, the second largest US carrier, C&amp;W's high points have been a domestic deal with Bell Canada Enterprises and the possibility of a joint venture to build 1m phone lines in the Philippines. The BCE deal - under which BCE took a 20 per cent stake in Mercury and C&amp;W a 12 per cent in BCE's UK-based cable TV company - gives C&amp;W scope to diversify beyond straight telecommunications, but hardly amounts to a grand strategy. However, announcing the annual results yesterday, Lord Young, C&amp;W's chairman, promised plenty of action for the year ahead. C&amp;W is nowhere near BT's cash flow league. But with operating profits of Pounds 771m on turnover of Pounds 3.8bn in the year to March 31, gearing down to 13.2 per cent (25.9 per cent) and analysts projecting pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 1bn in the current year, the company can raise its sights. In the immediate future, all eyes are on the imminent launch in the UK of Mercury One-2-One, the UK PCN mobile service of which C&amp;W is joint owner with US West. So far C&amp;W has spent about Pounds 150m on One-2-One. The competition, however, is not idle. Last week Vodafone, the largest cellular operator, cut its London tariff by 25 per cent, and announced the launch in October of a micro-cellular service to compete with PCN in the south-east. Much depends on the price sensitivity of the mobile market, and on the speed with which One-2-One rolls out its network beyond the M25. Growth in the UK market also hinges on the success of 'easy access' - dialling 132 from any phone to access the Mercury network - in attracting new custom from BT. Abroad, C&amp;W's plans appear less focused. It has 'hubs' in the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific, plus operations in the US, central and eastern Europe and a business networks division providing internationally-managed data services. Lord Young said he talked 'almost every day' to potential allies like AT&amp;T and Sprint, but that a link-up was 'possible not probable.' Instead, he emphasised the avenues opening up in China. 'Sooner or later the Chinese will have to change their policy of ruling out foreign equity stakes to achieve their ambitious growth plans,' he said.</p>

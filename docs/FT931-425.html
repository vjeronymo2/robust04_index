			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Pearson in talks with Thorn EMI over Thames TV PEARSON, the media, banking and industrial group, has had exploratory talks with Thorn EMI to buy Thames Television, the independent production company that lost its ITV franchise last year. Pearson, which is interested in expanding its television interests, started talking to Thorn late last year about the possibility of taking a stake in the proposed Channel 5. Executives noticed at the time that Pearson seemed to be as much interested in Thames as in Channel 5. In the end Pearson did little more than express an interest in Channel 5 mainly because the Independent Television Commission decided that under the 1990 Broadcasting Act the company could only have a 5 per cent stake. As owner of the Financial Times, Pearson is limited to a 20 per cent stake in commercial broadcasters in the UK. The company already owns 20 per cent of Yorkshire Television. Thames, which lost its ITV franchise to Carlton last year, would present few regulatory problems. The former ITV company has become one of the UK's largest independent producers. Asked about the talks, Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson chief operating officer, said yesterday: 'No comment.' But it is clear that Mr Barlow is keen to expand Pearson's television interests and that talks have taken place between the two companies at a high level. At yesterday's press conference to announce Pearson's results for the year to December, Lord Blakenham, chairman, said the company's main area of future investment would be in the media, including television. The company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 150.8m for 1992, a fall of 16 per cent but considerably more than the City expected. There was also a 3 per cent rise in the total dividend to 12p. Pearson shares rose 27p to 404p. Thorn tried unsuccessfully to sell its stake in Thames, which is expected to have a turnover of more than Pounds 100m this year, before the latest franchise round. If Pearson bought Thames, apart from the rights to programmes such as The Bill, it would acquire assets such as Reeves, a US production company, and stakes in UK Gold, the library channel, and in the Astra satellite system which broadcasts the BSkyB channels. Pearson has 17.5 per cent of BSkyB. Results, Page 28</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by journalist A.K. Bhattacharya] </F>   [Text] Those who criticize the central government for  agreeing to the Dunkel proposals at the Uruguay round of  negotiations should now be reassured by the announcement made by  the agriculture minister, Dr. Balram Jakhar. He has said that  the government would introduce specific legislation to safeguard  the interests of domestic farmers. He also said at the Fifth  World Sugar Farmers Conference in New Delhi yesterday that India  would not allow patenting of seeds. This means that India would  evolve its own system of preserving plant varieties. The fact  however is that the Dunkel draft has not prescribed any  patenting regime for seeds. It is only a figment of imagination  of some people that the Dunkel draft will impose restrictions on  the use of seeds by Indian farmers. It is being argued by some  leaders belonging to the opposition political parties that  farmers now have to purchase fresh seeds every time they want to  sow them. In other words, they cannot use seeds generated from  existing crops. These leaders have aroused the passions of  Indian farmers so strongly that recently a rally of agitating  farmers ransacked the office of a U.S. multinational seeds  company.    The agriculture minister has now put an end to such a  debate.  By ruling out patenting of seeds he has dispelled the root  cause of the farmers' apprehension. And since India would now  have to evolve its own system of preserving plant varieties,  there should be no question of ignoring the interests of Indian  farmers. While evolving the new system, Indian farmers and  other representative bodies should be consulted. This will be  necessary to ensure that all apprehensions of the farmers and  the opposition leaders on the issue are addressed adequately.    This brings one to the time of applicability of the Dunkel  draft. First, it will take at least one more year for the draft  to be ratified by parliaments of all member countries of GATT  before it becomes operational. Secondly, it is left entirely to  national governments like India to take its own time in  formulating the new system of protecting plant varieties. This  will have to be in broad conformity with the international  protocol on this issue. But the key issue which cannot be lost  sight of is that the nitty-gritty of such a system will be  finalized at home and not on foreign soil as has been alleged by  some critics of the Dunkel draft. More importantly, the Indian  Government and Indian farmers will have a lot of time at their  disposal to discuss and debate the new legislation to protect  them as well as the new plant varieties.</p>

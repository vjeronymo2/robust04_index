			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Liberty beckons for the Bank of France: Independent central bank becomes a pre-election rallying cry for defenders of the franc THE French political consensus for an independent central bank hardened yesterday, when Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said such a move would be desirable soon after the end-of-March parliamentary elections. This confirms that the government sees eye-to-eye with the opposition, which last month signalled that it would present plans to grant independence to the Bank of France after the election, which is likely to be won by an alliance of the opposition Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UDF. 'On this point, the opposition is on the same line as us,' Mr Sapin said on radio. 'I would say that the French, by voting for the Maastricht treaty last September, voted for the modification of the Bank of France's statutes,' he said. This would not, however take place before the elections. It is unclear exactly how much autonomy the French central bank would be allowed, given that former treasury officials continue to dominate the top financial jobs both in the private and public sector. Yet any reduction in political influence over the French central bank would add credibility to the policy of defending the link between the franc and the D-Mark, supported by the leaders of the Socialist and right-wing establishment alike. This could also help to bring about closer co-operation between the Bank of France and the Bundesbank, which is fiercely independent of any government, whether German or French. Less political influence on the central bank could reduce the impact on foreign exchange markets of a vocal minority of mainly opposition politicians calling for the franc to be floated. Rebel Gaullists such as Mr Philippe Seguin argue that this would allow a fall in interest rates, stimulate the sluggish economy and so help reduce the number of unemployed - currently nearly 3m - and the main political problem for the present and future governments. Mr Edmond Alphandery, a centrist member of parliament tipped as a possible finance minister in the new government, said yesterday that those who wanted to float the franc were 'against the construction of Europe' and warned that a drop in interest rates was neither necessary nor sufficient to bring an economic recovery. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the industry and trade minister, added: 'Let us ensure real independence for the Banque de France in March.' The battle against the franc would 'end in ruin' for speculators, he said.</p>

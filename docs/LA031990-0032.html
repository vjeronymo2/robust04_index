			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> PREGNANCY BIAS COMPLAINTS ALLOWED  </P> <P> Pregnant women who are barred from jobs or housing because they are carrying a  child can now file discrimination complaints with the state under a bill signed  into law by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The measure authorizes the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing to  accept complaints of discrimination against pregnant women. Pregnant women in  California file about 600 complaints of alleged discrimination each year, said  Lisa Ramer, an aide to state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris, the Oakland Democrat who  carried the bill through the Legislature. The new law does not take effect  until Jan. 1, 1991, but the fair employment and housing department agreed last  December to implement the measure and hear complaints from pregnant woman.  </P></p>

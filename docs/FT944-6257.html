			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Employers criticise 'marginal' measures - Employment While employers' bodies welcomed some of the chancellor's Pounds 375m package of measures aimed at reducing the number of long-term unemployed, they were critical that they did not go far enough towards addressing wholesale unemployment. Apart from the changes in National Insurance contributions, the measures directed at employers are broadly piecemeal - aimed at attacking the problem on a variety of fronts. The 0.6 per cent cut in National Insurance contributions for all employees earning less than Pounds 205 a week from April 1995 will cost Pounds 250m. At present, these contributions are in three tiers, between 3.6 and 7.6 per cent up to Pounds 199.99. The new tiers will be respectively 3, 5 and 7 per cent. Employer organisations said this was of minimal importance. 'It is only going to have a marginal effect on employers. All it does is make it a little more attractive to employ someone at a lower level,' said Mr Geoff Armstrong, director-general of the Institute of Personnel and Development. Mr Jim Yuill, director of social security services at Ernst &amp; Young, said he did not expect the measure to prove a useful incentive for employers. The vast majority of employers pay the 10.2 per cent National Insurance rate, he said. 'I don't think it makes a lot of difference because there is no evidence at all that reducing National Insurance rates encourages employers to take on more staff.' He said, however, that a second initiative to grant National Insurance contributions holidays of up to one year for employers of people who have been out of work for more than two years was a 'clear saving for employers'. The contributions holidays, starting in April 1996, will mean that employers who take on someone who has been out of work for more than two years will be able to get a full NI rebate for that person for up to one year. On average, employers will save more than Pounds 300 for every person they take on. This will cost Pounds 45m a year. The employer measures also include expansion of work trial schemes - three-week work trials for new recruits who have been out of work for more than six months. The work trials will produce 150,000 places over the next three years at a total cost of Pounds 30m. Work trials enable employers to assess the suitability of long-term unemployed job seekers for a vacancy before committing themselves to employing them. The idea is that people who have been out of work for more than six months can have the chance to prove themselves in a real job while their benefits continue to be paid over the three-week trial period. Some 20,000 work trail opportunities are available in 1994-95, rising to 40,000 next year, 50,000 in 1996-97 and 60,000 in 1997-98. The cost of the provisions in each of the three years will be Pounds 8m, Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m. Another initiative aimed at employers is the extension and development of workstart schemes, previously piloted in Devon and Cornwall, east Kent, south London and Tyneside. The pilots which started in June 1993 have been modest so far, helping 1,474 people find work, but new workstart pilots will provide 5,000 opportunities next year. These schemes give employers financial incentives to take on long-term unemployed people. The Department of Employment subsidies are Pounds 50 a week per employee for the first six months and Pounds 30 a week for the second six months. The pilots have varied, sometimes taking those unemployed for more than two years and sometimes taking those who have been jobless for more than four. The new pilots are expected to continue the variable approach on subsidy levels, method of payment, duration of subsidy and eligibility. Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the CBI, said: 'The measures have placed a lot of emphasis on the 500,000 people who have been unemployed for more than two years. We wanted more done, however, for the 1m people who have been out of work for between six months and two years.' The CBI welcomed the National Insurance measures. But Mr Howard Davies, director-general, said there was also a need to focus on skills training for the long-term unemployed. 'We hope to see more emphasis on that in the Department of Employment's programmes in future,' he said. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director of the Institute of Directors, said he was 'disappointed' at the maze of measures to help people in lower-paid employment. He said: 'The chancellor should have cut a swathe through the regulations and reduced employment costs.' The IoD, he said, would have preferred an across-the-board reduction in employers' national insurance contributions. 'Subsidies to reduce unemployment are no substitute for the creation of jobs,' he said.</p>

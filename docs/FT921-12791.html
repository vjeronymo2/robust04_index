			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Banker to succeed departing SIB chief SIR DAVID WALKER, tipped as a possible candidate to become the next governor of the Bank of England, yesterday announced a surprise decision to step down as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief investment regulator. He will leave at the end of May, when his current four-year term ends. Explaining his departure, Sir David, 52, who was asked to take on the post in 1988 after other candidates turned the position down, said: 'I don't want to retire a regulator.' He said he was looking for a new job in the private sector, but did not yet have another position to go to. His job is to be taken by Mr Andrew Large, a 49-year-old banker. A former chairman of The Securities Association, one of the City's self-regulatory organisations, Mr Large was the first Briton to be appointed to the main board of a Swiss bank when with Swiss Bank Corporation in the mid-1980s. Sir David was sent into the SIB at a time of widespread City concern about the bureaucratic and costly system of regulation that had been set up by his predecessor, Sir Kenneth Berrill. A former executive director at the Bank of England, where he still sits as a non-executive director, Sir David's forceful style and impatient manner have at times antagonised the self-regulatory organisations which come under the SIB's control. They have also enabled him to push through extensive changes to the regulatory system set up under the 1986 Financial Services Act. Sir David said he had warned of his intention to leave the SIB last September, but had offered to stay for a further short period beyond the end of his existing term if needed. The offer was not taken up by Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, current governor of the Bank, who jointly appoint the SIB chairman. The announcement of Sir David's departure comes as the SIB is close to finalising its policy on the selling of retail investment products such as life assurance and unit trusts - one of the most difficult and important aspects of its work. Policy decisions are expected to be taken before Sir David departs on several important aspects, including how commissions are paid on life assurance policies. But other aspects of retail regulation, such as the future of Fimbra, the financially troubled watchdog for independent financial advisers, will be left to Mr Large.

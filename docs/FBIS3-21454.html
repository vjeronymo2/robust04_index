			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 2 (PTI)--The government today  announced significant changes to the Companies Act ensuring  greater freedom to companies in managerial appointments and  remuneration.    Under the changes to schedule XIII of the Act, which comes  into effect from February 1, a company with adequate net profits  will now have full freedom to work out a suitable remuneration  package for its managerial personnel within the limit of 5 per  cent of its net profits if it has one, and 10 per cent of its  net profits, if it has more than one managerial person,  according to an official announcement here.    In the event of absence or inadequacy of net profits in any  financial year (where managerial remuneration exceeds 5 per cent  or 10 per cent of net profits), managerial remuneration will  have to be limited to amounts (varying from Rs 40,000 [rupees] a  month to Rs 87,000 depending on the effective capital of the  company) specified in section II of part II of the schedule.    The fresh changes will make it easier for companies to  attract the best available managerial talents on better terms  and conditions.    In July, 1993, the government had effected sweeping changes  in the Companies Act raising salary and prerequisite limits from  Rs 1.80 lakhs and Rs 1.35 lakhs per annum, respectively, to Rs 6  lakhs and Rs 4.50 lakhs per annum.    It had also withdrawn the ceiling on commission on net  profits. Mandatory 10 per cent reduction in salary in the event  of absence or inadequacy of profits was stopped and loss-making  companies were delegated powers to appoint managerial personnel  without Central government's approval on a par with  profit-making companies.    Under the new changes, remuneration under section II of part  II of the Act may be paid as "minimum remuneration" without the  approval of the Central government.    The official release said loss-making companies or companies  with inadequate net profits have the freedom to work out  suitable remuneration packages for their managerial personnel  within the limits specified in the stipulated section.    Approval of the Central government will now be required by  companies in regard to managerial remuneration only if the  remuneration is in excess of the limits (related to the  effective capital of the company) specified in section II of  part II of the schedule.    The condition that a sick company should seek government  clearance for appointment of managerial personnel has been  withdrawn, according to the announcement.    It says approval of the Centre is no longer required for a  managing director or manager of a company to become managing  director or manager of another company provided he opts to draw  remuneration from only one of the two companies.    Even in regard to such managerial personnel who are already  in position on the date of the amendment in the schedule,  companies may themselves raise their remuneration, from a date  not earlier than February 1, 1994, without the approval of the  Central government.    This may be done even where the earlier  appointment/remuneration had been approved by the Centre in  accordance with the provisions of schedule XIII save and except  in those cases where the Centre had given conditional approval  in such cases.</p>

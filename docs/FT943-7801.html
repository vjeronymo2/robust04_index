			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gifts to a wife I am non-resident for tax purposes but my wife and I will soon return to live in the UK. Before then, I wish to give her some of my shareholdings so (a) we can take advantage of separate annual CGT exemptions after our return, and (b) we can realise capital gains made while I am exempt from CGT through non-residence. If I simply give her the shares, will she be treated as having acquired them at market value on the date of the gift or at the (considerably lower) value at which I bought them, plus the relevant indexation? Although the matter might be debatable, I think your wife would acquire the shares at your base cost (plus indexation) up to the date of your disposal to her. If you want her to own the shares with a base cost equal to their market value, then she will have to acquire them in her own right. (Barry Stillerman).

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE BACK A NEW WILLIAM SIMON VENTURE;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: WITH PARTNER GERALD PARSKY, THE INVESTMENT LEGEND AND FORMER  TREASURY SECRETARY STRIKES AGAIN.  </P> <P> A huge Japanese insurance concern is putting $100 million in equity into a new  venture with former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and partner Gerald L.  Parsky that will invest in medium-sized real estate projects and corporations  around the world.  </P> <P> The Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. will be a passive long-term investor  in the partnership with Simon and Parsky. Simon became an investment legend  through his leveraged buyouts in the mid-1980s, and more recently the two men  have bought a string of thrifts and banks.  </P> <P> "This is the first time Bill Simon and I have made a relationship with one  partner for all our activities, and we consider Tokio Marine to be ideal," said  Parsky, who was an assistant Treasury secretary under Simon from 1974 through  1977.  </P> <P> The partnership, which won't invest in banks or thrifts, will be called WSPG  Partners LP, and will be based in Los Angeles. Simon and Parsky have until  recently conducted their activities through WSGP International, which they  founded in 1986, when Simon decided to give up leveraged buyout investments.  </P> <P> Simon and Parsky will be co-chairmen of the new partnership. Until he stepped  down this month, Parsky was a senior partner with the Los Angeles law firm of  Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, where he will continue to be "of counsel."  </P> <P> Tokio Marine operates in 40 countries and last year earned $704 million on  assets of $58 billion. The partnership will give Tokio Marine an opportunity to  diversify from its primary business, Parsky said.  </P> <P> "We believe in Mr. Simon's and Mr. Parsky's view of the global marketplace,"  Shunji Kono, president of Tokio Marine, said in a prepared statement. "We have  confidence in their ability to identify excellent investment opportunities."  </P> <P> While Tokio Marine won't take part in day-to-day decisions, it will help shape  the partnership's longer-term investment strategy, Parsky said.  </P> <P> For corporate investing, the partnership plans to set up an equity fund over  the next nine months with a small number of investors from around the world.  The fund will seek investments in medium-sized companies that it believes offer  good opportunities for rapid growth. The partnership plans other specialized  funds as well.  </P> <P> The partnership won't take part in any hostile takeovers, nor will it become  involved in highly leveraged transactions, Parsky said. He said the concern  will look for deals requiring a minimum 20% equity investment, rather than the  highly leveraged transactions that require less than 5% of the investors' own  money.  </P> <P> The partnership may invest in some companies that have over-leveraged and need  an equity infusion to improve their balance sheets, he said.  </P> <P> WSGP International has real estate investments worth some $800 million, Parsky  said. The new partnership will try to avoid the more mainstream commercial real  estate opportunities -- downtown office space, for example -- in favor of  specialized investments, Parsky said.  </P> <P> It may buy some properties from thrifts and banks that need to get rid of them  for regulatory reasons, or because they cannot hold them for all the years they  require to come to maturity, he said.  </P> <P> WSGP International, in addition to its real estate investments, has interests  in five thrifts and two commercial banks with combined assets of $10.5 billion.  Among them are Honolulu Federal Savings &amp; Loan, First Interstate Bank of  Hawaii and Western Federal Savings &amp; Loan.  </P></p>

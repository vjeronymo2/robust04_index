			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DAN REEVES, AMONG HIGHEST-PAID COACHES, GIVEN 4-YEAR EXTENSION  </P> <P> Broncos Coach Dan Reeves has received a four-year extension on his contract  that will carry him through the 1992 season, owner Pat Bowlen announced today.  </P> <P> Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but sources said Reeves will be paid  $785,000 annually, making him one of the five or six highest-paid coaches in  the NFL.  </P> <P> "I think I'm one of the top five or six coaches in the league, and I think this  contract is in line with that," Reeves said at a press conference. "I wasn't  looking for the biggest salary in the league; I didn't think I deserved that.  But I felt I was one of the top coaches in the NFL."  </P> <P> Reeves, 45, is entering his ninth season as head coach of the Broncos, during  which he has compiled a 74-45-1 record, including back-to-back Super Bowl  appearances after the 1986 and 1987 seasons.

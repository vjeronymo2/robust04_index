			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Pascal Delumuraz, chief of the Swiss </F> Department of Public Economy, by Konstantin Pribytkov:  "Switzerland Comes Closer For Russians"]    [Text] Bern -- Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, federal adviser and  chief of the department (minister) of public economy of  Switzerland, has been visiting Moscow at the invitation of Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. During his visit an agreement was  signed on trade and economic cooperation between our two  countries.    On the eve of the trip ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin  Pribytkov interviewed Mr Delamuraz. The minister said, in  particular:    "I am sure that Russian-Swiss relations have a big future.  The agreement we have signed is intended to start a new chapter  in partnership links between the two states. Switzerland wants  the transformations in Russia to succeed. Everything that  contributes to strengthening the liberal order in the world is  of fundamental significance, in the Swiss government's view.  The trip is a public expression of the Swiss will for  cooperation with the Russian Federation."    The federal adviser sees the present level of trade and  economic relations as "relatively modest and much lower than it  could be." While the average annual volume of trade with the  former USSR exceeded two billion Swiss francs, last year it was  approximately 700 million, which is "clearly not enough."  "Russia needs us, and we need an economically developed Russia."    [Pribytkov] How did the collapse of the former USSR affect  bilateral trade?    [Delamuraz] It was destructive, certainly. We are currently  at the stage of reestablishing our economic contacts along  decentralized lines. Where we used to have one partner, we now  have dozens. I think one major problem is finance and the need  to create an effective and reliable banking system.    [Pribytkov] Investments in Russia are still regarded by some  Western businessmen as very risky. Do you agree?    [Delamuraz] Indeed, capital investments in Russia are  particularly risky. As we get to know one another better and  establish relations of personal trust, these risks will become  easier to calculate and predict. A reliable juridical system is  of paramount importance in this respect. Swiss investors are  notoriously cautious. But once they get down to the job they  remain dedicated to it and prove themselves to be reliable  partners. I hope that our relations in the investments sphere  will become more intensive in the next few months and years.    [Pribytkov] As is known, Switzerland has instituted credit  guarantees to help countries with transitional economies. What  is the future of these credits?    [Delamuraz] Our assistance for Russia and the other CIS  states is only now becoming effective. I might mention the  recently instituted line of credit guarantees for Russia in the  sum of 100 million Swiss francs. We are also studying and  implementing a number of specific projects in the spheres of  technical assistance and infrastructure development. This is  just the initial stage. But no matter what foreign governments  do, state funds are always limited, so, ultimately, economic  cooperation must be driven by private entrepreneurs and  investors.    [Pribytkov] Russian officials are urging Western partners to  lift trade restrictions. This would help the reforms even more  than other forms of assistance. What do you think?    [Delamuraz] I entirely agree that trade is better than aid.  Trade partners are responsible for what they say. Markets have  to be even more open. In our case, I think I can say that the  Swiss market is wide open to all foreign goods, regardless of  their provenance.    [Pribytkov] What spheres of economic cooperation can be  regarded as the most promising, in your view?    [Delamuraz] I think there are many spheres in which our two  countries could cooperate more intensively and obtain mutual  benefit. The foundation of Swiss industry is made up, in  particular, of small and medium-sized enterprises. As for  specific sectors of industry, our companies have acquired a  worldwide reputation in such spheres as machine building and the  chemical, pharmaceutical, watchmaking, and food industries.  Most of these sectors are distinguished by highly intensive  research and know-how. Swiss financial and insurance services  are highly specialized and competitive.</p>

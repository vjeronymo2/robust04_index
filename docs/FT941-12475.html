			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Caution reigns - Directors' transactions As the market climbed to new heights, directors remained on the sidelines, particularly at the beginning of the week. Activity was marked by a number of deals in companies with large market capitalisations. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, sold 80,000 ordinary shares. There have been several option-related transactions recently but this was the first deal in ordinaries. The sales accounted for a quarter of Sir Allen's holding. Osprey Communications was noted earlier this year when Ronald Sidaway bought 125,000 shares at 41p. He has continued to buy at prices as high as 49p; the shares are trading now at about 53p. ASTEC (BSR), now based in Hong Kong, is involved in designing and making power conversion products and other electronic equipment. Technical director Neal Stewart sold his entire holding at 85.5p, although he retains some incentive shares. Correction: Last week, we reported a sale of 35,000 shares by three directors of Blacks Leisure. In fact, there was a purchase of 40,500, giving a total value of Pounds 14,985 transacted by four directors.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company              Sector        Shares     Value      directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Astec (BSR)          EE&amp;E       2,314,938     1,979           1 Blenheim Group       Mdia          65,000       247           2* Body Shop Intl       RetG          14,600        12           1 Border Television    Mdia          11,000        17           2 Caledonia Inv        OthF          12,500        86           1 Cementone            Chem         834,253       768           1 Christie Group       OthF          50,000        32           1 CML Microsystems     EE&amp;E         150,000       405           3* Folkes Group         Prop          70,000        29           1 Grand Metropolitan   SW&amp;C          80,000       400           1 Hepworth             BM&amp;M         129,809       646           1* H'land Distilleries  SW&amp;C          50,000       210           1* London &amp; Clydeside   BCon         127,000       184           1 Lowndes Lambert      Insu           4,000        18           1 Lucas Industries     EngV         256,021       525           1* Menvier-Swain        EE&amp;E          10,000        25           1 Millwall Holdings    L&amp;Hl       1,000,000        40           1 Newman Tonks         BM&amp;M         102,600       192           1* Perpetual            OthF         300,000     3,240           1 Pilkington           BM&amp;M         223,917       338           2* Reg Vardy            Dist         700,000     1,439           1 Sainsbury (J)        RetF           2,500        10           1 Seeboard             Elec           8,370        65           2 Smith (DS)           PP&amp;P          41,488       192           1* Spirax-Sarco         Eng           42,156       184           3* St Ives              PP&amp;P         105,000       391           1* Staveley Industries  DivI          25,715        65           1* Stirling Group       Text          65,000        39           1 Tinsley Robor        PP&amp;P          50,000        10           1 Treatt               FdMa          54,350       109           1 Watts Blake Bearne   ExIn           5,000        23           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Blenheim Group       Med           34,075        31           1 Bowater              PP&amp;P           2,000        10           1 Broadgate Inv Tst    InvT          12,500        17           1 Carclo Engineering   Eng           10,000        28           1 Etonbrook Prop       Prop         310,000       264           1 Hopkinsons Hldgs     Eng           25,000        12           1 Kewill Systems       SSer          10,000        24           1 Mercury Asset Mngmt  OthF           6,000        45           1 Midlands Elect       Elec           2,000        14           1 Osprey Communicatns  Mdia          50,000        25           1 PremierConsolidated  OilE          50,000        11           1 Premium Trust        Insu          35,000        34           1 Protean              Eng           32,103        58           5 Scottish Eastern     InvT          50,000        46           1 Scot Mortgage Tst    InvT          18,000        45           1 Value &amp; Income Tst   InvT           9,621        12           1 Watson &amp; Philip      RetF           3,000        11           1 Watts Blake Bearne   ExIn           5,000        23           1 WEW Group            RetG          93,000        57           4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

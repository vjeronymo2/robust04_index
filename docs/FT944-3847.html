			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Proteus Proteus International has had a miserable year, with its shares falling by more than 70 per cent at one stage. It hopes to 'design' effective drugs using computer software developed at Manchester University. But the company has failed to inspire investors suspicious of the scientific credentials of top management, which started out in the property business, and of the quality of the software. Its most successful research programme has been in animal drugs, an area with lower safety standards and sales than human treatments.</p>

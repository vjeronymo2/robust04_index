			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Taiwan set tobenefit from US recovery Taiwan is poised to benefit from economic recovery in the US, its biggest export market, and continued growth in its fastest-growing market, China, analysts said yesterday. The government's central statistics office said growth in the island's gross national product reached 6.08 per cent in the third quarter of this year, up from a revised 5.62 per cent in the second quarter and 5.8 per cent in the third quarter of 1993. The forecast for the fourth quarter was lifted to 6.9 per cent from the previous forecast of 6.44 per cent. 'The economic picture is more optimistic following an improvement in export performance,' Mr Daniel Chen, chief economist at Chinatrust Commercial Bank, said. 'The main pumping factors behind growth in 1994 have been increased exports and improved private-sector investment. This trend will be sustained into next year.' The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics raised its forecast for 1994 GNP growth to 6.10 per cent from 6.01 per cent, and forecast 1995 GNP growth at 6.52 per cent. In 1993, the island's GNP rose 6.02 per cent, revised upward from an earlier figure of 5.94 per cent. The statistics office said the leading indicator for economic growth would in future be gross domestic product instead of gross national product. It predicted gross domestic product would grow 6.42 per cent in 1994 and 6.49 per cent in 1995. Next year's growth would be the result of a global economic recovery and higher exports, as well as more investment in Taiwan's electronics and steel industries, the statistics office said. Economists cautioned that the demise of China's ailing paramount leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping, could damage Taiwan's share and property markets. Uncertainty surrounding parliamentary elections next year, and first-ever presidential elections slated for early 1996, could also damp private-sector investment. The ruling Kuomintang is expected take steps to stimulate the economy next year to enhance its prospects in those elections, Prof Wea Chi-lin of National Taiwan University said. He predicts the central bank is likely to nudge interest rates higher following municipal polls early next month, in line with recent US rate rises, but will bring them down again in mid-1995 to encourage investment. The statistics office said per capita income should reach Dollars 11,629 (Pounds 7,260) in 1994, up from Dollars 11,296 as previously forecast. The figure for 1993 was revised to Dollars 10,852.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (17): Down-to-earth research - A look at new materials Daniel Goldin, administrator of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, interviewed last spring by the FT, stressed that aeronautics, and spin-off from space research for the civil aircraft industry, would be given greater emphasis in Nasa's Dollars 14.5bn research and development budget. Aeronautics, although named first, has played the subsidiary role ever since cancellation of research funds for the titanium Supersonic Transport (SST) nearly quarter of a century ago. Now, Nasa has joint programmes with the US aircraft industry on both supersonic and advanced subsonic airliners expected to enter service early in the next century. New materials are one of the main R&amp;D goals. Nasa's European counterpart, the European Space Agency, is no less concerned to bring more of its technology nearer the ground. Its technology transfer initiative, run by Spacelink Europe, a consortium of technology brokers, has identified no fewer than 170 opportunities for transfer, among them advanced materials for heat resistance, lubrication, sensors and stiff lightweight structures. Earlier this year, one of Europe's most spectacular packages of advanced materials, the Rolls-Royce Trent engine for Airbus A330, was certified on schedule. The Trent is the most powerful engine Rolls-Royce has ever built. Its makers claim it is significantly lighter than competing US engines and runs at lower peak temperatures, while they remain confident it can be pushed to 100,000 lbs thrust. But Rolls-Royce has been at the forefront of those urging government to recognise the profound importance of advanced engineering materials to Britain as a manufacturing nation. The US subsidises aerospace materials development through both Nasa and the Department of Defense. Germany, in July, announced a new Pounds 500m subsidy for research to help its aerospace industry meet US and Japanese competition. The Japanese have long supported national programmes in such sectors as engineering ceramics, where many believe they lead the world. For Britain, the real purpose of the now-defunct Hotol project was as a test-bed demonstrator for advanced materials development that would push engines way beyond the Trent. Not only have UK engineers lost this opportunity, but they face further cuts in materials R&amp;D through the undertaking to axe defence R&amp;D by another Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year. Moreover, two major UK sources of carbon fibre composites and other advanced aerospace materials, ICI and Courtaulds, have both abandoned the field. A more positive step is the appointment of an internationally renowned materials scientist as chief executive of the new Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Richard Brook was Cookson Professor of materials science and head of Oxford University's department of materials science. His speciality is engineering ceramics. Recognition that better materials are the key to higher performance in every sector of engineering has slowly been gaining ground among decision-makers. A report from the the UK government's Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost) in 1992, reviewing advanced engineering materials, concluded that 'with a few notable exceptions, the UK science and technology base in these materials is weak. The level of R&amp;D is low, and the effort is spread too thinly.' Among Acost's recommendations were that the government should consider launching 'substantial demonstrator programmes' - particularly in the aerospace and automotive sectors. Prof Brook believes that, over the past two decades, R&amp;D has yielded 'enormous advances' in the properties of engineering ceramics. If harnessed, such advances should translate into lighter engines that can be run at higher temperatures. So far, they have not, and Prof Brook identifies three reasons: 1. Engineering ceramics are still too costly, and although it is believed that economies of scale would cut their costs the question remains: who is to pay for the build-up in scale? 2. The vigour with which established materials - such as superalloys - react to any threat from competing materials; and 3. 'The residual distaste of engineers for brittle behaviour', plus the fact that the fracture toughness of ceramic materials can still be a problem for many potential users. As a result, 'research progress has not always brought the rewards that were foreseen,' says Prof Brook. Nevertheless, he identifies another three factors that give him considerable encouragement: 1. An excellent base has now been established for systematic advance. He cites the way the Japanese are using this base as the launchpad for their synergy ceramics R&amp;D programme, a 10-year commitment involving Y100bn. 2. He sees merit in focusing on applications, where ceramics 'can deliver a function that simply cannot be provided by other materials,' such as the newly-discovered 'high-temperature' superconductors, where success would drag other applications along in its wake. 3. Those who have been least successful in their pursuit of advanced ceramic materials have been the loudest critics lately. 'The fact remains that a modern industrial nation looking for technological advance will be better placed if it can operate with full competence over the entire portfolio of materials - ceramics, metals and polymers.'</p>

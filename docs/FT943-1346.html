			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: New issues This has been a bad week for new issues. On Thursday, the share price of MDIS, a software group floated in March, halved after it reported profits below expectations. The day before Aerostructures Humble, an engineering company floated in May, saw its shares fall 40 per cent after a profits warning. Both companies were optimistic about prospects in their prospectuses. What should investors conclude from such fiascos? Certainly not that new issues are to be avoided. While new issues are not the easy route to a quick profit that many used to think, there is no need to swing to the opposite extreme. On average, companies floated this year have slightly outperformed the market. Investors should also resist the temptation to call for more regulation. The regulations are already tough enough. Under the Financial Services Act, companies and their advisers are liable for damages if they are negligent in preparing a prospectus. Of course, it is hard to prove negligence, meaning investors have little practical recourse. But tighter regulation would tie companies and their advisers up in more red tape without giving investors any complete guarantee. Nothing will change the fact that equities are a risky investment. The best sanction is to keep a close eye on the banks that sponsor issues that flop and avoid their deals if a poor track record develops. For the record, MDIS's bank is Barings, while Aerostructures' is N M Rothschild.</p>

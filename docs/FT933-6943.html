			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Caviar cartel formed THE FIVE caviar-producing countries around the Caspian Sea agreed yesterday to set up a caviar cartel, according to a report from the Iranian IRNA news agency, threatening higher prices for one of the world's priciest delicacies, writes Neil Buckley. Officials from Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan were reported to have met in the Iranian port of Bandar Anzali, and agreed to co-ordinate the global marketing of caviar. IRNA said member countries would get together to determine an export quota for each country, and study the possibility of joint exports. An Iranian official was quoted as saying the agreement was needed to end a slide in caviar prices since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. But western caviar importers said last night Russian exporters had been quoting higher prices for caviar this year, and a cartel might have the effect of keeping prices at sensible levels. The Soviet Union, which produced about 250 tonnes of caviar a year, and Iran, with 100 tonnes, were previously the only exporters - apart from China which produces about 15 tonnes a year - and fixed prices annually. The disintegration of the USSR has led to four different countries - Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan - emerging as exporters. Lack of centralised regulation has led to over-fishing and damage to caviar supplies in the Caspian Sea. There has also been a rise in smuggling of caviar into western Europe.</p>

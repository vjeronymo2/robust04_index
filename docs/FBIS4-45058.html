			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.E.B.: "Dark Days for Black Marketeers"; first </F> paragraph is LE SOIR D'ALGERIE introduction]    [Text] Black marketeers active on the country's  eastern and western borders are beginning to experience hard  times now that measures have been implemented to combat the  smuggling scourge.    In the eastern part of the country, following the steps  taken  to combat illegal exports of goods primarily to Tunisia,  Algeria's borders are becoming less and less permissive. That  fact is having a favorable impact on the local market in the  governorates of Tarf, Souk-Ahras, and Tebessa. Those border  areas are beginning to find a greater availability of consumer  goods thanks to regular supplies. The steps in question have  been all the more effective in that the price deregulation  affecting those goods, which have long been subsidized by the  state, has discouraged supporters of the black market.    The most spectacular result is the pronounced drop in the  price of red meat, which now ranges from 160 to 200 dinars [DA].  Fraudulent exports of domestic livestock have been markedly  curbed, and stockraisers are being forced to send their  livestock to the market in their own governorate. To get back to  the subject of food products, implementation of the new price  policy has discouraged black marketeers in that even the market  stalls in the border villages are beginning to show signs of  health, the exceptions being certain localities in the Tebessa  Governorate where prices have been holding firm in the case of  salad oil, Lahda powdered milk, and coffee. The reason,  according to the authorities concerned, is the inadequate supply.    As part of the same struggle, the Tarf Governorate, which  has  set up its own ad hoc committee, is continuing to update its  commercial registry thanks to the combined efforts of the  governorate's commercial departments and the Customs Service.    It has also been decided to introduce permits for merchants  who buy consumer goods, the purpose being to achieve better  control over food products intended for sale exclusively in that  governorate. Early results show that those measures are  effective.    The fight against the black market is also beginning to  produce a few favorable results in the western part of the  country. The most recent measure, which consists of prohibiting  taxi drivers, for instance, from transporting passengers across  the border, is already enabling customs officers to keep better  control over individuals and has "facilitated their task when it  comes to searching baggage," according to one customs inspector,  who adds that "the systematic recording by the customs offices  of all outgoing receipts makes the inspection of passengers more  effective and gives us more control." On 11 May alone, the  number of passengers totaled 1,312, and receipts totaling  DA393,600 in taxes were recorded. On that same day, a large  quantity of products was seized, including white meat, eggs,  rice, black pepper, salad oil, insecticide, and so on.    For the moment, aware of the difficulty of covering the  entire Algerian-Moroccan border, the trade departments backed by  the Customs Service are thinking of starting a major cleanup  operation involving in particular an updating of the commercial  registries.    They will also have the task of finding a way to put an end  to the trafficking in fuel, which is carried in vehicles  equipped with large fuel tanks and then unloaded somewhere along  the road on the other side of the border. According to experts,  that activity results in substantial profits. As is true on the  country's eastern border, food products are again appearing in  the market stalls, meaning that there has been a positive effect  since the beefing up of border surveillance.    Tea, flour, sugar, and semolina are readily available in  localities in the Tlemcen Governorate. Even the price of lamb  has dropped to DA260, compared to DA300 a few days ago. In  Maghria, however, the price of red meat has not dropped, the  reason being the regulations governing the trade in livestock.</p>

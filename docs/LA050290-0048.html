			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO PROPOSE NEW CUTS IN NUCLEAR ARMS IN EUROPE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, faced with growing anti-nuclear sentiment in Europe,  is readying a proposal to open negotiations with the Soviet Union to eliminate  all short-range, ground-launched nuclear weapons from Europe, Administration  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The proposal to launch negotiations "on an accelerated schedule" would cover  the Lance missile and two classes of U.S. nuclear artillery, as well as the  equivalent Soviet weapons, the officials said.  </P> <P> The initiative is expected to be the subject of an intense round of North  Atlantic Treaty Organization consultations beginning later this week, when  Secretary of State James A. Baker III meets with foreign ministers of the  alliance in Brussels, the officials said.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who met with West German Defense Minister  Gerhard Stoltenberg at the Pentagon on Tuesday, is expected to discuss the new  U.S. proposal with other defense ministers at a NATO Nuclear Planning Group  meeting in Calgary, Canada, next week.  </P> <P> Unless snags develop during the allied consultations, U.S. officials could have  the plan ready to present at the May 30-June 3 summit in Washington between  Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The proposed move would significantly expand the goals and speed up the  schedule for negotiations restricting the short-range nuclear weapons, which  have become something of an anachronism in Europe now that East and West  Germany are progressing speedily toward unification.  </P> <P> The draft proposal calls for elimination of the ground-based weapons, a goal  that goes well beyond the "comprehensive concept" that NATO adopted last May.  That alliance position stated that prospective negotiations on short-range  nuclear forces should be aimed at the "partial reduction" of such weapons  rather than a total ban.  </P> <P> The short-range weapons were not covered under the 1988 Intermediate Nuclear  Forces Treaty, which banned ground-launched missiles with a range of 300 to  3,400 miles. The new category of missiles would have a range of less than 300  miles.  </P> <P> The Administration's new position would schedule negotiations on short-range  systems to begin as early as next fall, when NATO and the Warsaw Pact are  expected to sign an agreement sharply reducing conventional forces in Europe.  </P> <P> By contrast, last year's "comprehensive concept" called for negotiations to  begin only after the opposing alliances begin to carry out the force reductions  called for in the Conventional Forces in Europe agreements. By most estimates,  that would delay the start of short-range nuclear forces negotiations until at  least 1992.  </P> <P> "The thrust is that there has been a basic adjustment" in the U.S. position,  said one knowledgeable Administration source. "The calculation has been that  it's better to get out ahead of this debate than letting the Soviets propose  the denuclearization of Germany" in the reunification talks set to begin  Saturday in Bonn.  </P> <P> With the May summit already set to address long-range nuclear missiles and a  conventional forces agreement, the latest Administration proposal would set out  a process for addressing another major class of nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The resulting negotiations would seek to ban the Soviets' deployment in Eastern  Europe of four types of short-range ballistic missiles -- the Scud, Frog,  Scarab and Spider -- as well as three kinds of artillery pieces.  </P> <P> However, the American proposal would allow each side to maintain and modernize  its arsenal of aircraft-carried nuclear weapons, such as air-launched cruise  missiles and the U.S. nuclear-tipped tactical air-to-surface missile.  </P> <P> The deployment of such weapons throughout Western Europe traditionally has  stirred less controversy than the fielding of ground-based missiles. In  addition, excluding the aircraft-borne weapons would leave NATO with a potent  nuclear deterrent capable of reaching beyond Eastern Europe and into Soviet  territory from bases in Western Europe.  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials said that salvaging an air-launched missile force  from rising anti-nuclear sentiment has been a principal U.S. aim in formulating  the new proposal. By making concessions on the timing and goals of negotiations  on short-range nuclear arms, Administration officials said they hope to defuse  pressures for the removal of all U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe.  </P> <P> "There is tremendous pressure on us to do something, especially from the  (European) allies," said one U.S. official. "It is not an issue that can be  iced until 1992."  </P> <P> But to some European anti-nuclear activists, the proposal will merely shift the  focus of controversy in Europe to air-launched weapons, which have slipped  virtually unnoticed into and out of European air bases.  </P> <P> "It amounts to turning in two handguns for an assault rifle and calling it arms  control," said Dan Plesch, an arms control analyst with the British-American  Security Information Council, a group active in promoting disarmament. The  air-launched missiles "will do everything ground-based systems can do and a  whole lot more."  </P> <P> The Pentagon had planned to spend $500 million over the next five years to  build a new generation of Lance short-range nuclear missiles. But with European  sentiment running high against the modernization program, Administration  officials have acknowledged that the new weapons are unlikely to be built.  </P> <P> Technical troubles and congressional opposition also have dogged the Pentagon's  proposed production of new nuclear projectiles for 8-inch and 155-millimeter  artillery weapons. More recently, the West German government has balked at  deployment in West Germany of the projectiles, whose maximum range of 19 miles  would ensure that any such weapon fired from West German soil would explode in  East Germany or in Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> New democratic governments in those two states and the prospect of German  reunification make either option politically troublesome.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John M. Broder also contributed to this report.  </P></p>

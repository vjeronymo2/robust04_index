			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: AmBrit resumes bid talks with United Energy AMBRIT International, the oil and gas exploration company, has resumed talks with a possible white knight just two days before the hostile bid offer by Pittencrief, the Scottish oil production and communications group, is due to close. AmBrit said it was in discussions about a recommended offer with United Energy, a USM-quoted oil and gas group with which talks have already been terminated once before. Mr Alan Russett, chairman of AmBrit, said that although discussions had been terminated just before Christmas due to the tight schedule, United had approached the group again. Although it was up to United to make any offer, AmBrit had to make an announcement yesterday as its shares rose 10 per cent from 7p to 8p on the day. A recommended offer by United would be equivalent to at least 9p cash per AmBrit ordinary, against Pittencrief's revised offer of 6p cash for every AmBrit share or one new Pittencrief share for every 28 AmBrit shares. 'It is not a final offer and until it is a final offer there is only one offer on the table,' said Mr Michael Munro, Pittencrief chairman. The announcement comes as Pittencrief raised its holding in its target to 39.9 per cent with the acceptance by Martin Currie - AmBrit's largest institutional shareholder, with a 9 per cent stake - of Pittencrief's all share offer.</p>

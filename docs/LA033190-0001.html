			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEASLES CASES RISE SHARPLY IN S.D. COUNTY  </P> <P> The measles epidemic in San Diego County has worsened dramatically recently,  leading public health officials to believe that more cases will be reported  during the first three months of 1990 than in all of 1982, when the previous  record for reported cases was set.  </P> <P> Since early January, 49 confirmed cases of measles and 418 probable cases --  most of which will eventually be confirmed -- were reported in the county,  officials said. San Diego reported 191 measles cases during 1989 and 451 during  1982.  </P> <P> The epidemic that began sweeping through Southern California in late 1987 has  hit hardest in Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire, where health officials  have already reported many more cases during the first three months of 1990  than in all of 1989. Dramatic increases in measles cases have also been  registered throughout the Central Valley, and an outbreak has developed in  Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> "Children are getting ill, going to the hospital and dying," said Dr. Loring  Dales, chief of the immunization unit for the state Department of Health  Services in Berkeley. "We are really stunned by not only the amount of illness  but also the severity. . . . (It is) the kind of thing you would see in  Calcutta."  </P> <P> The majority of the current cases are occurring in preschool-age children who  have never been immunized against measles. Health officials speculate that  these toddlers may be especially vulnerable to the disease. Previous epidemics  have largely affected school-age children or young adults.  </P> <P> More than half of San Diego County's confirmed and probable cases during the  past three months have involved preschoolers.  </P> <P> "That's an age group of kids who should be immunized at 15 months," said Sandy  Ross, immunization project coordinator for the county Department of Health  Services. "But many of the kids in this outbreak were eligible for vaccinations  they have not gotten."  </P> <P> Statewide, between a quarter and a third of measles victims have required  hospitalization, primarily for pneumonia or dehydration. About one in 200 of  the afflicted have died, contrasted with the historical pattern in the United  States of one death for every 1,000 to 3,000 cases.  </P> <P> While local hospitalization figures are not yet available, "one out of every  four people with measles was hospitalized during 1989," Ross said. "That's a  lot of people who were ill enough to require hospitalization."  </P> <P> "We feel like we're under siege," said Dr. Gary Euler, chief of immunization  programs in San Bernardino County, where health officials have documented 910  cases and five deaths so far this year, contrasted with 650 cases and five  deaths during 1989. Officials there believe the county's rate of new cases is  the highest in the state and possibly the nation.  </P> <P> Measles cases this month "have been coming in so fast you can't keep the log  up," said Orange County epidemiologist Thomas J. Prendergast.  </P> <P> San Diego has yet to record its first measles-related death during the current  outbreak. However, local hospitals have reported several serious cases,  including one death that might eventually be linked to measles.  </P> <P> Hector Lopez, a 10-year-old fourth-grader at Sunset View Elementary School in  Point Loma, died Feb. 23, several days after being hospitalized. The county  coroner's office has yet to determine if he died of measles, but the disease  has been diagnosed in other members of the boy's family.  </P> <P> Doctors at Children's Hospital are now caring for a 1-year-old who was admitted  to the hospital 68 days ago after being found to have measles. The prognosis is  "not good" for the infant, who is on life-support systems, hospital spokesman  Mark Morelli said Friday.  </P> <P> As of Thursday, 1,407 measles cases and six measles deaths had been reported to  Los Angeles County health officials, contrasted with 1,202 cases and 17 deaths  in 1989. The incomplete March case total of 661 is already the highest monthly  report of cases in 13 years.  </P> <P> Dr. Shirley L. Fannin of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services  said the epidemic there "clearly exceeds" the last major epidemic, in 1976 and  1977. "We are really into a major surge. . . . It is hop, skipping and jumping  from population to population and infecting the susceptibles," she said.  </P> <P> Statewide, reported cases are "running way ahead" of 1989, when 3,048 measles  cases were reported, said Dales of the state's immunization unit in Berkeley.  If trends continue, he said, it is possible that the 1990 case total will  surpass the 9,000 cases reported in 1977.  </P> <P> Previous epidemics have largely affected school-age children or young adults.  But the majority of the current cases are occurring in preschool-age children  who have never been immunized against measles, according to Fannin.  </P> <P> Particularly hard-hit are Latino, Asian and Pacific Islands ethnic minorities,  and children of all racial and ethnic groups in low-income communities.  </P> <P> Doctors are also treating an unknown number of measles victims at hospital  emergency rooms, said Ross of the San Diego County health department. "A lot of  people go to emergency rooms just to be diagnosed. Others are sick enough to  need (intravenous) fluids to rehydrate them so they don't have to be  hospitalized."  </P> <P> Some measles victims who go to hospitals are unwittingly helping spread the  disease, especially in emergency rooms, where sick people often face long waits  before receiving care. "The longer the infectious person is there, the greater  the opportunity to spread it to other people," Ross said.  </P> <P> Some San Diego County hospitals evidently have posted signs at emergency room  entrances, warning infected people not to mingle with others who are seeking  treatment, Ross said. UC San Diego Medical Center has posted warning signs at  doors leading to wards that house highly susceptible patients such as pregnant  women and infants.  </P> <P> And emergency room nurses are now advising parents to leave their other  children at home when they bring an injured or ill child in for treatment.  "That's difficult to do, but when they bring the 10-year-old in for treatment  of a soccer injury, they might expose their small baby who's not yet eligible  for a vaccination," Ross said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, the state health director, told the Assembly  Health Committee that $8.8 million more is needed this year to combat the  epidemic, including funds for more immunization clinics, programs and vaccine.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County is planning evening hours for some public health clinics and  is seeking assistance from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control.  </P> <P> Other counties are planning to extend hours of existing clinics or are  organizing special outreach clinics in shopping centers, churches, large  apartment complexes and community centers. Educational messages about the  epidemic and the importance of immunization are being sent out in various  languages with welfare checks and Medi-Cal mailings.  </P> <P> Measles, or rubeola, is a highly contagious viral disease that causes high  fevers and a severe rash. It is spread by direct contact with the respiratory  secretions of infected individuals. Measles most commonly occurs in the winter  and spring, but, during epidemics, a substantial number of cases occur  throughout the year.  </P> <P> To prevent the disease, a first dose of vaccine is recommended for all children  between 12 and 15 months old, and a second dose at 4 to 6 years. But the  vaccine is not foolproof; between 5% and 10% of recipients fail to achieve  immunity after one dose of the vaccine.  </P> <P> More than 90% of school-age children have been immunized against measles,  primarily because of intensive public health efforts over the past 15 years.  Such immunization is required as a condition of attending both public and  private schools as well as state-licensed day-care centers.  </P> <P> But surveys around the state show that only about 70% of all children -- and  only 50% of many ethnic minorities -- have been immunized against measles by  their second birthday, according to Dales. He estimated that a minimum of  375,000 California children between ages 1 and 4 have not been immunized  against measles. Until these children are immunized, they remain at high risk  of contracting the disease if they are exposed to infected individuals.  </P> <P> Measles immunization is given as part of a vaccine against measles, mumps and  rubella, or "German measles." A dose of the vaccine costs about $27, but is  generally available without charge to parents at public health clinics.  </P> <P> The San Diego County health department has historically provided vaccines for  needy children at 15 months of age. But, because of federal budget cuts, "we  don't even know if we'll have vaccines available in September, when the  anticipated supply will run out," Ross said. "We're really in limbo right now."  </P> <P> Also, the county does not have vaccine available for the second shot that is  being recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Lanie Jones in Orange County, Jenifer Warren in Riverside,  Jerry Gillam in Sacramento and Joanna Miller in Ventura contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

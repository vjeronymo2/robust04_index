			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Consensus on Iraq action weakening NEW CRACKS in the cross-party consensus over Iraq yesterday prompted a clear signal from Downing Street that Mr John Major had used his influence to limit the scale of military action against Baghdad. As senior ministers rallied behind the prime minister, officials hinted that the prime minister had successfully persuaded President George Bush to exercise restraint when the targeting and timing of air raids were discussed in a series of telephone calls last weekend. In spite of the assurances, however, the government yesterday refused to rule out sending British troops to Kuwait, but pledged that any such deployment, if it occurred, would be limited and in close conformity with United Nations agreements. Downing Street underlined that no such request had yet been received from the Kuwaitis. Nonetheless, it was pointed out that the UK had signed a defence co-operation agreement with the Gulf state in February last year. In a tacit acknowledgement of widespread disquiet among MPs of all parties over continuing military action, the government also granted an emergency Commons debate on the recent events in the region and the RAF's role in military missions. It is scheduled for tomorrow. As US aircraft were again in action over the northern Iraq no-fly zone, Mr Major insisted at prime minister's question time that the UK would act only in accordance with international law in co-operation with its coalition partners and with the minimum necessary force. But his assurances did little to dispel mounting anxiety in the Commons that Britain may be drawn into a new Gulf war at a time when Russia, France, Italy and several Arab states which backed the 1990 conflict are expressing deep misgivings over Gulf policy. Yesterday evidence of growing dissent at home also emerged. For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, the foreign affairs spokesman, said it was 'time for a pause' in military action to allow the UN security council to assess the situ-ation. The Liberal Democrats also sought a special meeting of the security council and George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, interrupted a tour of South Africa to urge caution. Backbenchers were more vocal with several leftwing Labour MPs using points of order in the Commons to press for a right to amend the government's motion for debate. Mr Ken Livingstone, MP for Brent East, said the stance of new MPs elected at the last general election meant a majority of the party opposed 'this military escapade'. More seriously for the government, many Tory MPs were yesterday urging extreme care before any further engagements are agreed. Mr David Howell, Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said that while the government still commanded overwhelming support, 'people want an explanation of the end-game.' A senior official stressed that reaching an accord among the coalition partners was 'a delicate exercise', adding that no action would be taken without the full approval of the UN and the agreement of Arab coalition members.</p>

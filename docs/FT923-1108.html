			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India aims to boost shellac exports A PREFERENCE for natural resins from the international food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries has boosted the export prospects for Indian shellac, according to Mr KB Jayaswal, chairman of the Shellac Export Promotion Council. The value of Indian shellac exports in 1991-92 rose by 63 per cent to Rs280m (Dollars 10m), and Mr Jayaswal believes that the 1992-93 export target of Rs335m will be easily surpassed. But if India is to take advantage of the growing demand for shellac, it must boost production. Lac is secreted on trees by the lac insect. Last year, the production fell by over 4,000 tonnes to 10,810 tonnes. Large-scale deforestation, environmental pollution and shortage of brood-lac are blamed. The council said the government will have to take the initiative in opening brood-lac farms in the lac growing states and distribute brood-lac free of charge among cultivators. The price of shellac has risen from Rs48,700 a tonne in 1991-92 to over Rs75,000 a tonne now.</p>

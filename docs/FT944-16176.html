			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Allied Domecq sells 641 pubs in Pounds 79m deal In an unusual deal, Scottish Amicable, the insurer, and the pension fund of Strathclyde Regional Council, Scotland's biggest local authority, have together bought 641 pubs from Allied Domecq, the UK food and drinks group, for Pounds 74.3m. The pubs are occupied by Pubmaster, the pub retailing arm of the heavily indebted Brent Walker group, which will continue to lease the properties from their new owners - but at a reduced rent. Pubmaster is paying an additional Pounds 4.75m to Allied Domecq - until recently Allied-Lyons - for the pubs' furniture, fittings and equipment. Scottish Amicable has bought 75 per cent of the pubs and the rest have been acquired by Strathclyde's pension fund, which the Glasgow-based insurer manages. Pubmaster, which was advised by Lazard Brothers, has been granted a 25-year lease on the pubs at a substantial cost-saving to the Allied lease. The agreement also allows Pubmaster to buy one fifth of the pubs every five years - giving it the opportunity of eventually owning all the freeholds outright. Mr John Brackenbury, Pubmaster's chairman, said: 'The terms of the new lease not only significantly reduce our costs but also give us greater flexibility to manage our portfolio actively.' Mr Alan Howie, of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, said that 'this is essentially a property transaction offering an index-linked return over 25 years. The deal provides for Pubmaster to continue to manage the portfolio to the benefit of both parties.' Mr Tony Trigg, chief executive of Allied Domecq Retailing, said: 'This agreement is an important move for both parties. Pubmaster is able to secure the long-term future of this part of the estate. We are able to realise cash from low-growth assets for reinvestment in our core business.' Pubmaster has leased the pubs, free of tie, from Allied Domecq since 1992. Most of them are in the Midlands and the home counties. Pubmaster, which has a total estate of 1,905 pubs nationally, said the pubs involved in this deal complemented its existing strengths in the north and north-east of England. Mr David Hunter, head of property investment at Scottish Amicable, said the investment was underpinned by the vacant possession valuation of the portfolio. Pubmaster, launched in 1991, has become the UK's biggest independent pub retailer through buying pubs from brewers such as Allied, Whitbread and Bass, which were required to reduce the size of their estates by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

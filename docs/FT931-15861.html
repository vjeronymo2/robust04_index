			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Block backs the Bolshoi - Off the Wall TONIGHT the Bolshoi Ballet treads the boards at the Royal Albert Hall and Derek Block can start to relax. Block, best known as a pop promoter, has invested Pounds 3.5m in the five week season, his first big diversion from promoting Rod Stewart, managing the Nolans, and putting on more pantos and pier shows than the mind can handle. The omens for such arts spectaculars are poor. The previous importers of the Bolshoi, the Entertainment Corporation, went bust, and when fellow impresarios Harvey Goldsmith and Raymond Gubbay put on arena-sized opera productions at Earls Court and Wembley it proved a risk too far. Block has recouped around Pounds 3m to date and if the performances approach anywhere near his starry-eyed enthusiasm he hopes that word of mouth will push box office revenue above Pounds 4m. With the 150 dancers performing excerpts from the classical repertoire rather than full-length ballets, Block is unlikely to win over the critics, or even the 400,000 committed dance lovers that his research pinpointed. But aficionados of an 'event', and less scrupulous dance goers, should buy the necessary 100,000 tickets, priced between Pounds 5 and Pounds 100. Many are being marketed by London hotels, anxious to sell beds on the back of ballet; many more through Pounds 200 corporate hospitality packages. With the disappearance of the old apparatchiks, Block found negotiating with the Bolshoi quite straightforward although, at Pounds 30,000 a performance, it is costing well over Pounds 1m to bring the company to London. This seems modest compared with the expense of hiring and transforming the Royal Albert Hall into a passing resemblance of the Bolshoi Theatre, which will consume another Pounds 1.5m. For Patrick Deuchar, manager of the Hall, it marks another significant step towards his dream of converting the auditorium into a venue for 'seasons' rather than renting it out nightly. Expect more major dance events and arts festivals at the Hall and fewer pop concerts. ***** There are people who think that the arts exist to excite confrontation. They are probably the only satisfied customers from the European Arts Festival which has just ended. This was John Major's idea to make the UK's Presidency of the EC a time for dancing in the streets. He extracted Pounds 6m from the Treasury to be spent on arts events under the supervision of John Drummond, ex-Edinburgh Festival and now supremo of the Proms. The Festival led to endless bickering. The problem was that the money came too late to devise ambitious new projects, especially at the big London venues. The press always enjoys trashing rather than praising and wrote off the initiative from the start. John Drummond took umbrage. Look at the stars we brought over, he says - Pina Bausch to the Edinburgh Festival, Ariane Mnouchkine to Bradford, Zeffirelli to London. Ask in Ulster, Wales, Scotland: there the Festival really hit home. But the fact that most of the money was spent out of London, and on community events, allowed the metropolitan critics to ignore it. Drummond had the last laugh. He enraged all those arts managers whose request for Festival funding was rejected by spending an undistributed Pounds 25,000 in national advertisements last weekend which sang the praises of the Festival. In January the main London salerooms sleep. This has allowed Christie's to display the masterpieces from the Dulwich Picture Gallery in its empty rooms. Sotheby's, meanwhile, is choked with washing machines and video recorders. They are the contents of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's country house, Headington Hall, which come under the hammer on January 14. Like most self-made men Maxwell had no artistic taste whatsoever and the 600 lots are expected to make a paltry Pounds 300,000 for his receivers. The only sign of humanity among the second-rate fixtures and fittings is the fact that Maxwell kept the cartoons which ridiculed him. A more sinister side to the man comes with his library desk desk, estimated at up to Pounds 3,000. It has a hidden extra, ignored by the catalogue entry. Attached to the desk lamps are a couple of state of the art microphones. The auction was originally to be held (by Christie's) on the premises at Headington Hall, and prurient curiosity might well have brought out the crowds - and high prices. But Sotheby's won the contract at the last moment by agreeing to a substantial cut in its charge to the seller. It could only afford to do this by postponing the auction until the New Year to take advantage of the the extra 5 per cent of revenue it now receives from raising the buyer's premium to 15 per cent from January 1. But the Maxwells had to quit Headington by the end of 1992; hence the second-hand kitchen furniture in Sotheby's Bond Street. ***** The V&amp;A is having little luck in renting out its newly created exhibition space. The Sovereign show, about the Queen, ran up against public disgruntlement with the royals and cost its sponsors Pounds 1m. Now the latest exhibition, Sporting Glory, has fared even worse, with the organisers, Sporting Trophies Exhibition Ltd, calling in the receivers. Attendances are just 300 a day, half the target, and it seems set to end well before the scheduled February 14. The main loser is Lord Burghesh, who devised the exhibition in memory of his grandfather who organised a similar, acclaimed, display before the War. The V&amp;A will forgo its Pounds 100,000 fee.</p>

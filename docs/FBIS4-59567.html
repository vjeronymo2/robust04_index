			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dictated by America!"] </F>   [Text] If Washington were to use propaganda to justify its  military presence in the region and to sell more weapons to the  Arabs, what should it say? This is the question that Washington  officials are still asking themselves and they are coming up  with the same stale reply.    To attain its objectives in the region, the United States  has  to continue to project the Islamic Republic of Iran as the  regional bad guy. It has to depict the region as tense, to  intimidate the southern shaykhdoms, and to warn them as if they  are being threatened by Iran. Therefore, they should rely on  the United States to help protect them. To do this it is  necessary to launch propaganda regarding Iran's military  capability so that the Arabs will allocate more petrodollars to  purchase more arms to protect their security.    These remarks seem a trifle repetitive, but they are true.  However, we are surprised and regret that these same remarks  have worked on those on the other side of the Persian Gulf and  that the United States continues to milk the regional shaykhs  with this repetitive and deceitful propaganda.    This propaganda by Washington is continuing, but our  question  today is: Why don't the Arabs think about their own interests  and continue to be duped by this hollow and repetitious  propaganda? It is amazing that these Arab shaykhs do not even  ask themselves: Who endangered the security of the region? Who  instigated Saddam to initiate an eight-year war against Iran?  Who has humiliated the Arabs before Israel? Who has made the  Persian Gulf waters unsafe? Who plundered the wealth of the  Arabs in two Persian Gulf wars? Who has eyes on the wealth and  oil of the Arabs today? Who is demanding greater contempt and  humiliation for the Arabs against Israel and formulating plans  for this purpose?    These are questions that are not difficult for the regional  shaykhs to answer. However, they do not even seem to have the  permission to understand these facts!    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs  Robert Pelletreau repeated these U.S. accusations against Iran  in the presence of Arab representatives of the mass media in Abu  Dhabi, and it seems that no one had the sense to ask Pelletreau  to stop these repetitive remarks and say something new that  should at least have some elements of reality.    A while later, the Arab mass media acted as if it had  received fresh grist for its propaganda mills and repeated the  same accusations verbatim along with whatever had been dictated  to them by the U.S. officials. Thus, they demonstrated that  they have no willpower or opinion and do not even realize their  own interests.    In its latest edition, the 'UKAZ newspaper that is  affiliated  with the Zionist circles of Saudi Arabia and is directly  instructed by the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, resorted to exposing  the so-called nuclear program of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  To make its allegations appear to be authentic, it presented  astoundingly astronomical sums as Iran's nuclear expenditure.  It appears that the entire text had been dictated verbatim by  the CIA rapporteur at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh.    It is regrettable that the regional shaykhs have fallen into  this vortex and cannot see these prospects very clearly with  their astonished eyes. The fact that the Saudi publications  take their orders from the U.S. Embassy is not a source of pride  for the Saudis. It is not to their benefit to grovel so much  and to show how eager they are to take dictation from the  Americans. Perhaps it would have been better to have kept up  appearances and have waited awhile before 'UKAZ published  Pelletreau's repetitive remarks dictated by the United States.  Then it would not have appeared to be so servile.</p>

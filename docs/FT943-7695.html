			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Tim Hely Hutchinson Tim Hely Hutchinson, 40, is chief executive of Hodder Headline, Britain's fifth-largest publishing group. His company's diverse backlist includes the Bible and Le Carre as well as The Hello] Cookbook. What would you need, apart from fax and telephone, to run your business? I wouldn't even try to run the business from a desert island. I'd hand over the reins to someone else until I could get a boat back. You can have a vehicle to get round the island. A horse. I like horses. It would be far more versatile than a car and something of a companion. If you could take one person with you, who would it be? It would have to be somebody very practical. Yes, I'd take Capability Brown. He could knock the place into shape and organise the fishing. Confined to an island, what would you miss most? Friends and family, obviously. I would also miss my house which I've spent two years doing up and from which I'll finally be dragged feet first. What would you miss least? Boring meetings. Most people in business spend far too much time in meetings. I am always telling colleagues that they should have taxi meters on their heads - they'd be horrified by the amount of money they'd wasted in even one meeting. It is very rare that I feel that a meeting is truly productive. You can teach a parrot one edifying sentence or motto. The thing I least like in business is people repeating back to me something I'd told them in the first place, as if they'd thought of it themselves. So I'd probably teach it to shut up. You can take one film. Just one? Very mean. The complete set of Le Carre's George Smiley television series. And one book. Again, I'm going to be greedy and take the complete works of Flaubert. He spent an average of seven years writing each book, so they bear endless re-reading. What would you eat and drink? I hope Capability Brown will catch the fish. I like avocados and I assume that there are groves of exotic fruits on the island. Oh, and a lobster pot. One condition can be imposed on the island. A perfect marble bathroom, full of fresh water, washed up on it after a storm. That would mean I wouldn't have to turn into the Wild Man of Borneo. It would be nice also if the island could have a race course, but I suppose that's asking too much. If marooned on the island for the rest of your life, how would you like to be remembered? I'd like my epitaph to read: 'Departure from plan'. I am known to family and friends as 'the planning department', to the point sometimes where spontaneity is lost. I would have taken belt and braces precautions to prevent myself being washed up on a desert island. So people would be interested in the comedy of errors which led up to it.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TINY BANK SEEKS AN EDGE BY OPENING ON SUNDAYS;  </P> <P> "AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY GOD ENDED HIS WORK . . ." -- THE BOOK OF GENESIS  </P> <P> God might have rested on the seventh day, but Jack D. Seefus thinks Sundays are  no time for relaxation in the banking business.  </P> <P> Seefus is president of Antelope Valley Bank, a small, Lancaster-based community  bank. Beginning Nov. 5, he plans to open the bank's six offices for four hours  each Sunday. The bank already has been open Saturdays, and each weekday of  course, since its founding in 1981.  </P> <P> Moreover, for the past few years Seefus has operated branch offices in two  Antelope Valley supermarkets (in Mojave and Rosamond), and plans to add more  such outlets. Some of Seefus' four other branches -- two in Lancaster and one  each in Palmdale and Acton -- are furnished with oak antiques and fireplaces to  make them more inviting.  </P> <P> He's also toying with the idea of placing big-screen televisions near his  tellers to distract customers from their wait in line.  </P> <P> Why? Anything to make the bank stand apart from its competition.  </P> <P> "The world of banking today revolves around marketing," said Seefus, who claims  that his bank, despite having a relatively small $120 million in assets, is  still the biggest in the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changing Demographics  </P> <P> Seefus, 54, said his bank will be open Sundays because of the changing  demographics of the Lancaster-Palmdale area, where thousands have moved in  recent years mainly because of the region's inexpensive real estate.  </P> <P> He estimates that 25% of the area's residents now commute 50 miles or more to  work in the San Fernando Valley or other parts of Los Angeles, leaving them no  time before or after work to go to the bank.  </P> <P> "The demographics have changed to the point of where we're a bedroom  community," he said. "Saturday is now the biggest day we have."  </P> <P> Sunday is a popular grocery-store day, Seefus said, and "we want to be where  the customers are."  </P> <P> But John Stocksdale, manager of First Interstate's Palmdale branch, dismissed  Seefus' plan to open Sundays as unnecessary and costly. "We feel it's going to  be just a very expensive proposition for them, with them picking up limited  additional revenues," Stocksdale said. "They have to do it to try to compete  with us majors. We have no immediate plans to do anything like that."  </P> <P> A bank open on Sunday was once unthinkable, but selling bank services these  days is little different than peddling soap or toothpaste. The deregulation of  the financial industry -- which now enables banks, savings and loans and other  financial entities to offer similar services at similar prices -- has forced  banks to keep finding new marketing gimmicks that will attract customers'  deposits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bank Giveaways  </P> <P> Banks and S&amp;Ls have long given away toasters or offered no-fee checking  accounts, particularly to big depositors or new customers. But lately even big  banks have tried to persuade the public that they're concerned about service to  all comers.  </P> <P> Last month, for instance, Wells Fargo Bank guaranteed a $5 payment to customers  each time they had to wait longer than five minutes in line. First Interstate  Bank of California ($21 billion-plus in assets) shot back by extending the $5  guarantee to each time the bank makes errors in their statements or their  automatic-teller-machine (ATM) transactions are fouled up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seefus wasn't the first to think about doing banking business on Sundays. Some  banks in Georgia already are open Sundays, and Fremont Bank, a community bank  based in Fremont north of San Jose, also plans to start Sunday hours next  month. The Sunday hours will apply only at eight new branches that Fremont  plans to open in supermarkets over the next year, said Robert David, the bank's  marketing director.  </P> <P> For little banks such as Antelope Valley or Fremont, which has $220 million in  assets, service is everything. They constantly try to attract business by  showing that, unlike the local branch of a huge, bureaucracy-laden big bank,  they respond better to customers' needs. The big banks, of course, dispute that  the community banks have any advantage.  </P> <P> Still, Antelope Valley and Fremont argue that putting branches in supermarkets  is a low-cost way of generating revenue. Using only two or three employees per  outlet, both banks use the supermarket branches to make loans as well as take  deposits and cash checks.  </P> <P> "It's low overhead and a lot of volume," said Seefus, whose bank employs 170  people.  </P> <P> Seefus knows banking both big and small. An Omaha, Neb., native, he moved to  Los Angeles in 1957 to work for Citizens National Bank, which later became  Crocker Bank, which has since been merged into Wells Fargo.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opened Branch  </P> <P> In 1966, Seefus opened Crocker's branch office in Lancaster, but in 1981 he  joined with several other local business people to start Antelope Valley Bank.  Ironically, his office is in a building that formerly was a Wells Fargo branch.  Seefus owns less than 5% of Antelope Valley's stock, which is not publicly  traded.  </P> <P> After earning $756,000 in 1985, Antelope Valley's profits dropped to $459,000  and $519,000 in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Seefus blamed the skid on a costly  conversion to a new computer system and some problem loans to small businesses.  But last year, the bank's earnings climbed back up to $916,000, which gave it a  strong return on average assets of 0.92%. The return measures how profitably a  bank manages the assets at its disposal.  </P> <P> Regardless, it is questionable how long a small bank such as Antelope Valley  can remain independent. In 1991, non-California banks will be allowed to  purchase banks in the state, and in all other areas of the country where  interstate banking has been allowed, there has been a wave of consolidation.  The same figures to be true in California as banks from the East use mergers to  expand in California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Possibility  </P> <P> "Informally, we're looking at that as a possibility" for Antelope Valley,  Seefus said. "But we're not hoping it happens. If it happened, I would probably  turn around and start another independent community bank."  </P> <P> In the meantime, Seefus will be trying to drum up business on Sundays. Will the  major banks follow him? Larry Kurmel, executive director of the California  Bankers Assn., an industry trade group, doubts it.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's evidence of a trend there, or even demand" by customers  for Sunday hours industrywide, Kurmel said.  </P> <P> But in the Antelope Valley, at least, Seefus predicted that the banks  eventually will follow his lead. Noting that Antelope Valley Bank began  Saturday hours several years before the big banks latched onto the idea last  spring, he said, "Just give them six years."  </P></p>

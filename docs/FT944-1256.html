			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Berlusconi set to call early elections: Lira touches new low as uncertainty mounts ahead of confidence vote Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, is expected to press for an early election even if he survives a parliamentary confidence vote this week. The strategy of the embattled media magnate turned politician was outlined yesterday by Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the government spokesman and minister for parliamentary affairs. Mr Ferrara said the prime minister would have no option but to go to the country if the rightwing coalition was deserted - as has been threatened - by one of its members, the populist Northern League. The heightening political tension and uncertainty was reflected in financial markets yesterday, with the lira touching a new low of L1,050 against the D-Mark. Early elections would probably leave Italy with a caretaker government until May, given the minimum 60 days between the dissolution of parliament and an election, plus the subsequent formalities of forming a government. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader who has become Mr Berlusconi's chief adversary, has presented one no-confidence motion in conjunction with the Popular Party, the main centrist opposition party, for debate today. Another two no-confidence motions have been tabled by leftwing groups. However, yesterday Mr Ferrara indicated that Mr Berlusconi would try to seize the initiative by presenting a confidence motion of his own. The aim of this would be to show that the League had 'betrayed' the government at Mr Bossi's bidding. 'If the vote goes against the government in the confidence motion, then there would be no alternative but to seek early elections - and quickly,' Mr Ferrara said. By pushing for early elections, Mr Berlusconi believes he will be able to capitalise on his own popularity and discredit the League for changing sides. Control of the media will be central to such a plan, and Mr Berlusconi on Monday showed disregard for the normal rules of media access. He obliged state and his own television channels to run a party political broadcast that encouraged popular protest against the League. Mr Berlusconi is due to open the debate this afternoon, the 1995 budget having been finally approved by both houses of parliament. Unlike a no-confidence vote, a confidence motion can be proposed at any time. This could come at the end of a speech by Mr Berlusconi in which he is likely to offer his resignation if he fails to retain the current majority. 'The government will resign tomorrow. A long election campaign begins tomorrow,' predicted Mr Giuseppe Tatarella, deputy prime minister and the senior member of the far right National Alliance in the five-party government.

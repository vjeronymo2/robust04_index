			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Implementation of an Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter said there should be provisions for starting restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition activities while the damage assessment is still under way. The Department's regulations provide for implementation of emergency restorations in appropriate circumstances, generally limited to actions necessary to abate an emergency situation. 43 CFR 11.21. Other than for emergency restorations, starting restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition activities while damage assessment is underway, while not precluded, is not expressly discussed in the regulations. However, trustee officials may not expend funds received for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources prior to developing a Restoration Plan and making it available for public comment and review. 43 CFR 11.92(c); CERCLA sec. 111(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment process is designed, in part, to ensure that appropriate and efficient measures to accomplish restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources are adopted. Unless there is a compelling reason for early initiation of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition activities, the Department believes that the administrative process established under the regulations should be followed. This approach is similar to that provided under other existing legislation and regulation (e.g., NEPA and the Administrative Procedure Act) whereby there are general and specific constraints on taking certain actions or making irrevocable decisions or irretrievable commitments of resources prior to completion of appropriate planning and public involvement. However, if initiation of certain restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition actions would not constrain decisionmaking following completion of the assessment process, and if the public was given adequate opportunity to comment on the proposed actions consistent with CERCLA section 111(i), such actions could be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters have also sought clarification of 43 CFR 11.21 (b) and (c), which provide that a trustee official may undertake emergency restoration actions ``consistent with its existing authority.'' Existing 43 CFR 11.21 was developed in recognition of section 111(i) of CERCLA, which provides that trustee officials need not develop a restoration plan subject to public comment prior to taking emergency actions. The Department does not believe that section 111(i) of CERCLA provides trustee agencies with independent authority to take action they would not otherwise have authority to take. The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asked the Department to recognize the right of co-trustees to spend collected damages on implementation of different Restoration Plans. While the Department's regulations require trustee coordination and encourage joint development and implementation of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition actions, nothing in the regulations prohibits co-trustees from implementing different Restoration Plans. The Department solicits further comment on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters requested guidance on determining when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is complete. Some commenters suggested that trustee officials provide PRPs with a certification when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is essentially completed so that PRPs will not remain liable indefinitely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's regulations provide that the recovery period is the time until baseline conditions have been reestablished. 43 CFR 11.73(a), as amended by 59 FR 14283. It is up to the trustee officials, and in the case of settlements the joint agreement of the trustee officials and the PRPs, whether a site-specific definition of completeness should be included in the Restoration Plan. The Department has not considered it necessary to require trustee officials to provide PRPs with a certification when restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources is essentially completed. The extent of a PRP's continuing liability after damages have been recovered by the trustee officials depends on the terms of the judgment or settlement agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bonnie R.

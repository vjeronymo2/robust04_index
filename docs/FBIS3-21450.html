			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 29--A five-hour long meeting today  between the Union Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and  leaders of trade unions, including those from the banking  industry, failed to find a common ground to proceed with the  financial sector reforms. Despite an assurance from the Minister  that there would be no retrenchment, the unions stuck to their  threat of a country-wide bank strike on February 17.    While the Minister invited the unions to "join the  Government  to write a new chapter in the history of the Indian banking  system," the unions presented their own plan of action for  revamping it. They opposed any privatisation and protested  against the Government move to offload 49 per cent of bank  equity to the public.    The unions alleged that the current sickness in the banking  sector was the result of decision by authorities which had  allowed "unconcealed political use of banks and their  resources." They said three-fourths of the outstanding debts of  the banking sector were directly attributable to the corporate  sector. The Government, instead of taking corrective action, was  now planning to hand over the banks to the same private sector.    Punishment demanded: The union leaders demanded  that the default in repayment of bank loans be made a criminal  offence and that the names of the defaulters be published. The  official response was that ten tribunals would be set up shortly  to recover bad debts.    On his part, Dr. Singh emphasised the need for banking  reforms and sought the cooperation of the unions in making the  Indian banking system vibrant and efficient.    Referring to the apprehensions in the minds of workers about  the closure of bank branches, he said inevitable and necessary  changes had to be made, but the interest of the workers would be  protected. Some changes had to be made if India wanted to be a  major player in the global economy.    Dr. Singh stressed that the reform process set in motion  would create employment opportunities commensurate with the  rising expectations of the people. He also said the Government  wanted to have a standing mechanism for continuing the dialogue  with the trade unions so that there could be pooling of  knowledge and experience.    The Minister said while India had to evolve a banking  structure suited to the needs of the economy, it could not  ignore development in other countries either. While conditions  prevailing in Europe and the United States were very different,  India could study what countries in Asia were doing to modernise  their banking systems.    Concessions opposed: According to trade union  sources, during the discussion, the banking unions and central  trade union leaders opposed to the granting of unrestricted  concessions to foreign banks. The leaders made it clear that the  country required an effective and depoliticised banking system,  run on professional lines and not thoughtless implementation of  the Narasimham Committee report.    While agreeing with the Minister on the need for  restructuring the commercial banking sector, the unions  cautioned against any hasty move and suggested that the reforms  process be spread over a six or seven-year period. They also  argued for the setting up of an independent audit and vigilance  commission to look into the banking irregularities.    The union leaders suggested that the appointment of Chairmen  and other top executives be made through a high-power banking  service commission. They argued for setting up of an overseas  banking corporation comprising all public sector banks abroad,  besides pleading for stringent and effective inspections of  banks to check irregularities and minimise corruption.    The meeting was attended by representatives of the National  Front of Trade Unions, Indian National Trade Union Congress,  All-India Trade Union Congress, National Labour Organisation,  Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, United Trade Union Centre (LS), Centre  for Indian Trade Unions, etc.    The bank unions included the National Organisation of Bank  Officers, Indian Bank Employees Federation, the All-India Bank  Officers Confederation, the All-India Bank Officers Association  and the National Confederation of Bank Employees.    From the official side, the Finance Minister was assisted by  the Finance Secretary, the Banking Secretary, the Insurance  Secretary and the Reserve Bank Governor, Dr. C. Rangarajan.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: MEPC falls to Pounds 53m MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, yesterday announced a 10.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 58.6m to Pounds 52.5m in the six months to end-March. The company surprised the City by not announcing a rights issue, although it insisted that its options on fund-raising remained open. 'The board has not made a decision,' said Mr James Tuckey, managing director. 'It doesn't rule out the possibility.' Many analysts believe that MEPC will join other large property companies in taking advantage of a revival in property share prices to issue new equity. The most recent example was Wednesday's announcement of a Pounds 132m rights issue by British Land, which has formed a partnership with the Quantum Fund run by Mr George Soros, the international financier, to invest in UK property. MEPC's shares slipped 5p to 443p, in line with a general decline in property share values, as investors took profits following a surge in prices on Wednesday. The company was cautiously optimistic about the market. 'My intuitive judgement says that the bottom has passed,' said Mr Tuckey. 'There are now some indications of new demand from occupiers beginning to emerge in pockets around the country. This, coupled with evidence of institutions returning to invest once again in property, provides the potential for a return to growth,' said Sir Christopher Benson, chairman. The decline in MEPC's interim profits stemmed from an increase in the cost of net finance from Pounds 45.7m to Pounds 52.5m. This resulted from a decline in interest capitalised for properties in the course of development from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 9.6m, along with lower interest income and continued high fixed interest rates on group debt. Group rental income increased from Pounds 158m to Pounds 165m. The overall vacancy rate fell from 8 per cent at the end of last year to 6.5 per cent. MEPC said that its cash flow had been supplemented by a reduction in capital spending coupled with property sales. Mr Tuckey said that the programme of property sales was likely to slow down, although MEPC would continue to dispose of properties that had limited growth prospects, particularly in central London. He said the company wished to increase its exposure to overseas property, particularly in the US and continental Europe. Earnings per share fell from 12.4p to 10.4p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 5.25p. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENURE AND 'DEADWOOD' AT UC  </P> <P> As a graduate student in the UC system and having served for nine months on a  tenure and promotions committee at UC Irvine, I find Miles' argument both  misleading and wrongheaded. First, he gives no supporting evidence for the  "distressingly large" number of tenured deadwood in the system, something that  in my experience with the actual promotions committee caseload was very rare.  </P> <P> For what I found to be the few tenured UC faculty who fit his image of  deadwood, Miles' promotes a wrong-headed vision of education by insisting that  UC system students be exposed to even more of their teaching. If these people  have so little regard for what academic life is about (they're thieves,  according to Miles), why should we want them to educate the finest students the  state of California has or can attract? In the hopes of punishing these few and  protecting California taxpayers, Miles would undermine the very thing he  rightly perceives a need for: "an explosion of demand for the kind of  high-quality university education the UC system manages to offer at a  relatively low price."  </P> <P> Miles is simply wrong about tenure and teaching in the UC system. Rather than a  form of early retirement, tenure is an investment in intellectual work that is  carefully made during a usually rigorous process of review. If there are  disruptions in the quantity of publications after tenure (Miles eschews  quality, something the actual review process considers carefully) it could be  the professor is taking intellectual risks by trying to push her and our  understanding of a field beyond its current boundaries. While time is often  money from a budgetary point of view, time is not the equivalent of effective  teaching in practice.  </P> <P> Rather than punish a poor research record with forced teaching, why not change  the tenure and promotion process in the UC system so that exceptional teaching  is more directly rewarded?  </P> <P> ROGERS HALL  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

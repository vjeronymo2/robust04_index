			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- Following President Nursultan  Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who last week suggested creating a  Euro-Asian Union which would include CIS countries which would  opt to join it, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, known  under the Russian acronym PRES, on Saturday issued a statement  suggesting that a confederative union of Euro-Asian states be  established.    "Not only the peoples but also many political forces in CIS  countries are prepared not just to discuss the idea of creating  such a union but also to tackle specific matters concerning its  functioning," said the statement signed by PRES leader Sergey  Shakhray.    The PRES suggests setting up an international working group  to elaborate the text of a confederative agreement. The party  has stated that it "takes upon itself to provide organisational  and financial support for such a group's activities".</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND BRUINS NEEDED MORE OF EVERYTHING  </P> <P> Year in, year out, win or lose, Terry Donahue coaches a brand of football best  described as ho-hum.  </P> <P> Along with my bifocals and my rocking chair and my lap blanket, I have fond  memories of the most exciting football I ever saw, coached by those unique  masters -- Tommy Prothro and Red Sanders.  </P> <P> What terrific leaders. Tricky devils with strange, detached senses of humor,  they got the most out of their troops with flair, intelligence and imagination.  </P> <P> Nowadays, down at the Rose Bowl, we see computerized clones going through the  motions designed by those with furrowed foreheads. They are worrywarts, fueled  by fear, who long ago lost touch with the essence of the game.  </P> <P> Ah, give me back my gutty little Bruins of yore.  </P> <P> MARSHALL HUTCHASON, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITION CLAIMS WIDE LEAD IN MYANMAR ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Voters in Myanmar (formerly Burma) turned the country's first elections in 30  years into a show of defiance against the military government Sunday, and the  opposition said it was heading for a landslide victory.  </P> <P> State radio, announcing the first result in the National Assembly elections,  said the National League for Democracy won at least one district in Yangon, the  capital, with 80% of the vote.  </P> <P> League candidates said the issue now is whether the military junta, which  assumed power after soldiers crushed a pro-democracy uprising in September,  1988, will step down.  </P> <P> Myanmar's 20 million voters turned out in large numbers. No conclusive results  are expected for several days.  </P> <P> The campaign was marked by restrictions and harassment. Several opposition  leaders were detained and banned from running.  </P></p>

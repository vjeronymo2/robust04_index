			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook Properties in dispute over restructuring ETONBROOK Properties, the former Business Expansion Scheme company which came to the market last year, yesterday launched a sharp attack on one of its shareholders as it prepared for an acrimonious extraordinary meeting next month. Mr Jonathan Harris, chairman, accused Multitrust of attempting to take over Etonbrook through the back door, by opposing the company's plans for a capital restructuring. 'If someone wishes to buy Etonbrook, make a bid,' he said, and added that the group's plans for a capital restructuring were part of a controlled liquidation to return value to shareholders. Etonbrook, which recently sold one of its three remaining properties for Pounds 1m, plans to pay shareholders 25p per share and a 2.7p dividend as a result of the sale. However, it cannot pay the ordinary dividend until it meets its convertible redeemable preference share obligations, which fell due on April 1. Since the group has no distributable reserves, Mr Harris wants to restructure the share capital to provide the money to pay preference and ordinary dividends. Etonbrook has already set aside the Pounds 1.2m necessary to redeem the shares. The restructuring will be put to the vote at the EGM on August 7. Multitrust has has been campaigning against the board's strategy, but Mr Andrew Perloff, chairman, was unavailable for comment yesterday.</p>

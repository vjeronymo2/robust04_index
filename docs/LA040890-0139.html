			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES FOR TUSTIN'S CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> Can Tustin believe anything Councilman John Kelly says? Kelly told the American  Assn. of University Women that he would attend a candidates forum on March 27.  He canceled at the last minute.  </P> <P> He also confirmed his attendance for the April 3 forum sponsored by the Tustin  Meadows Community Assn. The confirmation was made to their management company.  On April 2, at the Tustin City Council Meeting when Kelly was confronted with  some alleged actions involving misuse of his position, he struck back with a  comment that he would be at the Tustin Meadows forum the following night and he  could be asked those questions there. Again he didn't show!  </P> <P> On how many other issues has Kelly not done what he said? Can the citizens of  Tustin tolerate another four years of saying one thing and doing another? His  campaign signs and ads say "Honest" John Kelly. He even used President Abraham  Lincoln's picture and quote in one of his ads. John, Honest Abe you are not.  </P> <P> FABIE KAY COMBS  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

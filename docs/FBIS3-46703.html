Prior to this, the Christian figures from the North and  South  met in Beijing last November and agreed in principle to hold  exchanges. Thereupon, Kwon Ho-kyong, director of the Korean  Council of Christian Churches, plans to discuss with North Korea  the issue of North Korean Christian figures attending the  general meeting of the Korean Council of Christian Churches  slated for 21 February in Seoul and other religious events.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Paramount agrees to open talks with QVC Network DIRECTORS of Paramount Communications, the besieged US entertainment group, yesterday bowed to mounting pressure and agreed to open informal talks with QVC Network, the home shopping channel that has mounted a hostile bid for the group. It said issues to be discussed would include any regulatory restraints, the value of QVC stock, and 'the certainty and time frame of the transaction being consummated'. Paramount stressed that it still intended to proceed with an agreed cash-and-shares offer by Viacom, the cable television company, valuing it at Dollars 7.3bn. However, Paramount's directors have had to recognise that QVC's hostile cash-and-shares offer, worth Dollars 9.5bn, is not only worth Dollars 2.2bn more than the friendly Viacom bid, but also includes Dollars 30 worth of cash for each Paramount share, compared with just Dollars 9.10 worth of cash in the Viacom offer. QVC, though a fast-growing company, is much smaller than either Paramount or Viacom, and Paramount has questioned whether the company has the financial muscle to raise the Dollars 3.5bn necessary to fund the cash portion of its offer. Last week, however, QVC said it had secured funding of Dollars 4bn for its bid: two Dollars 500m equity investments from Liberty Media and Comcast, cable companies which are shareholders in QVC, and promises of Dollars 500m each from six banks. Separately, Liberty Media's former parent, Tele-Communications Inc, announced that it was in talks with Liberty over a possible buy-back of the company - a move that would put another large and well-financed company on QVC's side, since Liberty holds 22.5 per cent of QVC's stock. Viacom yesterday attempted to shrug off the latest development. It said Paramount's decision to hold talks with QVC was 'consistent with our merger agreement and with the board's responsibilities'. It said the talks would also give Paramount an opportunity to address the anti-trust issues it alleges have been raised by the QVC offer. Viacom, which has garnered a war chest of almost Dollars 2bn with which it could increase its bid through alliances with Nynex, a regional telephone company, and Blockbuster Entertainment, the video retailer, is expected to stay its hand pending the outcome of the Paramount/QVC talks. Shares in QVC were down Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 56 1/4 yesterday, valuing its bid at just under Dollars 80 1/4 a share. Viacom's A shares were up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 56 1/2 and its B shares were up Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 52 5/8, valuing its bid at just over Dollars 62. Paramount's shares were up Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 76 7/8.</p>

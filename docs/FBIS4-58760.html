			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--In a statement here today, Dr.  Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, stressed the importance of implementing the Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on time and as stipulated in  the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remark  yesterday that 'Arafat has asked for a period of four weeks  until the withdrawal and the deployment of the Palestinian  police force take place, Sha'th said that President 'Arafat  asked Rabin for the withdrawal to first be effected on time in  accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement and according to the  designated timetable to avoid any gap in time between the  Israeli withdrawal and the entry of the Palestinian police force.    In his statement, Dr. Sha'th said that the period requested  by 'Arafat is the same period specified in the Gaza-Jericho  agreement. He said there are rumors that the withdrawal might be  implemented within a day or two from the signing of the  agreement. But 'Arafat asked that the withdrawal be effected  according to the specified timetable so that they would be no  time gap between the withdrawal and the entry of the Palestinian  police force.    Dr. Sha'th's remarks were made during a news conference held  by representatives of countries giving donations to the  Palestinian police force following their meeting in Cairo today.    To a question about the funds to be given to the Palestinian  police force in the self-rule regions by the donor countries,  the Palestinian president's adviser said these funds will come  from the European countries through a coordination institution.  All these funds will be deposited in a private account in  support of the Palestinian police, Dr. Sha'th added. He  affirmed that there will be no custodianship on such funds.    Continuing, Dr. Sha'th noted that the PLO will be in  complete  control of these funds, adding that the PLO undertook to present  clear accounts to the donor countries through an international  institution in Cairo which will audit the accounts according to  the international regulations.    Dr. Sha'th said that Saudi Arabia has indeed declared that  it  will pay US$20 million through the United Nations Relief and  Works Agency [UNRWA] for economic development projects in Gaza  and Jericho. Saudi aircraft will transport the Palestinian  police force from six Arab countries to Gaza and Jericho, he  added.    Dr. Sha'th said that the PLO will submit a list to Israeli  Prime Minister Rabin containing the names of officials who will  be in charge of various administrations in Gaza and Jericho in  accordance with the agreement, which also notes that the names  should be submitted a week after the signing of the agreement  yesterday.    Dr. Sha'th pointed out that there are 6,000 Palestinian  employees currently working in the civil administration  [al-idarah al-madaniyah] in the Gaza Strip and these will become  part of the self-administration [idarat al-hukm al-dhati].  Therefore, the self-administration will not start from a vacuum.    The Palestinian president's adviser said that negotiations  will be held in Cairo within a week over certain points which  were not resolved during the 'Arafat-Rabin meeting. He said  that a round of negotiations will also be held for the election  of the Palestinian National Authority.    As regards the negotiations over the transition period, Dr.  Sha'th said these are slated to be held in Washington. However,  he said that if the Arab-Israeli bilateral talks are not resumed  in Washington soon, then the negotiations for the transition  period will be held in Cairo.    Dr. Sha'th noted that the first  Egyptian-Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli meeting will be held  within a month to discuss the return of refugees to Gaza and  Jericho according to the agreement.    Terry Larsen, Norwegian deputy foreign minister and  chairman of the donor countries coordination committee, said  that the United States, Japan, and the EU have donated $20  million to cover the expenses of the Palestinian police for six  months and that Saudi Arabia has promised to provide the  Palestinian police with electronic equipment worth $1 million.    He said that a number of Palestinian detainees will be freed  from Israeli prisons today and more will be released next week.    Larsen said at the start of the conference that today's  meeting discussed what has been achieved and the outcome of the  tours made by delegations from the committee member countries to  a number of donor countries last month. He added that a large  number of countries have decided to extend financial support to  the Palestinian police to help it carry out its duties.    Edmond Hal, U.S. charge d'affaires in Cairo and his  country's  representative on the committee, said that the United States  believes that the Palestinian police force will be an element of  support in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He  called on all the donor countries to honor their pledges so that  the Palestinian police can preform their duties.    The Russian Federation representative said that the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreements is the important  thing now so that it will have a practical and positive effect  on the entire peace process. He added that one of the  coordination committee's objectives is to help the Palestinian  police perform their duties and control the situation in Gaza  and Jericho, stressing that his country is ready to help these  forces.    On his part, Egypt's representative, Ambassador Husayn  Darar,  said that Egypt helped prepare the Palestinian police while  participating in the negotiations process so that these forces  would be ready to enter the self-rule area. He expressed  pleasure at hosting the committee's work in Cairo, stressing  that Egypt provided all the facilities for ensuring the success  of its work.    It is recalled that Norway, the United States and Russia --  the co-sponsors of the peace conference -- and Egypt chair the  committee coordinating international aid to the Palestinian  police. The committee also includes Japan, the EU countries,  and a number of financial insitutions.</p>

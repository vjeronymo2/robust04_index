			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with &sect;430.27 of 10 CFR part 430, on April 8, 1993, Asko filed a Petition for Waiver regarding its clothes washer models 10504, 12004, and 20004, with the following design features that differ from those covered by the existing clothes washer test procedure: An internal electrical heater for heating wash water; a continuously variable wash water temperature control; 208/240 volt electrical power supply; and machine-controlled water fill capability. On April 26, 1993, Asko filed an Application for Interim Waiver and on May 11, 1993, Asko subsequently submitted an amendment to the Application for Interim Waiver upon DOE's request for additional information to allow the Department to make its determination of the economic hardship and/or competitive disadvantage likely to result if DOE fails to grant the Application for Interim Waiver. On September 7, 1993, the Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Asko petition and solicited comments, data, and information respecting the petition and granted the requested Interim Waiver in its entirety (58 FR 47130).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received from the Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool) and Speed Queen Company (Speed Queen). All comments received were sent to Asko for its rebuttal. The Department consulted with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Asko petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of a waiver to Asko.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Assertions and Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Asko's petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test procedure that is based on an external water heating source. Instead, Asko requests the allowance to test its clothes washer models 10504, 12004, and 20004 using an internal heater which heats the cold inlet water supplied for washing. Since the nature of a water-heating clothes washer is significantly different from a nonwater-heating clothes washer, several issues have developed and have been commented on.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing test procedure for non-water-heating clothes washers uses inlet water at ``100 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F'' and requires a temperature rise calculation based on water volume which assumes a hot wash temperature of 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). Thus, the calculation for the warm wash temperature is presumed to be set at 100 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (37.8 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) which is obtained from assumed equal amounts of hot and cold water being mixed in the clothes washer. For clothes washers equipped with thermostatically controlled inlet water valves the hot water inlet temperature is set to ``140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F'' and the cold water inlet temperature is set to ``60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asko originally proposed testing its clothes washers utilizing four equally weighted tests. Asko proposed that two of the tests be conducted at 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) (one for maximum fill and one for minimum fill) and the remaining two tests be conducted at 68 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (20 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) (one for maximum fill and one for minimum fill). The Department did not concur with this proposal and issued an Interim Waiver with test requirements which were more representative of the existing test procedure. The Interim Waiver required testing at three temperature settings (hot_140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C), warm_100 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (38 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C and cold_60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (16 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C)) for maximum and minimum fill conditions. The results of the temperature setting tests were prorated using the existing test procedure Temperature Use Factors for a three temperature selection machine. The combined results for maximum and minimum fill were prorated using the existing test procedure values. Whirlpool and Speed Queen raised concern about the Asko's machines having the capability of heating water higher than 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). The concern is that some consumers will choose a temperature that is higher than 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) and therefore use more energy than the test would predict. The Department agrees with this concern. However, the Department also realizes that with Asko's variable temperature capability that some consumers may choose to utilize a ``hot'' temperature setting that is lower than 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). Furthermore, Proctor and Gamble market survey data for 1975 and 1988/89 reveal that consumers' preferences have changed over the 13 years to use cold washes more frequently. Therefore, the Department has decided that the test for water-heating clothes washers will be based on the following to reflect the comments received and to be as consistent as possible with the current test procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s100,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Temperature setting <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Percentage of use <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Hottest possible on machine  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 140 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (60 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C)  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (38 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C)  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coldest possible on machine  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, the Department, by deciding to test the water-heating clothes washers at their respective, hottest and coldest, settings, will enable the test procedure to be generic for various clothes washers. For example, if a particular clothes washer's coldest setting actually demands heat above the specified inlet water temperature, then the energy for this will be considered. Whereas, if a particular clothes washer's coldest setting prevents any water heating, then there would not be any energy used to heat the wash water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

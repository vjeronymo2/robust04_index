			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Brief commentary" by station commentator Mulatov from the </F> "Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" program]    [Text] The seven agreements between Russia and China  signed during the Russian delegation's visit will strengthen and  continue the equal and mutually beneficial cooperation achieved  over the last few years in economics, trade, science and  technology, and other fields. Setting their sights on the  future [words indistinct] the two countries have decided to  raise the neighborly and friendly relations between them to a  new level of development -- says a report on the outcome of  [words indistinct] visit to China. The document, which sums up  the outcome of the visit, also says the two countries will take  full advantage of their geographical closeness and make full use  of the complementariness between the two countries' economies.  Both Moscow and Beijing understand that the neighborly and  friendly relations and the mutually beneficial cooperation  between them are in line with the fundamental interests of the  two countries and their peoples and are an important factor for  preserving peace and stability and for ensuring development in  the Asia-Pacific region as well as in the whole world. We also  like to point out that the Russian delegation's visit to China  was widely reported in detail by the media of Eastern and  Western countires. At the beginning, some Western media doubted  that Russia might have an intention to develop bilateral  military technology cooperation with China. Such cooperation  will be developed under the condition that the two countries  fulfill their international obligations -- this should not cause  anyone to be suspicions.    During the talks, the two sides stressed the importance of  reaching an agreement on taking measures as soon as possible to  reduce their troops and armament and military trainings in  disputed areas. They believed this will not only enhance mutual  trust and understanding between the two countries, but also will  contribute to preserving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific  region.    During their talks, Chernomyrdin and Li Peng also discussed  international issues of common interest. The two countries'  identical and similar stands on some major international issues  were confirmed. This will be the foundation for the two  countries to strengthen their constructive cooperation in  regional and world affairs.    In short, the dialogue between the two governments has  yielded good results. Currently, the two sides are preparing  for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia. The two  countries believe that positive dialogues at all levels,  including the highest level, are prerequisites for promoting  neighborly and friendly relations and mutually beneficial  cooperation between them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang has sharply  criticized Seoul for the rupture of inter-Korean talks on  exchanging special envoys, saying the South would face "a curse  and collapse for driving the state of affairs into a war  situation."    In a statement issued Monday [21 March] on the breakdown of  the eighth round of working-level talks at the weekend, the  North Korean delegation said it had done everything possible to  ensure the negotiations' success since offering to exchange  special envoys last may, radio Pyongyang reported.    But the South hindered the cross-visits by erecting  artificial barriers and the proposed exchange "now faces a grave  crisis," the report quoted the statement as saying.    "While the dialogue was under way, the South took reckless  actions threatening its dialogue partner, such as the  maintenance of international cooperation (in dealing with the  North Korean nuclear issue), war games including the Team Spirit  military exercise with the United States and an attempt to  deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles."    On the hard-line measures being considered by Seoul after  the  breakdown of inter-Korean dialogue, the statement called them  "de facto declarations on destroying and renouncing the special  envoy exchange and on an all-out confrontation."    It went on to say, "the measures have revealed the South's  hidden schemes to make use of the inter-Korean dialogue in  applying a brake to the North Korea-U.S. talks and to cease  relations with the North, while driving the North-South  relationship into a situation of confrontation and war."    "We will take note of the chief South Korean delegate's  public statement that the South will no longer talk with the  North," it added.</p>

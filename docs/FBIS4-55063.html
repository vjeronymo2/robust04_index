			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosniak and Croatian delegations have continued  talks in Vienna on the implementation of the Constitution of the  Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most attention today was  devoted to the borders between cantons and the number of cantons  within the federation. Our special correspondent, Amir Hodzic,  reports from Vienna:    [Begin Hodzic recording] Stands have so far been coordinated  on the canton of Foca with a majority Croatian population and  [word indistinct] of two cantons in central Bosnia and the Lasva  Valley. There have been a few disputes about the status of  Gornji Vakuf, that is, individual districts in the outskirts of  the commune's territory. Views about the cantonal setup of  Herzegovina are somewhat different. Our delegation is of the  opinion that the commune of Stolac with (?Dubrava) Plateau and  the region along the left side of the Neretva River should be a  canton with the Bosniak-Muslim majority population because it  has an absolute majority of 55 percent of Bosniak people. For  this reason, as well as for the reasons of tradition, geography,  economy, communications, and other reasons it should be a  special cantonal entity.    The Croatian delegation, however, offers one canton that  would have an ethnic [word indistinct] with a majority Croatian  population, its borders would be drawn at the foot of the  Jablanica Mountain, along the Neretva Valley, and it would  encompass the whole of the Stolac Commune. As a major,  principled question is involved here, participants in the talks  will focus their attention on it in the afternoon as well so  that a realistic agreement can be reached at the end.

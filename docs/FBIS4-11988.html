			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali </F> by Sa'd al-Silawi in Amman -- date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Silawi] What does Jordan's  decision to link its participation in the negotiations to the  halting of inspections at the al-'Aqabah Port mean?    [Al-Majali] For over three years, the al-'Aqabah Port has  been subjected to inspections. Jordan has been under siege.  From time to time, there is a noticeable increase in the  pressure being applied against Jordan. This has had a severe  effect on the economic situation in the country. Unable to  reach Jordan because of the harassments that take place, a large  number of shipping companies stopped dealing with Jordan.  Besides, the conditions that have been set regarding the  arrangement of shipped cargoes and their quantities have led to  an increase in insurance premiums, fees, and the cost of living  in Jordan. Some cargoes have even been lost or unloaded at  other ports. Their owners could not find them. All this has  led to an inconvenient situation. In addition, we are suffering  from a major restraint imposed on exports to Iraq, especially  basic supplies. Of course, food and medicine are allowed, but  there are complications. Other human supplies also face many  complications. This has affected the Jordanian economy, which  has for a long time been built on the basis that it is a main  exporter to Iraq. When the Gulf war broke out, the blockade  started. The Jordanian economy has been negatively affected.  Under these circumstances and the extremely negative effect on  the Jordanian economy, how can we go and negotiate within the  peace process? The negotiator must feel comfortable and must  have the feeling that peace brings benefits to everyone.  Moreover, we have the feeling that many parties in Jordan feel  and explicitly say that all these measures are aimed at twisting  Jordan's arm and forcing it into a certain course of  negotiations. We want this matter resolved, especially since  all the inspections have not spotted a single violation.    [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, has the decision been  coordinated with the other Arab parties to the peace conference?    [Al-Majali] Among other states, Jordan is the only state  that  has been subjected to a blockade. Our's is a Jordanian  decision. But the brothers have been in the picture. They have  found this to be one of Jordan's rights.    [Al-Silawi] Therefore, the decision was made through  coordination with the brothers in Syria, Egypt, and the PLO?    [Al-Majali] I cannot say so. But in view of our constant  coordination, our brothers in Syria have been contacted.    [Al-Silawi] The United States says that there are  discussions  and proposals concerning ship inspections. What are these  proposals? Will the Jordanian Government respond to them?    [Al-Majali] First, I would like to emphasize that we hide  nothing. We are a committed and credible state. When we say  that we import nothing that violates the UN resolutions, we mean  that. But they insist on inspection. Therefore, we proposed  several verification methods, including the hiring of an  international firm, such as Lloyds Register, so that it would  send representatives to al-'Aqabah, where they can monitor  traffic and send their observations and reports to the United  Nations directly. This proposal was made three months ago. As  we understood, those concerned have approved the proposal. But  so far, nothing has happened. On the contrary, strangely  enough, the number of ships that have been inspected or  intercepted this year is nearly equal to the number of all ships  that have been inspected in the past years.    [Al-Silawi] But is there a specific commitment or  guarantees concerning the international organization's  resolutions on Iraq?    [Al-Majali] Of course, we are committed. We are a UN member  country. We respect and implement its resolutions. This is a  moral commitment. The picture should be clear. How can we not  be committed to an organization in which we are a member?    [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, can you give us the losses  in  figures resulting from the inspection operations?    [Al-Majali] These losses range from $300 to $400 million a  year. Total losses so far have reached $1.3 billion. For the  Jordanian economy, this is a very sizable loss.    [Al-Silawi] Reports in the Israeli press say there is a  project to widen the Jordan River to benefit from its waters,  and that Jordanian firms will carry out this operation. Is this  true? What do you have to say about this?    [Al-Majali] I do not have any information on this. This is  the first time I've heard of such a thing. However, from a  quick review of the issue, I do not see any justification for  this. What little what there is in the Jordan River is  mineralized. The Israeli authorities are pumping this mineral  water to purify the Tiberias Lake waters.    [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, as journalists we feel that  there is a missing link. Sometimes, we cannot understand what  the government wants. For example, when we speak about the  issue of Jerusalem, we do not know how to translate the state's  stand on the Jerusalem issue. What are the terms of reference?  We understand that only God's authority should prevail at holy  places. So far, we do not understand what the government wants.  What are the state's policies on these issues? There is a  missing link.    [Al-Majali] There is no missing link. The problem is that  journalists do not carry out indepth studies. They do not come  to us about these issues. But, since you have asked this  question, I will answer you: When his majesty the king says  that sovereignty over Jerusalem and the holy places belongs only  to God, this is clear. He does not say sovereignty belongs to  him, but to God. The Islamic quarters should meet and study how  to achieve this, that is, sovereignty is not for Israel, which  in its religious books and propaganda says Jerusalen belongs to  it and that it enjoys sovereignty over it. When we say to the  world at large that sovereignty belongs to God almighty, this is  to emphasize that sovereignty does not belong to Israel but to  god, and that we have to sit down and discuss this issue.    One other thing we should not forget is that Jerusalem  falls under the 1947 partition. The city and its environs are  areas that were given to an international administration that  did not materialize. Israel occupied the western part. There  was the Jordanian presence in the eastern part. There were two  parts. Western policies see it as a unified city. Most  countries still do not recognize Israel's sovereignty over the  occupied eastern part of Jerusalem. That's why these countries,  including the United States, have no embassies there.    [Al-Silawi] Jordan has asked for a clarification from the  United States concerning Resolution 904. Tnis resolution is  crucial if we realize that the U.S. Congress, which is  controlled by the Democrats, had in the past asked that  Jerusalem be the capital of Israel.    [Al-Majali] The United States did not recognize Jerusalem as  Israel's capital. Even so, President Bill Clinton said during  the election campaign that he would transfer the embassy from  Tel Aviv to Jerusalem if it did not constitute an obstacle to  peace. The fact is, this is an obstacle to peace. This is  something we should know.    [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, are there Jordanian-U.S.  contacts on this resolution?    [Al-Majali] Contacts on this resolution and others are under  way. His majesty the king's intervention was very clear that  the United States should not veto this resolution. This also  should be taken into consideration.    [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, this issue might have  created  a disagreement between the PLO and Jordan.    [Al-Majali] The brothers in the PLO placed the issue of  Jerusalem in the resolution with good intentions. They believe  Jerusalem should be Arab. We also believe it should be Arab.  But, the question is when to raise such an issue and in which  resolution. This is our viewpoint. It was feared that the  manner with which it was introduced would lead to removing it.  Thus, things would become worse, or it would have been vetoed.  This would have been very bad. The safest and the less damaging  stand was that the United States abstained on the paragraph on  Jerusalem. But, the resolution as a whole was adopted by the UN  Security Council members. The deliberations took place and  there was success. However, we do not wish to place the issue  of Jerusalem where it could be affected. [passage omitted]</p>

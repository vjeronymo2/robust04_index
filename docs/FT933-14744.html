			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / People: Jim Wadia to become new managing partner for Arthur Andersen Jim Wadia is to become managing partner of Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth largest accountancy firm, in succession to Roy Chapman. Chapman, 56, is retiring following completion of his four-year term as managing partner for the UK. He will leave at the end of the year after a four-month transition period. Wadia, 45, whose appointment was ratified by a vote of the UK partners after internal consultation, has spent his career working on tax matters. Currently deputy managing partner, he takes on the new role on September 1 at the start of Andersen's fiscal year. Chapman became managing partner of the London office in 1984, and has been managing partner of the UK firm since 1989. He has served on the worldwide board of partners since 1988 and is chairman of its remuneration committee. He says he had long planned to retire in his mid-50s, and that it is standard practice to step down from major responsibilities at this age. He stresses that he is retiring, and intends to travel and pursue leisure interests for the first few months. After that, he says he may consider becoming a non-executive director.</p>

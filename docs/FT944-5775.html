			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein talks to start next week: Offer to negotiate comes three months after IRA ceasefire The government is to begin talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in five days' time on December 7. The move will start an important phase of the Northern Ireland peace process. The announcement - made in a letter to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, from a senior Downing Street official - came three months to the day after the IRA's ceasefire. Decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals will be top of the agenda in the talks, which are intended to start bringing Sinn Fein into the political mainstream. The Sinn Fein team is to be led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president in the organisation. Mr Quentin Thomas, the Number Two civil servant in the Northern Ireland Office, will lead the government's team. The talks will be held in Belfast, probably at Stormont. Yesterday's announcement of an earlier-than-expected date for the talks came as the government appeared to bow to US pressure over whether Sinn Fein members would be invited to an important Belfast investment conference this month. Several US institutions and corporations had threatened to boycott the conference unless Sinn Fein was included. They included Mr Alan Hevesi, New York City controller, who earlier this year signalled a plan to channel institutional funds towards Ulster in the form of 'Irish peace bonds', and Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped to co-ordinate private investor interest in Ulster. Congressional supporters of the Irish Republicans urged the US administration not to allow Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, to attend the conference unless the British government invited Mr Adams. Yesterday the government said a handful of Sinn Fein councillors would after all be invited in their capacity as members of two local council committees. The decision is thought to have had an important bearing on the starting date of preliminary talks with Sinn Fein, in effect entailing that they had to get under way before the conference on December 13 and 14. Ulster Unionists and some senior Conservatives were under the impression until very recently that the talks would begin only just before Christmas. Reaction to yesterday's announcement was mixed. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the decision to hold talks with the 'men of blood' was 'highly resented'. But the move was welcomed by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Adams also responded positively: 'The opportunity to realise a lasting peace which will benefit all of the people of Ireland has never been greater.' In Washington, President Bill Clinton welcomed the announcement, saying that a just and lasting settlement in Northern Ireland was 'finally within reach'. Separately, he announced the appointment of Senator George Mitchell, the retiring leader of the Democratic Senate majority, to be his special adviser on Ulster economic initiatives. The Commerce Department said Mr Brown definitely planned to attend the conference. Mr Mitchell will consider attending. The issue became entangled with negotiations over Mr Adams's visit to Washington next week. Although the British government has not sought to dissuade the US from granting Mr Adams another visa, it has argued successfully that he must still not be allowed to raise funds in the US.

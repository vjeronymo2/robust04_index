			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cross-Channel bootlegging racket: plus ca change . . . Sir, Your report, 'Three bootleggers jailed for cross-Channel racket' (May 28/29), calls to mind the following passages in a letter sent by Tobias Smollett from Boulogne in September 1763: 'The shopkeepers here drive a considerable traffic with the English smugglers, whose cutters are almost the only vessels one sees in the harbour of Boulogne. 'The smugglers from the coast of Kent and Sussex pay English gold for great quantities of French brandy, tea, coffee and small wine, which they run from this country. 'The custom-house officers are very watchful, and make a great number of seizures; nevertheless the smugglers . . . are said to indemnify themselves if they save one cargo out of three. 'After all, the best way to prevent smuggling is to lower the duties upon the commodities which are thus introduced. I have been told that the revenue upon tea has increased since the duty upon it was diminished.' Raymond Nottage, 36E Arkwright Road, Hampstead, London, NW3 6BH</p>

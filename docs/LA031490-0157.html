			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CASTRO VOWS FIRM STANCE AGAINST URGINGS TO CHANGE  </P> <P> Fidel Castro, on the eve of a trip to Brazil that he said will show Cuba is not  isolated despite the changes sweeping his Communist allies, vowed that foreign  leaders will never sway him to make concessions.  </P> <P> Castro told a rally of thousands of students in Havana late Tuesday that he  knows that while he is in Brazil Thursday for the presidential inauguration of  Fernando Collor de Mello, other foreign leaders will have plenty of advice for  him.  </P> <P> "I know what it will be in advance, I know it by heart," he said.  </P> <P> Castro, who has led Cuba for 31 years, said he expects that some other leaders  will tell him that he should "behave himself, be a good boy, make concessions."  </P> <P> "Should we make concessions?" he asked the crowd, estimated by organizers at  more than 40,000.  </P> <P> "No," they roared.  </P> <P> "Never, that's the word, never," Castro said. "No revolution that ever makes  concessions can save itself."  </P> <P> Castro said his trip to Brazil would show that Cuba is not becoming  internationally isolated despite the changes sweeping out communism in Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> "We have to show the imperialists that we're not in the least bit frightened of  them," he said.  </P> <P> Castro has defiantly rejected the Western-leaning reforms being embraced in  Eastern Europe and insists Cuba will never abandon its one-party Communist  system.  </P> <P> "We know what a revolution is, what a revolution does," said Castro, who has  ruled the Caribbean island since leading the 1959 popular revolution that  toppled right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista.  </P> <P> The Cuban leader added he will discuss with the other leaders in Brazil issues  such as the problem of Latin American debt and what he called the unequal  economic relations between rich and poor nations.  </P> <P> The Havana rally was held to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of an attempt in  1957 by a group of revolutionary students to kill Batista at his presidential  palace.  </P></p>

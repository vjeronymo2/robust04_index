Speaking at a news conference in Aydin, Mentese noted that  the backbone of the separatist organization has been broken in  the struggle waged against terror and added:    The government had to take certain measures regarding  various  developments in the country. As a matter of fact, we have  managed to break the backbone of the separatist organization  through the measures we have taken.    The necessary measures have been taken throughout the  country  to ensure that the 27 March elections are held in a secure  atmosphere. These measures are also valid for the Nevruz holiday  celebrations to be held on 21 March. We are sending some  150,000 troops to the southeastern Anatolian region to ensure  security during the elections.    Mentese said that the leader of the separatist organization,  Ocalan, has been exerting efforts beyond belief to sit at the  negotiating table within a political framework with the Turkish  Republic in a bid to keep his name and his organization on the  world agenda and added: He will, however, never be able to  realize this because we are rejecting this proposal which is  tantamount to harming democracy.    Mentese concluded by saying that a draft bill is being  prepared that will regulate the passage through the Bosporus of  tankers carrying dangerous cargo.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow pressured by poor economic data Wall Street US STOCK markets ended one of their worst weeks of the year with further losses as news of a big fall in durable goods orders and rising bond yields undermined sentiment, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.40 at 3,413.77. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished fell 2.39 to 437.03, while the Amex composite ended 0.60 lower at 418.73, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.10 to 658.41. Trading volume on the NYSE was 257m shares. Prices opened lower, dropping more than 20 points in the first 90 minutes as sentiment was pressured by selling in the futures market and by bad economic news. The commerce department reported that durable goods orders fell 3.7 per cent in March. Even accounting for the impact on orders of the severe March winter storms, the decline, the biggest in 15 months, was much bigger than expected. Analysts had forecast a decline of about 0.5 per cent. The disappointing durable goods figures followed a string of weak data (including retail sales, industrial production and employment numbers) which suggest that the economy has been cooling off lately. The markets were also undermined by two other factors: trading activity in the stock index futures market, where S&amp;P 500 futures were at a discount to the price of the stocks underlying the index (a bad omen for the cash markets); and bond yields, which rose yesterday despite the durable goods news. The losses meant that share prices fell on every day of the week - the first time that has happened this year. American Express rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 29 1/4 in volume of 2.2m shares after the troubled financial services and travel group announced stronger than expected first quarter operating earnings of 75 cents a share. Investors were pleased by the improved performance of its credit card and investment banking operations. Bank stocks, which have been riding high all year in anticipation of improved profitability, continue to suffer as investors took profits and expressed concern about the earnings outlook. Chemical fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 7/8 , Chase Manhattan eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 , Citicorp dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 , Banc One gave up Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 54 3/4 and Bank America fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 . Canada TORONTO STOCKS ended the week on a winning note, boosted by a surge in gold stocks. Based to preliminary data, the 300 composite index was up 19.71 points, or 0.54 per cent, to 3,685.42, for a gain on the week of about 33 points. Gold Mines gained 1/2 to 9 1/2 after reporting higher first-quarter earnings. Lac Minerals and Teck Corp., which each reported lower first-quarter earnings, rose 5/8 to 10 and 1/4 to 17 7/8, respectively.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts On the surface, the money supply figures had a reassuring message for the gilts market. Overseas investors bought over Pounds 1bn in gilts in February, the largest monthly total for nearly two years. Yet it would be rash to assume that buying will be sustained at this level. February was remarkable in two ways: sterling fell to nearly DM2.30 and the gilts market was supported, particularly at the short end, by expectations of lower interest rates. The first made gilts attractive to those prepared to bet on the currency recovering from what appeared an abnormally low level. The second, which was probably a more significant influence, held out the promise of capital gain. Even investors worried about sterling falling further could hedge themselves by financing their holding at a profit with cheap short-term money. The main factor behind overseas purchases appears to have been such hedged buying by Japanese and US investors. On neither ground is the market so attractive now. Sterling has recovered, limiting the room for further currency profits. Talk of base rate cuts has faded. In the six months since sterling left the ERM, overseas investors have made net gilt purchases of only Pounds 600m, despite a 1.6 percentage point fall in 10-year yields. On the other hand, the political crisis in Italy and high real UK yields compared with those in Germany are now sparking some interest from the continent. And yesterday's other monetary data - promising moderate recovery without significant inflationary pressure  -should help underpin prices.</p>

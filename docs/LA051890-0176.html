			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE THREE RS: RIDIN', RUSTLIN' AND RHYMIN';  </P> <P> COWBOYS: IT'S POEM, POEM ON THE RANGE AS WESTERN POETS AND SINGERS MOSEY INTO  SUNDAY'S 30TH ANNUAL TOPANGA BANJO AND FIDDLE CONTEST.  </P> <P> Don't ever ask an old cowboy -- or a cowboy-at-heart -- too much about cowboy  poetry and song. He's apt to choke right up, like Lou Schubert. Or like Mike  Mahaney, who paused to collect himself while reciting a sample of the  deceptively spare verses of the anonymous cowboy classic, "Blood on the  Saddle":  </P> <P>  There was blood on the saddle  </P> <P>  There was blood on the ground  </P> <P>  And a great big puddle of blood all around.  </P> <P>  A cowboy lay in it, all bloody and red  </P> <P>  For his horse had fallen on him  </P> <P>  And crushed in his head . . .  </P> <P> Choked up or not, Mahaney and Schubert and a number of other Wild West  wordsmiths will be singing and reciting, yodeling and ti-yi-yippee-ing cowboy  tales Sunday at the 30th Annual Topanga Banjo and Fiddle Contest at the  Paramount Ranch in Agoura -- as part of the contest's first-ever "Cowboy Poetry  and Storytelling" segment.  </P> <P> Are Mahaney and Schubert cowboys? No. Fifty-year-old Mahaney is a lifelong folk  singer (and former host of KCSN's cowboy program, "Trail Mix") currently  working in telemarketing for KCET television. Schubert is a 61-year-old,  Boston-born former engineer and salesman (and former contest organizer) whose  wrangling experience is confined to having been social director for dude  ranches in Arizona and New Mexico.  </P> <P> Are they cowboys at heart? Sure as a bronco bucks. You can see it in their  misty eyes, hear it in their quavering voices, when they talk about how they  became interested in Western folklore -- or when they recite such famous pieces  of verse as "The Strawberry Roan," by cowboy poet Curley Fletcher, or sing  cowboy songs that have crossed over into mainstream tastes, like "Don't Fence  Me In," or those that haven't, like "The Old Chisholm Trail."  </P> <P> " 'The Old Chisholm Trail' is my speciality," said Schubert from his Malibu  Canyon home. "It probably has millions of verses. Some of them you only do in  men's company, and of course, I won't do any that are inappropriate at the  contest. And some are really written for children, and others for families."  </P> <P> Indeed, "Chisholm" has as many verses as there were cowboys to make them up.  Schubert collected several hundred during years of travel around the country,  interviewing old cowboys and other guardians of Old West memories, and will  perform as many as 70 verses at the contest.  </P> <P> "It's both a poem and a song," said Schubert, now a partner in an equestrian  center-building company who discovered his love for the West while reading Zane  Grey novels as a child. "I start it off by singing and yodeling, and then I  play the harmonica, then I read some verses from various books, then I play  Autoharp and sing some more. And then," he added, laughing, "I play my  mandolin. It takes a hell of a long time to get through the whole thing."  </P> <P> "Chisholm" tells several stories at once, and Schubert seems emotionally  involved with each of them. His baritone voice arches and growls dramatically  and spontaneously as he sings; he ti-yi-yippees like it really means something.  A few of his favorite stanzas:  </P> <P> "Come along boys, and listen to my tale  </P> <P>  Tell you all my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail  </P> <P>  Come a ti-yi-yippee, come a ti-yi-yay  </P> <P>  Come-a-ti-yi-yippee-yippee-yay  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Started down the trail on October twenty-third,  </P> <P>  Started down the trail with the Barracks herd  </P> <P>  Ten-dollar hat, forty-dollar saddle  </P> <P>  Best damn cowboy that ever been straddled  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> "Most of these songs go back to probably the 1840s and 1850s," said the lanky  Mahaney, who lives a cow-chip toss from the Burbank Equestrian Center, and a  short gallop from the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum (whose namesake first  inspired Mahaney's interest in Western lore at Saturday matinees long ago.)  "Some of the songs -- their meters and melodies -- can be traced to Irish and  Welsh tunes."  </P> <P> And the nonsense words like "ti-yi-yippee," which aren't really so nonsensical,  have similar roots. Schubert said:  </P> <P> "There's a lady that teaches folklore at night school in Culver City, and she  took a lot of these nonsense verses -- like a 'donny donny oogle and a bonnie  bonnie way' . . . and explained to me that it actually meant something in  Gaelic, and showed how some of these things eventually made their way to  American folk songs. They eventually lost their meaning for the singers, but  they still sounded good."  </P> <P> Mahaney, who will host the cowboy segment, blew the lid off the pastoral,  guitar-cradling "singing cowboy" stereotype as depicted in movies. Yes,  wranglers did sing -- but no, they did not strum guitars and croon like Gene  Autry or the Sons of the Pioneers. The music was often a cappella, and when it  wasn't, the instruments of choice were the fiddle and harmonica. The songs were  often far simpler than the fare that Autry warbled.  </P> <P> "I know it's a genre that's been criticized by academia," said Mahaney. "Most  of the poetry and song consists of four-line stanzas that rhyme. It's very easy  to listen to and understand -- pretty simple -- and it should be. It's all  really about a lost way of life, or a way of life that is struggling to be  preserved."  </P> <P> Or, perhaps it's more correct to say, a mythified way of life?  </P> <P> "Maybe it is more the myth that I love than reality -- you know, at least the  myth of simple living, truth and honesty, the white hat, friendship and those  kind of things," said Mahaney, whose home is in a neighborhood known as "River  Bottom" that used to house movie cowboys and their ponies in the '30s and '40s.  "Whether they really existed in the West or were the invention of Ned Buntline  (creator of the Buffalo Bill Cody dime novel, forerunner of paperback); whether  they were from the imagination of a writer or really existed, I don't know. But  I've seen so damn much film about the cowboy that it's left me with definitely  a love of the myth."  </P> <P> The cowboy theme of the contest was Schubert's idea -- the result of a  suggestion by contest director Mary Ellen Clark to add a "storytelling"  segment. Schubert quickly suggested calling Mahaney, and other volunteers were  rounded up, including storyteller/poet Greg McCarty, David Bouren, Beryl Black,  Dorin Kayser, Reine River and Christina Egrr. But reading is not limited to  special guests. Audience members will be invited on stage to spin tales of the  "lone prairie," and some of the stories are likely to be pretty authentic.  </P> <P> "There are two or three old cowboys who have come every year to sing songs in  the general competition, and we'll undoubtedly get some of those guys to come  over and talk and tell cowboy tales," said Schubert.  </P> <P> What? You mean, really working cowboys? Didn't know there were any left. . . .  </P> <P> "They're retired now," he said, "because they have too many broken bones or too  many aches, or they found there was more money in being a Hollywood cowboy than  a real one. There's one young guy, well, he's young compared to me -- he's 42  -- and he's a tremendous showman. He's a lot like some of these Will  Rogers-type people who were humorists. When he gets up and does a song, it's  really not a song at all; it's an act."  </P> <P> Schubert's own act is well-tested. In a lifetime's journeys around the world,  the former dude-rancher (an accomplished horseman in both English and Western  riding styles) always toted his guitar. Despite the fact that he courteously  made a point of singing in the language appropriate for whichever country he  happened to find himself in, in each case, Schubert said, "the thing everybody  loved was my cowboy songs and yodeling. It's a universal thing."  </P> <P> And a thing that he is still at a loss to explain the allure of. When asked  that question most dreaded by lovers of cowboy lore and history, "What do you  love about the songs and poems?" Lou Schubert could barely get the answer out:  </P> <P> "Well, you know there's two things that are . . . most beautiful. . . . Sorry.  . . . Gettin' emotional, here. . . . Well, there's the humor. The humor's . . .  beautiful. . . . Sort of a combination of the tragedy and humor, I guess . . .  and the loneliness. . . ."  </P> <P>  Come along boys, and listen to my tale  </P> <P>  Tell you all my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail  </P> <P>  Come a ti-yi-yippee, come-a-ti-yi-ya  </P> <P>  Come-a-ti-yi-yippee-yippee-yay..."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contest at the Ranch  </P> <P> The 30th annual Topanga Banjo and Fiddle Contest, which runs from 9:30 a.m. to  6 p.m. Sunday at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, will feature 100 entrants who  will sing or play fiddle, banjo, guitar, mandolin or special instruments.  </P> <P> The event, which in recent years has hop-scotched around Southern California  collegiate athletic fields, also will include folk dancing and crafts such as  ceramics, needlework, wood carving, jewelry making, weaving, and leather work.  </P> <P> Singing and Western poetry reading will begin at noon. Non-contestants are  encouraged to bring instruments for jam sessions.  </P> <P> To get to the ranch, take the Ventura Freeway west to the Kanan Road exit. Go  south on Kanan to Cornell Road. Turn left and veer to the right for 2 1/2 miles  to the ranch. Parking is free. Admission is $5, $2 for youngsters 12 to 17 and  seniors over 65, free for children under 12.

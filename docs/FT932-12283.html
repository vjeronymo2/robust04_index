			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Jordan forecasts new strike wave ECONOMIC RECOVERY could be accompanied by 'a return to industrial disputes of a combative kind' such as the bitter dispute at Timex in Dundee, Mr Bill Jordan, the president of the AEEU engineering union, warned last night. He told the Commons employment committee that trade union and individual worker rights had dramatically worsened over the past 14 years.

Under existing law a company cannot rehire workers who have lost their jobs in a mass dismissal without facing claims of unfair dismissal by those not offered re-employment. Mr Greville Janner, the Labour MP who chairs the select committee, appealed to Mr Hall to settle the dispute. 'Could you not reconsider the situation having heard what the union had to say?' he asked. Mr Hall said: 'We have stated our position and that is that.'</p>

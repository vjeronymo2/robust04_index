			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Building for history - Architecture When Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the Palace of Westminster, died in 1860, the Art Journal claimed that the new Palace had 'given an impetus to the three sister arts of painting, sculpture and architecture they in all probability would have never otherwise received.' What is the likelihood of the same words being written today about the important new parliamentary building that was announced last week? The new building, which is to provide offices for MPs, occupies what must be regarded as one of the most sensitive sites in the capital, on the Thames at the corner of Bridge Street and the Victoria Embankment. It will stand next door to Big Ben and will be an important feature in the townscape of Parliament Square, Westminster and the river. The site has long been a controversial one. An earlier competition for a parliamentary extension here was won by architects Spence and Webster and they produced a large minimalist glazed box which did not win enough friends in parliament for it ever to be built. More recently a planning study was carried out by Casson Conder and Partners which proposed a parliamentary 'campus'. This plan, which is now being followed, established a secure perimeter for parliamentary buildings stretching from Bridge Street to Richmond Terrace and from the Victoria Embankment to Parliament Street, necessitating the closure of Canon Row. The first phase of this work was recently completed and includes the refurbishment and adaptation of several listed buildings. The latest proposal is for an entirely new building over the top of the Underground incorporating a new Westminster station that will be a stop on the proposed extension of the Jubilee Line. The architects for the new Parliamentary building, Michael Hopkins and Partners, were appointed by the Department of the Environment and they completed their sketch proposals in October last year. Since then a great deal of work has depended on the planned development with London Underground of the new Westminster Station beneath the building. Michael Hopkins will also be the architect of this new station. Hopkins has almost become the architect of the Establishment. Following his successful stand at Lord's cricket ground in St Marylebone, he has moved on to be the architect for the new Glyndebourne opera house; the new offices for the Inland Revenue in Nottingham (won in competition last week); and the superb, recently completed conversion of the former Financial Times building at Bracken House for the Obayashi company in the City. He is also the house architect for the refurbishment of the Victoria and Albert museum. It is no easy task to design a major public building to stand between Norman Shaw's Scotland Yard and Barry and Pugin's Palace of Westminster; and opposite Ralph Knott's County Hall. It is also a challenge, today, to design something that conveys to the world that it is an important public building occupied by people who may contribute to the history of the nation. Architects and their clients come up against difficult questions about the meaning of architecture, and the language that architecture can or should use to convey values beyond the merely functional. Sir Charles Barry had what he called his 'great idea' to make his new Palace of Westminster a monumental history of England. He was able to achieve this only with the help of the prodigal imagination and decorative and antiquarian skill of Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-1852). The final result of Barry and Pugin's achievement is one of the most remarkable public buildings in the world and must be seen as the touchstone for any new building that grows alongside it. Hopkins has understood clearly the logic of Barry's axial plans and designed his new offices around a courtyard. He has also looked closely at the skyline of Westminster and dealt with the mechanical problems of air intake and extract rather in the way that Barry did, by utilising finials and ornamental details as part of the ventilation system. Whitehall is a street of courtyards, almost all of which are invisible to the public. It is presumably only essential security, plus privileged parking places, that prevents the whole of the Government area being an open series of beautiful public quadrangles. The Secretary of State for the Environment described the site of the new building as 'one of the most sensitive sites in the urban world' and the architects' design as 'a high class solution'. I think it will be a good office building. It will be built of very good materials, using a dark pinkish sandstone (from Scotland) for its load bearing walls and bronze for its roof. The palate is dark, closer to Norman Shaw's Scotland Yard than to the Palace of Westminster. This I am sure is right, as is the decision to treat the form and silhouette of the new building as a separate 'palazzo' along the Thames. The elevational treatment, the grid relieved by vertical strips of projecting bay windows a la Bracken House, is unremarkable. The curved corner turrets seem to have been inspired by Sir Albert Richardson's treatment of big city blocks. The roof, with all its metal catwalks, is unduly spiky and complex. For the one Pounds 120m it is expected to cost, this should be a very fine modern office building. But as a very major, new public landmark I question whether it is imaginative enough for its important site. It is a cautious marriage of elements from the its more powerful neighbours - an arranged marriage of convenience rather than one sparked into life by roaring romance. Barry did put the history of England into his designs, and was not afraid of the power of art to convey his ideas. Perhaps Hopkins needs a Pugin to add some fire to his cool rationalism?</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Growing silver deficit forecast Silver demand is likely to outpace supply by as much as 250m troy ounces this year, according to Mr Dennis Wheeler, chairman of Coeur d'Alene Mines, the second-largest US producer of the metal. Eventually this would be bound to push up prices, he said. Mr Wheeler pointed out that silver was the best-performing metal in price terms last year, moving up from a depressed Dollars 3.55 a troy ounce in 1992 to an average of Dollars 5.37. He suggested that annual demand for silver, mainly from the photographic, jewellery and silver-ware industries, was still growing at a steady 2 per cent a year, requiring an extra 20m ounces a year, but low prices at the end of the 1980s had forced many mines to close. Two mines in the Coeur d'Alene mining district of Idaho, in which his company has an interest - the Coeur and Galena silver mines - are at present temporarily shut down and on a care and maintenance basis. Mr Wheeler said it would need a sustained silver price of Dollars 6 an ounce to make it worth re-opening those mines. Last night silver closed in London up 5 cents at Dollars 5.18 1/2 . The Washington-based Silver Institute estimated last year that there was a 88.6m-ounce supply deficit in 1992 and predicted there might be one of 143.2m ounces in 1993 - a fourth consecutive year of deficit. The huge stocks of silver that have enabled this gap to be filled have also depressed the price. The institute will be publishing its latest market review on May 12. Mr Wheeler said this would be likely to show that consumption of silver for jewellery and silverware had exceeded the metal's use in photography for the first time in 25 years. He suggested that new technology still posed no big threat to the use of silver in photography. Last year's scare was caused by Polaroid's technology for silver-free graphic art applications, but this would reduce annual silver usage by only 15m ounces (out of demand approaching 600m ounces) even if 100 per cent of the business moved to the new process - which was unlikely because of its cost.</p>

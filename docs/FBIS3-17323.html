In response to an address, which has been  published by the local official press "to realize his special  responsibility to the Kazakh nation and correct his mistaken  opinion," he made a statement in the regular issue of the  newspaper `People's Congress,' which is the voice of the  People's Congress of Kazakhstan party.    The poet, the party leader, and the deputy of the Supreme  Kenges says, in particular: I am experienced enough to  understand that this publication of a writer's appeal in the  official Kazakh newspapers has been fired against me and  inspired by my permanent opponents, who as before prefer to  remain in shadow. I used to believe, and I still believe, that  national radicalism was and is the manifestation of political  ignorance. Therefore, for several years I am trying to restrain  the so-called patriots.    I and like-minded people in my party believe that "the  course  of history will lead us eventually to the creation of the  confederation of Euroasian sovereign states, with the union  between Russia and Kazakhstan being the nucleus of this  economic-defense union. You write to me "we don't understand  your suggestion. There is no nation in the world which doesn't  strive to be independent. How can your speak about  confederation, when our independence is only two to three years  old?"    I want to explain this: confederation is the union of  politically independent countries with their own presidents,  governments, budgets, currencies, armies, parliaments, and  constitutions. These countries are not subordinate to each  other, they have a common economic and defense space, regulated  by agreements which they sign. Borderlines between them are  conventional. The states create the most-favored nation regime  in trade and economy for each other.    President Nazarbayev has been working for this all these  years -- he simply doesn't use the word "confederation."  Presumably this is because of his attitude to political terms.    Further on, Olzhas Suleymenov went on to note that those who  have made accusations do not know history. "You are saying that  up until recently Russia acted as an empire while Kazakhstan was  a colony." These definitions might have been correct before  1917. Later on, both Russia and Kazakhstan became dependent on  the bureacratic center.    I studied issues of colonialism and national-liberation  movements over a period of thirty years. I travelled to Asiatic  and African countries, former British, Portuguese, and French  colonies. Can you imagine unskilled Englishman working, for  example, in India and any Indian supervising his work? Or can  you imagine Frenchman cultivating land in Africa, with his boss  being from Senegal? Who is the slave and who is the colonizer?    Relations between Russia and Kazakhstan are difficult, says  Olzhas Suleymenov. Therefore, now when Kazakhstan is facing a  dilemma we have to be honest and objective in remembering the  main landmarks of our history. These are: in the 18th century  it was Russia who saved Kazakhstan from extermination; in the  19th century Kazakhstan became Russia's colony; in the 20th  century we together with the Russian people fought and won. It  was the Russian Federation who has given us our independence.  This must be remembered. Independence.    The conclusion is: Kazakhstan can live without the Russian  empire and Russia can develop successfully without Kazakhstan as  its colony, but in the very near future they wouldn't be able to  exist without each other as equal and sovereign states, since  their histories are so interconnected. The current economic and  other problems of the two countries is the proof of this.    "There is no future for our country if we won't understand  this," summarises Suleymenov. "Kazakhstan and Russia have been  united by our wise ancestors, let's not allow ignorance to  divide us."</p>

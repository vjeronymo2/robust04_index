			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Banking on the multi-class of 94 - Victoria Griffith explains why companies are making an interactive push into US classrooms US elementary and high schools are turning into key testing grounds for multimedia products, as companies woo the young people they believe will one day be their most important customers. 'The eight-year-olds of today are our future market,' says George Schlukbier, director of new media for the News &amp; Observer Publishing Company, which runs an on-line service to schools in North Carolina. 'The information highway will come into full force a decade from now, when those eight-year-olds will be entering the consumer market.' Examples of this trend are many. Nynex, the telecommunications company, offers an interactive voice and video hook-up which allows students to take classes with a teacher in another school. Via computer, students in various locations can be called on to answer questions. AT&amp;T is connecting high schools with colleges interactively. The publishing industry is also throwing its weight into the classroom. For instance, Primis, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill, is making custom-designed textbooks via high-speed printing. Voyager has put out CD-Rom versions of Shakespeare's Macbeth and other books, complete with text, video, and annotations. The media sector has also been especially active in the schools. Whittle Communications runs a computer-linked cable news network to schools in the US and hopes to move into the UK market soon. Newspapers like the San Jose Mercury News, the Chicago Tribune, and the News &amp; Observer Company, which publishes the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, all run on-line services to schools. Meanwhile, Reuters, the UK-based wire service, has just launched Ingenius, a joint venture with Liberty Media Corp, to provide a multimedia smorgasbord of voice overs, photographs, videos, articles and interactive lesson plans. Today's adults, many believe, are too set in their ways to become major consumers of high-technology multimedia products. 'Older people will probably stick to traditional sources like newspapers and nightly news broadcasts for information, although they may dabble in multimedia,' says Lewis Friedland, professor in journalism at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 'The market will be shaped by the kids who grow up using this stuff.' Linking up with schools to ensure a future customer base is not a new idea. Apple Computer used the same strategy two decades ago when it handed out thousands of computers to classrooms around the US. Results, however, were mixed. Young adults today are far more computer-literate than their elders, but that is probably more due to contact they had with computers at home and work than at school. In many cases, the computers Apple provided sat idle for years as teachers tried to figure out how to use them, and how to incorporate them into their curriculum. 'We won't have that problem, because programmes are getting easier to use,' says Gerald Bennington, chief executive officer of Ingenius. Yet teacher training remains a concern, and Ingenius has established a training programme in Denver to encourage use of its product. Ironically, the free Apples which brought schools into the computer age may now slow the growth of multimedia in the classrooms. Most of the computers in schools today are too basic, for instance, to run sophisticated on-line programmes. 'Most schools are pretty out-dated,' says Schlukbier. 'Some don't even include the Vietnam war in their textbooks. You have to work with what you have, but it means we can't provide much in the way of CD-Rom film for the computer and other new technologies.' Companies are also struggling with pricing issues. The News &amp; Observer, for instance, provides services at no charge in the hope of a long-term pay-off. Whittle's Channel One is also free, but runs commercials on its network to garner revenues. Nynex and Reuters, on the other hand, believe schools will pay for a high-quality product. 'It's a myth that theschools don't have any money,' says Bennington of Ingenius. 'It's one of the biggest budget items in any state in the country.' Once they get access to the classroom, multimedia news providers have to grapple with the challenge of how to present violent stories to children. 'I think the trick is to present a story like OJ Simpson (in which the ex-football star is accused of murdering his ex-wife and her friend) in a straightforward, non-sensationalist manner, then tie it to real life through a discussion of domestic violence or learning activities, such as the study of the US judicial system,' says Katherine King, editor-in-chief of Ingenius. Multimedia companies may also face opposition from educators who doubt the value of the products. 'The studies we've done show that children don't learn any more when they're connected to computers and multimedia products than they do through traditional methods,' says Alex Molnar, professor of education at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. 'There's also the question of how to pay for it. US schools don't have lots of money, and if they pay for these products, they have to cut down in other areas. And if it's for free, like Channel One, but kids are subjected to advertisements, that raises all sorts of questions about commercialising our classrooms.' Despite the challenges, companies believe that a presence in the schools today is essential to tap the future multimedia market. For that reason, US classrooms are turning into one of the most important laboratories for the industry.</p>

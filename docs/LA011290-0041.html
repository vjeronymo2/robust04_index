			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: IS THERE A FUTURE IN DEAD-END PUBLISHING?  </P> <P> Psssst. Wanna buy a book with profiles of 12 condemned killers, a history of  capital punishment, and a complete listing of the nation's Death Row inmates?  </P> <P> If so, call Hare Productions in Carlsbad. They've got 13,000 copies in the  warehouse.  </P> <P> It's called "Death Row" ($19.95, 225 pages, fully illustrated). It's the latest  creation of Glenn Hare, 58, a former San Diego cop turned magazine publisher  and emergency gear manufacturer.  </P> <P> "We started working on it at about the time of the Ted Bundy execution," Hare  said. "I realized there is a public fascination and curiosity about capital  punishment."  </P> <P> Hare was on the San Diego force from 1962 to 1966. He left to start a company  making traction splints; his Dyna Corp. now manufactures 100 paramedic-style  items (cots, gurneys, extraction devices, etc.).  </P> <P> From that, he went into publishing. Hare Productions publishes Police magazine  (circulation 55,000) and Emergency magazine (35,000) and does the printing for  a dozen more magazines.  </P> <P> Hare sold 2,000 copies of "Death Row" through an ad in Police. He hopes to sell  the remaining 13,000 through bookstores and ads on television.  </P> <P> "I could see an update every three months, telling about new arrivals on Death  Row, who's been cleared, and who's finally been executed," he said.  </P> <P> Hare is pro-death penalty. But "Death Penalty" is not a tirade against liberal  judges and the ACLU. The prose is straightforward.  </P> <P> Steven Casey, an assistant to San Diego Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, wrote the  overview chapter and a profile of Robert Alton Harris, who murdered two Mira  Mesa teen-agers.  </P> <P> As a cop, Hare took part in one of San Diego's most celebrated shoot-outs: a  four-hour downtown gun battle in 1965 with the killer of a jewelry store  manager. Robert Anderson was captured and sentenced to the gas chamber.  </P> <P> In 1972, the state Supreme Court used Anderson's case to rule the death penalty  unconstitutional. He was paroled in 1978.  </P> <P> "He's walking the streets of Seattle these days," Hare said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flimsy Jail Humor  </P> <P> It's all true.  </P> <P> * The flight of inmates from the county's flimsy facility in East County has  bred its own humor. Fleeing prisoners are said to have issued themselves a writ  of habeas escapus.  </P> <P> When Supervisor Susan Golding received a crystal bowl from her colleagues this  week in appreciation of her year as chairwoman, she found the box packed with  tiny curlicues of Styrofoam.  </P> <P> Golding said she figured the fluffy stuff was building materials from the El  Cajon Jail.  </P> <P> * Golfers, Replace your Mantras!  </P> <P> MiraCosta College of Oceanside is offering a course in "Zen and the Golf  Swing." Golfers will be taught the posture exercises and breathing techniques  of Zen.  </P> <P> * Patricia Shaffer, professor of chemistry at the University of San Diego, has  received a $200,000 grant to study genes in connection with leukemia and  lymphoma.  </P> <P> It's not your usual grant: It's the largest grant ever received by a USD  professor.  </P> <P> Then again, Shaffer is not your usual professor: She's a Sacred Heart nun (Rome  '57) as well as a Ph.D in chemistry (UC San Diego, '75).  </P> <P> </P> <P> He's No Padres Fan  </P> <P> It started with a joking headline on Times sports editor Dave Distel's column  on Thursday: "Have a Credit Card Ready and Call Now! 1-800-BUY-PADRES."  </P> <P> Richard Cole, co-owner of Emslee Products of Cleveland, Ohio, is not laughing.  His company sells sanitary napkins. Its number is 1-800-BUY PADS.  </P> <P> "Our phone has been ringing all day," Cole said. "My secretary can't get any  work done, I'm losing orders, I'm paying 12-cents per minute for every call,  what in hell are you people doing out there?"  </P> <P> Cole hopes people will stop phoning. He spent an exasperating day telling  callers he's not related to Joan Kroc.  </P> <P> "I told them, 'Listen, I can't sell you a baseball team, but if you need  sanitary napkins, toilet seat covers or diapers, I'm your man,' " Cole said. "I  didn't make a single sale!"  </P></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Miyazawa urges political clean-up: Japan is slipping deeper into political and economic crisis - The Politics THE Japanese government has become gridlocked in the wake of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal while the economy is facing a severe slump, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, warned the Japanese parliament yesterday. Mr Miyazawa told an extraordinary session of the Diet there was an urgent need to restore public trust in politics, which had fallen to an all time low. A newspaper poll this week showed the cabinet's approval rating fell by 10 points over the last month to a low of 23 per cent. The slump is mainly a reflection of the scandal which has provoked a vicious power struggle at the top of the ruling Liberal Democratic party. This follows the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party's powerbroker who admitted receiving an illegal donation of Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company with links to organised crime syndicates. The Diet session, which has been convened for 40 days, will start by focusing on the scandal towards the end of next week. Opposition parties are demanding that Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and titular head of the LDP's largest faction, should testify over his role in the affair. Mr Takeshita's testimony could further destabilise the party leadership. Mr Miyazawa issued a ringing denunciation of the current political system: 'I am unalterably resolved to work for far-reaching political reform to eliminate the root causes that have bred today's distrust of politics, including ensuring greater transparency of political funding and facilitating elections contested over policy issues and political activity that does not require vast sums of money.' However, the reform plan which the government has agreed with the main opposition parties falls well short of demands made by leading reformers. The plan would reapportion several Diet seats from rural to urban areas, strengthen the political ethics council, force Diet members to make a fuller disclosure of their assets and allow illegal contributions to be confiscated. Mr Miyazawa called on the LDP and the opposition to continue talks on the more far-reaching reforms to the electoral system and political funding which would he said would be needed to meet public criticism. Mr Miyazawa responded to the uncertainty created by next week's US presidential election by stressing that relations with the US would remain the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy. However, he said Japan would increasingly develop Asian foreign policy initiatives which would lead Japan into a political role in resolving disputes in the region as well as providing financial assistance. Japan would not waver from its Russian policy that bilateral financial aid would be increased only once the dispute over the Kurile Islands was settled and a peace treaty was signed.</p>

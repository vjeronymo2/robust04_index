			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kyoto University Professor Michio Muramatsu: </F> "Introducing a System of Accountability to the Budget Process,  Expanding the Role of the Judiciary in Anticipation of More  Legal Disputes"]    [Text] 1. In order to prevent abuses from occurring in  Japan's bureaucracy, it is necessary to strengthen the role of  the prime minister and other top officials within government.  Reform should be undertaken to strengthen the audit system,  institute thorough post evaluations of the budget process, and  move government toward a "system of accountability."    2. With greater deregulation and decentralization of  government, there will also be a need to strengthen the role of  the judiciary. Questions will arise abaout the training and  education of those in the legal profession, including judges. It  is time to look into reforming government in its entirety.    3. The "maximum mobilization system" that has been a  characteristic of Japan's bureaucracy has created sectionalism  among ministries and other government agencies, pitting them  against each other for budget appropriations.    With Limited Personnel, Aiming for Maximum Effect    Japan's bureaucracy operates according to what can be called  a "maximum resource mobilization and deployment system." This is  a method to obtain maximum results from the resources  (personnel, budget, etc.) that an organization has at its  disposal. Japan's bureaucracy has been overly strained under  this system to meet the demands of an extremely heavy workload.  At the core of this system is competition among the various  government agencies and ministries. Policy proposals coming from  the bureaucracy have in large part been a result of this  competition. When competition exists among organizational units,  the horizontal authority structure or relationship among these  units is clearly defined. On the other hand, the so-called  division of labor within these units is only vaguely defined.  Even when authority legally rests at the "top," special  provisions will permit the decentralization of this authority  within the unit. Moreover, the next deputy down the line is  permitted to exercise the authority which has been delegated to  him to make decisions and put his own official stamp to them.    Intense cooperation exists among the various vertical layers  within a unit, and serves to mobilize all its resources and  energy. The one large room where the unit chief and those under  him work together without partitions and walls to separate them  is the physical expression of this system of cooperation. Due to  a heavy workload, it is not unusual for the workday to last well  beyond 1700. Personnel management sustains this kind of devotion  by maintaining a career-oriented system and scrupulous attention  to career promotions.    What makes this maximum mobilization system work is the  scarcity of available resources. Compared to other OECD  countries, Japan's administrative agencies not only employ a  relatively small number of public servants in total but operate  on relatively small budgets. They also have "weak" authority,  according to an analysis by John Haley. Haley, an American  university professor, points out that, even though regulations  and jurisdictional authority exist, existing laws often fail to  provide sanctions against violators. This writer also once  pointed out that, despite the importance of eminent domain, this  right was not exercised by government because it lacked the  authority to carry out such laws.    It should also be pointed out that, in addition to having to  manage with limited resources, the bureaucracy has extensive  responsibilities. This combination of scarce resources and broad  jurisdiction compounds the need for maximum mobilization.    Maximum mobilization also applies outside the central system  of ministries and public agencies. First of all, there is the  tradition of regional governments. These local units have made  it possible to maintain a small central administration. Instead  of having the central government create local branch offices of  its own, it delegates its work to these regional units. Thus,  though regional administration increases in size and scope, the  aggregate cost of government is reduced. Second, the  administration works in partnership with various groups. The  bureaucracy has created a number of industry and trade groups  through which it tries to have its intentions known and accepted  by the various sectors concerned. That it can exercise  administrative guidance without direct authority is due to this  tradition.    Recently, criticism has been directed at the bureaucracy,  albeit only half seriously, to the effect that "[the system  serves] the interests of the ministries, not the national  interest." Of course, this criticism is fairly groundless. But  it will be worth our while to pay attention to the frustrations  that are behind this sort of criticism.    Bureaucrats play a very important role in the policymaking  process. "But," doubting Thomases will ask, "when a policy  fails, who takes responsibility?" "Can bureaucrats effect major  shifts in policy on their own?" These kinds of concerns are  behind recent criticisms of the bureaucracy. In truth, Japan's  policies are in need of a change. For example, many critics are  now pointing to the weaknesses of "convoy fleet" policies; in  other words, the administration's attempts to protect industries  by way of regulations has come under attack. On the whole, there  is a strong demand for [less government intervention and] more  private [initiative]. Though the demand is slightly different in  the case of decentralization, this too being talked about.    These are demands for a basic shift in public policy. The  age  of "catch-up" modernization is over, and what critics are  calling for is a basic change in Japan's existing value system.  This trend can be seen in the recommendations of the Second  Provisional Administrative Research Committee and later in the  recommendations of the Council for the Promotion of  Administrative Reform. There are also the Maekawa and Hiraiwa  reports, both apparently in disagreement with the government's  prescriptions for the economy. These are all recommendations in  effect to change the basic premises of current policy.    Increasing Importance of Leadership Ability    The maximum mobilization system has brought sectionalism to  Japan's ministries and government agencies. It has also brought  about the kind of competitive behavior in making policy  recommendations that puts their authors' self-interest first.  How can such abuses be prevented?    The first step is to strengthen the top of the  organizational  pyramid, starting with the prime minister. In other words, it  means making revisions in the maximum mobilization system as it  applies to ministries and government agencies.    Cynics say this prescription is unreasonable, the  bureaucracy  is too strong. But is this really the case? Whether the ruling  group represents a single party or a coalition of parties, the  truism applies: "where there's a will, there's a way." Proof to  this effect already exists.    We need think only of recent events. That a "solution" was  reached at the Uruguay Round concerning the liberalization of  Japan's rice market, that the Ministry of Construction is now  attempting to switch to a general bidding system--aren't these  in fact indications that the Hosokawa coalition government and  its cabinet of "outsiders" have changed the direction of Japan's  ministries? Compare this, then, to the period from the general  elections on 18 July 1993 to 6 August, when [Morihiro] Hosokawa  was nominated prime minister. Government during this period came  to a standstill. Again, with the recent "fall" of the Hosokawa  government, it was impossible to carry out budget deliberations  for fiscal 1994, and government activities came to a long halt.    There are probably people who would say the rice market  agreement had already all but been concluded and that changes to  the bidding system were less a matter of who was in charge than  a sign of the times. But policy doesn't come about merely  because it is backed by the times or by public opinion; the will  of the government's top leaders must be there to support it. As  in other industrially advanced countries, the importance of  national leadership at the very top levels of government has  become more important than ever.    Reforming the way budgets are formulated--for example,  having  it done at the "top"--is an effective way [to strengthen the  upper levels of government]. It is necessary to transfer the  [Ministry of Finance's] Budget Bureau to the prime minister's  Cabinet Secretariat or establish an entirely new process which  links the prime minister's office and the Budget and Tax Bureaus.    The second direction which reform can take is to introduce  certain "appropriateness" [outcome] standards to the evaluation  of policy. While this will, of course, promote changes in  policy, it will also act as a deterrent to the kind of  competition for fiscal funds and the competition among policy  recommendations one sees where everyone is fighting for a piece  of the pie. Currently, those who evaluate budgets and personnel  reshuffling do so in light of future plans rather than  evaluating administrative activities in terms of audited  results. It is more important to come up with a proposal that  has the outer semblance of a good plan than to produce good  results.    To cite a familiar example: A university researcher's past  performance record will be of little use to him even for a grant  to cover essential scientific research expenses. In the research  application form, anticipated results seem to be the one and  only standard. On the other hand, even if the applicant shows  good potential, if his proposal is not well written, it will be  rejected. There is no process whereby an applicant can get prior  advice that will help him develop this potential. There seems to  be only a "weak" willingness to pursue what is good or original.  In other words, this is a system with very little sensitivity to  quality--whether with regard to policy or research.    Results are secondary. What matters is being persuasive  about  the "appropriateness" of a proposal at the time that allocations  are being made. By contrast, by revamping the external audit,  which is based exclusively on legal criteria, and introducing  appropriate [outcome-oriented] evaluation criteria, one has a  system that can be applied to post-budget assessments. The  results of this audit can then be reflected in the next round of  budget appropriations.    In the present system, too, a method has been devised to  rationalize one-time budget appropriations. The requester is  made to establish a long-term plan and to provide a performance  record for previous years. This is not, however, a thorough  method for assessing the "appropriateness" of his request.    The recommendation, here, is to revamp the various functions  of the existing audit system and introduce a method to provide  for an outside evaluation. There are the Ministry of Finance's  audit, which concerns fiscal efficiency, and the Management and  Coordination Agency's administrative inspections [gyosei  kansatsu], but at the present time, both of these have  limited roles. The mainstay of Japan's audit system (what may  properly be called an outside audit) is the audit conducted by  the Board of Audit. It is required by the Constitution and is  connected to the Diet's settlement process.    It would seem to be quite fitting to have the Board of Audit  adopt the idea of an "appropriateness" audit. What is wanted  here, in other words, is a system whereby the activities of our  public administrators--i.e., the agents of government and  society as represented by the Diet and the Japanese citizen and  ultimately by the prime minister and Japan's national  parties--can be assessed in terms of their outcomes and these  results can then be applied to the work of government.    System of Accountability    Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the impact that  such a system will have. Political scientists are constantly  concerned about where authority is located. Where will  decentralization or deregulation shift this authority? We must  consider such matters very seriously.    Former National Land Agency vice minister Jun Shimokobe once  said to those advocating decentralization: "Handing down  authority increases the role of lawyers and the judiciary." To  withdraw authority from one party is to assign it to another  party. It has been Japan's system in the past to entrust most of  this authority to the central administration. Before cutting  back on its role, we should explore the possibility that, as the  legislative functions [of elected officials] are restored, the  role of the judiciary will also be coming more prominently to  the fore.    That portion of authority relinquished by the central  administration will be fought over in legal disputes pitting  private citizens against each other and the private citizen  against the public administrator. When this occurs, what becomes  important is the educational background of the judge and his  ability to make policy judgments. There will also be concerns,  for example, about the quality of university education and the  system that trains judges and the fact that the legal profession  is represented by too few practitioners, including judges.    This article has explored one course that reform may  take--namely, the shift from a system to maximize the  mobilization of resources to a system of accountability. Any  reform proposal needs to strike a balance and avoid the danger  of discarding the strengths and merits of an existing system.</p>

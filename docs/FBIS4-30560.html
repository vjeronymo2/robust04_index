			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a Communications Ministry report on the  progress of the Thai-U.S. aviation talks, the United States sent  a letter to the ministry announcing a change in the head of the  U.S. delegation to the negotiations and asking to extend the  two-day talks an additional day to 30 June.    The United States was reportedly not satisfied with the  results of the last rounds of talks and therefore decided to  appoint Mr. Thomas Mark [preceding three words in English] as  leader of its delegation. It was reported earlier that the  United States was unhappy with the U.S. delegation's lenient  attitude in conducting aviation talks with Thailand and other  countries in this region. With this change in the leadership of  the U.S. delegation, the U.S. delegation's attitude is expected  to become more aggressive and uncompromising.    Touching on the U.S. request to extend the negotiations with  the Thai delegation, Sisuk Chantharangsu, head of the Thai  delegation and director general of the Civil Aviation  Department, said he cannot grant the request because he will be  engaged in official business on 30 June. Meanwhile, the Thai  side's conditions and positions remain unchanged. Regarding the  third airline freedom, the Thai side demands at least 55 percent  of through passenger traffic load and 70 percent of cargo on  U.S. planes as the conditions for agreement on the fifth freedom.    It is anticipated that this round of aviation talks will not  lead to any progress because of the ambiguity and rigid attitude  of the U.S. side.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Actor Martin Sheen won a ruling Thursday from the Nevada Supreme Court  overturning a requirement that he post a $5,000 bond aimed at stopping a  protest trespass at the Nevada Test Site. Sheen, active in the movement against  nuclear testing, was forced to post the "peace bond" after saying on national  television he would "hopefully commit civil disobedience" at the test site. In  reversing District Judge Bill Beko of Tonopah, the Supreme Court said in its  2-page order that prosecutors conceded that civil disobedience isn't a crime in  Nevada.

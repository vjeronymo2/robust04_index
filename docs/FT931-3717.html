			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / GPA seeks outside investors for share issue GPA GROUP is looking for outside 'strategic investors' to take up to 40 per cent of the Dollars 200m convertible preference share issue necessary for its survival. Nomura International, the Japanese securities house, the aircraft leasing company's leading adviser on the rights issue, has told it that its existing shareholders are unlikely to subscribe more than 120m of the 200m convertibles on offer. These effectively value the shares at Dollars 1, compared with a price less than a year ago of Dollars 30. Nomura has asked shareholders to give indicative responses before Friday, when the group's temporary waivers of the banking covenant breaches expire. According to one of GPA's banks, around 80 per cent of the group's lenders have agreed to the Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.8bn) debt restructuring proposals, but only on condition that the preference issue takes place. The company needs the debt restructuring to be completed soon so that it can raise finance in the bond markets. Many of GPA's shareholders have indicated that they are unlikely to take part in the issue unless an outside institution invests in the company. Shareholders are also watching whether the company's four biggest investors, with 35 per cent, support the issue. One shareholder said: 'Everyone is waiting to see how the big four jump. No one wants to be first to put up any money.' Bluff and counter bluff, Page 16</p>

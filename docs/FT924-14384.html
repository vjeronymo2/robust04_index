			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Institutions support Andrews Sykes TWO INSTITUTIONAL share-holders in Andrews Sykes, the industrial services and environmental products group, said yesterday that they would vote against a bid by a dissident minority shareholder to gain control of the board. Royal Insurance Asset Management (Riam), which holds an 8.19 per cent stake in Andrews Sykes, and Postel Investment Management, which has a 4.71 per cent stake, both said they would oppose moves by Mr Jacques Murray to take control of the board at an extraordinary meeting called for next Friday. Mr Murray holds a 26.6 per cent stake in Andrews Sykes through two investment vehicles, European Fire Protection Holding and Midland Bank Overseas Nominees. He has set down resolutions calling for the removal of Mr David Hubbard, the chairman, and Mr David Crowe, a non-executive director, from the five-man board and their replacement by himself and three of his associates. Both Riam and Postel said they strongly supported the existing board and objected to the attempt by Mr Murray 'to gain control without making a formal offer for the company.' The statements coincided with a second letter to shareholders from Andrews Sykes' management urging them to vote against Mr Murray's 'unnecessary and unmerited' proposals. Mr Andre Chudnoff, one of Mr Murray's associates, rejected the criticisms and said the board had failed to address the main issue of its own financial performance.</p>

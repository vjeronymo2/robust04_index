			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 211(f)(4) of the Act provides that upon application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by any fuel or fuel additive manufacturer, the Administrator of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA may waive the prohibitions of section 211(f)(1) if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator determines that the applicant has established that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such fuel or fuel additive will not cause or contribute to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emissions standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which it has been certified pursuant to section 206 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Administrator does not act to grant or deny a waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 180 days of receipt of the application, the statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that the waiver shall be treated as granted. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject of this notice is an application by Ethyl under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(f)(4) of the Act for a waiver for the fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), commercially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeled by Ethyl as HiTEC 3000, to be blended in unleaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline resulting in a level of 0.03125 (1/32) gram per gallon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manganese (gpg Mn).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Agency action is a reconsideration of Ethyl's fourth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for a waiver for MMT. Ethyl's first application was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted on March 17, 1978 for concentrations of MMT resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1/16 and 1/32 gpg Mn in unleaded gasoline. Ethyl's second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application was submitted on May 26, 1981 for concentrations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT resulting in 1/64 gpg Mn in unleaded gasoline. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator denied these requests for waivers due to concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding increases in exhaust hydrocarbon emissions resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from MMT use. The decisions and justifications thereof may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in the September 18, 1978  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 43 FR 41424,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the December 1, 1981  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 46 FR 58630. Ethyl's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third application was submitted on May 9, 1990, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of MMT resulting in a level of 0.3125 (1/32) gpg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mn in unleaded gasoline (the same levels which are requested in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application which is the subject of today's notice). Ethyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrew its third application on November 1, 1990, before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline for the Administrator to make a determination on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. Because no determination had been made at the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl withdrew that application, EPA accepted the withdrawal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately terminated the proceeding without action on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl's fourth application was submitted on July 12, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This application was, from a practical standpoint, an extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the third application, the entire record of which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated by Ethyl into the current proceeding. On January 8,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992, the Administrator of EPA denied Ethyl's fourth application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a waiver (57 FR 2535, January 22, 1992). The application was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denied based in part upon data submitted by Ford Motor Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ford) which indicated that, for the model groups tested by Ford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, for the conditions under which Ford tested its vehicles, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases in hydrocarbon exhaust emissions as a result of the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of MMT were substantially greater than those observed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl test program. The Agency stated in its decision that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely factor which might account for the differences observed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the Ethyl and Ford test programs was the severity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driving cycle. However, the Agency also concluded that other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors might be responsible for the observed differences. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the denial decision, the Agency stated that it had always  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted data from test programs which ``model'' the fleet in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support of waiver applications, but that if an interested party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were to present data indicating that a potentially significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subset of the fleet, not tested by the applicant, was especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> susceptible to the negative effects of the additive, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could reasonably require specific testing on representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> models of that sub-fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its decision, the Agency also stated that it believes it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is reasonable to consider the effect of a fuel on vehicles'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to meet future emissions standards. (The ``Tier I''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tailpipe standards prescribed by section 202(g) of the Act began  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to take effect in model year 1994, which began approximately in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1993. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE> ) Therefore, regarding the Ford data mentioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the Agency stated in its decision that the concerns raised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by that data related to both current and future standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FR 25724&hyph;25790 (June 5, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although not the basis of the 1992 denial, another important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue arose during the consideration of Ethyl's third and fourth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications. The Agency, as well as several commentors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed concerns regarding the possible adverse health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an increase in airborne manganese resulting from MMT use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These concerns were centered around: (1) The known severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxic effects of high-level exposure to manganese through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhalation, (2) the lack of data regarding the chronic effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of low-level inhalation exposure to manganese in humans, and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lack of knowledge regarding potential exposures due to MMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. It was repeatedly pointed out by commenters that neurotoxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage could occur prior to the onset of overt symptoms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those proceedings, Ethyl also submitted comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding manganese emissions. Ethyl indicated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manganese emissions resulting from the use of MMT in unleaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline would be so small as to not materially affect human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to airborne manganese. In support of its view, Ethyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted analyses and data on exposure modeling and monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in both its 1990 and 1991 applications (and in subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submissions associated with the remand discussed below). (The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of manganese emissions and public health is discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more detail in Section VI of this document.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Failure to ratify will put jobs at risk, Scots told MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, warned yesterday that tens of thousands of jobs north of the border would disappear if Britain failed to ratify the Maastricht treaty. The warning followed one by Sir Leon Brittan, Britain's senior EC Commissioner, that Britain would become a less attractive place for new investment by countries outside the EC if it was seen to be a reluctant member of the EC. Mr Lang told a gathering of leading Scots at Gleneagles, Tayside, that if Britain failed to ratify Maastricht it would 'undermine the confidence in us of those partners with whom we do so much business. That would damage our reputation beyond repair'. Mr Lang said failure to ratify the treaty would hurt the export-led Scottish economy particularly badly and 'cost tens of thousands of Scottish jobs'. Both men were addressing the international forum of the Scottish Council Development and Industry, an annual conference of 200 of the most prominent people in Scotland. A substantial majority of those present appeared to be in favour of Maastricht. In an impassioned after-dinner speech on Thursday, Sir Leon urged Britain to ratify the treaty. Companies from the US and Japan that had set up manufacturing plants in Britain to exploit the single European market were asking whether Britain was going to be part of the new Community or was going to be 'cast adrift' in second-class membership. That is a significant worry for Scotland, where about 25 per cent of manufacturing employment is in foreign-owned factories. Britain needed to ratify Maastricht to ensure that the rules of the single market were applied fully, Sir Leon said. That would not happen if Europe was thrown into turmoil because of Britain's failure to ratify the treaty.</p>

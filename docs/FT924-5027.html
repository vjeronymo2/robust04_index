			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: A new flag is flying over the City - London THE Lutyens cupola on the Midland Bank building opposite the Bank of England carries a new, startling flag these days: the red and white triangles of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. That symbolic presence in the heart of the City is reflected in the stock market. Silently, almost without anyone noticing, HSBC Holdings, the Hongkong Bank's parent, has become a powerful influence on the market's movements. HSBC Holdings now makes up three per cent of the value of the FT-SE 100 index. Since its purchase of Midland Bank in July, when HSBC joined the index, its shares have more than doubled, pulling the index up with them. The sterling-denominated line of stock (there is also a line denominated in Kong Kong dollars) was selling at 236p earlier in the summer; it is now 523p, down from its high of 570p. Why such a big rise? One analyst who follows the group closely offers a number of reasons. 'Very crudely,' he says, 'one third of the rise was due to the devaluation of sterling - HSBC is probably the largest dollar earner in the UK market. Another 20-30 per cent is due to the rise in the Hong Kong stock market.' A third element is a greater familiarity with the share among UK investors and analysts. 'In the past, when nobody here knew much about it, there was an obvious reaction: discount the growth. They now trust it more than they did, so that discount has dropped. And finally, the results in August were exceptionally good, and contrasted with yet another dismal set of earnings from UK banks.' The outlook for the stock hinges in part on political developments in Hong Kong - the shares have dropped back from their highs as a result of the row between Chris Patten, the colony's governor, and the government of China. But it is noticeable that the sterling line of stock, which originally traded at a 6-7 per cent discount to the Hong Kong dollar line, is now trading at a slight premium. Though the shares may still be under-represented in UK institutional portfolios, they are becoming a routine part of City life - just like the red-and-white flag. HSBC stands out when you look at how the equity market has performed between May, when the FT-SE index marked a record close, and the fresh record set this week. On Friday, the index closed at 2,760.6, 28.2 points higher than the week before and 22.8 points above the record set on May. Before turning to individual shares' performance, start by looking at the upper line in the chart. Since the index was launched, it has traced out - the collective frenzy of 1987 apart - a set of uneven oscillations around a strong central trend. Each new leg of the market is greeted with great excitement from the equity-watchers; lines drawn on charts; predictions of glory and despair. And all for nothing, because the underlying trend is quite clear: averaged over the period, a steady 12 per cent a year growth in the values of the country's leading stocks. There are two ways, however, in which that tidy pattern is misleading. One of them is shown in the lower chart, which tracks the index in real terms, adjusted for inflation. The underlying performance is halved, to a trend growth rate of six per cent. More important, the steady pattern disappears. Instead, the index traces out three stages: double-digit real growth from 1984 to 1986; a wild surge up and down in 1987; and sideways movement thereafter. In real terms, share prices have budged very little in the past seven years. Second, the neat pattern traced by the index conceals much bigger swings by industry sectors and companies. Between May and Thursday of this week, the index was unchanged. But bank shares have risen 16 per cent; and telephone and electricity utilities 14 per cent. Just as important, contractors have dropped 40 per cent and aerospace companies 37 per cent. Even related businesses have performed quite differently: composite insurers rose 11 1/2 per cent, but insurance brokers fell 29 per cent. Within those industry sectors, performance has varied widely. That is where HSBC comes in, pushing the banks into first place. Otherwise only Lloyds Bank, up 17 per cent, and National Westminster, with a rise of 7 per cent, can claim any glory. Bank of Scotland, Barclays, TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland all fell in value. (This week, interestingly, Barclays was a strong performer, closing up 17p at 373p - thanks to a sudden burst of unanimity among analysts who follow the stock that the dividend was safe.) HSBC apart, none of the FT-SE gainers had a really outstanding performance over the period. But the real FT-SE basket cases would have lost you nearly half your money in six months. BET has fallen 48 per cent since May; Arjo Wiggins Appleton 46 per cent; and Rolls-Royce 45 per cent. Such tales of woe apart, the market was driven on this week by one of its recurrent waves of optimism about the economic outlook. Leo Doyle, of Kleinwort Benson, drew attention to the fact that the volume of retail sales is back at record levels. (The shops only seem empty, he says, because there's Sunday opening and all that extra out-of-town space.) SG Warburg's economists listed nine separate pieces of positive news - though most of these were of the things-aren't-actually-getting-worse variety. Still, as they point out, BT reported a 1-2 per cent year-on-year increase in inland telephone calls during the three months to end-September, in place of an expected 1 per cent decline. We do not know, of course, how many of those callers were Access employees trying to speak to the chancellor of the exchequer about the little matter of an overdue account . . .</p>

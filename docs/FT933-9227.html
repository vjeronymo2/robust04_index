			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / New draft details SA regional powers THE second draft of an outline multiracial constitution for South Africa was unveiled yesterday, providing for the first time a fairly detailed view of the powers of regions within a future federal state. The document, which follows widespread criticism of the first draft unveiled two weeks ago, goes some way towards allaying fears that a future central government could have its own way. The government/National Party, Democratic Party and Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) all complained that the original draft offered insufficient powers to the regions. This deficiency was one of the main reasons causing the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party and the right-wing Conservative Party to withdraw from the talks last month. Although the latest draft represents a considerable change on its forerunner, spelling out the nature and extent of powers regions will exercise, it is unlikely to draw Inkatha back to negotiations. Concern about how a future constituent assembly will behave if there is disagreement over the final form of a constitution has still to be addressed. The technical committee drafting the constitution yesterday sought further guidance from negotiators on this point. Inkatha's central committee will be reviewing its participation in negotiations when it meets on Saturday. The latest draft says regional governments will have 'exclusive legislative competences', in 15 different functional areas ranging from planning powers and service delivery to tourism and casinos. These powers may not be altered by the national government except in accord with special circumstances identified in the constitution, and only to the extent that the constitution allows intervention. In the main areas of government such as education, health, agriculture and housing, regional governments will enjoy 'concurrent legislative competence' with the national government. This means, in the words of the drafters, that the national government cannot use its powers to negate those of the region. In the event of a dispute over powers, this will be settled by a court.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Polish row over interest rates The Polish government has called on the country's central bank to lower interest rates and attacked the bank's recent decision to lower the adjustable monthly devaluation rate - which devalues the zloty in order to keep exports competitive - from 1.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The government statement deepens a row over how best to deal with growing foreign currency inflows which are inflating the money supply and increasing inflationary pressures. It came as senior western commercial bankers gathered in Warsaw to sign a deal reducing Poland's Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9bn) commercial debt by 49.5 per cent which could produce capital inflows worth more than Dollars 1bn a year. Poland's net foreign debt stood at Dollars 44bn at the end of last April. Capital inflows from cross-border trading, including hard currency from citizens of the former Soviet Union who come to Poland to purchase consumer goods, have also swelled reserves. The resulting growth in money supply has led the central bank to refuse to make the 1 per cent interest rate cut which the government is now openly demanding. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

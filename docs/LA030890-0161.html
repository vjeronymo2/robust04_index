			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NERVE GAS WEAPONS DUE TO BE OUT OF WEST GERMANY BY SEPTEMBER  </P> <P> U.S. and West German officials announced Wednesday that all the deadly nerve  gas chemical weapons stored in the federal republic will be removed by the end  of September.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg pleaded with West Germans to help ensure  that there are "no attempts at disruption" of the outbound shipments of the  chemical weapons, which will begin in July.  </P> <P> Stoltenberg said the removal will contribute toward a world-wide chemical  weapons ban and an early U.S.-Soviet agreement to destroy poison gas  stockpiles.  </P> <P> The U.S. chemical weapons on German soil have long been criticized by peace  activists and environmentalists.  </P> <P> "In the interest of a safe pull-out," said Stoltenberg at a news conference  here, "I appeal to all citizens who may be affected in any particular way by  this issue: Help to make sure that the withdrawal of all chemical weapons is  carried out without danger and without attempts at disruption."  </P> <P> The defense minister did not spell out what form of "disruption" he had in  mind.  </P> <P> U.S. Gen. John Heldstab, deputy chief of staff for operations of the U.S. Army  in Europe, said the chemicals stored at Clausen represented 1% of all such U.S.  weapons.  </P> <P> The chemical weapons, in artillery shells, will be trucked from Clausen, the  ammunition depot near the French border where they have been stored for 20  years, to Miesau, about 20 miles away. There, they will be put on trains and  hauled to the North Sea port of Nordenham.  </P> <P> They will then be loaded aboard U.S. ships and carried to the Army Chemical  Activity on Johnson Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, where they will be destroyed.  </P> <P> Stoltenberg said that heavy security will be in place when the 100,000  artillery shells, tipped with nerve gas, are removed to make sure that every  precaution is taken for safety. The ammunition handlers and truck drivers will  be specially trained, officials said.  </P> <P> The large shells, 155 and 203 millimeters in diameter, will be placed in  airtight steel cases, the officials said, and packed in 5,000 transport  containers. West German police will guard the shipments from the depot to the  port, and commercial flights over the route to be used by the trucks or trains  will be banned, they said.  </P> <P> In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan told Chancellor Helmut Kohl that all U.S.  chemical weapons would be withdrawn from West Germany by 1992. That timetable  was pushed forward last year by President Bush.  </P></p>

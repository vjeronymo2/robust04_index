			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Prudential set to reduce directors' service contracts The Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest investing institution, is poised to follow the trend of other large companies and cut the length of its directors' service contracts. This follows mounting criticism from institutional shareholders of large payouts to directors who have resigned while holding long service contracts which entitle them to payouts of up to three times their basic salary. The move would also be a significant reversal of the Prudential's policy on directors' contracts. It has previously given three-year rolling contracts strong support. Last June it said: 'If we want to recruit and retain the right quality of executive on to our board, we need to offer them a competitive remuneration package and currently a three-year contract is part of that deal.' This comment was in response to the launch of a campaign by PosTel, the Pounds 25bn pension fund, calling for a reduction in the length of service contracts. PosTel votes against the election or re-election of directors with rolling employment contracts longer than two years. The Prudential's change of policy is likely to remove the possibility of PosTel embarrassing the Pru at its annual meeting in May. Sir Martin Jacomb, the chairman of PosTel, is due to become non-executive chairman of the Prudential at that meeting. Five executive directors at the Prudential, including Mr Mick Newmarch, the chief executive, have three-year rolling contracts. These are likely to be re-placed with shorter contracts - probably two-year rolling contracts - following an examination by the board's remuneration committee. 'There is a recognition here now that three-year rolling contracts are passe,' a senior Prudential executive said yesterday. The company confirmed the study and the conclusion that 'the market seems to be moving away from three-year rolling contracts'. The Prudential denied that Sir Martin's appointment as chairman had influenced its decision to launch the study. The company added that it would not try to impose similar cuts in the length of directors' contracts in the companies in which it holds shares. Other big public companies, such as Guinness and British Gas, have recently shortened their directors' contracts. Lex, Page 18</p>

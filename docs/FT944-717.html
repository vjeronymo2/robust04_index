			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / LME member fined Pounds 60,000 for rules breach The London Metal Exchange has imposed a fine of Pounds 60,000 on Sucden (UK), part of the Compagnie Financiere Sucres et Denrees (CFSD) group of France. It is believed to be the first substantial fine imposed by the LME's disciplinary committee under its self-regulatory system. The LME said that its rules had been breached in May when Sucden (UK) had applied to change from associate membership to one of the LME's 18 ring-dealing members. Sucden (UK) had not disclosed that CFSD was looking for a partner - and possibly a majority shareholder - in Terminvest, its immediate parent. The exchange's rules insist that every applicant for change of membership status should disclose all material information, including any possible change in ownership, even of a minority interest, in an immediate parent company. The LME said its fine would have been more severe were it not for the fact that the offence was one of omission and 'no statement of fact was made to the LME which constituted a positive misrepresentation by Sucden'. There were also circumstances that 'rendered the failure to disclose partially excusable'. Negotiations took place for the Winchester Commodities group to take over Sucden (UK) after it gained ring-dealing status, but these were called off at the end of November. CFSD recently restructured its futures trading operations and said Sucden (UK) was no longer for sale.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Government rejects Scottish milk merger THE government has rejected a proposed takeover by the Scottish Milk Marketing Board of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk business in Scotland, following a recommendation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission yesterday. The MMC ruled that the combined entity would be more efficient but might abuse its large share of the Scottish market by giving preferential treatment to its own commercial operations and raising prices for both raw and processed milk. These dangers would arise after 1994, when the Scottish MMB is likely to become a voluntary producers' co-operative. The Scottish MMB, one of three milk marketing boards in Scotland, purchases milk from farmers and sells it for processing. It produces its own milk for retail sale under the Scottish Pride and Scottish Farm labels. The MMC's decision could have a bearing on the future of the Milk Marketing Board in England and Wales, which the government also wants to see becoming a voluntary co-operative. The scheme, for which legislation is before parliament, is opposed by private dairy companies. The MMC's decision will be seen as a victory for independent Scottish processors, who felt that the Scottish MMB was increasing its vertical integration in the Scottish market in advance of the shake-up in 1994, and expanding its liquid milk processing. Yesterday the CWS said the decision had very little to do with the sale of its milk operation in Scotland and 'much to do with the deregulation of the milk marketing scheme'. It said it was absurd that it had taken the Scottish Office and the regulatory authorities 18 months to come to this conclusion.</p>

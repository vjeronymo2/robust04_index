			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski, Zbigniew Lentowicz, and </F> Jerzy Pilczynski: "The Belweder Putsch"]    [Text] Let us make the assumption that everything is for  real--that the coalition does not want to blackmail the  president but wants to really restrict his powers, that the  president not only wanted to frighten the coalition but will  really dissolve the Sejm. In other words, let us assume that it  is not merely a game but that the coalition and the president  will really do what they said they would do.    Right now, the president does not have any possibility of  dissolving the Sejm in line with the law. Now, if he does  dissolve the Sejm, it will be illegal (this will be discussed  below).    There will be no one who would be able to bring the  president  before the State Tribunal for dissolving the Sejm illegally.  This can be done only by the National Assembly, which will no  longer exist (unless the coalition amends this article of the  Small Constitution).    It may also happen that the Sejm speaker will not act on the  president's decision and will convene the National Assembly  anyway. The situation that will develop then will somewhat  resemble a coup d'etat.    It seems that the president will not be able to dissolve the  Sejm efficiently (that is, not only make the decision, but  execute it)...  <H5>  Without the Aid of the Army and the Police </H5>   Will he really be able to count on these services to support  him?    In line with the estimates of observers, during the last  election, a substantial part of the cadres supported the  Democratic Left Alliance. ``Nevertheless, among the officers.  there would certainly be people who would definitely support the  president's decision to dissolve the parliament. Most of them,  however, would consider such a measure to be an illegal attempt  on democracy, says a high-ranking officer.    ``The president is enjoying considerable respect among the  military people for what he is doing for the defense system,''  he says, confirming our information. He immediately adds,  however, that, in other areas, the Belweder is evaluated very  critically by the cadres. The Army hopes that, just as in  previous disputes, this one will also be resolved where it  emerged--at the political platform--and that the Army will be  able to keep away from the commotion.  <H5>  "It Would Be A Misfortune </H5>   ...for all of us, particularly for the Army, if even in the  most acute political conflict, one of the parties asked the Army  for support," claims Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, spokesman of the  Ministry of National Defense [MON].    Theoretically, in the present composition of the National  Defense Committee [KOK], which is empowered to, among other  things, forward a motion to the president requesting the  imposition of the state of emergency, the people linked to the  Belweder are in a majority. Apart from the KOK chairman--the  president himself--the core of the committee "proper for dealing  with the issues of defense and security of the state" is made up  of the heads of the so-called presidential ministries: the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  and MON (the defense minister is, by his office, the deputy of  the KOK chairman), and the head of the General Staff, appointed  by the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, as well as the  KOK secretary, who also steers the National Security Council.  This group also includes a member of the President's Office,  appointed by the president.    The minority "progovernmental" option within KOK, in a  hypothetical conflict, includes first of all the prime minister  (whom the KOK chairman has appointed as his first deputy), the  speakers of both chambers of parliament, and the head of the  Finance Ministry. The decisions of a collective body such as  KOK are made by a majority of votes. Thus, the propresidential  section of KOK has a theoretical chance to win the ballot on  forwarding a motion to the president, requesting the imposition  of a state of emergency.    We asked Lech Falandysz, secretary of state in the  President's Office, whether he believes that the president will  dissolve the Sejm, even if he were to violate the law.    ``If the coalition implemented its initiative--that is, if  we  really witnessed a change in the political system--one would  have to think about what to do. As a rule, it so happens in  democratic countries that a change in the political system is  accompanied by new elections. I do not think that the president  will decide to violate the law. Therefore,  <H5>  The Sejm Will Not Be Dissolved </H5>   ...if the law does not allow him to do so. He may take  advantage of the formula of `bowing to higher priorities.'  However, I do not think so because it is a general and bad  formula. Well, the option of a `lesser evil' might be chosen,  but we have already had that.''    "The president will not yield to blackmail; however, I  believe that he will not violate the law, either," we were told  by Lech Falandysz.    The interviews we have conducted with the representatives of  several groupings--Henryk Wujec of the Democratic Union, Jerzy  Eysymontt of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, Krzysztof  Krol of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, and Piotr  Zak of "Solidarity"--suggest that none of them...  <H5>  Would Approve of a Violation of the Law </H5>   ...by the president.    The provisions of the Small Constitution are in this case  not  very favorable to the president, and, in addition, they are  rather clear. If Walesa wanted to choose Yeltsin's option, the  senate is an obstacle. Article 19 of the Small Constitution  does empower the president and the Sejm to order a referendum;  however, first the senate must give its consent.    The constitutional law entitles the president to impose a  state of emergency on part or on the whole of the state's  territory. There are two reasons to do this: first, a natural  calamity, and, second, a threat to the internal security of the  state. Even though it seems that it is quite a broad concept,  it can be extended only to certain limits. When a state of  emergency is in effect, the Sejm cannot be dissolved, and the  electoral laws as well as the Constitution cannot be changed.  As far as the specific conditions of the functioning of a state  of emergency are concerned, the Constitution makes a reference  to a specific law. It was passed in 1983 and was amended when  constitutional amendments were being passed in 1989. A state of  emergency would merely freeze the situation and not resolve the  problem. In addition, it can be prolonged only once every three  months, after the Sejm gives its consent. Thus, after three  months, it would be necessary to submit a report on the illegal  introduction of the state of emergency to the same parliament.    One might think about another possibility, a different  sequence of events: The president first dissolves the Sejm, then  imposes the state of emergency. However, the Small Constitution  envisions four cases in which the president can dissolve the  Sejm; three of them contain clear limitations. None of them are  possible right now. One might speculate even further and include  the presidential powers in the extraordinary activities defined  in Article 28 of the Constitution; it says that the president  sees to it that the Constitution is observed and defends the  sovereignty and security of the state. However, it is difficult  to imagine that such activities might go against any clear  provisions of the Constitution.</p>

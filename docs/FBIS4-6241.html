			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Some 2,000 students of  South Korea held a rally in Seoul on April 16 against the  treacherous farm market opening by the traitor Kim Yong-sam,  according to a foreign press report.    After the rally, they went over to a demonstration and  marched toward the U.S. Embassy in Sejong Street, Seoul,  clashing with riot police and shouting "Yankees, Go Home" and  "Oppose Foreign Farm Goods".    The protesters carried U.S. flags with an "x" drawn across  them to show their anti-American resolution.</p>

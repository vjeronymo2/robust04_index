Samples were taken near the area of  suspected use or storage of chemicals and well as water from  puddles and ponds near the fields. The samples were analyzed for  the concentration of such organic pollutants as chlorophenols,  polycyclical aromatic hydrocarbons (PAU), and pesticides by  using a combination of gas-liquid chromatography (GZhKh) and  mass spectrometry (MS). To this end, 50 g samples were mixed  with 200 ml of 50% aqueous acetone and filtered, after  which  the residue was extracted in 100 ml of the same mixture, while  the extract was reduced by evaporation. Total ion current (PIT)  mass spectrograms of the water extract from a puddle near carrot  and other fields and mass spectrograms with various retention  times are plotted. The findings demonstrate that various toxic  substances are found in the samples taken near the poisoning  locations, especially near pesticide storage facilities, but in  most cases, no abnormally high concentrations of residual  amounts exceeding the maximum permissible concentration were  detected except for one sample. The data are not sufficient for  a complete statistical estimate of the total field contamination  and for pinpointing the specific cause yet point toward the  presence of individual localized contamination of the territory  with possible harmful impacts on agricultural workers.

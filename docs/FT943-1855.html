			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Ashdown edges closer to Labour: Lib Dem leader sets PR as price of any deal Mr Paddy Ashdown will today seek to nudge the Liberal Democrats further in the direction of co-operation with Mr Tony Blair's Labour party by suggesting that the two parties could build a bipartisan consensus on issues such as the future of the National Health Service. But, in an attempt to narrow Liberal Democrat divisions over his push for an accommodation with Labour, he will use his closing speech to the party conference to set the price for any formal deal between the two parties as a Labour commitment to proportional representation. His speech, previewed yesterday by senior aides, will attempt to walk a tightrope - holding the door of co-operation open to Mr Blair while reassuring his own party that the Liberal Democrats will not be 'rolled over' in any discussions. Mr Blair's reaction to the idea of cross-party collaboration on the health service will be seen as a test of his commitment to what Mr Ashdown refers to as a new style of pluralist politics. The speech will follow indications yesterday from senior party figures that the Liberal Democrats plan to counter the electoral threat from Labour by focusing all their resources at the next general election on 70 or 80 seats  -most of them Tory held - where they have a chance of winning. But Mr Ashdown's attempts during a difficult and unpredictable Brighton conference to hold open the door to Mr Blair were clouded when the new Liberal Democrat party president launched a strong attack on the new Labour leader. Mr Robert Maclennan accused Mr Blair of reducing Labour to 'a sort of smiling anaemia'. Mr Maclennan subsequently told journalists that he was determined there should be no 'behind-the-scenes bargaining with Labour'. Mr Ashdown, who is expected to chide the party conference gently for its defiance of the party leadership in two conference votes, plans to use his speech to set a series of 'benchmarks' against which the Liberal Democrats can judge the prospects for a closer relationship with Labour. But with the substantial anti-Labour group within his party threatening open revolt against any formal alliance, Mr Ashdown will stress that support for proportional representation would be the price he would demand for supporting a future Labour government.</p>

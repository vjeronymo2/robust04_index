			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Belgrade currency plummets THE Yugoslav federal government last night devalued the dinar by 98.65 per cent in an attempt to stop the monetary system collapsing. The new dinar is pegged at 700,000 to USDollars 1. But the move was unlikely to shore up the currency as the devaluation fell short of the recent sharp drop in the dinar on the black market. Stores in Belgrade yesterday closed after frantic shoppers bought up whatever remained on the shelves. Inflation last month was 2,000 per cent. The national mint worked non-stop printing dinars to cover the cost of the wars in Bosnia and Croatia. Serbia had also been hard hit by 17 months of UN sanctions and the breakdown of trade ties. Meanwhile, efforts to revive the moribund peace process in Bosnia yesterday failed to stop a surge in violence as a mortar attack on a school in Sarajevo killed three children and their teacher and wounded at least 20 other children. Three people died in shelling elsewhere in the city. In Mostar, Croat tanks demolished a famous bridge, built in 1566 and which embodied the heritage of the southwestern town. 'It was a shot in the heart and soul of every inhabitant of Mostar,' a local Moslem leader told Bosnian radio.</p>

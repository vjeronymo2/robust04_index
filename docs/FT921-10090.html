			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU leader calls for market-friendly farming - David Naish believes UK growers accept the need for change LOW INVESTMENT, falling incomes, job losses and uncertainty over political reforms have continued to batter the UK farm sector over the past 12 months since David Naish became president of the National Farmers' Union. But he believes that the farmers have taken on board the need to change their attitudes and get a lot closer to the market. He will be urging his members to become even more businesslike when he addresses his first annual general meeting as president on Tuesday next week. 'The willingness of farmers to accept new disciplines has been amazing,' he said. This does not apply only to the marketing side of farming. 'Four years ago could you have seen farmers through their trade organisation offering an animal welfare policy, a pesticide residue policy, an environment policy? They recognise they've got to actually live with all the other organisations and people who care about what happens in the countryside.' But the need for professionalism when it is time to sell the crop remains uppermost in his mind. 'I am extraordinarily keen that farmers don't believe that they can just respray themselves and be professional market men.' The Food from the Countryside scheme is a key part of the NFU's new policy. A help desk has been set up each of the nine regional offices for people who are even thinking about simple collaborative ventures. In April a series of workshops will start with speakers from successful collaborative ventures as well as food industry representatives and buyers who can explain what they are looking for from the farmers. All the other professional bodies needed to create a successful venture will be represented, including all five clearing banks, accountants, and management consultancies. The workshops will be followed up with a series of regional food fares where the multiple retailers, manufacturers and caterers will be available to any groups who are thinking of becoming what Mr Naish terms 'reservoirs of British produce'. But he does not believe it is in the farmers' interests to form millions more ventures. Rather they should join existing organisations, not just to get more muscle against the supermarkets' buying power but in order to be 'to be able to guarantee the level of supply that's required to get access to those multi-distributional warehouses or the manufacturity of supply to keep the warehouses running'. Much criticism has been aimed at the supermarkets by the farming community. At the recent Oxford Farming Conference, one of the speakers had to apologise after jokingly asking the difference between a supermarket buyer and a terrorist. Answer: you can negotiate with a terrorist. However, Mr Naish refuses to be critical of supermarket profits. 'I'm not going to snipe in any way at retailer markets because they get those margins either because we're weak sellers or they're very strong buyers and I believe we are weak sellers and we've got to get over that.' He recognises that farmers have to get more from the market place, no question of that, and the way to get more from the market place is to grow what your customers want, not what you want to grow. 'Then you're in a position to ask a realistic payment for it.' He is not above criticising the farmers themselves, and repeatedly stresses the need for discipline. There are a lot of examples of farmers, having said they were going to collaborate, trying to duck under the net and evade their responsibilities, he believes. 'The successful co-operatives have a very high degree of discipline at the moment and I believe that's the major route to success,' he says. He quotes his own experience to illustrate the rapidly changing nature of UK farming. Six years ago he did not know where any of the potatoes grown on 140 acres on his farm went after harvest. 'I now don't put a potato in the ground that has not got a market at the other end, providing it meets quality standards.' He is similarly certain of markets for his peas, oilseed rape and lamb, 'although I haven't done it properly yet with the cereals'. He is proud of UK farmers' record in the past, when the need for production overrode every other issue, and points out that at the end of the 1970s government white papers were predicting food shortages now. Many of the cows that are still milking today were being born then, he says. Cultural differences in the UK, particularly the system of primogeniture in land inheritance, have held back development of the co-operation from which continental European farmers have benefitted. But there are also fiscal differences throughout the EC, and Mr Naish knows that attaining an equitable trading environment will be anything but easy. He detests the uncertainty surrounding the two major issues facing European farmers - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. The NFU wants a Gatt settlement - but it does not want to see things settled in favour of the Americans. Mr Naish is strongly critical of Gatt director-general Mr Arthur Dunkel's proposals to break the Gatt deadlock, and believes proposed changes in tariffication on imports will lead to 'extraordinarily competitive' prices for US wheat. This might lead to some healthy consumer prices in the UK, he admits, but 'frankly you'll see huge disruption, both to agriculture and the countryside, which I believe is the adverse proportion to the goodness that will be gained from getting that Gatt settlement'. He is resentful of any suggestion that the NFU is merely reacting to Brussels decisions and not putting forward policies of its own. He has forged strong links with Copa, the association of EC farming unions, which believes supply management is the right way forward for professional farmers on commercially viable holdings. However, Copa's proposals have been ignored by the politicians. Meanwhile he is under no illusions of the task ahead for the UK's farmers. The industry has been stripped of its excesses and is still going downhill, weakening the base from which its business can be run. 'Your readers generally will say that is what has been happening in industry - but we've been having it for 10 years.'</p>

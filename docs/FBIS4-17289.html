			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Davidyants report: "Ivanovo -- City of </F> Unemployed? The Crisis in Light Industry and the Textile  Industry Can Be Surmounted Only Through Joint Efforts by the  Center and the Regions"]    [Text] Production volumes in the textile industry and  light industry have fallen more than 50 percent over the past  three years. Today only a small proportion of enterprises is  continuing to work steadily, while a further drop in production  is occurring in the bulk of factories. A fall in production  volumes has been noted for literally all types of output. The  financial position of enterprises is continuing to deteriorate.  As a result of the government's inflexible monetary and credit  policy producers do not have the working capital to acquire raw  materials. Because of this many factories are on the verge of  bankruptcy, the majority of them are going over to a short work  day and a short work week, and they have been forced to make  people take unpaid leave.    The critical situation which has taken shape in the sector  necessitated the urgent holding in Moscow of an enlarged session  of the board of the Russian Interregional Union of Textile and  Light Industry Entrepreneurs. Boris Fomin, its president,  pointed out that this is the first time the sector's problems  have been discussed at such a high level. Representatives of  the Russian Federation State Committee for Industrial Policy,  the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, and the  Central Bank participated in the work of the conference in  addition to leaders of enterprises. Representatives of 37  Russian Federation kray and oblast administrations were also  invited to the capital.    In Boris Fomin's opinion, the situation can be rectified if  enterprises are given assistance out of local budgets. As is  known, the federal budget today controls only 15 percent of all  the funds, the rest of the money being in the regions. It is no  coincidence that, as experience shows, the situation is far  better where the leaders of krays and oblasts devote proper  attention to enterprises' problems, allocate credits to them,  and help them to acquire raw materials. But this does not mean,  of course, that the government must entirely dissociate itself  from the sector's problems; on the contrary, without state  support for enterprises during this transitional period it is  hardly possible to reckon on the successful implementation of  economic reforms.    The appeal to the country's leadership adopted by the  participants in the enlarged session of the Union of Textile and  Light Industry Entrepreneurs says that the sector is in a very  grave position today. Hidden unemployment, which already has  more than 700,000 working people in its grip, the majority of  whom are women, is escalating into real unemployment. Wages are  not paid for several months. People can see no way out of the  present situation and have been reduced to despair, there is  growing indignation at the government's failure to take  effective measures, and strike committees are being set up. The  appeal proposes a whole number of specific measures that might  halt the collapse of these sectors of industry.    The results of the conference were examined at a session of  the Russian Federation Government Commission on Operational  Questions under the chairmanship of First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to find an  opportunity to grant to enterprises a deferment of the repayment  of the preferential centralized credits issued in the sum total  of 8.7 billion rubles [R], including R1.3 billion for Ivanovo  Oblast, and to postpone the deadline for repaying the said  credits until 1 January 1995. In addition, measures will be  taken jointly with the Bank of Russia to prolong until 1 July  1994 the centralized credits to the tune of R32.4 billion  received by textile and light industry enterprises in 1993 to  acquire raw materials at the prime rate of the Bank of Russia,  as well as measures to prolong through the end of this year the  credits to the tune of R44 billion allocated to Ivanovo Oblast  enterprises on the same terms. It was also decided to grant to  individual textile and light industry enterprises in Ivanovo  Oblast a six-month deferment of payments of profits tax and VAT  into the federal budget to the tune of R25 billion.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GERBER RECALLS TOUGH OAT CEREAL  </P> <P> Gerber Products Co. today recalled some shipments of Toasted Oat Rings because  a new manufacturing process made the cereal too hard for some children to  swallow.  </P> <P> "The Food and Drug Administration has been notified . . . and removal of the  product from retail store and wholesale grocer warehouses is under way," said  Ron Lovasz, vice president of quality control for Gerber.  </P> <P> Some parents reported that their children had trouble swallowing the rings, so  the company voluntarily recalled 7-ounce packages of the cereal with "Better If  Used By" codes of 30MAY90 through 15AUG90, Gerber said in a news release.  </P></p>

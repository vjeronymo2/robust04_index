			<p>BFN     [Text] The Peruvian Communist Party [PCP], during the  plenary session of its Central Committee, decided to support the  possible presidential candidacy of Javier Perez de Cuellar, in  an effort to unify the democratic, political, and social forces  of the country based on a consensus program.    The possible candidacy of Perez de Cuellar was supported  because it could open the path for the installation in the  country of a democratic regime capable of ending dictatorship  and effectively fighting poverty and unemployment.    The PCP, headed by Jorge del Prado and Secretary General  Renan Raffo Munoz, said the current administration is trying to  remain in government to continue a neoliberal policy that has  eliminated social and economic rights, worsened the crisis, and  run rampant over democratic institutions.    The 10th PCP Plenary Session also decided to hold the  Ideological, Programmatic, and Organizational National  Conference from 26 to 28 August in Ica.    The political programmatic guidelines to be debated include  the "reestablishment of democratic institutions with the full  enforcement of civil, political, and social freedom." It will  also debate the democratization of the state, the main role of  which should be the promotion and management of overall  development through coordinated planning and the market; and the  implementation of municipal and regional decentralization and  autonomy.</p>

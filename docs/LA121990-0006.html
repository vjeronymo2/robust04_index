			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S SON SENTENCED IN ROBBERIES  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam became a spectator in court Tuesday as he  watched his 33-year-old son sentenced to one year in County Jail for robbing  two taxicab drivers.  </P> <P> Earl Kenneth Gilliam was also placed on five years' probation, fined $200 and  ordered to repay cabbie John Plough the $66 stolen from him Aug. 10.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz specified that Gilliam be tested  for drug use every two weeks, attend drug counseling three times a week and  refrain from using public transportation.  </P> <P> The judge said that, if Gilliam violates the terms of his probation, he will go  to prison for as long as 10 years. The sentence will be reviewed April 24.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Garrett Randall had suggested a four-year state prison term.  He said Gilliam had admitted to robbing the drivers to get money to obtain  cocaine.  </P> <P> Gilliam pleaded guilty to robbing Plough and cabdriver Raymond Garcia on Sept.  18. Garcia lost a gold chain that was recovered by police.  </P> <P> Gilliam, who could have received a maximum seven years and four months in  prison, apologized to Plough, saying, "You did not deserve to be treated that  way."  </P> <P> He said he had been up all night using drugs before the 8 a.m. holdup.  </P> <P> "I'm really very ashamed of what I've done," Gilliam said. "I know I'm guilty .  . . and I have some serious problems emotionally. I have drug problems,  depression. One thing I don't want to do is drugs or alcohol anymore."  </P> <P> Judge Gilliam was appointed to the federal bench in 1980 by President Jimmy  Carter and was a Superior Court judge for many years in the 1970s.  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Blick rise 14% to Pounds 4.98m The Pounds 57.6m acquisition last October of Time and Security from Mercury Communicat-ions helped Blick, the communications systems and time products company, lift interim profits by 14 per cent and turnover by 48 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 4.98m in the six months to end March, while turnover increased from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 24m. Operating profits were 31 per cent ahead at Pounds 5.34m. The company attributed Pounds 5.8m of the increase in turnover to the acquisition, and 10 per cent to organic growth. Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said Blick had produced a strong cashflow following a cleverly structured acquisition which was on course. During the half year the group paid back Pounds 14m of bank debt incurred in the purchase, reducing gearing from 167 per cent to 81 per cent. He described the current level of business as encouraging, with a high level of customer confidence in the market. The Time division, responsible for clocking in equipment, car parks and time control software systems, showed strong growth and good margins. Operating profit rose from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 2.42m on turnover up from Pounds 6.78m to Pounds 9.24m. The Communications division, where margins are more competitive, increased turnover from Pounds 9.52m to Pounds 14.8m, and profits from Pounds 2.82m to Pounds 2.92m. Net interest payable rose to Pounds 359,000 compared with interest receivable last time of Pounds 293,000. Earnings per share increased to 12.54p from 12.42p. The interim dividend is 3.5p (3.3p).</p>

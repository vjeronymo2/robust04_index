			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.735&blank;Brakes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.735(a) would be revised to state plainly that wheel brakes must be provided. A proposed new &sect;23.735(c) would require the brake system to be designed so that the brake manufacturer's specified brake pressures are not exceeded during the landing distance determination required by &sect;23.75. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.735(e), applicable to commuter category airplanes, would require establishing the minimum rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly. Section 23.45 provides that the determination of the accelerate-stop distance for commuter category airplanes be made in accordance with the applicant's procedures for operation in service. The proposed requirement is needed to ensure that the brakes will perform safely under accelerate-stop conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.745&blank;Nose/Tail Wheel Steering <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Proposed new &sect;23.745 would provide requirements that apply if nose/tail-wheel steering is installed. Advanced airplane design technology, along with the need to safely control the airplane when it is being operated on increasingly congested airports, has resulted in several small airplanes being equipped with systems for ground steering only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed new section would not require the installation of a system for ground steering, but it would add requirements to define how such a system should function if one is installed. It would also require the steering system to be designed so that it will not interfere with any installed landing gear retraction and extension system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.775&blank;Windshields and Windows <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.775(a) would be revised to state that internal glass panels of windshields and windows must be constructed of a nonsplintering material, such as nonsplintering glass. Currently &sect;23.775(a) requires nonsplintering safety glass only. A nonsplintering material must be used to protect pilots from injury. While nonsplintering glass is an acceptable standard, other nonsplintering materials would be allowed under the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 23.775(c) would be revised to clarify that it applies to pressurized airplanes if certification for operation up to and including 25,000 feet is requested. This would not be a substantive change. It has always applied to such airplanes but is not as directly stated in the current rule as it would be in the proposed rule. Current &sect;23.775(e), which is being redesignated as &sect;23.775(d) by this notice without change, provides requirements for airplanes that are certified for operations above 25,000 feet. This revision of paragraph (c) and redesignation of paragraph (e) will clarify the requirements that are applicable to airplanes approved for operations at different altitudes. Redesignated paragraph (e) is revised to remove the masculine gender by rephrasing ``when he is seated'' to read ``when the pilot is seated.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 23.775(h), introductory text, and paragraph (h)(1) would be added to require windshield panes of commuter category airplanes that are directly in front of the pilots to withstand the impact of a two pound bird. This requirement is based on a Joint Aviation Authority recommendation to add windshield bird strike protection for commuter category airplanes. Following receipt of the recommendations, the FAA obtained and reviewed the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data on bird strikes that occurred on airplanes of 19,000 pounds or less from 1981 through 1989. These data show that approximately 550 strikes occurred and that one out of seven strikes hit the windshield. The bird strike reports, which include information on the type of bird, the airplane altitude and/or airspeed, show the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. More than one-half of the strikes (51.8 percent) occurred between the ground and 100 feet above the ground. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Another one-fourth of the strikes (26.7 percent) occurred between 101 and 1000 feet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The airplane airspeed at the time of most of the strikes (85 percent) was 150 knots or less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Where bird types were reported, 27.6 percent involved small birds and 58.6 involved medium size birds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Incidents where the airplane was damaged showed that 16.9 percent resulted from small bird strikes and 64 percent resulted from strikes involving medium size birds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of these data indicate that most bird strikes occur at takeoff and landing altitudes and airspeeds, and that medium or small birds, many weighing two pounds or less, are most often struck. Although only a few fatalities and injuries have resulted from these reported bird strikes, the data indicates a high probability of bird strikes during landings and takeoffs and the potential hazards of such strikes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed new paragraph would require that the windshield panes directly in front of the pilots of commuter category airplanes, and the supportive structure for these panes, must withstand the impact of a two-pound bird at an airplane's maximum approach flap speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.775(h)(2) would require the panels of the windshield to be arranged so that, if one is damaged, other panels will remain that will provide visibility for continuous safe flight and landing of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By requiring full protection against the strike of a two-pound bird at approach speeds, some protection will also be provided if the airplane strikes a larger bird or strikes a bird at a higher speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.783&blank;Doors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Current &sect;23.783(b) requires that passenger doors not be located with respect to any propeller disk so as to endanger persons using the door. Proposed paragraph (b) would add that passenger doors must be located in relation to any other potential hazard that could endanger persons using the door. The propeller disk remains the prominent hazard but other items, such as hot deicer surfaces or sharp objects on the airplane structure, are also hazards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new paragraph (g) would require lavatory doors, if installed, that would not trap occupants inside a closed and locked lavatory compartment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi -- Biography"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 -- The mandate handed today to  Berlusconi comes just four months after the media tycoon decided  to switch gears from private enterprise to politics, a move he  announced in a recorded statement on his own Rete Quattro  television station on January 26. "I do not want to live in an  illiberal country," the chairman of Fininvest told Italians,  adding, in a sports metaphor that would become his signature  during the campaign, that he had decided to "enter the game"  because he believed the country was "governed by immature powers  and by people tightly bound to a past which has been a failure  on a political and economical plane."    Berlusconi, 57, who abandoned the helm of one of Italy's  biggest private industrial groups to mount his Forza Italia (Go  Italy) electoral campaign, had been testing the political waters  for some time before that announcement. He said he thought  someone had to present a "viable" conservative alternative to  the coalition of Progressives led by the Left Democrat Party  (formerly the Italian Communist Party), a coalition the  businessman defined as "Communist."    When he founded Forza Italia, Berlusconi handed over to  Fedele Confalonieri, Fininvest's number two, the chairmanship  (but not the ownership) of a conglomerate which operates in the  television, advertising publishing, supermarket, insurance and  building sectors, generating net earnings of 10.5 trillion lire  (6.2 billion dollars) in 1992. He also owns the winning AC  Milan football club, which after Wednesday night's [27 April]  game is headed for its fourth European Cup final in six years.    With a considerable debt burden, the Fininvest empire  chalked  up industrial and financial current account losses for the first  time ever in 1992. Losses were due mainly to interest payments  of 738 billion lire (434 million dollars) on debts of 4.5  trillion lire (2.6 billion dollars). Net capital stood at 1.078  trillion lire (634 million dollars).    The question of how to separate Berlusconi's political role  from the influence of his media empire continues to be a vexing  one for Italian politics, with no firm solution to the problem  yet clear.    The son of a bank employee, Berlusconi began his  entrepreneurial career in 1962 at the age of 25, immediately  showing a flair for business and for threading the bureaucratic  and political red tape that quickly launched him on the Italian  business scene and propelled him into the ranks of the world's  richest men.    His first company, the Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi, was  responsible for building a housing complex for 4,000 people at  Brugherio, on the outskirts of Milan. From there, he expanded  to the Milano 2 and Milano 3 housing developments for 10,000 and  then 15,000 people, then turned his sights from construction to  media.    In mid-1979, Berlusconi entered the commercial television  field with Telemilano, a local station in Milan. A few months  later he took a quantum leap with Canale 5, the first private  television station to broadcast to a national audience.    A Constitutional Court decision in 1980 to allow private  channels to transmit over national airwaves opened up new  horizons for "Sua Emittenza" (Lord Broadcaster) who went on to  buy up Italia 1 in 1983 and Rete 4 in 1984.    A bid to enter the French television world in 1984 proved  difficult and finally collapsed in 1989, but he had more success  in Spain where he bought up a 25 percent stake in Antenna 3 in  1989.    Berlusconi's 1984 purchase of SORRISI E CANZONI TV (TV  Smiles  and Songs) magazine, today Italy's largest circulation  publication, marked his entry into the publishing world. In  1988, he took a 25 percent stake in Amef, the company which  controlled the Mondadori publishing group.    Things went far from smoothly there, when Berlusconi found  himself locked in combat with Carlo de Benedetti, the Olivetti  chief, who was forced to back down in 1990, when Berlusconi  became chairman of Mondadori, keeping the influential PANORAMA  news weekly but losing the L'ESPRESSO-LA REPUBBLICA group to De  Benedetti.    In a move this month, part of Berlusconi's promised  paring-back of his industrial empire now that his main concern  is politics, Fininvest announced that its shareholding in  Mondadori be reduced to less than 50 percent in a complex  capital operation.    Legal hassles have dogged Berlusconi, who in the 1980's  found  himself dragged into the scandal over the clandestine Propaganda  Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, of which he was a member. He denied  ever having played an active role in the outlawed lodge, but  found himself charged with perjury in connection with the  inquiries.    The late 1980's also saw him doing battle with the RAI state  broadcasting company which sued him for unfair competition and  unauthorised use of live broadcasting. The issue of who was  permitted to broadcast live was cleared up with a new  broadcasting law which many saw as tailored for the Milan  magnate.    According to his detractors, Berlusconi's close personal  friendship with disgraced Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi,  who was premier when the new broadcasting law was being drawn  up, smoothed the tycoon's path in this and other areas.    Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, started its life as a  think-tank to test the political waters and do the groundwork  for his change of career. Forza Italia linked up with the  federalist Northern League in the north of the country, and with  the National Alliance, heir to the neofascist Italian Social  Movement in the south, in two- and three-way Freedom Front  coalitions that gained the majority in the March 27-28 general  elections. (The Front won an absolute majority in the Lower  House, but a relative one in the Senate.)    With a roster of faces fresh to national politics (95  percent  of candidates had never sat in the Rome parliament before),  Forza Italia took 95 seats in the Lower House and 41 in the  Senate, less than its Freedom Front partners, making it  parliament's third biggest force. The biggest percentage of the  popular ballot, however, went to Berlusconi's party.    Forza Italia, and Berlusconi in particular, fought the  election battle on a "red peril" stance, warning the nation of  the possible dangers of control of the economy falling to the  former Communists of the Left Democratic Party.    But it was the novelty offered by Forza Italia and the  popularity of Berlusconi himself which seemed to win the new  line-up most votes in a country jaded by scandals in the  political and economic worlds, scandals in which Berlusconi and  his empire have so far managed to remain unscathed.</p>

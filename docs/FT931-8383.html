			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Seismic shock to the economic landscape: Public investment and a heavier tax burden are the keynotes of the package As an impassioned plea for a fundamental change in the nation's economic philosophy, President Bill Clinton's address to Congress may prove to be of historic significance. He argued, in effect, that Republican strategies emphasising increased incentives for individuals had failed and that the nation needed to follow a social democratic path, involving a greater emphasis on public investment and a fairer distribution of the tax burden. Mr Clinton bucked recent fiscal trends by becoming the first leader of an advanced democracy to propose a big increase in the top rate of income tax - from 31 per cent to nearly 40 per cent for the richest families. Adding in state and local taxes, top earners will face an effective top rate of about 50 per cent. Most industrial countries have been striving to reduce top marginal rates in a bid to improve economic efficiency. Although Mr Clinton deliberately targeted the rich, he raised taxes on the great bulk of American households - all families with incomes of more than Dollars 30,000 a year - thus breaking one of his main campaign pledges. However, because a significant proportion of the taxes will be used to increase public investment in infrastructure, education and training, Mr Clinton was not able to signal a wholly convincing reduction in the federal deficit. By fiscal 1997, some five years into a business cycle upswing, Mr Clinton hopes to have reduced the deficit to slightly more than Dollars 200bn, compared with nearly Dollars 300bn today. However, that still represents 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product, a significant drain on national savings at a point in the cycle when the budget ought to be close to balance, if not in surplus. Moreover, in all probability Congress will not accept all the proposed spending cuts and tax increases. And, as Mr Clinton rightly stressed, any hope of controlling the deficit in the longer term requires the enactment of effective controls on healthcare spending - a controversial issue on which a national consensus is as yet far from assured. The economic plan reflects two of Mr Clinton's deepest convictions: A public sector-led switch from consumption to investment is essential to revive long-term productivity growth and restore faith in the 'American dream'. Social solidarity is important for its own sake. Mr Clinton is telling affluent Americans that it is their duty to pay more taxes. He probably would have raised taxes on the rich even if he had not needed more revenue. Yet recent economic figures are throwing doubt on the assumptions underlying the Clinton plan, which was conceived largely as a response to the perceived economic problems of the 1980s. Hearing his 'call to economic arms', you might think the economy was still floundering in recession. In reality, the downturn ended nearly two years ago and the underlying annual rate of growth has accelerated to about 3 per cent. Business investment and profits are rebounding strongly. Jobs are admittedly not being created as fast as in previous recoveries. But the labour force is growing far less rapidly, reflecting the absorption of the 'baby-boomer' bulge in the workforce. The unemployment rate has already fallen to 7.1 per cent from a peak of 7.7 per cent last year. Productivity growth - the number one problem according to Mr Clinton - seems to be staging a spontaneous revival. Productivity increased by 2.7 per cent last year and at an annual rate of 4.0 per cent in the fourth quarter. These were the best figures for two decades. Efficiency gains are occurring throughout the economy, even in the sprawling services sector. Against this economic backdrop, the Clinton plan looks flawed. With the economic numbers improving, it is hard to understand why Mr Clinton is determined to press ahead with a short-term fiscal stimulus worth Dollars 30bn, or about 0.5 per cent of GDP. Such a Keynesian boost to an already debt-laden economy was no part of his campaign strategy. When the aim is supposedly the creation of 500,000 jobs over two years, the emphasis on investment incentives - a temporary credit for large companies and a permanent credit for small companies - may prove unwise. There is a danger that additional subsidies for capital, at time when rapidly rising healthcare premiums are raising the cost of labour, will accelerate the shift under way towards more capital-intensive forms of production. It is also curious, and perhaps unprecedented, for an administration to call simultaneously for stimulus and restraint. The attack on the deficit is long overdue but it means that Mr Clinton will be taking purchasing power out of the economy as his presidency progresses: he plans to raise taxes by about Dollars 240bn over four years and make net spending cuts (after allowing for the boost to public investment) of about Dollars 80bn. It seems naive to expect consumers and companies to react joyously to the immediate stimulus without taking account, today, of the 'austerity package' planned for later. The net effect of the package could thus be mildly deflationary, even allowing for some further decline in long bond yields. The risk of a negative impact on growth has been heightened by Mr Clinton's disregard for economic incentives. He had to cut the deficit but he did not have to rely so heavily on increases in taxes. And having targeted taxes, he could have tried to broaden the tax base rather than raise tax rates. The energy tax was a modest step in the right direction but it will raise only Dollars 22bn a year when fully phased in. It is no substitute for a European-style value-added tax which could efficiently have raised a far larger sum. This would have corrected the biggest anomaly in the US tax system (the near complete absence of levies on consumption), while inflicting no damage on incentives to save or invest. Mr Clinton instead emphasised higher rates of income and corporate taxes, only partially balanced by special concessions such as investment tax credits. In effect this is a repeal of the admired 1986 Tax Reform Act, which sought to create a 'level fiscal playing field' by eliminating loopholes and lowering tax rates. Mr Clinton may argue that considerations of fairness obliged him to raise top rates of income and corporation taxes. This was certainly the easiest course. But he could have preserved economic incentives by attacking the tax concessions that favour the wealthy: for example, the tax deductibility of pensions, health premiums and mortgage interest costs about Dollars 150bn annually in lost revenue, which is nearly twice as much as Mr Clinton hopes to raise when his rate increases are fully phased in. Mr Clinton has been preaching the need for higher public investment, a lower deficit and a fairer tax system from the day he announced his bid for the presidency. All three goals are a legitimate reaction to the 'excesses' of the 1980s and, if achieved, will bring US policies more into line with those of other industrial democracies. Whether his package will boost growth or transform the employment outlook is altogether more questionable. Nobody can claim that Mr Clinton lacks courage, however. He is attempting the most sweeping reshaping of the economic landscape since Ronald Reagan's famous tax-cutting budget of 1981. The difference is that he sees government as part of the solution rather than as part of the problem.</p>

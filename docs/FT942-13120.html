			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (28): Hankering after the old days - Zipperhead Mainframe computing specialists are wasting their time if they apply for jobs at the London International Financial Futures Exchange. For Liffe only wants young people with personal computing and Unix experience and its advertisements spell out that mainframe people are unlikely to fit the bill. Liffe says such people tend to have expertise in specific technical areas, whereas today's computing person needs an open attitude and greater adaptability. Such views among organisations moving to networked personal computers and office systems have led to the emergence of the term 'zipperhead.' The research company Xephon, in its annual handbook of IBM terminology, defines a zipperhead as 'someone with a closed mind, typically a middle-aged person who remembers the days when you could carry a mainframe operating system around as a deck of punched cards - and wishes you still could'. Job prospects for dyed-in-the-wool zipperheads are certainly falling. The National Computing Centre's annual survey shows that programmers now make up 14 per cent of systems staff, compared with 34 per cent six years ago. The demand now is for end-user support people, who have come from nowhere in four years, to account for 13 per cent. In addition there will be just four per cent growth in demand for programmers over the next five years - compared with more than 30 per cent for end-user support people and 40 per cent for network staff. These findings are underlined by annual counts of job advertisements by Salary Survey Publications for trade journal Computer Weekly. These show that skills in local area networking and in desk-top computing products such as Windows, Oracle and Ingres have moved into the top 10 skills in most demand in the last three years at the expense of expertise in specialist mainframe products. Older people (in computing anyone over 35 seems to be seen as old) tend to have the traditional mainframe skills. Indeed, age has a role in the zipperhead debate. Older people might have had PCs thrust upon them, the argument goes, but young people have grown up with them. And if the average age of the PC or client-server team is 25 and even the manager is only 30, how can a 45-year-old fit in? All these issues are summed up by Mr Ian Maclachlan, professional services director at client-server systems specialist RCMS, which has helped companies like Bass and rank Xerox move to client-server systems. 'Mainframe staff are used to long development cycles; get heavily involved at systems level; are programmers of logic; do not believe client-server technology can replace the functionality and performance of legacy systems; and understand and appreciate rigorous development methods for big applications,' he says. 'PC staff are used to short development cycles; only work at application level; understand personal productivity tools; expect high recognition for their work; and have no disciplined approach to development.' However, Mr Maclachlan's contrasting lists show room for beneficial compromise. For example professional management of computing projects has become a key topic in the last 18 months following government and other reports highlighting poor quality. A national examination has been introduced by the British Computer Society's Information Systems Examinations Board. The fact that traditional mainframe people have been brought up with disciplined approaches to development is one reason why recruitment agency Neville John Associates, in Chester, has launched a contract computing service based on older people. As the company says, older people have seen it all. Far from being stuck in the past, they have been through change many times as technology has moved forward. They can bring experience, realism and a cautious restraining hand to organisations which might be tempted to rush for the latest over-hyped 'new' product or approach. Research into staffing needs by the Institute of Data Processing Management and the Women into Information Technology campaign concludes that organisations should 'retread' existing people 'instead of replacing them by cheaper or supposedly flexible youngsters.' The learning curve of the latter group can be expensive, the research report says. It adds that 'retreading should include business, marketing, management and personal communication skills training' to enable computing specialists to work more effectively with end-users, especially managers. Neville John Associates and others point to another role for experienced older people. Although today's talk is all about PCs and client-servers systems, many important corporate systems run on mainframes. Most programs are still written in the long-established Cobol language and there are many in the esoteric Assembler machine language and in PL/I, dating back 12-15 years yet well proven and in daily use. Maintenance of such programs is just the job for diehard zipperheads. Age has long been an issue in employment and various organisations have lobbied for years to get age discrimination outlawed, just as sex and race discrimination are. The arguments will probably go on forever - unlike the people involved in them. For today's bright young thing is inevitably tomorrow's zipperhead.</p>

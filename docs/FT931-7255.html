			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Brussels to increase aid for industrially declining regions THE EUROPEAN Commission intends to devote greater resources to poor and industrially declining regions, including Merseyside in the UK, and eastern Germany. The Commission yesterday adopted a plan to try to arrest industrial decline as part of the Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 117bn) EC structural aid programme agreed at December's Edinburgh summit. The traditional industrial regions of Merseyside, Hainaut in southern Belgium, and the eastern Lander, or states, of Germany will be entitled to the higher levels of funding hitherto devoted to backward regions and the poorest member states. Highlands and Islands in Scotland also qualifies for the higher funding. Brussels also wants to reform the Social Fund, devoted until now to training both young and long-term unemployed, to target part of its warchest to industries facing structural change. The object is to retrain workers before they become unemployed - a move seen by some member states including the UK as a disguised industrial policy. The Social Fund was worth Ecu7.2bn out of a total EC structural aid budget of Ecu63bn in the 1989-93 period. The Commission is also seeking greater flexibility in the criteria for allocating aid to so-called 'Objective 2' areas, or industrial regions in decline. The plan here is to channel money to areas which may not now have high enough unemployment to qualify for grants, but which are vulnerable to big factory closures. This more direct attention to industrial restructuring was largely brushed aside at the Edinburgh summit, when the 12 agreed the 'Delors 2' package on EC finances for 1994-99. When the package was being put together last year, the intention was to target funds towards industries like defence, electronics, cars and textiles, to improve European competitiveness. Although the emphasis now is on preserving and creating jobs, a row over whether this constitutes market-distorting interventionism can be expected when the Commission plans go to the Council of Ministers. A decision on the whole package, and the dividing up of funding, is not expected until June. Additional controversy is expected over Brussels' plans to involve workers and employers in designing the new training programmes. 'We all know this will be controversial, and I can think of one member state which won't like it,' said Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, in a reference to the UK. In London, the proposals won little favour among British ministers, who in the past, have resisted any policy seen as 'propping up' ailing industries. Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, said 'in the past we've concentrated on the cure' for unemployment through the Social Fund. 'In the future, we want to give more attention to prevention'. The focus would be on retraining workers, threatened by 'new production systems', to maintain their jobs or help them find alternatives. endrule Minister warned over aid, Page 6</p>

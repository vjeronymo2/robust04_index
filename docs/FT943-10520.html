			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Low-down on Low bid - Appearances could be deceptive in Tesco's victory At first sight it might appear that the takeover battle for William Low, the struggling Scottish food retailer, has been resolved with winners all round. Shareholders in the Dundee-based group will receive Pounds 247m from Tesco, compared with the Pounds 154m which the retailer offered only 18 days earlier. Tesco was still confident it would obtain a good return from the Wm Low stores - in spite of having been forced to increase its first bid by Pounds 93m. Even J Sainsbury, which intervened with a Pounds 210m offer and thus forced Tesco to pay more, has laid to rest its reputation as the retailing giant which would never become involved in a hostile takeover battle. But some hard questions remain. How could the board of Wm Low and its merchant bank advisers, Baring Brothers, have recommended the original bid as 'full and fair' - particularly since Tesco reckons it can still make money from the deal, even after increasing its offer by 60 per cent? How could retailing analysts and the market have so undervalued Wm Low's shares, which in April touched 138p - 222p less than Tesco's latest offer of 360p? Advisers to Wm Low said their hand had been forced by the rapid deterioration in the Dundee group's trading position this summer. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, first approached Wm Low in April, and discussions resulted in a cash bid of 180p per share being mooted - a figure which was later increased to 200p. The Wm Low board checked with their store managers, heard that trading conditions were stabilising, and decided to sit tight. But when Tesco returned in July, with a firm offer of 225p, trading had worsened markedly. Like-for-like sales, the life-blood of any retailer, were down 12 per cent. Sir Ian made his offer conditional on a recommendation by Wm Low. The recommendation was not over-enthusiastic. Mr James Millar, chairman of the Scottish group, said merely that the Tesco offer represented 'better value for shareholders than the value Wm Low could achieve as an independent retailer, as the harsher retail food market and our lack of scale limit our prospects for profit growth over the next few years.' Barings said that - given the deterioration in Wm Low's trading position, and Tesco's insistence on the bid being recommended - the only way to test whether more could be obtained for shareholders was by making the offer public, and letting the market decide. There was real concern that analysts would get wind of the drop in sales and start raising concerns about the group's dividend - pushing the shares even lower. Analysts concede they made a mistake in focusing on Wm Low's poor profits performance, rather than the underlying value of its bricks and mortar to competitors. But few could have foreseen that Tesco and Sainsbury would be prepared to bid against each other for the 57-store chain. Tesco was confident that Sainsbury would not become involved in a contested bid - even although Wm Low warned Sir Ian in writing that it did not consider his Pounds 247m offer would necessarily be a knockout blow. Perhaps the biggest winner is the empty-handed Sainsbury. It has has shown the City it is prepared to become involved in a contested bid and stop a rival gaining market share on the cheap - but not pay over the odds. A Sainsbury adviser said: 'We know the value of the business and were not prepared to pay a penny more. If a rival has been forced to pay more for it, that's no bad thing.'</p>

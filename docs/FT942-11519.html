			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Nationwide names new chief executive Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, yesterday appointed Mr Brian Davis, its operations director, to succeed Mr Tim Melville-Ross as chief executive in July. Mr Melville-Ross is to become director-general of the Institute of Directors from the beginning of August, after 10 years as Nationwide chief executive. Mr Davis said that his priorities would be to improve the range of services offered to customers in as efficient a way as possible. He would be looking to improve further the society's cost to income ratio - which in the year ended April 1993 fell to 48 per cent (55 per cent). Pre-tax profits fell by 8.6 per cent to Pounds 184.6m, after a sharp increase in bad debt provisions. But the society, which then had assets of almost Pounds 35bn, now seems better placed after a period of strengthening its balance sheet. It is expected soon to announce plans to end its relationship with Guardian and set up its own life assurance operation. Mr Davis joined Nationwide in 1986, and directed the combining of the Nationwide and Anglia computer systems following the merger between the two societies in 1987, and directed also the introduction of FlexAccount, the UK's first interest-bearing current account. The handling of the merger attracted criticism within the sector, as the society was seen as not becoming a single, efficient organisation quickly enough.</p>

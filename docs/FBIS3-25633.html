			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Information received at our news desk today reveals  that Russian [words indistinct] and transport planes arrived in  Luanda recently. These war planes carried technicians and  military advisers contracted as mercenaries to fight the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].  UNITA condemns this action which endorses the warmongering and  criminal speech made by Lucio Lara in Paris recently,  endangering the Lusaka peace talks. Thus, UNITA will present a  protest to the United Nations, because it wants to know whether  it is worthwhile to negotiate peace while Luanda wants war.</p>

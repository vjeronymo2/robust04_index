			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DAY A WINNER FOR CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN  </P> <P> Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), a congressional leader in science and  technology policy, had a good day at the office Tuesday.  </P> <P> Brown received a top award from the National Science Foundation. He also won  House passage of a bill to devote $150 million to hydrogen fuel research at the  Energy Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  </P> <P> The bill, approved by voice vote, will have to be reconciled with a similar,  Senate-passed measure before it goes to President Bush, who is expected to sign  it.  </P> <P> Brown was the only person outside of the National Science Foundation to receive  its 1990 Distinguished Public Service Award. He was instrumental in creating  the Office of Technology Assessment and the Office of Science and Technology  Policy, and the award cited his "persistent and effective efforts in support of  science and engineering research and education."  </P></p>

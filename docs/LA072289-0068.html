			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATORS RECESS TALKS IN COAL STRIKE  </P> <P> The United Mine Workers presented a proposal Friday to resolve its 3  1/2-month-old strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc., but no agreement was  reached and the two sides decided to recess.  </P> <P> "It appears there is nothing new in it," Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland  said. The company will respond to the proposal next week, she said.  </P> <P> Each side said the other asked for a recess until Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's really frustrating," said Bruce Bratten, administrative assistant to UMW  vice president Cecil Roberts. "We came in here and stated we were willing to  stay and continue this on. It's hard to come to an agreement when you can't get  someone to sit at a table across from you."  </P> <P> A four-person negotiating team from the union and Pittston Vice President Joe  Farrell spent the day meeting in separate rooms and federal mediators shuttled  proposals back and forth.  </P> <P> The union presented two proposals, Bratten said. One was a formal request that  the two sides meet face to face. The other proposal would address Pittston's  need for miners to work Sundays if Pittston would consider the miners' need for  job security, Bratten said.  </P></p>

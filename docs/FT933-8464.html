			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / South Korea shares continue to fall THE South Korean stock market fell for a second day on Saturday in response to an immediate ban on anonymous financial transactions, but there were indications that investor panic at the measure could subside this week, writes John Burton in Seoul. The general share index fell to 666 on Saturday, an 8 per cent drop since Thursday, when the anti-corruption action was announced. The fall on the market was caused by investors liquidating their false-name accounts to move their funds elsewhere and avoid paying taxes. But analysts noted that trading volume at 21.2m shares was up sharply from Friday's 1.3m shares, indicating that institutional investors were entering the market to take advantage of buying opportunities. Meanwhile, gold prices and the black market dollar rate stabilised. It had been expected that holders of false-name accounts would rush to acquire gold and illegal dollars in an attempt to hide money from the tax authorities. The property market was calm after officials said they would need to approve all transactions for the next three months to prevent the flow of hidden money into that sector. Cash withdrawals from banks were reported to be at normal levels, with few customers shifting false-name accounts to ones held under their real names as required under the new rules. Sales of safes fell sharply, however, as the government announced that it would track buyers who could possibly use them to conceal their assets. Most lenders on the unofficial kerb market, which is largely financed by the money held in the false-name accounts, remained closed. Small and medium-sized businesses depend heavily on the kerb market for financing, but the virtual closure of the kerb market has not so far affected their operations. The central bank reported that few businesses were requesting the emergency loans which had been offered by government to prevent possible bankruptcies resulting from the introduction of the real-name system.</p>

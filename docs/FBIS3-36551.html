The Ukrainian </F> Parliament Will No Longer Stymie the Nuclear Disarmament of the  State"]    [Text] Kiev -- It was simply a crushing victory for Leonid  Kravchuk. Once again he mixed his supporters and opponents  together in the Supreme Council to produce new political loaves  in the way that a good housewife kneads dough. Leonid  Makarovich listened carefully first to the microphone on the  left which promised him the Nobel Peace Prize and then to the  microphone on the right which threatened him with Article 56 of  the Criminal Code for treason on an especially large scale. And  all this for a three-page statement by the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States, and Russia delivered in Moscow on 14  January.    Meanwhile the stove had been lit and the loaves knew that  they would have to leap into it. Ukraine's nuclear weapons are  -- thanks to the economic policy of the last two years -- the  only commodity which the West has dreamed of buying here, buying  in order to destroy them.    However, the Supreme Council was required not to sign but,  on  the contrary, to erase something, to strike out its so-called  "warnings" over an article in Protocol Five of the START Treaty  as enshrined by decree in November 1993 so that the document was  not at odds with the three-page statement of the presidents  which had already been agreed upon.    The situation was lent special piquancy by the fact that the  "Moscow pact" -- neither the statement itself nor the appendices  to it containing specific figures and deadlines for Ukraine's  nuclear disarmament -- did not need ratification at all. And  the debates in parliament guaranteed their participants profound  moral satisfaction only.    Leonid Makarovich bore the blows of fate in worthy fashion.  He forgave his attackers: "I understand it is a difficult  decision for you to make..." He encouraged those who thought  like him: "I received a letter from Clinton at lunchtime. He  writes that he is doubling economic aid to Ukraine." True, the  real issues remained off stage: The questions of interest to  the technicians and professionals like Kuchma of how modern  solid-fuel SS-24 missiles are going to be scrapped if the  technology for recycling them does not yet exist in the world;  who will solve the problem of utilizing weapons-grade plutonium;  what to do with the abandoned missile silos, and so forth. A  purely political rather than a comprehensive approach to nuclear  disarmament can only result in either blatant deception of the  whole world or upheaval within the Ukrainian state system. But  the president was as good as his word: He exerted his influence  and led people toward a compromise.    With just a couple of minutes to go before the end of the  working day parliament was persuaded that it was being taken  into account, established a quorum, and pushed the "yes" button.  Unconditional ratification of START I was carried. The new  decree was prepared by the president himself as a legislative  initiative. True, during voting the third paragraph -- on  accession to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Weapons of 1 July 1968 -- got unexpectedly dropped: Someone  remembered that deputies had not actually seen the document  themselves, which was inconvenient.... Therefore Ukraine has not  subscribed to it, although it now wished to!</p>

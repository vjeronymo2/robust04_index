			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Kohl's candidate drops out of race for German presidency Mr Steffen Heitmann, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chosen candidate for the German presidency, yesterday withdrew from the race amid mounting criticism over his controversial views on women, nationalism and Germany's past. His resignation represents a personal blow for Mr Kohl who had stubbornly defended Mr Heitmann as recently as last Wednesday in a speech to the Bundestag. Yesterday, the chancellor said the justice minister from the eastern state of Saxony had been the victim of a shameful campaign: 'The intolerable campaign of personal attacks and defamation against Steffen Heitmann in the last few months shames all those who took part in it.' Mr Heitmann, 49, created a furore when, in reference to the Holocaust, he said Germany need not be permanently shamed by its past. He also suggested that women should return to their traditional role as mothers, and that more attention should be paid to those Germans who felt they were being swamped by foreigners and refugees. His resignation will come as a relief to many east Germans, who believed Mr Kohl had chosen a relatively unknown easterner to rein in the presidency. Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the incumbent, spoke out on several controversial issues, including the social and political responsibilities of unification. Several eastern German officials also argued that the west German media coverage was condescending and biased in the way it equated easterners with Mr Heitmann's views. In his resignation statement, Mr Heitmann appealed - some German officials believe at the behest of Mr Kohl - 'to all parties in the interests of the internal unity of our country to agree on a joint candidate' (for president). He proposed Mr Richard Schroder, an opposition Social Democrat and a philosophy professor and theologian at the Humboldt University in Berlin, even though the Social Democrats (SPD) have overwhelmingly endorsed the popular Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine Westphalia. The question is whether the coalition government and the SPD will seek a consensus candidate. The president will be elected by a special convention representing all the parliamentary parties next May. Any horsetrading would suit Mr Kohl. It may deflect criticism over his miscalculated support for Mr Heitmann. It would also give the chancellor time to repair the damage before next year's federal and state elections.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>   [Excerpt] Yet another chetnik offensive, this time in the  Bihac region, has failed to yield results. The traitor Fikret  Abdic has many problems maintaining his authority in the Kladusa  region.    [Sadikovic] The preoccupation of Bihac region residents and  members of the 5th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina with  internal clashes and the agreed support of Fikret Abdic, were  obviously the reason Radovan Karadzic launched his strongest  offensive so far to finally finish off the Bihac pocket, the  Muslim enclave not in physical contact with Sarajevo.    Four brigades and a few additional chetnik units were  supposed to capture the Grmecko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez in  the first stage, and in the second reach the right bank of the  Una river. At the same time, Fikret Abdic's so-called forces  were supposed to enter Cazin, link up with the  Grmecko-Srbljanski plateau and then enter Bihac itself with the  help of the Croatian Defense Council, which allegedly controls  the plateau.    However, this did not happen. The heros of the 5th Corps  have been resisting the chetniks for 10 days. Chetniks did not  make much progress from the Grabez wasteland. Kladusa's Babo  [Fikret Abdic] also spoiled the game. He did not carry out any  of his promises. The conscience of the residents of Velika  Kladusa came to the fore. They expressed allegiance to  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 5th Corps. Abdic now has the problem  of how to keep back hundreds, even thousands of those who want  to go to Bihac. He appealed for help in the fight against the  5th Corps, forgetting that it was actually the local people who  make up the 5th Corps. Neither Milosevic nor Tudjman are  listening to him any longer. He has yet to settle accounts with  Karadzic. [passage omitted]</p>

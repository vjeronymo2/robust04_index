Tormented by excessive prices and mass  unemployment in Lipetsk (perhaps not a single enterprise is  working at full capacity) and by notorious privatization as a  result of which some have become multimillionaires but most have  become impoverished, at the elections people voted "with their  feet." The elections were not valid at one of the oblast  center's 15 electoral districts. And that despite the fact that  the "pass level" was lowered to 25 percent.    For the same reason the elections to the city assembly were  also invalid. Yet here it was the "city fathers," the head of  the administration and his deputies, the leaders of industrial  enterprises, and new capitalist gentlemen who were running for  the majority of districts.    The same attitude toward the new organ of oblast power was  displayed in Yelets, where not a single candidate got through  either, because voters failed to turn out. Thus elections were  valid in only 19 out of 38 districts. But even in those  districts, mainly rural ones, where the elections were  successful, the turnout was scarcely more than 50 percent. On  behalf of whom will the victorious candidates resolve  legislative questions if most often only 15-20 percent of the  population voted for them?</p>

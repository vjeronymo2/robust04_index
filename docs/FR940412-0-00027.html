			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over 150 comments were received on the July 9, 1993 NPRM. Another 110 comments concerning detectable warnings were received in response to a NPRM published by the Access Board in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 21, 1992 which proposed to reserve detectable warnings provisions for curb ramps installed in the public right-of-way by State and local governments. 58 FR 60612. The comments received in response to both the July 9, 1993 NPRM and the December 21, 1992 NPRM have been considered in this rulemaking. The comments came from blind persons and their organizations (132 comments); State and local government agencies (54 comments); manufacturers of detectable warnings (14 comments); professional and trade associations (11 comments); businesses (4 comments); organizations representing persons with mobility impairments (4 comments); mobility specialists (13 comments); and other individuals (17 comments) and entities (14 comments). About 25 persons submitted comments in response to both NPRM's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments centered around three issues: whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and other locations; their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians; and their durability, maintainability, and cost. The comments are further discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Need for Detectable Warnings at Curb Ramps and Other Locations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Federation of the Blind (NFB), ten NFB chapters, and 31 blind individuals submitted comments supporting the proposed suspension of the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools. NFB further recommended that detectable warnings be eliminated eventually from ADAAG, including at transit platform edges. NFB asserted that blind persons are responsible for using effective travel methods (i.e., cane or guide dog) and that public policy should be based on an ``individual responsibility'' standard. NFB pointed out that blind persons move about safely every day without detectable warnings; and stated that fears of blind persons falling or being injured are based on emotional responses and not factual information. NFB claimed that there are sufficient cues already available in the environment to alert blind persons of hazards on a circulation path and that if only some hazards are marked by detectable warnings, the inconsistency is likely to defeat their intended purpose and could create a threat rather than an aid to safe mobility for blind persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Council of the Blind (ACB), 18 ACB chapters, the Council of Citizens with Low Vision International and two of its chapters, the Guide Dog Users of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, the National Alliance of Blind Students, the American Foundation for the Blind, the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Impaired, 15 other State and local organizations representing persons who are blind or who have vision impairments, 49 blind individuals, and eight mobility specialists submitted comments opposing the suspension. These commenters recounted incidents of blind persons approaching curb ramps and stepping into the street without stopping; walking into reflecting pools; and falling from transit platforms. News articles were submitted reporting the deaths of three blind persons who fell from subway platforms in Boston and New York and from a commuter rail platform in Maryland during 1993. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Another news article reported an incident of a blind person who was severely injured from falling in front of an oncoming train in Baltimore in December 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> None of the transit platform edges had detectable warnings that conform to the ADAAG requirements. The New York subway platform edge was marked by a yellow stripe and an abrasive material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ACB submitted a report of a recent research project which studied cues used by blind persons to detect streets. Barlow, J. and Bentzen, B.L.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cues Blind Travelers Use to Detect Streets,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Washington, DC: American Council of the Blind (1993). Eight cities were included in the research project. In each city, ten blind persons who use canes to travel approached ten unfamiliar intersections with curb ramps without detectable warnings. They were asked to stop when they believed their next step would be into the street and to report the cues which they used to determine where to stop. Of the 80 blind persons who participated in the research project, 75% were considered good-to-excellent travellers by self-report and through assessment by orientation and mobility specialists; and two-thirds reported travelling independently a minimum of five times a week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 800 street approaches, the participants walked down the center of the curb ramps in 557 instances and stopped before the street in 360 cases (65%). Of the 22 cues reportedly used to detect the street, the two most frequently mentioned cues were the downslope of the ramp and the presence of traffic on the street perpendicular to the participant's line of travel. Other cues frequently mentioned were the upslope or texture change at the street, the end of the building line or shoreline, and the presence of traffic on the street parallel to the participant's line of travel. The participants stated that they usually used a combination of cues to identify the street.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

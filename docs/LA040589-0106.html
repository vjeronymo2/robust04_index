			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 YEARS OF C-SPAN COVERAGE -- AND THE HOUSE STILL STANDS  </P> <P> On March 19, 1979, when then-Rep. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) stepped up to the podium to  make the House of Representatives' first live televised speech, opponents  predicted the practice would lead to disaster. In his speech, Gore countered by  saying that television would "revitalize representative democracy."  </P> <P> Ten years later, most analysts and members of Congress agree that neither side  was right.  </P> <P> Since that day when the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) started  broadcasting live coverage of the House of Representatives via the rapidly  expanding cable-TV industry, Washington-area clothiers have joked of a marked  rise in the sale of bright-red neckties.  </P> <P> But beyond cosmetic changes and some slight accommodations in House rules, the  consensus is that television in the Congress has not had the dramatic effect  both sides predicted.  </P> <P> Opponents of a televised Congress once claimed that cameras would reduce the  level of debate to "political posturing" for the benefit of the people  watching. But a leading foe of congressional television at the time, Sen. John  Danforth (R-Mo.), conceded recently that "the playing to the cameras and the  galleries that I expected just didn't occur."  </P> <P> At the same time, those leading the fight for C-SPAN said the cameras would  force a new level of representation for members of Congress who would suddenly  be accountable to the average person in their districts.  </P> <P> But Michael Robinson, a professor of media and politics at Georgetown  University, said that because of C-SPAN, "a few more people might show up on  the floor, (but) the House is not all that different than it was 15 years ago."  </P> <P> Even Brian Lamb, the widely acclaimed founder and chief executive officer of  C-SPAN, now questions whether his network has "changed the world" as some had  predicted it would.  </P> <P> "I don't know and I don't worry about it," he said. "I didn't get into the  business to change the system. I got into the business to provide people a  larger picture, more of the story."  </P> <P> C-SPAN's picture has grown larger over the years. Initially covering only the  House proceedings, the network has now added coverage of the Senate, political  conventions, congressional hearings, press conferences and call-in talk shows.  </P> <P> "It has been a constant growth," Lamb said. "That was all in the plan. We had  to show a lot of different people that there was an audience out there for this  kind of TV. We evolved a step at a time."  </P> <P> Experts say that while C-SPAN hasn't wrought major changes in Congress, it has  had an effect.  </P> <P> For example, analysts say a cluster of House members who call themselves the  Conservative Opportunity Society, led by Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), successfully  used C-SPAN to help gain public recognition. By taking advantage of a short  period at the end of each day's business that allows for speeches on any  subject, Gingrich and his colleagues were able to rally public support for  their particular interests. The rule allowing such speeches had been there  before C-SPAN, but was little used until there were cameras present to  broadcast the remarks.  </P> <P> "Newt Gingrich made it clear from Day 1 that they were going to use C-SPAN to  tell the people the truth," Robinson said.  </P> <P> In March, Gingrich was elected minority whip, the No. 2 position in the House  Republican leadership.  </P> <P> Regardless of partisanship, almost everyone agrees that the camera's presence  has shortened speeches on the House floor and has probably made them better.  </P> <P> For Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), the presence of the television cameras in the  Senate has meant "the debate has been better. The speeches have been better."  </P> <P> "There is greater care taken in making sure that what they say is what they  mean," said Michael Sheehan, a media consultant who frequently advises  Democrats in Congress on how to take advantage of the television camera. "You  don't have the ability to edit the tape before it is beamed up to the  satellite."  </P> <P> Ed Blakely, a Washington media consultant who formerly worked for the  Republican Party, said C-SPAN "requires members to be articulate and to be able  to speak in 30- and 60-second sound bites. Woe be it to those who do not come  across in a telegenic manner."  </P> <P> More changes may evolve. Gore, now a U.S. senator, applauds "the marriage of  open debate and the television medium" on C-SPAN but adds: "The House and  Senate still have some work to do in fully adapting to the needs of democracy  by, for example, scheduling important debates for times when most Americans can  watch and listen. Eventually, that will occur."  </P> <P> He suggested that the Senate might schedule important debates during prime time  "maybe a couple nights a week."  </P> <P> By the network's own count, more than 21 million people tune in at least three  times a month to watch the House on C-SPAN I and close to 17 million do the  same with the Senate on C-SPAN II. While the numbers remain far below the  average viewing audience for commercial networks, they represent substantial  growth for the once-fledgling channels.  </P> <P> "There is a part of the population in America that is fascinated by politics  and public policy," said Jeff Greenfield, who covers politics and the media for  ABC News. "They follow C-SPAN the way a sports junkie would follow (the cable  sports channel) ESPN."  </P> <P> C-SPAN's audience spans the socioeconomic spectrum, Lamb said, but he  acknowledged that the network appeals most to the politically interested.  "Newspaper people, bankers, teachers, politicians -- the political  infrastructure -- watch this network out of proportion with the others in  society," he said.  </P> <P> Some analysts say television's success in the House and Senate foreshadow  similar changes in the other branches of government -- most notably the Supreme  Court.  </P> <P> "As each institution opens up," Sheehan said, "the pressure gets greater to  open up the deliberations in the Supreme Court." He added that photo  opportunities at the White House might eventually turn into "video  opportunities" with C-SPAN broadcasting them live.  </P> <P> For Lamb, however, the primary goal for the next 10 years is "fine-tuning what  we've already got," including getting it carried by more cable systems and  persuading more teachers to incorporate it in their curricula.  </P> <P> But he said the network would not necessarily be satisfied with broadcasting  only American politics. Lamb said he foresees a future where C-SPAN covers the  political process in other countries as well.  </P></p>

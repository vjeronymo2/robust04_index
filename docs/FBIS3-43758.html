			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There were no direct talks between the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA-PT] yesterday. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special  representative in Angola, is today expected to organize another  face-to-face meeting between the Angolan delegations which are  searching for peace.    At the meeting the parties will once again discuss political  issues connected with the formation of the national police. Of  the 12 interrelated points, the national police formation is  viewed as one of the most complicated issues in this second  round of talks, because the end of the riot police -- the main  cause of the present war -- depends on it. UNITA has already  demanded the dissolution of the riot police. UNITA and the  MPLA-PT have already reached agreement on half of the 12 main  points presented by the mediators.    Yesterday, Alioune Blondin Beye once again called on the two  delegations from UNITA and the MPLA-PT to respect the game rules  and the press blackout [preceding word in English]. Alioune  Blondin Beye said there is a flight of information.</p>

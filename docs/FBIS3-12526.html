			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar: "A </F> Change of Venue Will Not Help"]    [Text] It is a pity that the mandate given to the state  commission of inquiry does not extend beyond Israel's borders.  If Justice Me'ir Shamgar and his colleagues were permitted to  travel as far as the United States, it is doubtful that they  would exonerate Secretary of State Warren Christopher -- or even  President Bill Clinton -- from responsibility for the fiasco.  The Americans are very fastidious. They meticulously word and  file everything away. It would not even be necessary to dig up  secret files.    The exploits of the settlers were cited in this year's State  Department annual human rights report. The investigators would  find that the CIA's agents in Israel repeatedly reported on the  evil deeds of the Kahanists from Brooklyn. And, if he had a hard  time reading overt and covert material, Christopher could have  heard about it from Palestinian leaders. This, of course,  unless he fell asleep, as he did during Clinton's speech in  Brussels and his latest meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres.    Old hands at the State Department cannot remember such a  lethargic, bureaucratic, and hesitant secretary. Asked to  comment about the fate of the occupied territories, he would  have a ready-made answer: The peace process, and the process  alone, is the solution. And what did the secretary contribute  to that process? Twice a week he would grovel before Jewish  functionaries and promise not to put pressure on Israel, God  forbid.    The U.S. team includes a handful of dedicated officials who  witnessed the birth of the peace process and are eager to hold  the baby in their arms. The secretary reined in anybody who  asked permission to intervene in the negotiations, lest this be  interpreted as a provocation of the Rabin government.    The Jewish leadership, which has not yet shaken loose of the  Likud's grip, knows why it prefers Christopher and has gone to  great lengths to stand in Strobe Talbott's way to the secretary  of state's office. Talbott's articles in TIME show that his  views about the damage caused by the settlements in particular  and the occupation in general are very close to those of Peres  and Yosi Beilin. Prior to the Oslo agreement, I heard Peres  speak in favor of working intensively on a permanent arrangement  (a confederation) and skipping the interim stage. Why pay  twice, he asked time and again. During his visit to Washington,  Beilin publicly stated that he would forego the autonomy stage.    Yitzhaq Rabin apparently exhausted his ability to be dragged  by the Foreign Ministry duo when he signed the Oslo agreement,  and there is no way they can drag him into a debate about the  future of the settlements/provocations. Since 13 September,  Peres and Beilin have been asking the Americans to take action,  particularly on the Syrian arena, but also on the Palestinian  track. People who know Rabin know that if there is anything he  idolizes, fears, and respects it is Washington.    If the United States had a President who could see reality  beyond the level of crime in Chicago, he would ask the prime  minister -- to cite just one example -- to tell him how he  intends to deal with criminals armed with government-issued  weapons who openly declare their intention to kill Palestinian  policemen. After all, Clinton was asked to be the best man at  the signing ceremony of the Oslo agreement. Since then, he has  missed no opportunity, particularly in domestic political  events, to boast about this feat. He must have reached the  conclusion that a strong police force in Chicago would improve  his chances of getting reelected. This is much more important  to him than a Palestinian police force and Jewish criminals, or  vice versa.    A month and a half ago, through his meeting with Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad, Clinton made his most active  contribution to the peace process. What came out of it?  Another one or two -- who is counting? -- rounds of sterile  talks in Washington. Everybody patted themselves in the back  about the "businesslike atmosphere" achieved by cutting down the  size of the delegations and the frequency of press briefings --  some contribution by the only superpower in the world to the  peace process.    One should not infer from this weakness that the country  that  put a man on the moon had no people who could read the writing  on the wall. Appearing before a Jewish convention, Dennis Ross,  the head of the U.S. peace team, warned that long intervals in  the negotiations on the implementation of the Declaration of  Principles between Israel and the PLO might jeopardize the  process. His remarks cast the heads of the U.S. Administration  in a grimmer light when one considers that he and his colleagues  supposedly said the same things to their superiors.    Even now that the President has invited Israel and the PLO  to  Washington, it is hard to discern a substantial change in the  way it perceives the problems and their solution. For  convenience's sake -- in other words, for fear of upsetting the  Jews -- the focus remains on matters of procedure and venue.  The logic behind this passive approach is that the peace  process itself will improve the atmosphere in the area. The  massacre in Hebron made abundantly clear that what we have here  is a question of ideology, which is becoming more acute as the  peace process advances toward a compromise solution.    The only remedy to such an ideology is resoluteness and  firmness. A change of venue will not change fortunes. Jimmy  Carter did not overcome the ideologist Menahem Begin thanks to  the fresh air at Camp David, but thanks to his arm-wrestling  tactics and the negotiating methods used by a superpower with a  protege.    Bill Clinton shares responsibility for the tragedy in Hebron  and its aftermath. If he does not bring up the problem of the  settlements with Yitzhaq Rabin, the Middle East will join his  other failures in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and apparently,  Russia. It is very doubtful that when the day comes, the Jews,  whom he fears so much, will thank him for this failure.</p>

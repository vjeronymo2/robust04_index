			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Should Have the Spirit of Advancing in the </F> Face of Difficulty"]    [Text] Advancing in the face of difficulty is a major part  of the pioneering spirit and the way to succeed in all  undertakings. It is also an impending requirement we have to  meet in order to fulfill our tasks under the present  circumstances.    The present economic situation, on the whole, is excellent  in our province. Economic development has embarked on the  "expressway." Since spring this year, our industry has grown at  a rate higher than the nation's average. The status of  agriculture as the foundation of the national economy is being  strengthened. And an excellent situation has appeared, marked by  steady advances in all fields. In the course of advance,  however, we are faced with some problems and difficulties. Chief  among them are: a rather serious shortage of capital, the  appearance of more "double suspension" enterprises [enterprises  that have suspended production and wage payments to their  employees], and an increased amount of losses suffered by some  enterprises. Also, commodity prices have risen to an excessive  extent; staff members and workers of the "double suspension"  enterprises and masses in disaster-stricken areas are  experiencing difficulty in livelihood. With regard to the  relations of interests, contradictions of one kind or another  have been intensified, and problems due to people's thinking and  understanding have become more complicated. In view of this, we  should keep a clear head so as to perceive the situation  correctly.    There are two different attitudes toward difficulty and,  hence, two different results. One is to advance in the face of  difficulty, struggle hard, and step up efforts for reform and  opening up to achieve great development. The other is to take  the usual attitude toward work or even quit in the face of  difficulty, and the result is to lag behind in competition. With  respect to these two results, the leadership of the provincial  party committee has stressed time and again that we must enhance  our sense of urgency and historical responsibility and try to  achieve the former and avoid the latter. At present, however,  the problems are: Some people are in low spirits, pessimistic,  and disheartened. Others are full of complaints and blame this  and that. Still others assume a passive and perfunctory  attitude, trying to evade problems if at all possible. Given  this state of affairs, it is appropriate to say that our present  difficulty is caused by the mentality and work style on the part  of some cadres rather than by the tasks before us.    To advance in the face of difficulty, we should, first of  all, look squarely at difficulty, despise it, and foster a  dauntless spirit to conquer it. We should see the dual nature  of difficulty: it is a motive force as well as a pressure; it  not only causes us hardship but also provides something that we  can take advantage of. Take the current macroeconomic  environment as an example: Following two years' rapid economic  growth, the "bottleneck" restriction and inflationary pressure  have increased. On the one hand, our economic environment is not  without strain. On the other hand, we have a new market economy  marked by a high degree of vitality and compatibility, hence  there are more opportunities for development. Moreover, despite  the same environment, some units have remained passive and  failed to go out of predicament, while others have overcome  difficulties and "blazed a trail" through brambles. As a result,  there have appeared in the province a number of counties,  cities, and townships that have developed by leaps and bounds,  "little tigers" that have excelled in developing the economy,  and new enterprises that have arisen in the waves of market  development. These positive and negative experiences show that  the outcome of a matter depends on human efforts. Those who  appear energetic and ambitious when circumstances are favorable  but become discouraged and lose their bearings in the face of  difficulty can never make any significant accomplishment or  pioneer a great cause.    To advance in the face of difficulty, we should not evade  problems. Instead, we should be daring and adept in tackling the  main and prominent problems that affect our reform and  development and make a serious effort to solve them. For  instance, enlivening big and medium-sized state enterprises is a  major and hard job at present. Some enterprises have entered the  market to conduct transactions on property rights, thus  relieving themselves from the "specially guaranteed units"  status granted them under the planned economic system. Other  enterprises have been transformed into joint stock companies,  accepted foreign capital, organized conglomerates, or opened new  business in the field of tertiary industry. Still others have  leased or auctioned themselves to the "main task forces" for  competent management. To press ahead and make breakthroughs in  every work, we must dare to tackle problems and overcome  difficulties. If we turn away and refuse to do anything when  problems arise, we will not only be overwhelmed by difficulties  and cannot perceive our real backwardness, but what is more, we  will aggravate the difficulties, cause more problems, and even  turn solvable problems into "longstanding, big, and  hard-to-resolve issues."    To advance in the face of difficulty, we should also have  perseverance in doing thoroughgoing work. We will not be able to  overcome difficulty and achieve success if we take the usual  attitude toward our work, dare not tackle the hard problems, or  quit in the face of difficulty. For example, the "one-vote  overruling" is a good way to remove difficulties in family  planning. The "system of leaders taking responsibility for local  security" is a good measure to improve public order. Using law  to reduce the burden of enterprises and farmers is an effective  method. To put these into practice, we should strive  persistently and in a thoroughgoing way. Otherwise, we will  waste our efforts or even spoil our previous achievements. Such  a consequence will be hard to remedy.    Whether a cadre can advance in the face of difficulty is a  test of his or her thinking and work style. To break through  difficulty, cadres and masses should help each other, pool their  efforts, and display a daring and heroic team spirit. When  difficulty arises, if our leading cadres just look on with  folded arms or talk indiscreetly, if they are indulged in  extravagant feasting and wining and busy entertaining guests and  sightseeing, or if they are merely enthusiastic about replacing  their present vehicles with high-grade luxurious cars and about  seeking "ease and comfort," then the masses will not respect  them, and the difficulty will remain. What is more, their  behavior will invite serious complaints from the masses and make  the difficult problems even more difficult to solve. To sum up,  we must strive to improve our mindset and work style and foster  a spirit of advancing in the face of difficulty so as to exert  ourselves to fulfill the objective of "revitalizing Hubei in  central China."</p>

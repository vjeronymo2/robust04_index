Far From Russia...." --  first two paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] Colonel General Boris Pyankov was born in  1935 in Sverdlovsk. He is a Russian. He has been in the armed  forces since 1954. He graduated from the Far Eastern tank  school in 1959, the military academy of armored troops in 1969,  and the General Staff military academy in 1979. He has  commanded an armored platoon, an armored company, an armored  battalion, an armored regiment, a motorized rifle division, an  army corps, an army, and the Siberian Military District. Since  1991 he has been chief of the USSR Civil Defense and USSR deputy  defense minister. Since 6 July 1992 he has been deputy  commander in chief of the CIS joint armed forces. Since  September 1993 he has been commander of the coalition  peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. He is married with a son and  a daughter.    Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the CIS  coalition  peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, answers PRAVDA's questions.    [PRAVDA] Boris Yevgenyevich, today many people are naturally  asking: Why was it necessary at all to create this armed  formation on the territory of an independent state?    [Pyankov] To answer your question objectively one must first  of all assess the existing military-political situation in the  world. A brief conclusion is that despite the fact that the  world community has found the strength in itself to push back  the threat of nuclear danger and to consign the Cold War to  oblivion, today we have all been faced with a "new generation"  of local conflicts and wars caused by national and religious  intolerance.    Today we must clearly note that the fact of aggression  against sovereign Tajikistan is taking place. Literally every  day armed gangs and groups from the Islamic State of Afghanistan  try to penetrate its territory in various regions. This has  required the CIS to adopt necessary relevant steps to render aid  to Tajikistan and to safeguard its state integrity and security.    All peoples of the former USSR are linked not only by firm  economic ties. Their friendship, which has deep roots, has been  preserved. A large number of citizens of other CIS countries,  those whom quite recently we proudly called "the Soviet people,"  live on Tajikistan's territory. This naturally imposes  obligations on the supreme powers of these states to protect  human honor and dignity.    There is one more aspect of the problem. If the political  power, economic potential, and armed forces have been more or  less divided up, dividing up joint security into the security of  each individual states has been not only hard but virtually  impossible.    I must say that the creation of the collective peacekeeping  forces was preceeded by lengthy, painstaking work. Favorable  prospects for ensuring national and collective security were  opened up by the treaty on collective security signed in  Tashkent in May 1992 by six states of the CIS. In accordance  with this treaty's articles, the 24 September 1993 session of  the council of CIS heads in Moscow adopted a decision on the  formation of collective peacekeeping forces and the start of  their functioning and also an agreement on the coalition  peacekeeping forces and joint measures for their material and  technical backup. These documents meet all requirements of the  UN Charter.    [PRAVDA] Which CIS countries' military subunits belong  directly to the coalition peacekeeping forces and what functions  do they really perform?    [Pyankov] The coalition peacekeeping forces include military  units from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation,  Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan with their arms, military vehicles,  and property.    Unfortunately, it must be noted that not all states have  fulfilled the terms of the agreement in their entirety. Thus,  for instance, the question of the allocation of the Kazakhstan  armed forces' efforts and funds to the coalition peacekeeping  forces remains open. The Kazakhstan border troops and internal  troops units on Tajikistan's territory arrived here under the  bilateral May 1993 agreement.    The operational use of one subunit of the Kyrgyz contingent  has been complicated. This has been caused by the fact that it  is based on its own territory and is a long way from the main  regions where the conflicting sides are deployed.    A separate motorized rifle battalion with authorized means  of  reinforcement has been assigned from the Uzbekistan armed  forces. With the arrival of this battalion's last company the  tasks set it in its zone of responsibility will be fulfilled in  their entirety.    Thus, only Russia and Tajikistan have wholly fulfilled their  duties to earmark the necessary number of forces and facilities.  Russia has transferred to the coalition peacekeeping forces  joint command the 201st motorized rifle division and several  other units. We are helping the Republic of Tajikistan Defense  Ministry in resolving organizational questions connected with  the use of subunits and units of the republican armed forces  assigned to the coalition peacekeeping forces.    We are worried by one further problem: Financing the  activity of the coalition peacekeeping forces joint command.  Because of the lack of a mechanism for settling accounts  between the states which have signed the agreement, money has  still not been paid into the joint account by Uzbekistan and  Kazakhstan.    [PRAVDA] A few words about the coalition peacekeeping  forces' tasks in Tajikistan.    [Pyankov] They include an analysis of the military-political  situation in the region, the submission of reports to the states  involved, collaboration with the management organs of the states  involved, participation in the negotiations process, the  protection of the humanitarian aid convoys route and  participation in the aid's distribution, and also the  operational use of forces in combat in the event of dire  necessity.    [PRAVDA] Please cite examples of specific actions.    [Pyankov] In late October and early November convoys with  necessities and fuel was escorted to Gornyy Badakhshan with the  aid of the coalition peacekeeping forces and from there the  evacuation of refugees to central regions of the republic was  organized. A group of generals and officers were at the same  time holding talks with leaders of the Gorno-Badakhshan  Autonomous Oblast [GBAO] and commanders of field detachments  operating on the oblast's territory, which helped to remove  tension in this region and improve dialogue between the Gornyy  Badakhshan leadership and the central authorities. Now, at the  request of the republic's leadership the protection of  enterprises producing bread articles and their delivery to the  stores has been organized.    I want to note that the joint command is doing everything to  ensure that the coalition peacekeeping forces' role consists  primarily in conducting preventive diplomatic actions and  peacekeeping activity as a whole. This would be helped by  granting our coalition forces the status of UN troops with all  ensuing consequences. The implementation of this proposal would  press the opposition leaders to sit down at the conference table  with the central authorities in Dushanbe.    [PRAVDA] As far as we know this question was examined at a  CSCE session but the proposal did not get through. Those who  voted against it included several representatives of republics  of the former USSR, in particular Ukraine, Moldova, and the  Baltic states. They explained their position by fear that  Russia's imperial ambitions would be strengthened.    [Pyankov] In this case I must draw attention to several  important factors. First, we must seriously consider the fact  that if the coalition peacekeeping forces leave Tajikistan and  open up the borders, the influx of weapons and drugs will be a  scourge for many CIS countries. And they could include the  above-mentioned countries. Second, because of the  destabilization of the situation there will be a mortal danger  to citizens of all nationalities living in this region.    As for talk of Russia's imperial ambitions, that is the  wrong  way of putting the question. That becomes understandable if you  study the agreement attentively. Yes, I am a citizen of Russia.  But I was appointed to this post by the decision of the council  of heads of state. In my activity I am subordinate to the heads  and defense ministers of the states which signed the agreement.  All planned peacekeeping operations are coordinated with the  defense ministers of the signatory countries and are implemented  only with their approval. And only in an emergency situation  does the commander have the right to make decisions  independently on conducting combat operations, subsequently  reporting to the heads of state and defense ministers. For the  practical organization of collaboration the joint command staff  includes one defense ministry representative from each signatory  state with the rights of deputy chief of staff of the coalition  peacekeeping forces joint command. Highly professional officers  of the republics involved work in all the main directorates and  departments of the joint command. Thus our command is a fully  coalition one. And one more detail of some importance: Article  13 of the agreement reads that it is open to any CIS country and  also to other states which share the agreement's aims.    Russia's interests? Yes, they do exist. Some of them I have  already enumerated. In addition even a nonprofessional can  understand that the transfer of Russian border troops from the  Southern borders to the border with Kazakhstan, which at the  same time includes the creation of a completely new system for  guarding a border many thousands of kilometers long, will  require a colossal investment of material assets. In today's  economic situation such expenditure is beyond Russia's means.  In addition, the activity of the Islamic fundamentalists will  increase in dangerous proximity to Russian territory. It is no  accident that a number of Islamic organizations have proclaimed  their ultimate goal to be the creation of a single Islamic state  including the former Central Asian republics of the USSR and  even some regions of Russia!    [PRAVDA] Boris Yevgenyevich, do you believe that the  introduction of the coalition peacekeeping forces contingent in  Tajikistan has had any positive effect on the stabilization of  the situation in the republic and on the Tajik-Afghan border?    [Pyankov] Yes, without any doubt. For that you only have to  go out onto the streets of Dushanbe and other cities and talk  with the local citizens. The overwhelming majority of the  republic's population welcomed our forces' arrival with great  enthusiasm and hope. And we shall strive to justify this hope.    As for the border, here the situation is far more complex.  Yes, the number of overt armed conflicts has declined somewhat.  But that is connected not only with the intensification of the  guard on the border but also with factors like the change in the  tactics of the opposition armed formations' actions, their  transfer to guerrilla warfare methods using the experience of  the Afghan mujahedin. That is also confirmed by recent events:  The blowing up of the railroad bed on the Termez-Kurgan-Tyube  sector, acts of sabotage on highways, and the murder of  civilians.    In Tajikistan there is one more distinguishing feature: In  winter combat operations usually die down here. Forces are  built up, strongholds and arms and food depots are prepared.  But with the advent of spring the opposition forces will try to  switch to active operation with a view to seizing power.    We are particularly worried by the activity of the well  known  thug and drugs baron Rezvon, who has been declared by the  so-called "government in exile" to be the commander of all the  opposition armed forces. Naturally we are losing no time: We  are reinforcing our borders, engaging in planned combat training  activity, and taking preventive measures.    The visit to Tajikistan by B. Rabbani, the head of the  Islamic State of Afghanistan, and the treaties and agreements  concluded at interstate level instill some optimism.  Unfortunately, the central authorities of that state do not  control many of the border regions, which makes it impossible to  pin all hopes on the stabilization of the situation in the very  near future.    We will use the temporary respite which has been formed to  continue dialogue with the opposition and to find joint points  of contact and mutual advantage.    [PRAVDA] Boris Yevgenyevich, the meeting of heads of state  and defense ministers of the CIS countries ended in Ashgabat  recently. Could you share your impression of its results  regarding the position of the collective peacekeeping forces in  Tajikistan?    [Pyankov] The Ashgabat meeting paid great attention to  questions of the consolidation of the Tajik-Afghan border. The  heads of state decided on additional measures to stabilize the  situation on Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan. In  accordance with these decisions, the 22 January 1993 decision of  the council of heads of state which we have already mentioned  has been extended to the end of 1994.    [PRAVDA] The New Year has arrived. What wishes do you send  to the parents of the boys fulfilling their duty far from Russia?    [Pyankov] To the mothers and families of the Russians whose  sons and relations are serving on Tajikistan's territory I wish  that the need for Russian military units to be here may  disappear as soon as possible and that your relations and close  ones, having honorably fulfilled their military duty, will  return alive and well to the Motherland.</p>

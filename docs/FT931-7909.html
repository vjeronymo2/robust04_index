			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / BSM in talks for October flotation BSM GROUP, owner of the British School of Motoring, one of the UK's largest franchisers, is in advanced discussions to obtain a listing on the London stock exchange later this year. Mr John Mackie of Morgan Grenfell, who is a non-executive director of the company, said yesterday that a flotation was planned for early October. Final details are still being prepared, but it is believed that the value of the share offering may be about Pounds 50m. The BSM proposal comes at a time when a number of companies are considering going public while the equity market is buoyant, including Westminster Health Care which plans to float in the spring. Mr Mackie said the share offering would provide an exit from ownership for the team which financed the management buy-out of the company in 1990, as well as reduce the level of borrowing and help fund future growth. BSM has already selected Morgan Grenfell as the sponsoring merchant bank and James Capel as brokers for the float. It is expected to select Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the auditors, as reporting accountants. The company reported ordinary profits of Pounds 810,000 in the year to December 31, 1991, before a tax credit of Pounds 109,000 mostly caused by advance corporation tax written back. Morgan Grenfell Capital Partners put up Pounds 11.5m in equity as part of the Pounds 40m buy-out of BSM in April 1990. The 1991 accounts show senior debt of Pounds 11m.</p>

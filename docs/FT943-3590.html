			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bekaert posts sharp advance at six months Consolidated profits at Bekaert, the Belgian wire and steel cord producer, leapt to BFr5.1bn (Dollars 157m) in the first six months of the year, compared with BFr951m in the same period a year ago. The result was inflated by a capital gain of BFr3.7bn from the sale of 12.1m shares in BMA-Bridgestone Metalpha Corporation, formerly BSB. Without this, consolidated profits were BFr1.4bn, 48 per cent up over the same period in 1993. Bekaert said the rise, excluding the capital gain, was partly due to improved economic conditions - particularly in the US - but more to 'the continued internal efforts started in previous years', particularly the group's total quality management programme. Consolidated turnover increased by 12.8 per cent to BFr31.4bn in the period, while cash flow reached BFr7.2bn, including the capital gain from the share sale. Without it, cash flow was BFr3.58bn. Combined sales volume for the consolidated and associated companies increased by 7.9 per cent compared with the first half of 1993, but growth came entirely from the consolidated companies which lifted sales by 10.5 per cent. Sales volume of associated companies was flat due to poor economic conditions in some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil and Venezuela. The contribution of the associated companies fell 25 per cent. Capital spending for the consolidated companies was BFr2bn in the first half of the year, little changed from the BFr1.9bn in the same period of 1993. An interim dividend before withholding tax of BFr134.68 per share will be paid. For the ordinary shares this represents a net dividend of BFr100 per share.</p>

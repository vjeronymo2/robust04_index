			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Mujahideen named as Afghan ministers THE new Islamic government of Afghanistan named 36 mujahideen leaders as ministers in the transitional administration that took power a week ago, as a barrage of rockets killed at least 40 people and wounded 200, Our Foreign Staff writes. Dozens of rockets fired by fighters supporting Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar landed throughout the city after government forces began an offensive at first light. Apart from Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, who was named defence minister before the government formally took power, and Mr Ahmad Shah, the interior minister, all the ministers were appointed for only two months.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRIDGES PLAYS 'THE HEAVY' IN NEW FILM  </P> <P> Try not to gasp when you see Jeff Bridges starring in "Texasville."  </P> <P> It's shocking to see how the slender, muscular leading man of "Starman" and  "Tucker" has let himself get fat, sloppy and slack-jawed in the span of a year  or two.  </P> <P> There he is on the big screen, weighing well over 200 pounds, his gut hanging  over his belt, his double chin in need of a shave.  </P> <P> It's not that Bridges has hit the skids personally. He's simply doing justice  to Duane Jackson, a role he first essayed 20 years ago in "The Last Picture  Show." It's Duane who's gone to seed. Not Jeff.  </P> <P> The last time we saw Duane back in 1970 he was an 18-year-old Texas high school  football flash. Now he is middle-aged, out of shape and $12 million in debt.  Bridges has done a splendid job of bringing author Larry McMurtry's character  to life again, abetted by outstanding direction from Peter Bogdanovich.  </P> <P> The other day, Bridges was enjoying pasta at lunch in Westwood, his weight  about 175. Once more he looked like the actor who starred with his brother,  Beau, two years ago in "The Fabulous Baker Boys."  </P> <P> The transformation from Jeff to Duane was carefully calculated. Bridges didn't  use body padding or makeup to create the older Duane. The poundage produced the  actor's concept of the good old Texas boy.  </P> <P> "I usually approach a role by figuring out what the guy I'm playing looks like  physically," Bridges said with a grin.  </P> <P> "Then I try to mold my body along those lines. Duane, after all, was 10 years  older than I am. I needed weight for the age factor and for the shape he would  be in after the kind of food he must have been eating. I put on 35 pounds,  getting my weight up to about 210.  </P> <P> "The weight was uncomfortable. I didn't feel well, which is enough reason to  keep my weight down. But it was worth it because it helped me believe in  Duane."  </P> <P> Working with other performers from the original cast of "The Last Picture Show"  -- Cybill Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Randy Quaid and Cloris Leachman -- was a  powerful inducement that drew Bridges back to the sequel.  </P> <P> "I wanted this picture to measure up to the first one," he said.  </P></p>

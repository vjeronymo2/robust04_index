			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (5): Verdict awaited on the high-yielders - Their long-term performance has yet to be assessed There are two ways of getting an income from investment trusts. You can buy trusts, or particular types of trust securities, specifically designed to provide an above-average yield; or you can buy trusts aiming to produce an above-average total return, and periodically sell some shares to provide an income. If you prefer the total-return method, (resoundingly endorsed by at least one guru, Robin Angus, of NatWest Securities), turn to our article on investing for growth on page 15. Now, a brief explanation of the different types of income specialist. First, trusts which invest in shares with an above-average yield and pass this on to the investor; second, trusts in which the capital is structured in a way that gives an unusually high yield to holders of certain types of security. Income Growth trusts and High Income trusts Both invest in shares with an above-average yield, which they aim to pass on to the investor. The difference in the objectives of the two types may seem slight, but is important. Income growth trusts do not offer such a high immediate yield, but aim to increase your income steadily in future. The vast majority (at least 80 per cent) of their holdings are in UK shares, rather than convertibles or other securities which may offer a high immediate income at the expense of capital growth. Some trusts are more prepared to go overseas than others, and it is worth checking this if you are worried about overseas exposure. If you are comfortable with overseas investment, another group of trusts, International Income Growth funds, do not have geographic restrictions - though in practice most of them have the majority of their portfolio in the UK. A fairly typical investment strategy is to scour out-of-favour sectors for shares the managers reckon are unfairly neglected, and have a correspondingly high yield. The managers then sell when the share price has risen sufficiently to bring the yield in line with the market average. This strategy ran into some problems when the economy was deep in recession and many companies were cutting their dividends. It has been working better now the economy is coming out of recession, because companies are finding it easier to maintain imperilled dividends, and their share prices have benefited accordingly. But it will be harder to find neglected shares now that the market is relatively high. High Income trusts are distinguished both by their yield and by the means by which they achieve it. They aim to provide a yield at least a quarter higher than the FT-SE-A All-Share Index, and keep at least 80 per cent of their assets in UK shares and convertibles. At the moment, for example, high income funds have an average yield of 6.4 per cent, compared with 4.4 per cent for UK Income Growth trusts, 3.9 per cent for the FT-SE 100 index., and 3.7 per cent for the FT-SE-A All Share. Convertibles, a cross between a fixed-interest security and an ordinary share, help the overall portfolio yield, and also produce a good capital performance in rising markets. But they do not generally do well in falling or static markets. Other strategies to boost yield vary, from gearing up with RPI-linked debentures (which provide a cheap source of borrowing at the moment) to investing in the income shares of split-capital trusts. The point to remember is that there is almost always a capital cost to this type of strategy. Income shares of split-capital trusts, for instance, are in many cases bound to produce large capital losses at some future point, though clever trading can mean that the loss is passed on to the next investor. But few of the high-income specialists have been in existence long enough to get a realistic idea of their long-term performance. Split-capital trusts These are trusts which achieve a high yield for some shareholders, mainly through their capital structure rather than their choice of investments. When split-capital trusts were first invented, in the 1960s, they were relatively simple. All the trusts had a pre-set date for winding up - like the redemption date of a gilt. One class of share got all the income and was repaid at a pre-determined level, usually the issue price when the trusts were wound up. The other class got all the capital gains. These 'old fashioned income shares' still exist. But the recent fashion for splits has introduced more complex ways of dividing the total cake. It is important to distinguish between the different types of income share, and between the differing entitlements of individual securities. But, irritatingly, even the investment trust industry does not have a common way of classifying or describing them. Income shares normally have a guaranteed repayment value, but this may increase, decrease or fluctuate over the life of the trust. Very broadly, they can be divided into those which can be expected to provide a worthwhile capital repayment when the trust is wound up, and those which will have only a token value (perhaps 1p) often called 'annuity shares'. Points to consider when looking at income shares with worthwhile capital claims are: what the repayment rights are, how many other classes of capital rank for repayment before the income shares, how the (probable) repayment price relates to the current stockmarket price, and how long the trust has left to run. Points to consider when looking at 'annuity' income shares are: what the probable level of income will be, how long the trust has left to run, and what your capital loss will be. If there are several years left before redemption, the market price of both types of income share may be considerably higher than the redemption price, but the redemption price will exercise an increasingly powerful attraction as redemption looms. Treat an unusually high dividend yield as a warning sign that further inquiry is necessary. Such shares move in a parabola, dragged up by the high income in their early years and pulled down by their redemption price in later years; and the longer the fall is delayed, the steeper it will be, particularly with an annuity share. What are disarmingly called Ordinary Income shares can be even more treacherous, since there are no repayment guarantees. They get a good income, though there have been some dividend cuts, but investors will only get any money back once other types of shareholder have been paid off. They are frequently part of a trust whose other component is zero dividend preference shares. (The zeros, which are issued at a discount, get no income but are entitled to a set amount of the capital on winding up.) Thus the Ordinary Income shares' secondary role is as a highly geared capital play: if things go wrong, they get nothing; if the trust prospers, they could produce big capital gains as well as providing a good income throughout. One helpful description of them is that they are annuities with warrants attached. Experience to date is that the overall performance of most split-level trusts is inferior to that of trusts which do not have to target an unduly high portfolio yield. What is not yet clear is who will bear the real cost of that poor performance, investors in the capital shares or investors in the income shares. Some observers reckon that income investors have the whip hand, in that their need for a high income is immediate and obvious, and that it will be investors with unspecified claims on the capital on winding up who suffer. If they are right, the knowledgeable, skilful and lucky investor in the various types of income share could do well. How does the private investor make use of all these different types of share? Many advisers suggest that it makes sense to put income shares in a personal equity plan, since that magnifies the yield benefit. But personal circumstances will dictate what type of share you put into your Pep. An annuity-type share might, for example, be suitable for a very elderly person who wants the income for a limited period. Many people will be rightly reluctant to tackle the complexities of splits without expert professional advice. And it is worth considering a couple of funds from Exeter Fund Managers: both the Dartmoor Investment Trust and the High Income unit trust invest mainly in the shares of split level trusts - though there are, of course, management charges.</p>

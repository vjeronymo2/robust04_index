			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt steady as strike threat looms SENIOR bourses regained their composure after the German money supply scare on Thursday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell slightly but confounded dealers who had expected a steep decline. The DAX index closed down 6.74 at 1,745.70 for a 0.2 per cent fall on the week. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, shed 3.76 to 710.81, barely changed on the week. Turnover fell to DM5bn from DM6.1bn. News that postal workers had voted to strike had no immediate impact, but investors remained cautious ahead of the weekend when more ballot results are expected. Continental closed up DM3.50 or 1.3 per cent at DM281, off a new year's intraday high of DM283.50. The tyre company was reported to have held a presentation in London yesterday. Some analysts attributed Continental's rise this week to expectations of good 1992 forecasts at its press conference next month and to confirmation that European tyre prices are to increase. Chemical stocks fell ahead of next week's dividend payments. Hoechst fell DM2.70 to DM263.50 and Bayer lost DM1.90 to DM287.10. PARIS made another attempt to reach 2,000 on the CAC-40 index at the start of the new account but subsided as follow-through buying failed to appear. The CAC-40 index reached 1,995.03 in the morning before closing 6.77 higher at 1,984.91. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.6bn. Michelin rose another FFr3.60 to FFr208.40 but volume halved to 923,200 shares. Peugeot also gained, closing FFr16 higher at FFr758. It told analysts in London that it did not believe Michelin planned to sell its 5.8 per cent stake in the car company. Eurotunnel fell 90 centimes or 2.4 per cent to FFr37 with 2.2m shares traded. Analysts were disappointed by yesterday's meeting which failed to offer any reasons to buy the shares. They added that the share's recovery was capped by outstanding equity warrants with an exercise price of FFr42. Pechiney CI's eased FFr7.40 to FFr368 while Pechiney International added FFr3.60 to FFr212 amid talk that the company was preparing for a rights issue. MILAN saw early gains wiped out by profit-taking and a fall in Stet. The Comit index dropped 1.58 to 508.56, up 0.2 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at less than L82.6bn. Stet fell L77 or 3.5 per cent to L2,120 on rumours, later denied, of a rights issue. Sip fell L28 or 1.9 per cent to L1,458 in sympathy. Pirelli continued to rise, adding L15 to L1,365, while Fiat put on L32 to L4,977. ZURICH ended weaker. The SMI index closed down 5.4 at 1,874.7, but was up 0.18 per cent on the week. The chemical sector saw the biggest losses. Roche certificates fell SFr50 to SFr3,120 and Sandoz registered shares were down SFr50 to SFr2,620. BRUSSELS was lifted by blue chips. The Bel-20 index gained 16.15 to 1,221.58. for a 2.1 per cent increase on the week. Petrofina advanced BFr200 or 1.9 per cent to BFr10,900 with 14,800 shares traded, while Solvay was up BFr100 at BFr12,750. Delhaize put on BFr190 or 2 per cent to BFr9,690. AMSTERDAM attracted strong foreign interest. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 128.6, a gain of 1.66 per cent on the week. Turnover was Fl 729.4m. Cyclical stocks and those with exposure to the US and UK were generally stronger. Akzo put on Fl 2.50 or 1.6 per cent to Fl 154.80, while DSM advanced 60 cents to Fl 111.70, but off the day's high of Fl 112.90. Akzo is due to report first quarter results on Wednesday and DSM publishes its first quarter figures next month. US demand for Philips pushed its shares up 50 cents to Fl 37.30 while Daf was 20 cents stronger at Fl 24.80 with UK interest reported. STOCKHOLM made modest gains, thanks to a recovery in Astra and demand for Asea and forestry shares. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 3.1 to 987.3, little changed on the week, in turnover of SKr586m after SKr837m. Astra rebounded in heavy trading. The A restricted rose SKr6 to SKr519 while the B free was up SKr1 at SKr515. The forestry sector was lifted by a government proposal to abolish the general energy taxation on industry. Stora rose SKr4 to SKr301. MADRID's general index was up 0.4 at 250.03 but down 0.8 per cent on the week. Telefonica recovered Pta20 to Pta1,035.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm   1 pm    2 pm     3 pm     close 1167.83  1167.50  1166.56  1167.41 1168.00 1167.29  1167.95  1167.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1168.14    Day's Low  1166.04  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 23    Apr 22   Apr 21    Apr 16    Apr 15 1169.11   1171.34  1166.73   1169.83   1167.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

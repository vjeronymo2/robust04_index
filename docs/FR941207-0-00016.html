			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department supports the commenters who recommended that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> donated foods currently listed in the regulations be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as substitutable with commercial foods without prior approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the distributing agency. However, the Department does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree that all donated foods should be considered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutable. The Department purchases high quality products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which must meet strict specifications for recipient agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in their meal service operations. Because the quality of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-listed donated foods, especially meat and poultry, can vary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tremendously, which will ultimately affect the quality of the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, the Department believes it is necessary to eliminate any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility that inferior commercial product could be substituted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the high quality donated foods provided by USDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the argument that Federal inspectors or graders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could ensure the quality of any commercial product being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituted for donated food is not reasonable. Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspectors or graders are only present in processing plants that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convert donated meat or poultry into finished end products; they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not required to be on-site in bakeries or processing plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which only handle fruits, vegetables and/or grains. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional costs for obtaining the services of inspectors or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graders to perform these services would be extremely high.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, based on the comments received, it is apparent that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters do not favor requiring distributing agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor the level of the processors's commercial production so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they would be permitted to withhold deliveries of donated food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from processors which have reduced their level of commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production because of participation in the State processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule adopts sections 250.30(f)(1)(i) and 250.30(f)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed State processing regulations without change. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alleviate the commenters' concerns, but to maintain the necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program accountability, section 250.30(f)(1)(iii) of this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will require the processor to be responsible for maintaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation that normal commercial production has not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced as the result of participation in the processing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To conform to the change in section 250.30(f)(1)(iii), this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule also adds a new paragraph to section 250.30(c)(4)(xviii) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule. This final rule adopts section 250.30(f)(2) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed State processing regulations as proposed with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor modification for clarification. Additionally, this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule adopts sections 252.3(c) and 252.4(c)(7) of the proposed NCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Time Frames for Processors to Pay Refunds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 250.30(k)(3) of the proposed State processing regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require processors to make refund payments to recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies within 30 days after receipt of any refund application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, sections 250.30(k)(1) and 252.4(c)(4)(i)(B) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule would also permit recipient agencies to file refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications on a Federal fiscal quarterly basis, if the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated refund due for all purchases from that processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. Furthermore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors would be permitted to group together refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for a single recipient agency on a Federal fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis if the total anticipated refund due that recipient agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. These quarterly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options of batching of refund applications and refund payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would only be permitted between a recipient agency and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor, not between a distributor and a processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A total of 16 comments was received on this proposal. Regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 30-day time frame for processors to pay refunds, twelve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters stated that they agreed with this concept and three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters were opposed. Many of those commenters that supported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 30-day time frame did so for the following reasons: 1) a 30-day time frame is more realistic and logical than the 10-day time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frame; 2) a 30-day time frame conforms to time frames used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal business practices; 3) a 10-day time frame is very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to meet because of limited staff resources; and 4) a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30-day time frame is reasonable because a refund payment will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually be received by the recipient agency before the recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's payment for the end products reaches the processor. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three commenters who expressed opposition to the 30-day time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frame stated that it allows the processor to use school food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority money for an excessive period of time. One processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also stated that the current 10-day time frame is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate because it is the key to acceptance of the refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system by recipient agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourteen comments were received regarding quarterly batching of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund applications by recipient agencies and twelve comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were received on quarterly batching of refund payments by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors. While all comments received on the concept of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarterly batching were favorable, three commenters made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following suggestions: 1) the threshold should be increased from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25 dollars to 100 dollars; 2) there should be no minimum dollar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold associated with quarterly submission of refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications by recipient agencies; 3) recipient agencies should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an option to file refund applications monthly or quarterly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and processors must provide refunds within 30 days of receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the refund application; and 4) to accommodate extenuating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, distributing agencies should permit recipient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to submit refund applications and processors to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund payments outside of the quarterly time frames.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments received and the reasons set forth above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule adopts sections 250.30(k)(1) and 250.30(k)(3) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed State processing and section 252.4(c)(4)(i)(B) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed NCP regulations without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Refund Applications/Performance Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 250.30(k)(1) of the proposed State processing regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would eliminate the requirement that recipient agencies must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forward copies of the refund applications to distributing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies at the same time they submit the refund applications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor. Section 250.30(m)(1) of the proposed rule would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also amend the State processing regulations to add the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements: 1) that monthly performance reports be postmarked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no later than the final day of the month following the reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period and the final performance report for the contract period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be postmarked no later than 60 days from the close of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract year; and 2) that performance reports must be submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly unless a processor made no sales and had no inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during that month. Finally, section 250.17 of the proposed State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing regulations would provide that where performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports are electronically transmitted to the distributing agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by means of a facsimile machine, the date printed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facsimile machine on the facsimile copy may serve as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postmark. The Department received seventeen comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

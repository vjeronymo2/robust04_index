			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: Box opened, money gone - Off the Wall BRIAN McMaster is a mild mannered chap and did not complain publicly when he opened the box in the director's office at the Edinburgh Festival and found he had inherited a deficit of Pounds 170,000, and not a booking in sight for the 1992 Festival. McMaster, coming from Welsh National Opera, expects to plan two or three years ahead, so will not make his mark until 1993 at the earliest. In the meantime he has conjured up a patchwork programme for this summer's Festival, with lashings of Tchaikovsky, the innovation of retrospectives - of the plays of Granville Barker and CP Taylor, and a few plums. The most eye-catching is the return of Pina Bausch after 10 years. The most ear arresting is likely to be Elisabeth Soderstrom appearing in Poulenc's opera for solo voice, La Voix Humaine. This is a brave undertaking for a 65-year-old, but apparently there is only one note in the piece that the Swedish soprano views as her Beecher's Brook. * Blinds should have been lowered in Bond Street galleries this week to mark the passing of one of their best customers, Lord Spencer. The British aristocracy stopped collecting art more than a century ago, but Lord Spencer was constantly popping into leading picture dealers, happily disposing of works by van Dyck, Salvator Rosa, Guercino and the like, while Lady Spencer was busy at Partridges buying up 18th century furniture in order to re-decorate Althorp to her brilliant taste. So keen was she on gold that she had a plain 18th century suite gilded by Partridge and paid for it by handing over another suite of furniture so good that the dealers sold it on to the V &amp; A. The Spencers used dealers because they did not want to be seen to be selling off the family treasures publicly at auction, although numerous minor pictures were discreetly unloaded through the salerooms, to the great delight of sharp eyed dealers, well aware that a Spencer provenance would ensure an easy sale. Sometimes the Spencers sold short the family name. Wildenstein picked up a Salvator Rosa for about Pounds 60,000 and sold it on to the National Gallery in 1982 for Pounds 350,000. American museums, such as the Getty, were happy to pay Colnaghi's well for the five Van Dycks that it dispersed from Althorp. In all around Pounds 4m was raised from the sales, with most of it going to shore up the ancestral home and to build modern beach bungalows in Bognor. * It is possible the new Earl, faced with a considerable tax bill, will be forced against his will to dispose of more of the Spencer collection. He will be encouraged by the Pounds 10m that Lord Cholomondeley received this week from the National Gallery in return for his Holbein. In fact this was a deal that satisfied both parties. The market value of the Holbein was probably nearer Pounds 15m, but because of a double tax burden the Marquess would have needed a price of around Pounds 28m from the proposed auction at Christie's to net the equivalent of the Pounds 10m. No one expected such a sum, which would have been a record for any Old Master, to be achieved in the current world economic climate. * Wolfgang Fischer, one of the leading London dealers in 20th century art, has joined the bandwagon and closed down his King Street gallery rather than pay a higher rent in these difficult trading times. Like Kasmin, Max Rutherston, Nicola Jacobs, and Michael Goedhuis he prefers to operate from home. But it is not all gloom and doom. On Election, Day Noel Oddy opens a gallery inside Patisserie Valerie, in the Brompton Road, offering, as well as cakes, works on paper by the current and former Presidents of the RA, Sir Roger de Grey and Sir Hugh Casson, John Bratby, Frederick Gore and others. This is part of a trend - mixing art and food. The Eagle gallery in Farringdon Road has firmly established itself this year above one of London's more fashionable pubs, where an exhibition by Bernadette Kerr opens on Thursday, and Drones, the well established eatery of the rich and famous, now covers its walls with saleable art from young graduates at London's top art schools. Other London galleries are going overseas to drum up custom. The last time Colnaghi operated in Paris was just before the Revolution, when the Italian founder of the firm had to leave pretty sharply. Now the Bond Street dealer is returning, opening up an office next month in the Faubourg St Honore, which positively bristles with glitzy dealers. The gallery is in the former disco of the ultra chic Hotel Bristol. Hardly by chance the Bristol is owned by the German food billionaire, Rudolf Oetker who also owns Colnaghi. For the first year it will act as a representative office, offering French and Italian paintings. Given the remarkable shortage of top Old Master dealers in Paris it should do well. Another London dealer, Hazlett, Gooden &amp; Fox, has no complaints about opening in Manhattan earlier this year. It sold two important paintings at its first show.</p>

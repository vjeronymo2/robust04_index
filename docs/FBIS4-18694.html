			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Blackmail"] </F>   [Text] The EU [European Union] Commission's decision to  refer Greece's embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] to the European Court of Justice  is open and unconcealed blackmail.    And not only is it profound blackmail, given the history of  the European Union, it is also another demonstrative example of  our European partners' one-sided and offensive attitude toward  our country.    With this decision, the EU Commission automatically becomes  an untrustworthy mediator of the problem between Greece and  Skopje.    The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a  transgression  against Greek feelings and every principle of international and  EU law, because it does not recognize Greece's right to react  with countermeasures to Skopje's intransigence, while Skopje  continues falsifying history, using Greek historic symbols, and  spreading offensive propaganda.    The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a provocation  because on the one hand it refers Greece to the European Court  of Justine with a seven-day deadline for lifting the embargo,  and on the other hand it politely calls on Skopje to "reexamine  its position on the issues regarding its constitution and flag  within the framework of finding solutions to all issues,  including the state's name."    The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a provocation  for Greece because it encourages [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov  to continue his intransigent stance and not make any concessions.    Greece has no reason to be afraid, and it will fight at the  European Court for inalienable rights and its own rights. And  it is a battle that Greece will win.    However, beyond the legal and political issue, there is also  a huge issue of EU solidarity, which in practice has been proven  not to exist because it is superseded by various interests and  ambitions.</p>

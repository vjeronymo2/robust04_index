			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Higher margins help Email to ADollars 87m for year Email, the Australian white-goods and building-products manufacturer, yesterday announced a 58.3 per cent increase in after-tax profits for the year to end-March, to ADollars 87.8m (USDollars 65.9m). The rise was achieved on operating revenues of ADollars 1.8bn, up from ADollars 1.47bn a year earlier. The figures included a nine-month contribution from National Consolidated, the building-products and formed-metal business, which added around ADollars 13.7m to after-tax profits. However, earnings per share still rose significantly, to 34.1 cents from 21.7 cents on a fully-diluted basis. Email said that margins rose by one-fifth, due to productivity gains, cost reductions and some volume gains. Export sales also rose significantly.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KING OF CRIME IN THE SUITES;  </P> <P> TWILIGHT AT MAC'S PLACE BY ROSS THOMAS (MYSTERIOUS PRESS: $19.95; 320 PP.)  </P> <P> Anyone reading a Ross Thomas thriller for the first time is in imminent danger  of addiction: One taste is never enough. His books ought to come with a health  warning: Prolonged exposure to this page-turning prose can lead to nervousness,  loss of sleep and antisocial behavior.  </P> <P> Critics, fellow suspense writers and his passionate fans have been singing  Thomas' praises for more than 20 years, with an ever-rising sense of  frustration and injustice: How can it be that a writer so blissfully  entertaining isn't a staple of the best-seller lists? (The question itself has  become a Ross Thomas cliche.) Each new book -- and this is No. 23 -- is  expected to be the "breakthrough" that will put him in the magic circle with  the Elmore Leonards and Robert Ludlums and John Le Carres. Though Thomas is a  steady seller -- and anybody who's been profiled in People magazine can no  longer be considered an obscure cult writer -- a stylist who is this deft ought  to be a household word.  </P> <P> The fact that Thomas often is mentioned with Leonard is wildly misleading.  Leonard works the streets, writing about crime in low places. Thomas writes  about crime in high places. He's the most worldly of thriller writers, equally  at home with a Central American dictator, a Washington labor leader, the madam  of a Shanghai bordello or, in his new book "Twilight at Mac's Place," the inner  offices at Langley.  </P> <P> The Thomas tone -- funny, urbane, politically savvy -- exudes a bouncy  disenchantment. One of the characters in his new book is described as having a  look of "semi-devout fatalism . . . acquired only by those who at some risk  have peered into the human abyss and aren't at all reassured by what they've  seen." That could go for Thomas as well, but as that quote suggests, not far  beneath the jolly cynic lurks a disappointed romantic.  </P> <P> Not for nothing did E. J. Dionne, the New York Times reporter, describe Thomas  as a "Humphrey Bogart liberal." The wonderful, hard-drinking rogues who  populate his adventures have been around the block too many times to be  paragons of virtue; they're willing to play as dirty as the really bad guys.  Yet sooner or later their dormant idealism -- usually expressed by their  contempt for official cant -- peeks out from behind the protective shell.  </P> <P> Thomas' blithe fatalism isn't just literary attitude. What gives it authority  -- and makes his books so damn much fun to read -- is Thomas' insider's  familiarity with the corridors of power. Whether he's writing about corruption  in Southern California ("Chinaman's Chance," arguably his best book), oil and  arms in Libya ("The Mordida Man"), labor unions ("The Porkchoppers"), African  tribal politics ("The Seersucker Whipsaw") or that wonderful Shanghai bordello  ("The Fools in Town Are on Our Side"), Thomas gives you the impression that  he's been behind the closed doors where the deals get made, the palms are  greased, the cover-ups are arranged.  </P> <P> His characters may have fanciful names like Lucifer Dye and Velveeta Keats and  Otherguy Overby, and they're certainly smarter and cooler under pressure than  anybody you or I will ever know, but even his most baroque fabulations have the  ring of political veracity. Thomas just makes the awful truth hopelessly  entertaining.  </P> <P> "Twilight at Mac's Place," his rousingly adroit new thriller, begins with the  death of a 57-year-old sometime CIA operative named Steadfast Haynes. His  companion at the moment of his death, at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, is  a 33-year-old French reporter, Isabelle Gelinet, who promptly, and subtly,  blackmails the bureaucrats at Langley into giving her old friend an Army burial  at Arlington Cemetery. Steady, she informs them, has left behind a copy of his  memoirs that just might give an honest account of what Haynes "had really done  as an occasional agency hire in Africa, the Middle East, Central America and  Southeast Asia."  </P> <P> At Steady's sparsely attended Arlington funeral, we meet an arms-dealing  ex-French Foreign Legionnaire named Tinker Burns; Isabelle; an aging CIA  operative named Gilbert Undean, who knew Steady in his Laos days, and the  novel's true protagonist, Granville Haynes, Steady's 33-year-old son. Granville  is one of Thomas' larger-than-life, improbably well-rounded men of action. A  former LAPD homicide detective with a master's degree in Old French from the  University of Virginia, he has recently won the state lottery, enabling him to  retire from the force to pursue an acting career. As it turns out, he'll need  to be both cop and actor to get out of this situation alive.  </P> <P> As the inheritor of Steady's combustible memoirs -- which he is not certain  actually exist -- Granville finds himself at the center of a bidding war. An  anonymous figure offers him $100,000 for the book. The CIA, cringing at the  thought of publication, makes a counter offer. And then the war gets lethal.  Isabelle, who helped Steady write his memoirs, is found murdered in her  bathtub. Someone, it seems, has a very literal notion of a kill fee.  </P> <P> No more of the plot should be revealed; suffice it to say that the nastiness is  just beginning, and the twists come with breathless efficiency. (Amazingly,  Thomas never outlines his plots -- he makes them up as he goes along.)  </P> <P> Adding to the fun is the appearance of two Thomas regulars, McCorkle and  Padillo, the heroes of his first, Edgar-winning novel, "The Cold War Swap," as  well as "Cast a Yellow Shadow" and "The Back-Up Men." Mac's Place, as the  faithful already know, is their dimly lit Washington bar and restaurant, the  sort of place, Padillo explains, "you go when you have to meet someone and  explain why you won't be getting the divorce after all." Mac's Place is to  Thomas' Washington what Rick's was to Casablanca.  </P> <P> This time Padillo and McCorkle, getting on in years, cede center stage to the  younger Granville and to McCorkle's own 22-year-old daughter Erika, who's  inherited her father's taste for adventure. McCorkle himself has hit 221 pounds  and now chews Nicorettes, while the dashing Padillo -- "the assassin's  assassin," as one of his enemies calls him -- seems to have stolen "the secret  of eternal middle age -- if not youth itself." The presence of these "old  dragons," a step or two slower than they used to be, gives Thomas, 63, the  opportunity to punctuate his suspense tale with witty ruminations on the  changing times, whether it's the inflationary cost of hiring a hit man or the  fact that nobody eats his salad after his meals any more.  </P> <P> "Twilight at Mac's Place" takes place in the Washington of the Oliver North  trials, shortly after the inauguration of the 41st President. "What you've got  now is the first director of Central Intelligence ever to be President, which  they don't seem to mention much anymore," remarks Tinker Burns. Mixed in with  characters with work names like Pabst and Schlitz are sprinkled resonate  references to Casey, Poindexter, Hakim and North. These are the real toads in  Thomas' imaginary garden, and their presence seems to inspire him to his  mordant best.  </P> <P> "Twilight at Mac's Place" is the most stylish and suspenseful of the  Padillo-McCorkle series, the most densely populated with memorable characters.  As always, there's not a wasted motion in his fleet, elegant prose.  </P> <P> This book is serious fun. But what Ross Thomas thriller isn't?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  (Free Democratic Party of Germany) does not see any alternative  to continuing support for the reform forces in the East, "as  they are represented by (Russia's) President Boris Yeltsin." In  a discussion in the Bundestag on Friday [11 March] about aid to  the reform democracies in the East, Kinkel stressed "the Federal  Government's pioneering role." By providing almost 90 billion  German marks [DM] so far to the countries on the territory of  the former Soviet Union, it has provided more than half of the  entire international aid and is surpassed only by the United  States. In contrast, Japan has spent DM46 million.    Kinkel said that German aid to the Central European reform  states (except the CIS) has amounted to about 37.5 billion since  the end of 1989. He advocated accepting Russia as an equal  member into the G-7 groups of the large industrialized  countries. [passage omitted]</p>

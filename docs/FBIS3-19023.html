This  happened yesterday during the discussion of a statute law aimed  at amending the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands.    The Aruba debate was one of the rare occasions in which the  Chamber was filled with "special delegates" from the Antilles  and Aruban states. The last time this happened was almost 10  years ago, when a provision was included in the Charter  stipulating that Aruba would assume a separate status as of 1  January 1996, becoming independent as of the same date under  international law. In the bill currently on the table, this  provision has been scrapped. Minister Hirsch Ballin was  assisted in the defense by the prime ministers of Aruba and the  Antilles, the ministers plenipotentiary from both countries, and  the Aruban justice minister.    Only the two single-person groups, the Reformist Political  Federation and the Center Democrats, opposed the bill. The  Parliaments of the Antilles and Aruba unanimously supported it.  The Netherlands still includes the condition that talks with  Aruba on improving the administration of the island and  reorganizing government finances are held and implemented in  good time. [passage omitted]    Aruban opposition leader Eman lashed out fiercely at the  government of Prime Minister Oduber, who, he said, has brought  the island to the brink of bankruptcy with an overly generous  spending policy and by appointing political friends to official  posts. Eman warned Minister Hirsch Ballin that financial  support by the Netherlands for Oduber in Aruba will be construed  as "a bonus for improper administration." The Aruban prime  minister had already said before the debate that Eman practiced  dishonest opposition and has no time for the radical  re-organization which he initiated.</p>

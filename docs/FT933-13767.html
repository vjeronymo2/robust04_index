			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / George Formby fans are not amused: Tim King visits Blackpool to judge reaction to the EC environment ruling against its beaches BLACKPOOL, Britain's biggest and brashest seaside town, was humbled this week. Even the George Formby Appreciation Society was pushed to keep smiling when the European Court of Justice ruled that Blackpool's beaches did not meet environmental standards. The court ruling came as no surprise to Mr Alan Hall, a Blackpool deckchair attendant for four seasons. 'I would not set foot in the sea except to recover a deckchair,' he says. The timing of the court judgment - on the eve of the UK school holidays - was a particular blow. The borough council's tourism office describes it as Pounds 1m of bad publicity. It says the water is cleaner than it used to be, and some day it will be cleaner still. By the standards of most seaside resorts, Blackpool has a serious image problem. But normal standards do not apply in this town of 105,000 people, where Father Christmasses adorn seafront lamp-posts in July. Seventeen million people visit Blackpool each year precisely because the town is not normal. The business of Blackpool is to astonish the senses with noise, colour, light and size. Mr Geoffrey Thompson, managing director of Pleasure Beach, an amusement park full of rides, shows and cafeterias which brings in 6.5m visitors a year, says Blackpool has largely turned its back on the beach in favour of the entertainments across the promenade, and has got a good swap. Next year Pleasure Beach will unveil the largest roller coaster in the world. To pay for itself, the Pounds 9m ride will need to attract another 1m visitors. Mr Thompson believes it could achieve that in just one year. To market Blackpool, Pleasure Beach has formed an alliance with First Leisure Corporation which runs the three piers, the Winter Gardens, the Blackpool Tower and dozens of clubs and shows. Restoration of the tower was completed at Easter and next year will see extravagant celebrations of its centenary. Mr Roy Page, managing director of First Leisure's resorts division, says the company invests 'because we believe Blackpool has a good future'. To Blackpool's guest house owners, that future looks very different. In days gone by Blackpool boomed when northern industrial towns shut down for a fortnight and their populations emigrated en masse to the seaside. The traditional boarding houses still cater for visitors from Tyneside, the west Midlands, Glasgow, south Wales and Dublin. Competition makes Pounds 9 a night for bed and breakfast very common - half what it would be in Bournemouth. But now the trend is for short breaks - a week at the most. The faster turnover is good news for Pleasure Beach and First Leisure, but bad news for the small hotels. Day trippers pour cash into the amusement parks but do nothing for the hotels. Mr John Donovan, secretary of the Blackpool Hotel and Guest House Association, says his 1,300 members will suffer most from the bad publicity about Blackpool beach. He says: 'I wouldn't say our members are making money, they are covering debts, keeping their heads above water.' Mr Donovan says hotel trade fell 20 per cent in 1991 on the previous year and a further 10 per cent last year. Water is one of the costs that is rising - North West Water has completed its metering programme and water bills for some hoteliers have doubled. The bigger hotels benefit most from Blackpool's conference trade, which has just enjoyed its best year. Those attending events this year at the Winter Gardens have included 20,000 pigeon fanciers and 10,000 young farmers, who are regarded as good spenders. Suggestions that the quality of the beach is of little importance are supported by the fact that the resort is busiest when the beach is cold and dark - during the traditional illuminations, the show of lights along the promenade which this year runs from September 3 to November 5. Old illuminations are one of Blackpool's few growth exports. Last year some went to Bangkok. This year some were sold to Saudi Arabia and now adorn the seafront at Jeddah - an irony, as British Aerospace, which employs about 5,000 people at nearby factories, is hoping for an order for Tornadoes from the Saudis. There have been successes in winning civil service jobs, principally the Department of Social Security and National Savings, but employment in manufacturing has been shrinking. Burton, the biscuit maker, has just announced 450 job losses. British Nuclear Fuels is cutting back. Lancashire County Council estimates that unemployment in Blackpool borough is 10 per cent - 13 per cent in winter  - and as high as 30 per cent in some areas. Mr Ivan Taylor, the council's leader, said income levels were 32 per cent below the national average. He fears a low-wage, low-skill economy, over-dependent on tourism. Blackpool is seeking assisted area status from the government, an appeal which is not easy to make while the resort exudes brash self-confidence to appeal to visitors. Mr Taylor said: 'We have trouble convincing the civil servants in Whitehall that we are a deprived area. They ask: 'Are you a deprived area or a nice place to visit?''</p>

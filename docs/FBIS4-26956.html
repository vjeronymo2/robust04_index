			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Forestry Minister Xu Youfang by </F> staff reporter Lu Peifa (7120 1014 3127) on World Environment  Day; place not given: "Heavy Responsibilities for Environmental  Protection and Development--Interviewing Forestry Minister Xu  Youfang on World Environment Day"]    [Text] It is one of China's basic national policies to  plant trees, make the country green, and improve the natural  environment. To develop forestry, China has enacted and carried  out a series policies, laws, regulations, and measures, which  enable China's forestry construction to embark on a course of  steady development. On World Environment Day, this correspondent  interviewed Forestry Minister Xu Youfang to hear his views on  environmental protection and development.    Every year for more than a decade, leaders of the central  government, in their capacity as ordinary citizens, have taken  the lead to participate in afforestation activities, and their  acts have set a good example for people throughout the country.  The joint efforts of people throughout the country have brought  about great and historic changes in the construction of China's  forest industry, and great achievements have been made in  afforestation and forest protection. Since 1981, a total of 3.4  billion people have taken part in tree-planting activities on  various occasions and 18 billion trees have been planted. Over  the past few years, some 80 million mu of land have been  afforested each year. By now, three provinces -- Guangdong,  Fujian, and Hunan -- have afforested all barren land that can be  planted with trees, and they have been commended by the party  Central Committee and the State Council. This year, some other  provinces will accomplish the task, too. Major achievements  have been made in the construction of a 100-million-mu base of  fast-growing timber, the "three norths" (north China, northeast  China, and northwest China) shelterbelt networks, the  shelterbelt networks in the middle and upper reaches of the  Chang Jiang, the coastal shelterbelt networks, the farmland  shelterbelt networks on the plains, the Taihang Shan  afforestation project, and the national desert control project,  all of which form the basic framework of China's ecological  improvement efforts. While the scale of afforestation is  expanding continuously, close attention also has been given to  raising its quality. The verified total acreage of man-made  forests that are up to the state requirements has reached 285  million mu, and the yield has gone up from 65.6 percent in 1988  to 84.5 percent in 1992. The consumption of forest resources  also has been brought under effective control. According to the  second national survey of forest resources (1977-81), the annual  average consumption of forest resources was 294 million cubic  meters, while annual average growth was 275 million cubic  meters, with an annual average deficit of 18.75 million cubic  meters. In the third national survey of forest resources  (1984-88), annual average consumption was 344 million cubic  meters and annual average growth was 366 million cubic meters.  By the time of the fourth national survey (1989-93), annual  average consumption was down to 320 million cubic meters, while  annual average growth went up to 400 million cubic meters.  These figures show that China's forest resources are increasing  steadily. In a situation in which forest resources in the world  as a whole are on the decrease, the increase in China's forest  resources can be considered an important contribution China has  made to the development of forestry and the protection of the  world's natural environment.    China, however, still faces an arduous task in building up  its forest industry. On the one hand, it is still a country  with a shortage of forests. Its percentage of forest coverage  is 13.92 percent, lower than the world average, and its per  capita average of forests is even lower. There are still large  tracts of mountains and wasteland which need to be afforested,  and large areas of desert and land threatened by desert which  need to be improved. On the other hand, owing to the  insufficient forest coverage, the problem of the natural  environment remains serious. Taking the country as a whole,  half of the population, one-third of the cultivated land, and  one-third of the major cities are situated below the  flood-warning line of rivers, and areas that generate two-thirds  of the country's total industrial and agricultural output value  are threatened by floods. According to statistics, there is an  average of about 500 million mu of farmland under the constant  menace of natural disaster, of which that caused by drought  accounts for 61 percent; that by flooding, 24 percent; that by  hailstorms, 9 percent; and that by frost, 6 percent. In  addition, there are the calamities of dry and hot winds and low  temperatures. To effect a fundamental change in this situation,  the most important thing is to further sharpen the whole  society's sense of ecology and a better environment, make great  efforts to develop the forest industry, continuously expand the  green canopy, and bring into full play the role of forests as an  ecological shelterbelt with their multiple functions.    Minister Xu pointed out: In the world today, the cry for the  development of forestry is growing louder and louder, and  China's modernization drive has imposed higher and higher  demands on the forest industry. As a major task and the chief  content of environmental construction, forestry must make its  contribution not only to the improvement of the natural  environment, but also -- in conjunction with the readjustment of  the industrial setup in the countryside and the local economy --  to improving the livelihood of people in mountainous areas, to  improving the investment environment in the drive to open up to  the outside world, and to promoting spiritual civilization.  China will adhere to its own road for the development of the  forest industry, and taking as its objective the development of  highly efficient and sustained forestry that provides greater  and better yields and focusing closely on the two major tasks of  reform and development, will comprehensively accomplish the goal  for the development of forestry in the 1990s -- that is, to  fulfill the predetermined national afforestation tasks one or  two years before the turn of this century. By 1995, 13  provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) will basically  accomplish the task of afforesting all their barren mountains  where trees can be planted, and by 2000, the number of provinces  (autonomous regions and municipalities) will reach 21, and the  percentage of forest coverage in the country will be raised to  around 15.3 percent. By then, the total output value of the  forest industry will increase from the current 140 billion yuan  to 304 billion yuan.</p>

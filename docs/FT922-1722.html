			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Food: A supersaver's Cotswold delight - Nicholas Lander pops down to Gloucestershire for lunch THE JOURNEY to the restaurant cost me Pounds 9, the cost today of a taxi ride across central London. Instead, it was the 10.05 British Rail supersaver from Paddington which took me through 100 miles of English town and country and deposited me at 11.30, just in time for an aperitif, at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. A brisk five-minute walk from the station and I was in the high street, a broad, tree-lined avenue which must have been a glorious sight in its heyday. Today, sadly, it is an incongruous mixture. At one end, in Cotswold stone, is the only inviting police station I have seen, but it faces a supermarket and an ugly complex of retirement homes. The rest of the high street contains antique shops, tea rooms, pubs, hotels, and two fish and chip shops. On a corner is the Marsh Goose restaurant and food shop, which opened in November 1990. It has three owners: Gordon Campbell-Grey, Leo Brooke-Little and Sonya Kidney, the chef. When I asked her whether a relatively small restaurant with three owners was not a recipe for disaster, she said they had all worked together for four years at the Feathers Hotel in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, and that, anyway, Campbell-Grey lives in New York. He checks on his investment with a weekly telephone call. The Marsh Goose could almost be a village corner shop - you have to lower your head as you walk in, and there are piles of food here, cases of wine there - except for the quality of produce on offer: half-pints of home-made soup, a variety of pates and terrines, excellent lightly-cured gravadlax and some delicious breads and croissants, as well as biscuits and cakes from the kitchen's pastry section. The Pounds 100,000 the partners have invested has been spent more noticeably on the restaurant next door. Skylights allow natural light into almost all of the building. Square, purpose-made dining tables with upright, padded chairs provide an air of comfort and elegance. The atmosphere and the food in the restaurant are distinctive, too. This is partly because of the partners' good taste, and partly because Kidney, 38, and Brooke-Little, 26, have not worked in very many other restaurants before. Indeed, Brooke-Little's only job before the Feathers was on a building site. Thus both have felt free to break the rules. Front of house at the Marsh Goose, this manifests itself in three ways. First, the dining tables are not pre-set with cutlery - they are 'laid up' only after your order is taken - which gives them an uncluttered look. Second, the waiters wear eye-catching bow ties (modelled on one worn by a guest to the opening). Third, the partners realised from their time at the Feathers just how critical the pricing of their menu would be, particularly at lunchtime. That menu, therefore, begins with a list of starters and light meals (from Pounds 2 to Pounds 5.50), then a main course salad (Pounds 7.50) and, finally, a range of the more obvious hot main courses at Pounds 8-Pounds 10. This, together with a no-minimum-charge policy, has attracted more women and visitors at lunchtime, and caused the restaurant to rely less on local businessmen. None of these thoughtful policies could have borne fruit without Kidney's obvious talents. Born in Barbados, she went to catering college in Wales and then to a succession of hotels and restaurants around England, including a stint at Sharrow Bay in the Lake District. Her style is simple and direct. A smoked trout mousse wrapped in smoked salmon was rich and creamy but lightened by a well-dressed salad. A fillet of brill was cooked with top-quality saffron. And what could have been a sharp, iced, rhubarb terrine was sweetened by some delicious ginger shortbread. I caught the train back to London, after an excellent meal, with some gravadlax in my bag for a more abstemious lunch the next day. My strongest memory, however, will be of looking through the kitchen door, watching a happy Sonya Kidney at work with an inspirational glass of mineral water at her side.

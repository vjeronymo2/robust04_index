			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Jaime Crombet, vice president of </F> the National Assembly of the People's Government, by Rosa Maria  Godoy; time and place not given -- recorded]    [Text] On 10 May, the process of progress reporting began  with the assembly held in District No. 40 of the Camilo  Cienfuegos People's Council in Santa Cruz del Norte, Havana  Province. Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government [ANPP], participated in the assembly  which was characterized by its organization, its brevity, and  its search for solutions to area problems as soon as they arise.  Also attending the assembly were administrative officials of  the units corresponding to this People's Council, who responded  to the queries of the population as necessary.    Jaime Crombet explained that during the current progress  report process, efforts are being made to avoid monotony,  formalisms, lengthy reports, and limited participation of the  constituency -- things that would block the appropriate  development of these assemblies.    [Begin recording] [Crombet] We think that the progress  report  process is not merely a delegate meeting with his constituency.  This is a dynamic, constant, and daily process, as we have seen  here. This assembly is a summary, a sample of which we can take  advantage not only to recount what has been done but also to  project future tasks and promote collective participation in  solving the problems of the community. This process also permits  channeling any unresolved problem the community or district may  have, if it is beyond the realm of the district, to the People's  Council for resolution. In that case, of course, the delegates  must take it to the Peoples' Council and then to the  municipality; some are national level problems.    The people know there are many material problems for which  there are no feasible solutions at this time, such as power  outages, transportation, food supplies, or medicine supplies.  There are many problems that are the result of the economic  situation of the nation, the special period. The people, as we  have seen here today, know that many problems do have solutions,  and that some are subjective problems.    We need to have those problems brought up and, depending on  the possibilities and types of problems, to promote solutions  and the participation of the constituency. We have also  encouraged taking advantage of these meetings to highlight,  emphasize, and encourage the main events that have taken place  in that community. References can be made to international,  national, provincial, and municipal problems. We believe,  however, that it is essential that the people know who are the  best students; if there has been a graduation; whether there is  a vanguard student; who are the most outstanding combatants;  whether there are workers in the distriact who are national  vanguards; who are the best sugarcane cutters; which members of  the Federation of Cuban Women are going to be delegates to the  municipal assembly, provincial assembly, or congress. These  accomplishments of the people should be highlighted.    Tonight, we have seen here that the assembly concluded with  a  cultural activity, not with artists of national caliber but with  amateur artists from this People's Council and activities that  the people enjoy. We also saw the active participation of  children; they were spontaneous and appealing. This assembly  moved quickly. There is no need for assemblies to be boring. Not  all assemblies have to be alike. Each community has its own  characteristics; cities have their characteristics; country  towns have other characteristics. We want great diversity,  dynamism, and participation.    We do not want rigid formulas; above all, we want to  motivate  the people. We have to stimulate the people so that there will  be the utmost participation because, in these difficult times of  the special period, we need the people's backing, their support  for the Revolution and the measures that must be adopted. This  is a process of ratification and willingness to make the  sacrifices needed to preserve the main values for which we are  fighting: our sovereignty, national independence, the  accomplishments of socialism, and the preservation of the  fatherland.    It is important, for these to become assemblies of  revolutionary confirmation. The most important aspect of the  assemblies, as was confirmed here, is the ratification of the  willingness of the immense majority of our people to support the  accords of the ANPP and the measures that, little by little, the  Council of State will implement. Measures against ill-gotten  wealth, against hoarders, have already been announced. These  measures have the massive backing of the people. Measures will  be implemented, however, that will not be so popular; some of  the people will not be pleased with those measures. Therefore,  what we need is for the revolutionary forces at these  assemblies, those who are more aware of the facts, to explain,  inform, and clarify things when a portion of our people are not  fully convinced of the reasons behind each of the decisions to  be adopted in compliance with the resolution of the special  session of the ANPP.    [Godoy] In this process, the attendance of managers and  administrators has also been stressed.    [Crombet] That is essential, and we have seen that here.  When  the main figures of the municipal administration, of the  entities that work at the Peoples' Council level, are not  present, many questions go unanswered and then the issues have  to be relayed to the People's Council or municipal authorities  by the delegate; thereupon the assemblies lose dynamism,  efficiency, and effectiveness.    This has happened in many places. The manager of the grocery  store is not present at the assembly; problems relating to the  grocery store are discussed and the administrator is not  present. It is essential to the quality of the assemblies that  the principal figures -- the school principal; the director or  administrator of the daycare center; the administrator of the  grocery store, or neighborhood market, or vegetable market; the  butcher; the local doctor; the main administrative officials --  be present.    The municipal administrative officials should organize a  schedule and attend the assemblies so they can actively  participate. Then, whenever proposals are made, the issues can  be debated and analyzed and the possible solutions evaluated in  the assembly.    This is the better way. If the problem can be solved or  clarified at the assembly, that is even better. Sometimes, this  type of assembly is much more efficient than those where the  involved parties are not present because then the proposals must  be left for later and the people are told the outcome  afterwards. Sometimes the information does not arrive on time or  at the appropiate time. We have seen how many of the problems  brought up here were immediately discussed and solutions and  alternatives found. The process becomes much more dynamic and  efficient when those responsible for the things the people need  to solve are present. This has to be scheduled and controlled;  it is not spontaneous.

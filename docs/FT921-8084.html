			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Warning over results in school 'league tables' PUBLICATION of school examination results in 'league tables' can be seriously misleading if made without an estimate of 'added value', according to a paper published by the National Commission for Education. The paper, by Professor Andrew McPherson of Edinburgh University, calls for 'raw results' of tests and exams published by the government and local authorities to be accompanied by an assessment of the contribution a school makes to its pupils' progress. This should take account of each pupil's prior level of attainment and other factors influencing progress. The paper is the first to be published by the commission, a privately funded body conducting an in-depth inquiry into Britain's education system. The National Association of Head Teachers will seek a High Court injunction tomorrow to prevent the governors of Stratford School in east London from impeding the headteacher in the running of the school.

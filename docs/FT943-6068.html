			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Joy turns to tension as Falls Rd hails peace A day of jubilation boiled over into tension in the Roman Catholic Falls Road in Belfast last night as the IRA ceasefire came into effect. Hundreds of people, who had spent the day celebrating the breakthrough, put the nearby Springfield Road police station under virtual siege, waving banners and the Irish tricolour. As a police helicopter hovered overhead, and RUC vans converged on the scene, one man scaled the 20 ft caging around the station to wave his flag to the cheering crowds below. The mood was a dramatic culmination to the euphoria that had been building up among the crowds in the area during the day. As the news of the ceasefire was first announced in the morning, one old woman said to me delightedly: 'It would have been like this if we had won the World Cup.' She grabbed my arm and started to dance a jig. 'I've been waiting for this for 25 years, and now we have got it we are going to have a party]' she said. As she spoke a procession of more than 50 cars, horns blaring, began to wend its way up and down the road. Most carried Irish flags and Sinn Fein posters. 'Brilliant, fantastic, any bloody word you like,' said George, one of the drivers. 'They are the reason I'm so glad,' he added, pointing to his two young children in the back of his car. Outside Sinn Fein's headquarters the crowd shouted: 'We want Gerry, we want Gerry]' Eventually the president of Sinn Fein appeared to loud cheers. 'I have got a bottle of champagne in one hand and a bunch of flowers in the other,' Mr Adams said. 'What's happened to the ballot box and the rifle?' a man whispered to me - although his appeared to be a lone protest. But later in the afternoon, some along the Falls Road questioned the joy. 'This will not take me off the Protestant hit list, will it?' said Jim, the 21-year-old manager of a takeaway restaurant. 'The judge of whether this means anything at all is whether I can start delivering food along the Shankill,' he added. 'And I tell you, if I got a call to go up there tonight I wouldn't even dream of it.' Shaun, a taxi driver, warned that little had changed. 'Be very careful down here - if one of our cheeky lads thinks you are a Prod there will be no peace for you, whatever Mr Adams says,' he said. 'It really is up to Paisley and his people now.' Along the Protestant Shankill Road there were few visible signs of optimism, although people felt secure enough to give their full names. Jim McBride, who has lived on the road for all of his 90 years, said the ceasefire would be unlikely to change anything. 'The tit-for-tat killings will continue, neither side is going to lay down its arms,' he said. 'It's too late for that now - there is too much at stake. The IRA is running a business.'</p>

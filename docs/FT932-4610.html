			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (12): Calls for support still unheeded - Paul Betts on the message to government from industry THE HEADS of Britain's aerospace industry have been filing in to a trade and industry committee in the House of Commons during the past few months. Their message has been invariably the same. They warned that unless the government started digging deep into its pocket to provide the industry with more research and development funds, the UK risked losing its pre-eminent position as a world aerospace leader. The industry, with an overall turnover of Pounds 11bn last year, accounted for about 4 per cent of UK manufacturing output and about 3.5 per cent of UK manufacturing employment. With exports of Pounds 7.7bn last year, it accounted for 9 per cent of all UK exports of manufactured goods and contributed about Pounds 2.5bn to the country's balance of trade in 1992. An annual average growth of 12.6 per cent over the last decade means it has also outperformed the rest of UK manufacturing industry in terms of productivity, accor- ding to the Department of Trade and Industry. But during the past three years of deep recession in the civil aerospace sector, compounded by the decline in government defence spending, the industry has faced pres- sures that are altering its shape and putting at risk its long-term prospects. Employment has fallen from 194,000 people in 1989 to 146,000 at the end of last year. It is still falling as aerospace and defence companies continue to announce new restructurings and job cuts. Rationalisation has also led to greater consolidation in the industry and the search for international partnerships and mergers. British Aerospace, the coun- try's biggest company in this sector, has forged an alliance with Taiwan Aerospace for its loss making regional jet activities, resulting in the closure of its historic plant at Hatfield outside London. It is in advanced discussions to merge its guided weapons business with the French Matra group and is looking for international partners for its turbopropeller commuter aircraft business based in Scotland. Rolls-Royce, the engine manufacturer, is also talking with Taiwan over the possib- ility of Taiwanese investment in the family of regional aircraft engines it is devel- oping with BMW of Germany. Like BAe, it is rationalising its sites, closing its helicopter engine plant at Leavesden in Hertfordshire and an aero- engine component facility at Parkside, Coventry. In the aerospace component sector, Dowty has been taken over by TI group and Lucas has been regularly cited as vulnerable to a takeover. Shorts of Northern Ireland, the country's oldest aircraft manufacturer, has been absorbed by Bombardier of Canada and has reached partnership agreements with Thomson CSF of France in the short range missiles business and with another French company, Hurel-Dubois, in the field of engine nacelles. But the industry warns that it requires government support to develop a coherent strategy for the future. 'Unless the UK develops such a coherent strategy, our aerospace industry will fall behind,' says Mr Roy McNulty, the president of Shorts who will also become this month president of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, the industry's trade association. In 1992, for the second consecutive year, the UK aerospace industry was behind France in the world league. In terms of turnover, it is now in third place after the US in first and France in second. With the exception of Belgium, the industry has also been growing more slowly that the aerospace sector of other European Community countries. EC statistics show the UK aerospace sector grew by 1.5 per cent from 1980 to 1991, while its French counterpart grew by 4 per cent, Italy by 4.2 per cent, Germany by 8 per cent, Spain by 7.3 per cent and the Netherlands by 10.2 per cent. 'The industry has not benefited from the hands-off approach of the UK. We've simply not been spending enough and we've not been getting the same amount of support as other countries,' Mr McNulty says. In common with other indus- try leaders, he believes the government should increase its support for aerospace research and development from the current level of about Pounds 25m to about Pounds 100m a year. 'The government is spending more money on astronomy than on aerospace R&amp;D; they should be supporting aerospace much more since it is one of the few manufacturing success stories of this country instead of looking at the stars in the sky,' he says. Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, told the parliamentary committee that Britain had been outmanoeuvred by foreign governments in the aerospace business because of its unwillingness to collaborate with industry. He urged government to intervene to help UK aerospace avoid 'continuing industrial decline'. In recent months, the dialogue between government and industry has improved significantly. The government has continued to give its strong support for the European Fighter Programme (now renamed Eurofighter 2000) which is still clouded with uncertainty. But Eurofighter apart, the industry believes the government must contribute more to ensure the UK remains at the leading edge of new aerospace technological developments. The SBAC has emphasised that aerospace companies will need to invest heavily in new technologies at a time when product development costs are growing by between 5 and 10 per cent a year above inflation. However, companies are finding it increasingly difficult to sustain high rates of investment because the return on their sales continues to be squeezed by recession, the slump in the civil aircraft market and declining defence spending. With the trend towards a global aerospace industry, the challenge for the UK will be to play a leading role in the international partnerships being forged. But UK companies will also have to be in a position to bring to the table their own contribution to future aerospace technology and innovation. As the Royal Aeronautical Society recently put it in its submission to the parliamentary committee investigating the state of the British aerospace industry: 'The government's aerospace policy priority should be the explicit recognition of aerospace as a key industry. This has been one of the first initiatives of the Clinton administration in the US.'  -----------------------------------------------------                 UK exports/imports           Military and civil (poundsbn)  ----------------------------------------------------- Year         Exports    Imports    Trade                                   balance  ----------------------------------------------------- 1980           2.7        2.3       0.4 1981           2.3        1.5       0.8 1982           2.8        1.8       1.1 1983           2.9        1.9       1.0 1984           3.2        2.3       0.9 1985           3.8        2.8       1.0 1986           4.3        2.4       1.9 1987           5.0        2.7       2.3 1988           5.4        3.7       1.6 1989           8.0        5.5       2.4 1990           8.0        5.9       2.0 1991           7.9        5.4       2.5 1992           7.7        5.2       2.5  ----------------------------------------------------- Sources: Business Monitor, Overseas Trade Statistics  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

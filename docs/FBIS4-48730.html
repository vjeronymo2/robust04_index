			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Alves Antonio] </F>   [Text] Good evening! After about a five-day break, the  Angolan peace talks exercise has resumed here in Lusaka with the  magic wand of mediator Alioune Blondin Beye in operation. All  Zambian holidays are strictly observed by Alioune Blondin Beye,  special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola.  Today he broke the tradition, however, by receiving in his  apartment this afternoon the negotiating team from the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which had  returned from Huambo today. Although nothing concrete is known  about the meeting, it is thought that the UNITA men briefed  Alioune Blondin Beye on the results obtained in their meetings  with their leadership on negotiations with the government here  in Lusaka.    Sources close to the mediator told Luanda Radio Nacional  that  it is hoped that delegations from the government and UNITA will  meet alone tomorrow. The source added, however, that everything  will depend on Malian-born Alioune Blondin Beye who will  certainly try to use an effective tactic to speed up the  negotiating process.    The Angolan peace process mediator is meanwhile working on  his report to be sent to the meeting of the UN Security Council  in New York set for 31 May.    The government delegation is all set for talks. The issues  under discussion, within the framework of national  reconciliation, are the future of the Voice of Resistance of the  Black Cockerel; special status for Jonas Savimbi; his security  and the security of senior UNITA officials; and UNITA's  participation in the government.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Accor talks stumble over Suez bid for more control The relationship between Accor, the French hotels group, and Suez, its biggest shareholder, has been called into question following an apparent breakdown in negotiations concerning an increase in the stake held by Suez in its long-term partner. The two companies had been discussing an increase in Suez's participation aimed at providing a solid core shareholder for Accor. But the negotiations ran into trouble concerning the extent to which Suez would play a management role, and Accor said that it had become clear to both parties that they could not move ahead. 'They wanted powers of decision which we could not accept,' Accor said. Suez declined to comment on the state of the talks, but said it would make an announcement on Monday concerning the future of its 12.4 per cent stake in Suez, held through Societe Generale de Belgique, its Belgian subsidiary. Industry observers in Paris said that the rupture of negotiations could prompt Suez to reduce its stake in Accor. 'If they haven't reached agreement, then a sale of some of its stake seems likely, although it may not be immediate,' said Mr Jean-Jaques Vironda, leisure analyst at Societe Generale in Paris. According to Mr Vironda, the disagreement between the two companies revealed the fragility of Accor's shareholding structure. The Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state financial institution which is Accor's second biggest shareholder, is widely thought to want to sell its stake. Suez was regarded as a stable core shareholder, but Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, demanded a significant management role in Accor and a strong influence in designating the eventual successor to Mr Paul Dubrule and Gerard Pelisson, the co-chairmen who have built the company into one of France's leading hotel chains.</p>

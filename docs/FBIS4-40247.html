			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- The Supreme Council of Ukraine evening  plenary sitting on 14 June discussed the draft Law of Ukraine  "On Changes and Additions to the Law of Ukraine `On Forming  Local Authorities and Self-Government Bodies'." Two drafts of  amendments had been put forward, one by the commission for  issues of legal policy, judicial, and legal reform, chaired by  Volodymyr Stretovych of the "Agrarians of Ukraine" grouping; and  the other by the commission for issues of nation building,  council activities, and self-government, chaired by Oleksandr  Steshenko of the Communist grouping. Differences on positions  of principle in them made sure the debate was heated. Virtually  all amendments, proposed by the commission for issues of nation  building, council activities, and self-government, were passed  by a majority vote.    Most disagreement emerged in discussing the following  articles:     -  Article 4, stipulating that chairmen of councils at all  levels, including towns' rayon councils and their executive  committees, be accountable and responsible to the relevant  councils. In matters of exercising the state executive  authority powers delegated to them, they are subordinate to the  Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the chairman of the  executive committee at a council of a higher level. The  commission for legal policy, judicial, and legal reform was  insistent a provision on subordination to the Ukrainian  president also be added to this article.    -  Article 3, under which  both the relevant council's deputies and individuals who are not  deputies can be members of an executive committee. This  amendment is effectively in breach of Article 85 of Ukraine's  Constitution, where it is ruled that a deputy cannot be a member  of an executive council. The view of some of the deputies is  that the appropriate amendment can also be put forward in the  course of examining the draft Law "On Ukraine's Cabinet of  Ministers" and amendments to the Law "On the President of  Ukraine", which it is planned will be considered this week.  Appeals by deputies from the groupings of Rukh, "Reforms,"  "Statehood," Interregional Deputies Group, and others to  Oleksandr Tkachenko, Supreme Council of Ukraine first deputy  chairman, who was chairing the sitting, did not encounter  support.    -  Article 8, saying that after the election of deputies  and chairmen of all levels and the formation of executive  committees at councils, the Law of Ukraine "On a representative  of the Ukrainian president" shall become invalid and the powers  of oblast, Kiev and Sevastopol municipal, rayon, Kiev and  Sevastopol municipal rayon, and local administrations shall be  transferred to the relevant councils' chairmen and executive  committees.     The commission for legal policy, judicial, and legal reform  proposed that added to this article be a provision that, in the  event that elections fail to be held, or were considered not to  take place, or there are any breaches of the legislation, local  administrations carry on exercising their powers temporarily  until the holding of new elections. The amendment was not  passed, which gave its authors, notably Rukh's Oleksandr  Lavrynovych, reasons to state that Ukraine was thus deprived of  its state representative in Crimea as, indeed, it was possible  that elections there would fail to take place.    In token of protest against these decisions being passed,  some deputies of national democratic orientation left the  session's chamber and did not vote on the changes to the law as  a whole. Serhiy Sobolyev of the "Reforms" grouping has  officially requested the Ukrainian president not to sign this  law as it was passed knowingly in breach of Ukraine's current  Constitution.</p>

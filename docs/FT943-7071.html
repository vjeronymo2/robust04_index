			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: WH Smith Those seeking reasons for not buying shares in WH Smith have rarely had to look far. Of late they have been spoilt for choice. They could worry about monopoly inquiries into newspaper distribution or compact discs, the losses at Our Price, the group's ability to compete in a low inflation world, the future of the Net Book Agreement, the rising tax charge, the falling pension credit, or the continuing nightmare that is Do It All. For the really fastidious there was even a two tier share structure. Now the doubters are having to work harder. The two classes of share have gone, Our Price is back in profit, the group has shown it can live without inflation and it rightly sees the likely collapse of the NBA as an opportunity to gain market share. Even losses from Do It All are coming down and will be largely swept under the carpet this year. The pessimists can still fret about the growth prospects for the WH Smith chain. But there remains room to tickle up margins, as the investment in technology continues, and it is now taking advantage of weakened competitors to open more space. The Virgin and Waterstone's formats still have a long way to go, with the full benefits of integration into the group yet to come, and there are clearly the makings of a useful business in the US even if the  -reassuringly cautious - expansion in book retailing comes to little. Add the fast-growing office supplies business to the mix and Smiths has a good story to tell. Given fewer distractions, the sceptics might just start to believe it.</p>

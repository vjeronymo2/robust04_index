			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Few former Swan Hunter workers find jobs, say unions Fewer than 20 per cent of Swan Hunter employees made redundant since the company went into receivership six months ago have so far found jobs, says a survey by trade unions campaigning to retain shipbuilding on the Tyne. The survey findings were released yesterday as the remaining Swan Hunter workforce learnt the names of the 510 workers to go in the latest round of redundancies, announced earlier this month. Those named left the Tyneside company immediately, reducing the payroll to 1,040. All union members made redundant by the receivers before yesterday were contacted by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions to discover whether they had found work. Of 750 contacted, 207 had replied in time for the survey. Of these, 40 had found jobs, a handful of them on short-term contracts. The rest were still unemployed. The bulk of those contacted were made redundant between four and six months ago. The survey highlights the disparity of job opportunities for different employee categories. Fewer than one in 10 ancillary workers, pipeworkers, painters and wood machinists had found work, and 88 per cent of fitters and 85 per cent of electricians and steelworkers were still jobless. Among white-collar employees more than three in 10 had found work. The most successful were managers, of whom 50 per cent were in new jobs. The survey did not include former Swan Hunter directors. One of them, Mr George Thompson, shipbuilding director, has moved to the Barrow-in-Furness company VSEL as project director for the Ministry of Defence helicopter carrier contract whose loss triggered Swans' receivership. Mr Fred Oman, formerly Swans' frigates project director, is now a consultant to VSEL on surface ships. Some technical staff have moved to Clyde-based Kvaerner Govan to work on the helicopter carrier contract, won by a VSEL-Kvaerner consortium. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, who this month met European competition commissioner Mr Karel van Miert to press Swans' case for an intervention funding subsidy, has told the unions Mr Van Miert wants 'additional consultation'.</p>

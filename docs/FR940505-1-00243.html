			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Optional state-wide program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is concerned that the FIP areas may be too small to create sufficient market incentive for equipment manufacturers to develop and offer for sale equipment meeting the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and that therefore, little equipment would be provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the requirements of this program. EPA is further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that even if there are such engines, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of more traditional equipment in areas adjacent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP areas will create incentives for people to attempt to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid the fleet average requirements. Finally, EPA is concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that FIP residents may choose to comply with the first years of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fleet average requirements by purchasing extra nationally-regulated engines right before the start of the program. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a strategy does not impact air quality, provided full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance occurs, it could be extremely destabilizing for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment dealers and could put the viability of dealers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses at risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address these concerns, EPA is requesting comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various revisions to the enhanced in-use compliance program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines. First, as described in the standards discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (section C.(3)), the Agency is requesting comment on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard for all three FIP areas. This revision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would eliminate any problems that a Sacramento-only standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would create for manufacturers. Unfortunately, it would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address most of the other concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another option is to apply the enhanced nonroad emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards statewide (including the 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust NMHC standard and the low evaporative requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section C.(3)). Under this approach, only equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified to the enhanced nonroad engine standards would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available in California beginning in 1999. The statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement expands the market available for engine and equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and should provide them sufficient incentive to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer all types of nonroad equipment. Further, in a statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, the size of the state and the location of the FIP areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should counteract any incentive to cheat by using higher emitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment available in neighboring areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unfortunately, statewide application will not eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of significant pre-FIP purchasing and corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack of purchasing in the early years of the program and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destabilizing effect on the economy both could have. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore asking for comment on a requirement that engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers sell a similar fraction of their engines in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state in the FIP years as they did on average for the three years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding the FIP. Fractional requirements would be converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into numerical requirements to facilitate averaging and trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among engine types and manufacturers. No banking would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed, since banking would create the destabilizing problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program was designed to avoid. Trading and averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted would be modeled on the current averaging, and trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for heavy-duty on-highway engines (55 FR 30584, July 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990). EPA is proposing to apply this requirement to engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, rather than equipment manufacturers, because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment manufacturers cannot control the emissions level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their equipment without the cooperation of the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also considering a more flexible sales requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that natural economic fluctuations do not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. Such a program would require that in the first year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the program manufacturers sell at least eighty percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of engines they sold in the previous year. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following several years the sales requirement could be reduced to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seventy, sixty and fifty percent of the sales in the 1998 model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. Finally, once the transition to FIP engines was complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and market fluctuations were unlikely, the sales requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be dropped entirely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Either form of the option would diminish somewhat the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of the requirements for registration, fleet average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, stickers and other enforcement programs directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towards the equipment user. Presumably, if manufacturers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selling the new equipment at historical rates, it is getting used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is replacing the old equipment at historical rates. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would consider, therefore, if it adopted a strict sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, dropping the fleet average program and sticker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement. The Agency almost certainly would need to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a nonroad registration program as a check on the efficacy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales requirement. If the requirements proved to be ineffective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in maintaining historical turnover, then EPA would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement a fleet average requirement in order to ensure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment targets were met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA acknowledges that sales requirements can force  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to offer discounts and otherwise subsidize their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines, they are in a better position to accommodate the impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the program than fleets or dealers. Manufacturers sell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the nation and can recover costs by spreading small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost increases across a larger market than can fleets or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealers. On the other hand, lack of business in one area for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few years could put many dealers, which operate in much smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, out of business. It is important to note that so long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the turnover rates stay at historical levels through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the FIP, both programs would be transparent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulated parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intergovernmental relations, Oxides of nitrogen, Ozone, Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

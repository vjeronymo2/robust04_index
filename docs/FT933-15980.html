			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 9m purchase for Rubicon SHARES IN Rubicon Group, the maker of storage and handling systems for retailers, put on 1p to 145p on the resumption of trading yesterday as the company announced it had reached agreement for the acquisition of High Speed Production (Holdings) for Pounds 9m. The total consideration for the purchase will be satisfied by the issue of 3.28m shares, loan notes of Pounds 3.5m and Pounds 1.4m cash. To satisfy the cash element and provide cash backing for the loan notes, Rubicon proposes to raise Pounds 7m net of expenses via a rights issue of 6.36m shares at 120p on a 7-for-11 basis. An extraordinary meeting has been called for July 26 to gain shareholder approval for the proposals. HSP, which manufactures precision metal components and assemblies, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.7m on turnover of Pounds 20.1m in 1992. It will form a second operating division of Rubicon. The announcement came as the company reported a 48 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 820,000 to Pounds 1.22m, for the year to May 31. The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 15m to Pounds 18.1m, boosted by the acquisition of BFN in September last year. A second interim dividend of 2.5p is declared making 4p (nil) for the year. The dividend is more than twice covered by earnings of 8.4p (30.4p) per share, adjusted for a capital reconstruction during the year.</p>

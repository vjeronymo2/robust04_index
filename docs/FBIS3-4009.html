On March 7, the Hewlett-Packard Company simultaneously  launched six state-of-the-art computers in the United States and  Shanghai. On March 17, the China Hewlett-Packard Co. Ltd signed  contracts with three well-performing South-east Asian  international computer companies, authorizing them to be special  retailers in China.    On March 10, the Digital Equipment Company, the largest  computer network producer in the world, signed a long-term  cooperative memorandum with the Shanghai-based Pudong Software  Park.    On March 18, International Business Machines (IBM) announced  it was going to donate 5.5 million U.S. dollars worth of  computer equipment to the Shanghai University of Science and  Technology and to help it set up a teaching center of computer  auxiliary software engineering.    Late last year, Shanghai declared computers to be one of its  pillar industries.    Overseas computer producers quickly reacted to this  declaration. Nearly one-third of the world's 100 largest  computer producers have discussed cooperation with Shanghai.    Domestic enterprises are also competing for the market.    Changjiang Computer Group, of Shanghai, is planning to  popularize its computers in such fields as securities, finance,  posts and telecommunications and commerce. Major Chinese  computer companies like Legend and Giant are also accelerating  their pace to step into Shanghai.    Recently, the Shanghai Computer Square, sponsored by the  China Corporation of Science and Technology Books and joined by  Shanghai Computer Bookstore and Giant and Legend companies,  opened here.    It sells books, provides information and develops software  and hardware and is open to the whole country.</p>

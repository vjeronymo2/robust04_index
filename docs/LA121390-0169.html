			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: PACIFIC PALISADES;  </P> <P> CHANGES FOR 2 SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Palisades High will become a four-year school next year and Paul Revere Junior  High will add sixth grade under a reconfiguration plan approved by the Los  Angeles Unified School District Board.  </P> <P> The reconfiguration is a way for the schools in the Palisades area to take on  23% more students, as required by the district, without the grade schools  having to go on a staggered year-round schedule.  </P> <P> It is possible in the area because there is empty space available at the junior  and senior high schools. Moving the sixth grade to Revere makes space for the  growing population of elementary school students in kindergarten through fifth  grade. The ninth grade then is bumped up to the high school.  </P> <P> Parents in the area supported the reconfiguration, rather than having each  elementary school struggle with the need to increase capacity. Also, current  educational research favors a sixth-to-eighth grade middle school as best for  serving the needs of this age group.  </P> <P> The elementary schools involved in the reconfiguration are Canyon, Kenter  Canyon, Marquez and Pacific Palisades.  </P></p>

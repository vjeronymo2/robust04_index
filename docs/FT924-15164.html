			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Non-core side blamed for GM Firth loss GM Firth, Wakefield-based steel stockholder, reported a sharp jump in pre-tax losses to Pounds 4.86m in the year to March 31, against Pounds 727,000, which included losses of Pounds 164,000 from discontinued activities. Mr Michael Wilkinson, chairman, said while the group suffered badly from the severe economic downturn the main contributors to the disappointing result were non-core activities. Sales of continuing activities fell 23 per cent to Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 56.1m) for an operating loss of Pounds 2.89m (profit of Pounds 1.63m). Interest charges fell to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 2.19m). A Pounds 707,000 loss in the steel division (profit of Pounds 1.47m) in depressed market conditions included considerable provisions against stock values. Losses per share rose to 12.27p (2.5p). The final dividend is again being passed as was the interim. Last year an interim of 1p was the only payment.</p>

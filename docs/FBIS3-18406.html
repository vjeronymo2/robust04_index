			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "The Attack by the `Falcons'"] </F>   [Text] It was the first time in its history that NATO had  fired shots at someone: Not at the Soviet Union but at a  country that did not even exist during the Cold War, namely  Serbia. Why now, and why out of the blue?    In fact, NATO registered a thousand violations of the flight  ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina since it was imposed by the United  Nations in November 1992. Even after it was tightened about one  year ago, that is after the adoption of UN resolution 816, which  threatened the use of force, the infringements of the air space  continued to take place regularly. The alliance has registered  approximately 500 violations so far, but it did not attack the  intruders. Why did it do so now?    If rulers like Bismarck and Talleyrand were still shaping  foreign policy today instead of men like Kinkel, Christopher, or  Hurd, one might picture an extremely subtle game behind the  scenes. The story begins on 17 February, 100 hours before the  expiration of the ultimatum against the Serbs in Sarajevo. All  of a sudden, Russia appears on the scene like a deus ex machina,  dragging the Serbs by the collar. There is no longer any need  for the ultimatum and bombs because the Serbs promised to  withdraw their heavy artillery according to schedule.    This was good for Sarajevo but not so good for NATO and the  United States, because the alliance had labored in vain and  Washington had to watch how the old and seemingly toothless  rival was suddenly pulling all the strings. For four decades,  the West had tried successfully (with Tito's help) to keep  Soviet influence out of the Adriatic. Now Moscow was the  mastermind, the "lead in the tumbler," as Bismarck used to  describe the role of the German Reich. NATO was neutralized,  and the Russians -- half protectors and half conquerors of the  Serbs -- showed that they alone directed the play.    Cynics might now believe that the downing of the Serbian  Jastrebs ("hawks") which attacked Bosnian ground targets earlier  represents an elegant Western countermove. Thus, the operation  of the U.S. F- 16 Falcons might be viewed as a signal that NATO  is still in charge. It was as difficult for the Russians to  protest against this move as it was for the NATO allies to  reject the coup of the Kremlin two weeks ago. After all, Moscow  voted in favor of the flight ban, supported by a threat of  violence, together with all other members of the Security  Council on 31 March 1933.    Yet this is mere fantasy -- at least this is what NATO  claims. The downing was merely a matter of routine. The F-16  pilots did not even have to consult anybody because the rules  adopted by the United Nations stipulate clearly that shots can  be fired after two warnings. Why were the shots fired now?  Because the NATO planes were always "in the wrong place at the  wrong time" in the past. Or: Because it was usually helicopters  that were involved, which landed immediately.    One party that does not believe in the theory about the  routine operation are the Serbs. They immediately sent their  own signals -- in the form of heavy shelling of the Muslim  enclave of Tuzla. The conclusion is that the world rejoiced too  soon. After the withdrawal of the Serbian guns from Sarajevo,  some problems seemed to dissolve. The Serbs hinted for the  first time that they might become sensible, and the Muslims and  Croatians started to talk with each other again. Yet the most  recent cease-fire between the two groups has again collapsed,  and the use of the Serbian jets shows that the tactical  withdrawal has by no means changed the overall strategy of the  Serbs.    For this reason, NATO "reported back" -- drastically but  regularly. The rapid approval from Bonn and Paris underlines  that there is no dissent within the alliance. Still: A  seemingly insuperable threshold was crossed with this attack.  Thus, a new chapter has begun in the two-year-old Bosnian drama.    Only one thing is certain: Although the Serbs showed their  readiness for escalation with the decision to attack Tuzla, they  will not be able to keep it up. The U.S. aircraft carrier  Saratoga is already moving toward the Adriatic to make this  clear. Yet he who takes the first step must know what the  second should be. Violence on a regular basis -- once here, once  there? This would be no military problem for the alliance but a  political one. One reason is that Russia is a member of the  Security Council, and that the Serbs will be clever enough to  avoid such a clear provocation.    With the F-16 operation, the West has drawn level with  Moscow  in the political power game. This creates on opportunity to  test a joint strategy. As the protectors of the Serbs as it  were, the Russian possess a degree of influence that the West  does not have. If Washington and Moscow curbed their rekindled  rivalry in favor of cooperation in the Balkans, they might  succeed in bringing the Serbs to their senses (on the basis of  the threat of violence). Bonn would have to play a similarly  disciplined role vis-a-vis the Croatians who firmly believe that  the Germans will block all sanctions against them. Is this  unrealistic? Maybe, it is. However, even the best F-16 planes  cannot create a modus vivendi by firing shots.</p>

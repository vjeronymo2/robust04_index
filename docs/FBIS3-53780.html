The proposal was conveyed by the foreign secretary,  Shaharyar M. Khan, to the Indian high commissioner, Mr. S.K.  Lambha, in Islamabad today. Pakistan has also asked the Indian  Government to take visible steps in the Indian-held Kashmir so  that a propitious climate is created for the peaceful resolution  of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.

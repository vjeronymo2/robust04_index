			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Store's slow start hits Bentalls A slow start to the newly acquired store at the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex, accounted for just under half of the Pounds 1.05m pre-tax losses reported by Bentalls, the department store operator, for the half year to August 1. The deficit compared with a Pounds 207,000 profit last time. Mr Edward Bentall, chairman, said that with consumers still reluctant to spend, directors had been reviewing operations to identify how further cost savings could be made. The head office was to be relocated, while the situation at Lakeside was being assessed. He said trading in August had shown a considerable improvement over last year, while further sales gains were expected when the Bentall Centre opened in November. Agreement had been reached to sell the Bentalls charge card business to GE Capital. The move would reduce borrowings by more than Pounds 6m. Turnover edged ahead by Pounds 1m to Pounds 31.5m. Losses per share were 1.63p (0.32p earnings), but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.6p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir,  president of the republic, this morning addressed at the  Friendship Hall the consultative meeting held by the Federal  Rule Office for leaders of the executive organ, the Armed  Forces, and the police forces for the purpose of studying the  options submitted by the higher committee for the redivision of  states.    The president of the republic affirmed in his address the  importance of the redivision at this very time since it involves  the curtailment of the administrative shadow [as heard], the  provision of more federalism, and the handing over of power to  the masses. He denied that the financial cost of the project or  the distribution of the human cadre was an obstacle preventing  the implementation of the redivision recommendations, pointing  out in this respect the success of the experiment on the  redivision of states. [passage omitted]    Dr. Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, minister in the Federal Rule  Office  and rapporteur of the committee, presented a comprehensive  explanation at the beginning of the meeting, supported by maps  detailing the options arrived at by the committee. He explained  that the number of states in Sudan will rise to 25, by dividing  each state into three states, with the exception of the northern  state which it was decided will be divided into two states only;  whereas the committee recommended the division of the central  state into four states. It also decided to keep Khartoum state  as it is -- one state.</p>

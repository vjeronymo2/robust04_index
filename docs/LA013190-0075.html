			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> NOTHING COMICAL IN 'WOMEN AND WALLACE'  </P> <P> "American Playhouse" is off to a wobbly start this season. Tonight's show,  "Women and Wallace" (at 9 on Channels 28 and 15), is even more grinding and  self-conscious than last week's stodgy opener, the East Coast elitist drama,  "Sensibility and Sense."  </P> <P> What's happening to "American Playhouse"? These first two productions of the  ninth season have been dreary. At least last Wednesday's play, co-starring Jean  Simmons and Elaine Stritch as besieged old leftists, had its moments. Tonight's  play opens with a mother's suicide and follows her young son's subsequent  efforts to deal with girls in his anguished adolescence.  </P> <P> The play supposedly is a dark comedy but on television, under Don Scardino's  arty direction, it's merely bleak. Perhaps the major problem is that the  playwright, 20-year-old Jonathan Marc Sherman, wrote this semi-autobiographical  play when he was 18. Adolescence will out.  </P> <P> Credit the producers with giving youth an opportunity. (The play was a winner  at the 1988 Young Playwrights Festival at Playwrights Horizons in New York;  coincidentally, it's also currently on stage at the Beverly Hills Playhouse.)  What a break for a juvenile work.  </P> <P> The only way a play like this could work is to go for a black humor. But  there's nothing comical here. The handsome youth is played with a teen-ager's  basic insecurities by Josh Hamilton, who did the play in New York. His  dialogue, both directly to the camera and to other characters (most prominently  the luminous Joanna Going), is full of posturing, self-protective devices.  </P> <P> At one point he describes his dead mother (whom we saw slitting her throat) as  "Sylvia Plath without the talent." That's a smart line but not from a grieving  son.  </P> <P> At least the youth's grandmother (nicely portrayed by Joan Copeland) has it  right: "A dead mother doesn't give you carte blanche to screw up," she tells  him. A tip of the cap to playwright Sherman for some belated wisdom and  maturity. There's hope for Sherman. But what about "American Playhouse"?RAY  LOYND  </P></p>

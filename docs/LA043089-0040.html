			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BLACK EXPERIENCE IN HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Re Patrick Goldstein's series on blacks in the movie industry:  </P> <P> Blacks for years complained about how a racist Hollywood wouldn't make films  for us, so we went out and made our own films. Then we turned back around to  negotiate with the same racist Hollywood to show these films to the black  community. That was a bad move on our part.  </P> <P> Developing an independent industry, lock, stock and barrel, is our challenge,  and we may not necessarily choose to be affiliated with certain factions of  Hollywood in the process.  </P> <P> You have to remember, Hollywood built this system on the backs of black, brown,  yellow and red people. We are aware that whites would not like to see this  privilege disappear in Hollywood.  </P> <P> NIJEL BINNS  </P> <P> African film maker  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

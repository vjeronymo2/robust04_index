Objects with larger focal  lengths require larger-size and thus less interference-immune  holographic apparatus, the purpose of spatial filtration being  to overcome the resulting difficulty. In the first exposure a  matted screen the incident converging beam of coherent light has  a quasi-spherical waveform with a radius of curvature equal to  the distance d[.sup]1[/] from the monitored lens  L[.sup]1[/] with a focal length f[.sub]1[/] &gt;  d[.sup]1[/]) and the hologram of diffusely scattered field  monitoring this lens is recorded by a quasi-plane reference  wave. Then, prior to the second exposure, the matted screen is  shifted in its plane through a distance z along say the x-axis  axis and the monitored lens is shifted in its principal (x[.sup]2[/],y  [.sup]2[/]) plane in the same direction through a  distance equal to zf[.sup]1[/]/d[.sub]1[/]. Reconstruction  of the thus recorded double-exposure hologram with a copy of the  reference wave gives rise to a diffraction field whose complex  amplitude is describable in the Fresnel approximation. The  amplitude distribution of this field will be modified by  placement of a filtering second lens with a focal length  f[.sup]2[/] in the plane of the hologram. Its new  distribution indicates that the subjective speckle fields  appearing as a result of two exposures will coincide in the  plane in which the image of the matted screen is formed. Such  double-exposure holograms were recorded experimentally with 630  nm light from a He-Ne laser on Micrat BRL photographic plates,  the focal length of the first lens being varied over the 180-500  mm range and that of the second lens over the 15-30 mm range.

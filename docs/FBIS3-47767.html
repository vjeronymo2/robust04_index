Now the  United States is sending Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to  visit China, Indonesia, and Thailand with a specific mission of  prying open their markets for the major U.S. service sectors so  that they can earn money freely in this region. The treasury  secretary's maneuvers are being closely observed and many wonder  if Bentsen is the second Commondore Perry.    As Thailand is one of the three targets of his mission,  Bentsen is determined to unlock the services market,  particularly the capital and financial market which involves the  operation of commercial banks, stock brokerage firms, and  insurance companies. Besides civil aviation, he will discuss  with Thai officials ways to solve the double taxation problem  left unsettled on the negotiating table for two decades and ask  Thailand to pass a law dealing with money laundering.    We believe that what the United States wants most is the  opening of the Thai financial market, probably the part  involving banking services and stock trading. Statistics shows  that the total value of the stock trade value last year was over  2.053 trillion baht, an average of 8.597 billion baht per day.  Trading by foreign investors amounted to 581.869 billion baht  or 14.10 percent. Since late last year, more U.S. capital has  been flowing into the stock market. Therefore, the United States  must try to play a role as large as possible in the Thai  financial sector.    We want the officials concerned to think thoroughly and  avoid  yielding to all Bentsen's demands because that could lead to the  collapse of Thai commercial banks and brokerage firms, not  because the U.S. banks and brokerage firms have more expertise  in this field. If we open our market for the United States, we  will have to do the same with all other countries. Hence, we  will have to face strong competition with banks from other major  financial powers like Japan, the European countries, Australia,  and Canada.    Liberalization of our financial market is a good thing. But  if it means the death of Thai businesses, we must avoid it  altogether or try to do it gradually. We want to remind  everyone concerned that the United States has clearly announced  that its financial market will remained closed until next  September, even after the new GATT rule takes effect. In other  words, the United States has said frankly that it will not open  its financial market. Thailand can at least cite this as an  excuse for doing the same thing.    Thai commercial banks and stock brokerage firms should be  aware of the fact that we can no longer block U.S. banks and  brokerage firms. So, we must prepare ourselves for competition  through the merger of banking and brokerage services in advance.</p>

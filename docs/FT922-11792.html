			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Most of shadow cabinet back Smith: Labour MPs have until Tuesday to decide on nominations for leadership MOST MPs elected to the shadow cabinet support Mr John Smith in the Labour party's leadership contest, his campaign manager Mr Robin Cook said yesterday. The Smith campaign rejected the suggestion that the show of support by 14 of the 18 elected shadow cabinet members so far in advance of the voting on July 18 reinforced the impression that the contest was a 'stitch-up'. It was pointed out that MPs had to decide whose nominations to support by next Tuesday. The only elected shadow cabinet members not supporting Mr Smith are Mr Michael Meacher, Ms Jo Richardson, Mr John Prescott, and Mr Bryan Gould, who is standing against Mr Smith. Mr Meacher is supporting Mr Gould's candidacy, and Mr Prescott is standing in the contest for the deputy leadership. Beyond the 18 elected members, the shadow cabinet includes the party leader and deputy leader and two senior spokesmen who are appointed by the leader. Meanwhile, Ms Ann Clwyd, one of the shadow cabinet members supporting Mr Smith, opened her campaign for the deputy leadership. She asked trade union leaders not to vote in the leadership election unless they had balloted their members. It was, she said, 'frightening and insulting' to union members that the support of some of the big unions should appear to be taken for granted before they had been consulted. Mr Smith has made it clear that he believes that trade unions should undertake the widest possible consultations before casting their votes. Ms Clwyd went further, saying: 'Even the idea of trade union leaders taking soundings without balloting their members is open to abuse. Unless the unions genuinely reflect the views of their members on the leadership - and that means a ballot - then they should not vote in this election.' The executive of the AEU engineering union has said that it will not hold a ballot, citing time problems and cost. Ms Clwyd's pro-proportional representation, pro-European platform also includes a strong pitch for the party to broaden its appeal to women. She said many women were put off by the 'macho images' the party was presenting. 'Women should no longer be seen as bit-part players in the political scene.' She said it was essential that the deputy leader should be a woman. However, she refused to call on her supporters to vote for Mrs Margaret Beckett if - as is quite possible - she herself did not get the necessary 55 signatures of Labour MPs to stand in the contest.</p>

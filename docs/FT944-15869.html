			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Kohl claims narrow poll victory: German ruling parties likely to hold power with 4-seat majority Chancellor Helmut Kohl claimed a narrow victory in the German election last night, but looked set to rule with a wafer-thin majority in the German Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. Late computer projections based on partial results indicated an overall majority of four seats for the present conservative-liberal coalition over the combined forces of the left. The outcome could leave Mr Kohl with an uncomfortable and potentially unstable coalition. However, he seemed determined last night to stay with his partner, the minority Free Democratic party (FDP) headed by foreign minister Mr Klaus Kinkel, in spite of its poor showing at the polls, rather than form a grand coalition with the Social Democratic party (SPD). The key to the narrow result was the success of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed East German communist party, which looked set to win four direct seats in east Berlin, and therefore a likely 29 seats in the Bundestag under the complicated electoral rules. According to the projections, Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, will remain the largest group in the Bundestag, with 284 seats. The FDP will have 46 seats, giving a combined 330 for the coalition. The SPD, the main opposition party, was set to win 249 seats, while the Greens looked likely to win 48. With the 29 PDS seats, that would give 326 for the opposition as a whole. 'It may be difficult, but so is life,' Mr Kohl said as the outcome became increasingly clear. 'It is still a perfectly good working majority. Why should I not be satisfied? I can still carry on governing.' The projected victory for Mr Kohl, 64, would give him his fourth successive term as chancellor. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, claimed the result was a vindication for his campaign, in spite of his failure to defeat the government. He warned that the coalition might well not last its full four-year term. He appeared to concede defeat, saying the coalition had a majority of 'one, two or three'. 'It has been very narrowly endorsed, and therefore it is a coalition of losers. 'Even if we are not going to be governing now, one thing is certain,' he added, 'we will certainly be doing so in 1998, or even sooner. It cannot be excluded that this coalition will face real difficulties in the course of the coming legislative period.' The same prediction was made by Mr Ludger Vollmer, joint leader of the environmentalist Greens. 'I am not at all sure that Kohl and Kinkel will be able to survive a full four years,' he said. The temptation for Mr Kohl might be to switch to a grand coalition with the SPD, in order to have a reliable working majority, and in recognition that such an outcome is already inevitable in practice: the SPD enjoys a majority in the Bundesrat, the second house of the parliament representing the 16 federal states. The other alternative, a so-called 'traffic light coalition' of the SPD, Greens and FDP, was flatly rejected last night by FDP leaders, including Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the immediate past leader. He said the party would rather go into opposition than participate in such an alliance. The biggest loser in the election was the FDP, which was set to lose about 30 seats. In spite of the setback, however, a delighted Mr Kinkel was celebrating last night, because with its vote forecast at about 7 per cent of the total, the party would keep its place in the parliament. The far-right Republicans failed to make any impression on the election, with a final vote forecast at less than 2 per cent. In the three state elections which took place simultaneously with the general election, the SPD narrowly retained its absolute majority in the Saarland, in west Germany, but failed to dent the lead of the CDU in the two east German states involved, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Thuringia.  --------------------------------          HOW THEY VOTED        (Late projections)  --------------------------------                 No of     % of                 seats     vote  -------------------------------- CDU-CSU          284      41.7 FDP               46       6.8 SPD              249      36.6 PDS               29       4.2 Greens            48       7.1 Others             0       3.5  -------------------------------- Election special, Pages 2 and 3; Lex, Page 30; Markets, Page 35; Bonds, Page 36</p>

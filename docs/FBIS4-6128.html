			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Industrial News Department reporter Hideki </F> Hirano; first in the series "Field Report on Market Opening";  this installment entitled "Auto Dealers: Dealers Welcoming U.S.  Cars But `Keiretsu' Still Form Barriers"]    [Text] In the "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign  Trade Barriers," the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has blamed  Japan for setting trade barriers against 43 items. Is Japan's  market really closed, or are the trade frictions caused by the  lack of U.S. efforts? We have assessed how the Japanese market  is open in sectors criticized by the United States --  automobiles, plate glass, semiconductors, and medical and  telecommunications equipment.  <H5>  Imported Cars Become Popular </H5>   Speaking to a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of  Commerce in Japan, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale said  as follows on 30 March: "There is virtually no progress....  Above all, I was disappointed with Japan's achievement in auto  imports." The United States did not accept Japanese automakers'  "voluntary action plan for purchasing U.S.-made products."    In the trade barriers report, the U.S. Government focused on  Japanese "auto dealers." The United States is scheduled to  review its trade barrier list in September, and Japan's auto  dealers may be listed as one of the unfair industrial sectors.  However, our field research showed that actual market trends  are somewhat different from the harsh tone of intergovernment  negotiations.    President Toshiro Nakada of the Honda Crio Tokyo Company  said: "We have excellent responses from our customers. Of  course, the Cherokee brings us a handsome profit." Honda Crio  dealers began to sell Chrysler four-wheel-drive models in 1990.  At that time, they really became sick of frequent customer  claims of mechanical troubles and an inadequate supply of spare  parts. However, changes took place in last 12 months.    The Autorama Seijo Company (president: Tomotoshi Ono, with  its office in Setagaya, Tokyo) is also doing well in its sales  of Ford models. This Ford dealership had been a burden on the  company until six months ago, but the Taurus suddenly became  popular among customers in the thirties and forties age group.  At present, imported cars make up 60 percent of total sales,  and they are improving the company's business performance.    While Japanese automakers are suffering from a prolonged  sales slump, U.S. automakers have succeeded in improving the  quality of their products. Japanese auto dealers are well aware  of such market trends, and they want to "deal in profitable  cars, no matter where they are from." In this connection, the  Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales Company has recently decided to sell  Ford cars because the company has too many employees and  dealerships to sell only domestic cars.    Statistics released by the Fair Trade Commission state that  2,010 domestic auto dealers (55.6 percent of the auto dealers in  Japan) deal in foreign-made automobile. However, most of them  are doing so because of business ties-up concluded between their  parent companies and foreign automakers. Japan is the only  nation where foreign automakers have to sell their own cars  through local automakers. In this sense, Japanese automakers  and dealers still form a great "keiretsu" barrier against  foreign automakers.    A senior official of a European automaker in Japan said: "It  is true that the Japanese market is exclusionary. But the Big  Three have to try harder." European automakers have been  building their sales network in Japan since the 1980's. In most  cases, however, their achievements have been business carried  out by dealer networks of Japanese automakers. Direct franchise  contracts between European automakers and Japanese dealers do  not exceed 40 cases.  <H5>  Strong Financial Dependence on Automakers </H5>   Japanese auto dealers have been taking a passive attitude  toward dealing with foreign-made automobiles. This was partly  because the competitive appeal of Japanese-made cars was still  strong, but the primary reason was strong ties between Japanese  automakers and subsidiary dealers.    When an auto dealer thinks about dealing in imported cars,  it  has to take into account the reaction of its parent company.  Honda dealers began to deal in Chrysler models because the  Honda Motor Company had started to take part in the supply of  spare parts. Because the Toyota Motor Company has sales ties-up  with Volkswagen and General Motors (GM), Toyota dealers cannot  take a positive attitude toward dealing in Ford cars.    The Japanese auto market is unique in that a few dealers  cover large areas. In the U.S. and European markets,  "responsible coverage areas" are assigned to each shop, but  Toyota and Nissan usually have only one dealer in each  prefecture, and each prefectural dealer runs many branch shops.  Dealers have to open many branch shops because automakers  assign targets for regional market share. The financial needs  for business expansion tend to create dealers' excessive  dependence on automakers.    The Japanese auto parts market is closed to foreign  companies, and this is also caused by the fact that the Japanese  auto market is controlled by a small number of dealers. Japan's  "parts makers companies" are usually established by automakers  and local dealers, and this makes automaker-dealer ties even  stronger.  <H5>  U.S. Wants Direct Contracts With Dealers </H5>   As seen in the trade barriers report, the United States is  seeking direct franchise contracts with dealers without the  intervention of Japanese automakers. The U.S. report defines a  "fair market" as being where dealers can make their own  decisions.    Under the present circumstances, the United States would not  be convinced by Japan's claim that "U.S. automakers have free  access to the Japanese market." From the standpoint of the  United States, the "fairness" of Japan's manufacturer-led market  would look suspicious.    A major Toyota dealer in the metropolitan area said: "We  want a free hand from the parent company. We wish the  manufacturer would make no complaint about our imported car  business." Japanese automakers had better just introduce local  dealers to U.S. automakers and let them freely discuss their own  business affairs. This may appear to be a conservative method,  but the United States may trust it better than the automakers'  action plan, which was designed as a set of figures.</p>

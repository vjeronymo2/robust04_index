			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: A man with his finger on the pulse / Profile of Pierre Vinken, the Elsevier chief with global ambitions YOU MAY have run into Mr Pierre Vinken in the past without ever realising it. It would have been on London's Piccadilly Line somewhere between Heathrow Airport and Green Park station and Mr Vinken, chairman of Elsevier, the Dutch publisher, would almost certainly have been wearing a sober blue suit and be on his way to a meeting at Reed International, the international publishing and information group. 'It was beautiful when Reed was right beside Green Park station,' says Mr Vinken, a former neurosurgeon turned publisher who still often travels from the airport into London by tube. If it is very cold, or he has a lot of paperwork to get through, Mr Vinken will, however, hail a cab. The quietly-spoken Mr Vinken is not only a millionaire; if all goes to plan, from January he will also be chairman of one of the largest publishing groups in the world - Reed Elsevier, the Pounds 5bn group being created by the merger of the two companies. An important part of his ambition to make Elsevier a truly global company has been fulfilled by the merger agreement. 'The bigger, the vaster, the organism the more you can do with it. There is an endless string of possibilities for improving businesses. With 35,000 people there are always people with ideas. If you are fishing this is an enormous net you are casting into the ocean. You always catch something,' says Mr Vinken in a rare interview. He has never appeared on television and says he never will. Despite Elsevier owning several influential Dutch newspapers Mr Vinken, who is 64, says he never voluntarily speaks to the press. He is, he insists, a private person. Mr Vinken, whose father was a coal mine security officer, graduated in medicine in 1955 and between then and 1963 did post graduate studies in psychiatry, neurology, neuroradiology and neurosurgery. And that was how he turned to publishing. 'I was working day and night and had no money. What I did to escape was spend my weekends and free evenings working for a medical publisher indexing journals - the lowest you could be. Within a few years he was editor-in-chief of 50 journals and for five years maintained a dual career as publisher and neurosurgeon. 'I would operate between 7am and 12 noon, then I would go for lunch to the publishing company where they were waiting. I would work there from 12.30 to 6pm and then I would go home and do either of my homeworks,' he says. When Mr Vinken was forced to choose by Elsevier in 1970 there was no doubt in his mind. 'I think there is something editorial born in me which somehow makes a publishing company attractive to me. I know how each of these products are made and I could stand in for any of the jobs save for book keeping,' he says. The Elsevier chairman was an early exponent of electronic data bases for medical use and was also chief editor of the 27-volume Handbook of Clinical Neurology. But he can also point to a growth of operating income that has averaged 20 per cent a year and operating income per share of 15 per cent. He is due to become the first chairman of Reed Elsevier and will then be succeeded by Mr Peter Davis, the Reed chairman who will be chief executive of the merged company. 'The chances for effectiveness and efficiency are enormous but I will not be the one to bring this into the next century. Peter will do that. But I will contribute experience and a sense of strategy and direction as far as necessary,' Mr Vinken said. Together they would be saving costs and developing strategies, including acquisition strategies, designed to boost profit per share. 'That is good for the company, good for everyone. You get the best personnel, the best products in an almost Darwenian process of natural selection and improvement,' says the former neurosurgeon who claims never to look backwards and is already looking forward to the first meeting of Reed Elsevier.</p>

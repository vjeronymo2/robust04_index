Petitioners submit that they are not subject to the filing requirements of sections 6 (schedule of rates and charges), 19(a) (maps and valuation data), and 20 (annual, periodic, and special reports) of the ICA. In the alternative, petitioners request that the Commission (a) exempt Hunt and East Mississippi from the filing and reporting requirements which otherwise would apply, or (b) recognize that Hunt and East Mississippi need not publish a schedule of rates and charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitioners state that the facilities for which an exemption is sought are owned entirely by Petitioners and will be utilized solely to transport crude oil to which Hunt holds title. No other refinery interconnects with the Petitioners' facilities and, due to the location and service performed by these facilities, requests for access to the facilities by any third party are extremely unlikely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 21, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

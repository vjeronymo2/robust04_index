Gaviria's nomination will reportedly be doomed by the  government's noncompliance with the Inter-American Human Rights  Commission [CIDH], which has asked the Colombian Government to  severely punish human rights violators.    For the lawyers who have denounced 15 human rights cases  before the OAS, the black mark the Gaviria administration has in  the organization's files will shatter the president's candidacy.    The future of Gaviria's candidacy is being threatened by the  case of Fernando Lalinde Lalinde, who was murdered in 1987; the  disappearance of 13 students between 1981 and 1982, when the  police were searching for the kidnappers of the Alvarez  children; and the cases of attorneys Alirio Pedraza, Martin  Calderon, Primitivo Silva, Isidro Caballero, Patricia Rivera,  and Olga Ester Bernal. In all these cases, the OAS asked the  Colombian Government to financially compensate the relatives and  punish severely those responsible for these actions.    President Gaviria's government has said, however, the  commission's resolutions were recommendations and, therefore,  were not mandatory. This attitude annoyed the CIDH, which in  the following days decided to file a suit against the Colombian  Government before the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Court,  which is headquartered in Costa Rica. The suit regarded the  cases of rural teachers Isidro Caballero and Maria del Carmen  Santana, who disappeared on 4 February 1989 in Cesar Department.    The lawyers who denounced these events before the OAS  believe  this constitutes a major setback to Gaviria's candidacy, because  the government's accuser, the CIDH, has weight and influence  throughout the continent.    According to the lawyers, this lawsuit against the  government  represents an unavoidable obstacle to Gaviria's candidacy,  because whenever he would have to make any decision--should he  became the new secretary general--nobody would trust a person  who did not comply with the organization's resolutions during  his administration.</p>

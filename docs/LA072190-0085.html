			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> San Diego police are trying to identify a Latino man found dead in an alley  Friday from an apparent drug overdose.  </P> <P> The man, whom police believe was a transvestite, was wearing a pink blouse and  black skirt in the north alley of the 3000 block of National Avenue, said  Homicide Lt. Paul Ybarrondo.  </P> <P> There was no obvious trauma to the body, leading police to suspect the man died  of a drug overdose and then his body was dumped in the alley, Ybarrondo said.  </P> <P> "It was probably a bunch of people shooting up. Then one dies, so you take it  out and dump it so you don't have the evidence of a narcotics transaction,"  Ybarrondo said.  </P> <P> Police said the man was about 5 feet, 8 inches tall, weighed about 150 pounds  and had dark curly hair that was frosted on the ends. Police have no other  information on the man.  </P> <P> Since June, three transvestites have been killed in San Diego. Two were killed  in shootings near the San Diego Wild Animal Park in June and a 24-year-old man  was shot to death July 3.  </P> <P> Ybarrondo said the police are not investigating Friday's death as a homicide.  </P></p>

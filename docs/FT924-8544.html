			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Beith reverses election pledge to increase taxes THE LIBERAL Democrat party yesterday reversed its general election pledge to raise income tax to finance extra education spending and a recovery package, saying that the recession was now too deep to justify an increase. Unveiling Liberal Democrat plans for economic recovery ahead of tomorrow's Autumn Statement, Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said: 'I would be reluctant to impose a general tax increase in the current, even deeper, state of recession.' But he defended the pledges made during the election, saying: 'We don't think what we said at the general election was a mistake. Indeed had it been done, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now.' Mr Beith added: 'The Treasury's obsession with keeping the public expenditure total set last year (Pounds 244.5bn) is both dogmatic and dangerous. Instead of a large boost to investment programmes, the government is promising little more than maintaining capital spending at levels already planned.' Mr Beith's comments followed Labour's decision to put on ice its 'shadow budget,' set out during the election, which included lifting the ceiling on National Insurance contributions. Liberal Democrats promised in April not to implement the new lower 20p tax band and to increase the basic rate of income tax by 1p. That would have helped finance an extra Pounds 4bn of public investment and boost education expenditure. The recovery package announced yesterday says that since the election, 'the economic outlook has deteriorated, and confidence has slumped. This suggests that a more ambitious package would be appropriate, funded purely by borrowing.' The package does not, however, specify what public sector borrowing requirement would be appropriate. The package included a 'large and immediate' increase in public investment in transport and public buildings', temporary cuts in the uniform business rate for ailing businesses, extra training programmes, and help for mortgage lenders and housing associations to start up 'mortgage-to-rent' schemes. Liberal Democrats also back an independent Bank of England to boost confidence in financial markets, giving scope for interest rate cuts and increased borrowing. Mr Beith and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday that MPs should, like other public-sector workers, get a zero or very small pay rise next year.</p>

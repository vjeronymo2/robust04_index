			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA COUNCIL REJECTS BAN ON PUSHCARTS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: STRICTER REGULATIONS AND SANCTIONS ARE NEEDED, ONE MEMBER AGREES, BUT  SAYS REMOVING THEM FROM CITY STREETS IS 'SLIGHTLY FASCIST.'  </P> <P> Calling the measure overkill, the City Council on Tuesday rejected a proposed  ordinance that would have banned pushcart vendors from city streets.  </P> <P> In a 3-2 vote, with Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed Glasgow dissenting, the  council directed the city attorney to prepare a substitute ordinance that would  place more restrictions on street vendors.  </P> <P> "What I have heard here is that pushcart vendors are a problem because they  don't have the permits they are supposed to have, which makes them illegal,  which makes them a nuisance," said Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis.  </P> <P> "We need proper sanctions and more regulations, but to ban them outright is  slightly fascist."  </P> <P> City officials had maintained that the vendors, mostly Latinos who sell ice  cream, snow cones and other food items, are a threat to the public's health and  safety.  </P> <P> "If one of your children bought an item from a vendor that was not approved  from the health department and got food poisoning, you would probably have  second feelings about this," Amburgey said. "If council members took the  opportunity to inspect these vendors, they would be alarmed at the unsanitary  conditions."  </P> <P> During one 10-day period in August, police cited 14 vendors for operating  without a business license or health permit and eight others for soliciting  without a permit, according to code enforcement officials.  </P> <P> City officials said they have received numerous complaints from residents about  vendors going door to door, causing children to run across busy streets, and,  in some cases, purposely giving incorrect amounts of change to children after  purchases.  </P> <P> According to a staff report, a recent investigation by the county Health Care  Agency found that one Costa Mesa vendor was operating an ice cream business  from an unapproved industrial warehouse in another city that was also being  used for living quarters. The county confiscated and destroyed 850 pounds of  food and 27 pushcarts found behind the warehouse and arrested seven employees.  </P> <P> Jim Houston, assistant director of the Health Care Agency's division of  environmental health, said unauthorized street vendors pose a growing problem  in many cities.  </P> <P> The county enforces state laws that impose some structural and operational  requirements on food trucks and pushcarts, requiring an overall clean, healthy  operation.  </P> <P> "The cart has to be kept clean and in good repair and the food must be labeled  and come from an approved source," Houston said. "It has become a difficult  enforcement activity because of its mobile nature and has led to more and more  cities . . . regulating or banning the activity."  </P> <P> In fact, at least three other communities -- Anaheim, Newport Beach and Brea --  already ban pushcart vendors on city streets. And a Santa Ana official said  that city, because of complaints, is reevaluating its current vendor law, which  requires a health permit and business license.  </P> <P> Although Amburgey and other city officials maintained that the ordinance is not  aimed at Latinos, many critics argued that it would have had a discriminatory  impact.  </P> <P> Rebecca Jurado, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, citing the  spate of recent controversial actions undertaken by the city to deal with  illegal immigrants, agreed that the ordinance appeared to be aimed at Latinos.  </P> <P> She noted that vendors in the city are already required to obtain a city  business license and a county health permit.  </P> <P> Under new regulations to be considered by the council, pushcart vendors would  be required to display city business licenses, health permits and photo  identifications, and would face fines for carts found to be in violation of  regulations. The city could also confiscate or impound illegal carts.  </P></p>

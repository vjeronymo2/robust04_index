			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] has once again begun to intensify the shelling of  the Kuito and Kunje in Bie Province. About 200 wounded people  could die in the coming five days because of a lack of medicines  and medical care. [passage omitted]    What is more, Jonas Savimbi's men continue to shell the town  of Tchindjenje in Huambo Province. The aim is to take  Tchindjenje District, but government troops are preventing the  rebels' advance. Apart from shelling the town, UNITA is laying  mines on paths leading to peasants' farms.</p>

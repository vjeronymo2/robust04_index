			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] And now let's turn to Italian news: the Intelligence  and Democratic Security Service [SISDE] slush fund investigation  -- Fabrizio Feo reports on the latest developments:    The five former SISDE administrators involved in the slush  funds scandal have all been sent for trial: Riccardo Malpicca,  Antonio Galati, Rosa Maria Sorrentino, Matilde Martucci, and  Michele Finnocchi, who is still wanted by the police, will be  tried in six weeks. In the meantime, the former SISDE  treasurer, Ugo Timpano, who was arrested last week, obtained  house arrest. It is said that he has made the first admissions  on the movement of funds, termed top-secret, the origin and  destination of which were not clear; 35 billion lire per year  and none of it under any form of control.    A new, sensational chapter has been opened in the scandal.  Ten billion lire from SISDE are said to have been spent in  order to support the electoral campaign of one of the governing  parties. That sum is said to have come from the money used to  buy the site of SISDE's new headquarters in Via Polli, which was  sold to the security service for 25 billion lire by the  architect, Adolfo Salabe.</p>

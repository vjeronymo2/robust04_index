			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> BRAIN BUSTERS;  </P> <P> 'CONCEPTUAL IMPULSE' ISN'T A SHOW THAT YOU'D BREEZE IN AND OUT OF  </P> <P> "Conceptual Impulse" marks the first anniversary of the Security Pacific  Gallery, the contemporary art gallery at the Security Pacific Bank headquarters  in Costa Mesa. There have been some ups and downs during the past 12 months,  but this exhibit contains some genuinely fresh and provocative work.  </P> <P> Which is not to say that the show is easy to breeze in and out of. Most of the  seven American artists in the show -- who live in Los Angeles, New York and  Tupelo, Tenn. -- want to slow you down and dance awhile on your brain.  </P> <P> Michael Ballou offers coy glimpses of human flesh wedged in between sheets of  colored wood veneer. In some of these works, the contours of the bodies look as  weirdly arbitrary as the political boundaries on a map. That's no accident --  Ballou is concerned with the notion of covert glimpses at information some  consider too provocative for public consumption.  </P> <P> Uta Barth uses optical effects to give viewers a hard time. Each of her four  paintings is a four-foot-square field of thin black-and-white stripes with a  tiny photograph in the center, of a house or apartment with brightly  illuminated windows. While your eyes experience the retinal tease of the  eye-popping stripes, your mind tries to make sense of them as an evocation of  nocturnal danger lurking outside the comfort of the home.  </P> <P> Mel Chin concerns himself with elements of the scientific method; he seems  fascinated with the processes of proof and cause and effect. In "Revival Field  Documentation," he presents a description and diagram of an experiment intended  to remove metal contamination from a planted field and create "an invisible  aesthetic."  </P> <P> Betty Tsou Fong's minimalist sculptures are sometimes too blandly Plain Jane,  but she offers a sweet conceit in a bronze "Floor Sculpture 2" of a swelling  mountain form with a deep belly-button-like central core, and sweeping sides  that swirl around like an open coat.  </P> <P> Other points of view are offered by Ernest Scott's moodily evocative  mixed-media photographic work, and David DiMichele's shaped canvases that  mingle pattern-making, modern-art references and allusions to the ubiquitous  urban infrastructure.  </P> <P> What: "Conceptual Impulse," mixed-media installations by seven artists.  </P> <P> When: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Mondays, through Aug. 12.  </P> <P> Where: Security Pacific Gallery, 555 Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: San Diego Freeway to Bristol Street exit; go north. Anton is off  Bristol between the freeway and Sunflower Avenue.  </P> <P> Wherewithall: Admission is free.  </P> <P> Where to call: (714) 433-6001.  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Court criticises conduct of councils review The High Court yesterday sharply criticised the conduct of the local government review in England, but refused to overrule recommendations that three county councils - Avon, Cleveland and Somerset - should be abolished. It said the three councils' complaints about proposals made by the Local Government Commission, which is charged with drawing up new council structures, should be left to politicians, not the courts. The ruling intensified confusion over the review. Cleveland said it was considering an appeal, while Cambridgeshire, which was recommended for abolition earlier this month, announced that it would also seek judicial review. Lord Justice Staughton said: 'Charges of irrationality were not made out.' But he criticised leaflets - distributed by the commission as part of its consultation exercise - which included estimates for annual savings created by reorganisation, but made no mention of the transitional costs involved. He said: 'We have serious reservations about the propriety of leaflets in that form. There was mention in the argument of picking out the plums and leaving the duff, and of conduct which in the case of a second-hand car salesman would lead to an appearance at the Old Bailey.' Sir John Banham, the chairman of the commission, said the literature for all the 11 counties for which proposals were announced this month would include transitional costs. He said Cambridgeshire was 'throwing good money after bad', and that the county's decision to seek judicial review represented 'the triumph of hope over experience'. He said: 'It costs Pounds 100,000 a time to seek judicial review, and this from counties which tell us they are strapped for cash. I can't believe this will be good for the standing of local government.' But Mr Robin Wendt, secretary of the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, said that 'important issues' had been left unresolved, and that more legal challenges by both county and district councils lay ahead. The judgment was welcomed by the cross-party Association of District Councils, which backs abolishing county councils and replacing them with all-purpose unitary authorities based on merged districts. Ms Margaret Singh, who chairs the association, described judicial review as 'inappropriate and a waste of public money when there are other avenues available'. The ruling clears the way for Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to submit formal plans for abolishing Avon and Somerset to parliament, but his department said that no decision was imminent. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local-government spokesman, said the 'vacillation and indecision' of ministers had thrown the whole process into confusion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> correspondent Noel Velli on 27 May; place not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Juppe] We  have not proposed sending French peacekeeping forces because we  were not asked. We have not been asked by the UN secretary  general. I understand that one party to the conflict does not  want our participation. That is fine and we take note. What  France is doing from this point of view is exemplary. Few  countries have done as much in such a short period of time as  France in helping the refugees and setting up humanitarian aid.    [Velli] What do you intend to do to improve French relations  with Rwanda if the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] takes power?    [Juppe] Well, if the RPF takes power, this will mean that an  agreement and reconciliation between all the parties to the  conflict should be reached. This is what France did  successfully last year with the conclusion of the Arusha  agreement. The latter was based on the idea of power-sharing  between the various parties representing the Rwandan population.  There is no other way. There will come a time when talks on a  political agreement will have to be held after a cease-fire. I  am convinced that the usefulness of the French contribution will  be considered then. [end recording]    [Announcer] Another statement was made by Cooperation  Minister Michel Roussin. He said the Rwandan tragedy is the  biggest human catastrophe of the end of this century.</p>

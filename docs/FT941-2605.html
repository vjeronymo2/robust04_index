			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / The Long View: Debatable dividends An increase of 50 per cent in the dividend of the UK merchant bank Schroders this week, though scarcely typical, has provided a reminder that dividends are showing unexpected buoyancy this year. Although earnings cover has become thin, by historical standards, British companies are ready to be generous. At present the income on the All-Share Index is showing growth of 4.6 per cent on a year ago, adjusting for the negative effect of last year's dividend tax changes, and the growth rate could expand by a percentage point or two as the results season progresses. This is not bad when, for comparison, pay is rising at only 3 1/4 per cent in the UK and underlying retail price inflation is a little less than that. Elsewhere in Europe shareholders are not so fortunate. In Germany, for instance, the big companies are displaying their traditional readiness to cut dividends in bad times: the big chemical groups BASF and Hoechst have both trimmed by 20 per cent or so. During the past five years, since shortly before the recession began to bite, UK dividends have grown by a cumulative 7 per cent in real terms, while capital investment in real terms in the UK has fallen by 14 per cent. Profits are heading this year towards 16 or 17 per cent of GDP, close to a post-war peak, and yet output is no higher than four years ago and imports are rising rapidly. Has British short-termism come to dominate once again, with companies trying to keep shareholders happy rather than invest in the future? There is no simple trade-off here, because companies are becoming quite flush with funds. Indeed, many forecasters expect that the corporate sector will begin to expand its investment again quite markedly this year. But will companies find opportunities that are profitable enough? Once more there are signs that the British economy is looking less vigorous than are British plcs. Too many chief executives, it seems, are looking for a 20 per cent return on equity, even though inflation is much lower than it used to be. Consider the puzzle of the so-called output gap, which economists now attempt to measure rather as the old theologians calculated the number of angels on a pinhead. It is the gap between current output and underlying productive capacity, and allegedly explains the downwards pressure on prices (with factory gate wholesale prices rising by only 3.3 per cent in the year ended February, down from 4 per cent-plus reached at one stage last year). But this output gap co-exists rather oddly with the Pounds 13.4bn trade gap in visible goods last year. You would think that if there was surplus capacity there would tend to be production in excess of domestic requirements. Soon the government may start to become restless as it realises that import volumes are rising (at more than 3 per cent a year) and that the balance of payments deficit may threaten sterling. It will become agitated if capital investment fails to recover and 'restructuring', not to mention 'downsizing', continue to be the buzz words in British boardrooms. If capacity is being sidelined it must be that it is not regarded as profitable enough to be operated at current or immediately prospective price levels. For a time, British industry may continue its conjuring trick of generating more profit out of scarcely rising output. But an attempt to achieve much higher rates of return than are required by competitors in countries such as Germany will inevitably lead to a loss of market share in both the home and export markets - unless there is a further substantial sterling devaluation, which still seems unlikely. International economists do a lot of work on the competitiveness of labour forces, and how expensive workers in Germany, costing Dollars 25 an hour, will tend to lose out to Chinese workers costing Dollars 3 an hour or less. Perhaps more investigation could be done on how shareholders making ambitious demands can price their companies out of more competitive market sectors. We are coming up to a tricky period of transition for the British economy. Consumer spending has been driving the recovery so far but domestic consumption is already very high and if the next stage is to be healthy there must be an emphasis on capital investment and exports. But if domestic companies have excessive expectations of profits, because they seek to satisfy the ambitions of pension fund investors, who have enjoyed dividend growth of 10 per cent and a total rate of return of 22 per cent on UK equities annually on average over the past 15 years, they may be scratching around for opportunities. There is a limit to the availability of newly-privatised monopoly utilities with huge cost-cutting potential. In an open economy, of course, greedy domestic investors will be outbid by foreigners. We have seen key industries such as motors (Rover, for instance) and semiconductors drift into overseas control. Perhaps we can afford to leave the duds and the marginal cases to overseas' owners. With luck, they will continue to run the operations in the UK, at least for a while. But the persistence of a substantial trade gap through a deep recession indicates a chronic shortage of available capacity. There is a mirror image contrast with Japan, where in the late 1980s vast amounts of capital became available to industry at almost zero cost. The result was an explosion of investment in low return productive capacity and today Japan runs a trade surplus of Dollars 140bn a year. This is not an example to follow either, because economic logic requires that the yen must be squeezed up to ruinous levels so as to force the closure of capacity and restore some sort of equilibrium. Investors, meantime, have lost heavily. In the UK, in spite of recent setbacks, stock market investors are sitting pretty by comparison. Managers of UK companies are making the assets sweat. But soon the government could be sweating too.</p>

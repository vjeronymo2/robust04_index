It is  also one project to which the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee  and the municipal government have attached great importance. As  a result of the various measures party and government leaders  have taken to tighten comprehensive management of public  security in recent years, Shanghai's public security and order  have improved noticeably, and a environment favorable for  Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic development has been  created. Nevertheless, we should also realize that certain  districts are still plagued by serious public security problems,  and the people are eager to see this situation change. Leading  cadres in these districts must fully understand their  responsibilities and take effective measures to deal with the  problems until actual results have been achieved.    Shanghai has a system under which leading cadres are charged  with the responsibility for managing public security in a  comprehensive manner. This system has institutionalized the  principle that "whoever is in charge should also take up his or  her responsibilities." Under this system, principal party and  government leaders must be the first persons responsible for the  security of the districts and departments under their charge.  Experience proves the key to achieving comprehensive management  of public security lies in the leadership exercised by the top  leaders of one level over the top leaders of the next level.  Comprehensive management of public security is a broadly  involved and formidable social systems engineering project; and  only when principal leaders attach importance to it, care for  it, support it, and involve themselves in it can they mobilize  and guide other responsible cadres to do their job with real  efforts. In accordance with their assignments for comprehensive  management of public security, party and government cadres at  all levels must find their respective positions, discharge their  respective responsibilities, properly supervise their own staff,  and take proper care of their own affairs so that peace can be  ensured in districts under their charge.    To succeed in comprehensive management of public security,  the system governing leaders' responsibilities in ensuring peace  in districts under their charge should become one criterion  having a close bearing on leading cadres' term of office,  performance evaluation, promotion, and award or disciplinary  action. Leading party and government cadres of various  districts and departments whose serious negligence of duty has  given rise to protracted public disorder or to major incidents  upsetting the local stability must be disciplined in accordance  with relevant party and administrative rules.    To show that they care about comprehensive management of  public security, leading cadres at all levels must conduct  investigation and study at grass-roots units and attend to their  major problems. More importantly, they must pay attention to  giving full scope to the roles played by organs in charge of  comprehensive management of public security as well as  departments in charge of public security, judicial, and  educational affairs. Moreover, they must attach importance to  the work of these departments, care for their work, support  their work, and earnestly help them deal with the outstanding  problems they encounter in their work. We should also have  effective measures for mobilizing the people, especially party  member-cadres, to take part in the management of public security  in certain districts or trades so that the work of ensuring  peace there will become an obligation of each and every one.    Development needs stability, and there will be no  development  without stability. On the other hand, development promotes  stability, and stability ensures development. Leading cadres at  all levels must fully understand and have a firm grip of the  dialectical relationship between development and stability.  Under the new situation where Shanghai continues to deepen  reform, open wider to the outside world, and take the lead in  building a socialist market economic system, we hope all our  cadres will take advantage of the system of delegating leading  cadres responsibility for comprehensive management of public  security, and mobilize and organize people in our society to  intensify the project so that a social environment favorable for  achieving a sustained, fast, and healthy economic development  can be created in Shanghai.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Emhart Will Consider New Bid: Officials of Black &amp; Decker Corp., which has  agreed to buy Emhart Corp. in a $2.8-billion takeover, said they were not  worried about Emhart's indication that it still would consider a higher bid  from a rival suitor. In an SEC filing, Emhart said it offered New York-based  investment partnership Topper L.P. the chance to review internal company  documents if the information would help Topper formulate a higher bid. Emhart  has rejected as inadequate Topper's unsolicited $2.4-billion buyout offer.  Topper investors include oil heir Gordon P. Getty.  </P></p>

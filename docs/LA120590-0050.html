			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADORANS' EVICTION FROM CHURCH STIRS DEBATE;  </P> <P> RELIGION: MORE THAN 200 WERE REMOVED FROM LA PLACITA AFTER A SECURITY GUARD WAS  ASSAULTED. SOME PARISHIONERS QUESTION THE MERITS OF A LONGSTANDING POLICY  OFFERING SANCTUARY TO REFUGEES.  </P> <P> A weekend fracas at Los Angeles' oldest church that resulted in the eviction of  more than 200 Salvadorans and the torching of a church member's car has  invigorated debate over whether the church should serve as a sanctuary for  refugees.  </P> <P> The Salvadorans were evicted from Our Lady Queen of Angels Church, known as La  Placita, Saturday night after two of them assaulted an armed security guard. A  car belonging to a church choir member was set afire in the ensuing squabbling.  </P> <P> La Placita officials said it was the first time they could recall that the  church turned away refugees. Fewer than 30 spent the night in a church  basement.  </P> <P> The evictions and vandalism have stirred debate among parishioners over the  church's future. Some church members believe that the political activism  espoused at La Placita is being taken advantage of by criminals who prey on  fellow Salvadoran homeless seeking refuge at the church.  </P> <P> Father Luis Olivares declared the church a sanctuary from U.S. immigration  authorities. The former pastor used La Placita as a platform to espouse liberal  causes, including opposition to U.S. involvement in El Salvador.  </P> <P> The controversy, according to some at the church, has set parishioner against  parishioner.  </P> <P> "The church no longer wants to help Salvadorans," charged parishioner Camilo  Castillo, a Salvadoran refugee. "They don't understand what's really going on.  We believe the church should be with the people, the poor -- not with the  rich."  </P> <P> A U.S.-born parishioner, a longtime worshiper at La Placita who asked that his  name not be used, retorted:  </P> <P> "We don't need the violence that has occurred here recently. Salvadorans come  to Los Angeles and they try to get as much (money) as they can for their  families over there. But their efforts do not help La Placita. My heart says  that La Placita has always and will always help everybody, not just the  refugees."  </P> <P> Some accuse the church's new pastor, Father Albert Vazquez, of wanting to  rescind the church's sanctuary declaration to appease some longtime  parishioners.  </P> <P> "That's absolutely not true," Vazquez said Tuesday. "We cannot close our eyes  to the homeless and others."  </P> <P> The incident Saturday night prompted rumors that some Salvadoran activists  would take over a Mass the next day to make a political statement about La  Placita.  </P> <P> The takeover did not occur, but the rumor has forced the public discussion of  La Placita's future.  </P> <P> Some parishioners believe that the continuing problem of violence at the church  -- two homicides reported near La Placita in the last three years and the  continual confiscation of weapons from some refugees -- is linked to the  church's declaration of sanctuary.  </P> <P> "I think Olivares' intentions were good and honorable," one Latino parishioner  said. "However, somebody took advantage of it. A bad element."  </P> <P> Salvadoran refugee Castillo said the refugees are being used as scapegoats for  the violence. "Most of the men are good, honest," he said. "They are trying to  escape violence, not create it."  </P> <P> "I am between a rock and a hard place," said Vazquez, who became pastor in  July. "I admire him (Olivares). He is a visionary. But the Salvadorans do not  feel they have the voice that they had before. I am not Luis. I am my own man  and Luis isn't me."  </P> <P> Olivares, who is awaiting reassignment after being diagnosed as having AIDS,  could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.  </P></p>

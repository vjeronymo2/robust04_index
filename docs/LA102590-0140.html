			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL TO PUT OFF POLICE COMMISSION MEETING ON GATES  </P> <P> An unusual meeting between the Los Angeles City Council and the Police  Commission will be put off indefinitely while the commission conducts an  inquiry into recent statements by Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The meeting, requested last week by the City Council, had been tentatively set  for Nov. 6.  </P> <P> The meeting was scheduled at the urging of Councilman Robert Farrell, who said  he was dissatisfied with the commission's apparent lack of interest in Gates'  statement last month that casual drug users should be shot.  </P> <P> However, Farrell said Wednesday that because the commission has decided to look  more closely at the matter, he will move to postpone the meeting.  </P> <P> City Council President John Ferraro, whose office was organizing the session,  said Wednesday that no new date will be selected until Farrell renews his  request.  </P> <P> The Police Commission, a five-member panel appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley, has  ultimate policy authority over the Police Department. The City Council has the  authority to approve or reject Bradley's nominees.  </P> <P> Farrell said he is concerned whether the commission is exerting adequate  authority over the Police Department in light of Gates' statement.  </P> <P> "The issue is whether there is a single standard of justice for people who wear  police uniforms," Farrell said. The commission's inaction, he said, was a  signal to lower-ranking members of the department that their superiors are  "immune" from disciplinary action.  </P></p>

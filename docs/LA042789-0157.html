			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEATH IS RULED OUT FOR SOLDIER FACING TRIAL FOR ESPIONAGE  </P> <P> An Orange County soldier charged with espionage for allegedly passing defense  secrets to East Germany will stand trial by court-martial, but prosecutors have  decided not to seek the death penalty, military officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri, 21, an expert on Warsaw Pact radar equipment, will go  on trial June 6 on charges of espionage, illegally entering East Germany,  possessing classified documents, larceny of military property and making a  false statement to military authorities, Maj. Samuel Taylor, deputy public  affairs officer of the 5th Army Corps, said in a telephone interview from  Frankfurt, West Germany.  </P> <P> The maximum penalty in espionage cases is death, but Taylor said that the 5th  Corps commander, Gen. John Woodmansee, decided that Peri's case would not be  tried as a capital offense.  </P> <P> "The maximum sentence he could receive is life in prison," Taylor said.  </P> <P> Taylor declined to say why Woodmansee declined to seek the death penalty,  saying only that the decision was based on a review of the evidence and  interviews with Peri's company and regimental commanders.  </P> <P> Peri, who went to La Quinta High School in Westminster and whose family lives  in Laguna Niguel, is being held in the Army Confinement Facility in Mannheim,  West Germany. His parents could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Peri was charged with espionage and the other offenses after he allegedly  crossed into East Germany and gave officials there sensitive information about  the defensive deployment of U.S. tanks and helicopters.  </P> <P> Peri, who worked in intelligence with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at  Fulda, West Germany, disappeared Feb. 21 with a military Jeep and a laptop  computer from his office. He reappeared with the computer 12 days later and  turned himself in to base officials.  </P> <P> Taylor said Peri was charged after an investigation revealed he had taken  classified documents from a storage area and had given them to East German  officials. The documents, according to military officials, related to the 11th  Armored Cavalry's general defense plans, specifically the regiment's role in  defending itself from an attack by Warsaw Pact forces.  </P> <P> The 11th Armored Cavalry is positioned on the strategic Fulda Gap, a  traditional invasion route to Western Europe and a likely avenue for  Soviet-bloc tanks in the event of war.  </P> <P> Taylor said Peri had retained two civilian attorneys in addition to two  attorneys provided by the military. Heading the defense team is Maj. William G.  Stokes, senior defense counsel for the Trial Defense Service based in  Frankfurt.  </P> <P> According to Taylor, Peri will be held in the Mannheim facility until the  trial.  </P> <P> Taylor said Peri has two choices: a court-martial before one military judge,  who would hear the case and then rule on Peri's guilt or innocence, or a trial  before a panel of at least five military officers.  </P> <P> He said the trial would be held in the Abrams Courtroom at the Abrams complex  in Frankfurt, headquarters for the 5th Army Corps in West Germany.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Kenya abandons the straight and narrow of reform: Corruption has triumphed over donor-inspired liberalisation KENYA'S reversal of its economic liberalisation programme is a serious challenge to the concept of linking western aid to political and economic reforms and a sign of the stranglehold corruption has over one of Africa's most developed economies. The government's announcement on Monday that it was abandoning foreign exchange reforms demanded by the country's donors and returning to a controlled allocation system has thrown the fragile economy further into crisis and re-opened opportunities for graft. The move, accompanied by a series of bitter attacks on the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, signalled the government's intention to 'go it alone' without western aid - a policy which has wrecked several other African economies such as Zambia under ex-President Kenneth Kaunda. The government's belligerent attitude to its western donors has also sunk hope that pressure could be brought to bear on the country to end economic mismanagement and corruption and release the considerable potential of its dynamic business community. Donors and economists believe the government's retreat is rooted in the considerable power wielded by a handful of politicians who have stolen millions of dollars by manipulating economic controls in their personal favour. For more than a decade Kenya has been making efforts to reform its economy, supported by billions of dollars of western aid. But throughout the late 1980s the government consistently failed to fulfil its policy pledges to donors to curb a growing budget deficit, slash the bloated public sector, privatise inefficient government-owned companies, reform the financial system, and free the trade regime. At the same time, evidence continued to leak out of corruption perpetrated by the ruling elite which has defeated reform efforts. This has taken two forms: direct payoffs to politicians by private companies in return for inflated government contracts or politicians using their position to build business empires and divert money to overseas bank accounts. Donors suspended quick disbursing balance of payments support worth Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) a month in November 1991, pending a government commitment to tackle corruption and introduce a serious reform programme. Donors also decided to insist on political reform in the hope that a democratic system would create accountability and root out corrupt practices. President Moi responded to the suspension of western aid by introducing multi-party democracy and sacking Mr Nicholas Biwott, one of his most controversial ministers. The biggest recent scandal surrounded a company called Goldenberg International which was licensed to export gold and diamonds. The company was paid at least Ksh1bn (Pounds 10.4m) in preferential export compensation payments by the Treasury for inflated export shipments. It was also granted billions of shillings by the Central Bank under a pre-shipment financing facility - originally devised to provide cheap credit to exporters before shipping goods. Goldenberg and some politically connected banks - including Exchange Bank, set up last year and linked to Goldenberg - abused the scheme to gain cheap credit to speculate on the collapsing foreign exchange market. The Auditor-General's report last year exposed the Goldenberg scam and blamed the Treasury and Prof George Saitoti, vice president and minister of finance, for allowing the scandal to continue. No action was taken and Central Bank documents given to the Financial Times yesterday suggest that Goldenberg continues to operate freely with official blessing, claiming to export almost Ksh1bn of diamonds in December 1992 alone. Furthermore the Central Bank allowed several politically connected banks which have been in severe financial difficulties for at least two years to run up huge overdrafts worth up to Ksh10bn in contravention of Kenyan banking regulations. The state owned pension fund the National Social Security Fund was also directed to lend up to Ksh9.5bn to banks desperate for deposits. Last month the government appeared to be grasping the nettle when it introduced bold foreign exchange liberalisation measures. However, it failed to mop up the excessive liquidity in the system fuelling a rapid depreciation of the Kenya shilling and more inflation. Bankers say the government has been reluctant to use interest rates to squeeze liquidity because of the impact it would have on prices and on the politically connected banks. The banks still maintain large overdrafts at the Central Bank and last week the Central Bank rolled-over Ksh5.4bn of debt incurred under the pre-shipment financing facility . 'The cancer in the system is the power of the political banks to determine economic policy in their interest,' said one banker yesterday. See Editorial Comment</p>

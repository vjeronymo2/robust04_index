			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 14 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal  Kovac today appreciated the decision made by Hungarian ethnic  minority's elected representatives from southern Slovakia to  solve problems of the region by constitutional and legal means.    Slovak Television reported that Kovac today received the  organizers of the January 8 meeting of elected representatives  of the Hungarian ethnic minority from southern Slovakia in  Komarno, south Slovakia, which was initiated by the Association  of Towns and Villages of Zitny Ostrov (ZMOZO).    Originally it was said that the Komarno meeting would  declare  autonomy in southern Slovakia and elect a 100-member assembly.  Eventually, the meeting decided to push for the minority's  demands in the Slovak Parliament.    Some 560,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, most of  them  in the south. They constitute 11 percent of the country's  population.    Kovac's Spokesman Anton Bodis said that Kovac would comment  on the resolutions from the meeting, which he obtained today,  after he had thoroughly studied them.    The meeting called for collective rights of the Hungarian  minority to be embedded in the Slovak Constitution, and demanded  that the Hungarians be allowed to use their language in official  contact at any place where they make up at least one-tenth of  the population, that they be represented in state bodies and  public institutions proportionately to their number, and that  they be allotted a relevant share of the state budget.</p>

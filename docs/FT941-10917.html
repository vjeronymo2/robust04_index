			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (8): Watchdog vigilant - The Philippines The Philippine stock market is is still largely rumour-driven, despite the emergence of professional research activities among brokers. However, expectations of economic resurgence, along with political and economic reforms, have produced sharp gains for the market. A government watchdog agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), oversees the conduct and development of the market, but it has weaknesses. While it is a quasi-judicial body, the commission is without police powers, so that it cannot enforce implementation of some of its controversial rulings. Yet the SEC has tried to instil discipline. It has been involved in upgrading the level of professionalism; and these efforts have been capped by the recent unification of the two active stock exchanges into a Philippine Stock Exchange, though the two trading floors (PSE-Ayala, in the Makati financial district, and PSE-Tektite, at the fast-developing Ortigas Center) were maintained. There are 285 issues from 182 companies listed simultaneously on both exchanges, though only about 100-110 of these issues are traded daily. Foreign investors may buy only the Class B shares. Philippine nationals may acquire both A and B shares. Local companies usually allocate up to 40 per cent of their equity to foreign investors. However, since most companies going public only offer up to 15-20 per cent of capital on the market, the amounts actually made available to foreigners are small. Thus, liquidity problems arise in many counters whenever there are huge inflows of foreign funds, as happened in late-1993. The exchanges have two major sections: the big board and the small board. Big-board issues, also referred to as 'blue chips', are from companies with a track record of earnings and dividend payments to shareholders. These include the country's leading commercial, industrial and mining enterprises. The small board is for speculative stocks, mostly newly established mining and oil exploration companies with small irregular production or none at all, and which therefore have no dividends to declare yet. On each of the two exchanges, 90 broker members currently operate. - Eventually, all 180 will be members of the new entity. Unification will not bring the two exchanges' activities under one roof, but their computer systems will be linked, providing each other with real-time prices and allowing match-ups of bids and selling prices from either exchange. Trading on the exchanges starts at 9.30am and ends at noon, with 15-minute extensions allowed but using only 12-noon closing prices. Current SEC rules prescribe a freeze on the trading of a particular issue when its price moves up by 50 per cent or down by 40 per cent during any single day. Trading on such issue resumes only after the SEC has ruled that such fluctuation there is justified. Sales are done in lots of five to 200,000 shares, depending on the price range of a particular stock. The lots become bigger as the price level goes down. Brokers charge commissions of usually 1.5 per cent of the total cost of each transaction. There is no capital gains tax, but a transaction tax of 0.25 per cent of the total transaction cost is charged - which the government is seeking to increase to 0.5 per cent. There is no tax on dividends received from Philippine companies by resident individuals or corporations. For non-resident foreign individuals, there is a tax of 30 per cent, while that for foreign non-resident corporations is 35 per cent. Paperwork on transactions involving foreign investors has become simplified in recent years. For an investor who maintains a custodian bank, the process takes about four days. After confirmation of the sale, the investor may instruct the broker to register the shares in the custodian's nominee name and informs the custodian of the arrangement. Payments fall due in four days. The custodian bank is to be paid in foreign exchange, converts this amount into pesos and pays the broker that amount in local currency. The custodian bank issues a registration document (a requirement from the Philippine central bank) and gives two copies to the broker. One of these copies is sent to the transfer agent. After competion of the procedure, the certificates are delivered by the transfer agent to the broker, who delivers the same to the custodian bank. For investors who do not maintain custodian banks, all transactions are centralised with the broker, who coordinates with a local bank in fixing the local currency equivalent of the foreign exchange requirements on the deals. The shares certificates may be kept by the broker for the investor, or they may be delivered elsewhere upon instructions of the investor.</p>

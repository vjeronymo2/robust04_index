			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE COSTS CREATE EPIDEMIC OF CONCERN IN MANY DENOMINATIONS  </P> <P> While thanking this summer's General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church  (U.S.A.) for a "wonderful year," outgoing Moderator Kenneth Hall also ended on  a worried note -- one of enormous practical importance for many small and  average-size churches.  </P> <P> "Health care costs have become a burden on our churches," Hall said, then  warned that congregations with fewer than 200 members may no longer be able to  afford (the salary and benefits of) a full-time pastor.  </P> <P> Hall could have been speaking for most of America's mainline denominations.  </P> <P> Virtually all of the major churches have been hit hard by ballooning costs and  view the medical coverage situation as critical.  </P> <P> Denominations are groping for ways to contain insurance costs while still  maintaining benefits. But with national health care expenditures rising about  9% annually for much of the past decade, it is an uphill battle.  </P> <P> Currently, most churches employ one of two basic methods for providing  coverage. Some use commercial insurance companies for ministers and other  workers. Others use denomination-based health plans.  </P> <P> There are, however, an array of variations available. For instance, some  denominations provide national plans that are mandatory for all clergy. In  other churches, participation in medical plans is optional. Still others  provide coverage by region or district and, in some cases, individual ministers  are responsible for providing their own coverage based on a congregation's  ability to pay.  </P> <P> No matter what form is used or how well the funds are managed, the churches  have no control over the never-ending increases in medical costs that are  causing nightmares for providers of health care coverage in every segment of  society.  </P> <P> But the one big disadvantage for the churches, as one church executive points  out, is that denominations, unlike businesses, cannot increase the price of  their product to meet the rising costs.  </P> <P> The churches have taken some action aimed at bringing costs under control by  increasing premiums and deductibles (the amount the insured must pay before the  insurance plan takes effect) and by cutting back on coverage. But those  measures represent only the first steps up the mountain of costs.  </P> <P> Among the hardest hit by the crisis are some ministers of smaller congregations  who have begun to divert funds from their pension plans in order to pay for  limited medical coverage. And denominations fear that others may be left  unprotected, forced to drop medical insurance altogether because their  congregations cannot generate enough income to pay for it.  </P> <P> Few churches have gone unaffected by problems of escalating medical costs, as a  survey of denominations illustrates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (U.S.A.)  </P> <P> In hope of gaining some control over steadily rising costs that contributed to  a major medical fund net loss of $18 million during 1988, the church has been  casting about to find a company that will take on the church's troubled  self-insured medical plan.  </P> <P> However, as of mid-July, none of the 12 insurance companies contacted would  touch the plan, which hit local congregations with a 3% increase on the  pastor's salary and housing in 1988 and a 2% increase this year.  </P> <P> Claudia B. Smith, vice president of benefits for the church's Board of  Pensions, said experts in the field are not optimistic that the church will be  able to find an insurance company willing to operate a churchwide program that  gives members any better deal than they now have.  </P> <P> Indeed, to Smith the future looks grim: "There will continue to be increases  and/or benefit reductions as long as the rate of inflation continues to go up  each year. That's just simple mathematics."  </P> <P> In addition to the premium rate increases in the last two years, the  Presbyterian plan, effective last Jan. 1, increased the deductible charged to  members on the family plan from 2% of salary to 3%.  </P> <P> "Our experience . . . is practically identical to what is happening in the  American economy in general," said Smith. "We are facing the same tough  decision as every other entity out there."  </P> <P> But there is one critical difference between the way rising medical costs  affect churches and the businesses that produce a product, she noted,  explaining, "We can't add on to the cost of another widget."  </P> <P> </P> <P> UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST  </P> <P> At its General Synod earlier this summer, the United Church of Christ approved  a resolution noting that premium rates for the church's self-insured medical  plan escalated by 40% in 1988 and "are quickly moving beyond small churches'  and retired clergy's financial ability to participate, and may leave many  persons uninsured and at risk."  </P> <P> The resolution encourages all UCC churches and national bodies to participate  in the church's voluntary plan as a strategy for reducing premiums.  </P> <P> Joan F. Brannick, administrative vice president of the United Church of Christ  Pension Boards, said UCC policy requires churches to provide medical benefits  to clergy, either through the church's plan or other options.  </P> <P> While she said she knows of no situation where ministers are going without  benefits, Brannick would not rule out that possibility, saying, "My guess is  that there are as many variations as you can imagine because there are very  small churches feeling the pinch."  </P> <P> Not only have premium rates for the church-sponsored medical plan escalated by  40% in the past year, but deductible amounts have been increased as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UNITED METHODIST CHURCH  </P> <P> The United Methodist Church's Board of Pensions last week authorized a task  force to examine the feasibility of establishing a church-wide medical benefits  program.  </P> <P> Currently, each United Methodist "annual conference," or regional body,  oversees its own medical program. But cost increases averaging about 20%  annually in the last several years and the disparity in benefits provided from  conference to conference have created "an incredible amount of discussion"  within the denomination, prompting establishment of the task force, according  to the Rev. Tom Marston, director of the board's Benefits Department.  </P> <P> Marston said the church finds itself in "a very fluctuating situation," as some  conferences consider dropping plans provided by insurance companies in favor of  their own self-insured plans, while other conferences proceed in the reverse  direction.  </P> <P> "I think they're trying to take the best-educated guess," said Marston.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH IN AMERICA  </P> <P> The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, formed in 1988 from a merger of  three predecessors, paid $38 million in medical claims out of its medical plan  in 1988, and without changes in the church's plan those costs are expected to  increase to $45 million this year and to $53 million in 1990.  </P> <P> At its Churchwide Assembly to be held in August, the church is scheduled to  consider recommendations by its Board of Pensions calling for optional coverage  for spouses and dependents and an increase in member costs from the current 10%  to 20% of eligible expenses.  </P> <P> Kathryn A. Barrus, vice president for medical/dental administration for the  Board of Pensions, said, "It is unfortunate that the ELCA started out at a time  when medical costs were increasing tremendously."  </P> <P> During the young denomination's first year, she reported, rising costs forced  the church to increase medical premium charges from 8.1% to 9.9% of employee  compensation.  </P> <P> According to Barrus, contribution rates are likely to increase from 9.9% of  employee compensation to 13.5% if the Board of Pensions recommendations are not  approved by the Churchwide Assembly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION  </P> <P> John Dudley, senior vice president of insurance services for the Southern  Baptist Convention, which is enrolled in an Aetna Life and Casualty plan, said,  "I would say it's approaching the critical point. . . . We're greatly concerned  about our churches continuing to be able to afford these rate increases."  </P> <P> Under SBC policy, medical coverage is not required for clergy or lay workers.  While 37,000 Southern Baptist churches, or roughly half the denomination total,  participate in the Aetna plan, Dudley said he believes many of the smaller  churches simply do not provide medical coverage.  </P> <P> "The salaries of the pastors and the congregations just don't allow for that,"  Dudley said.  </P> <P> In some instances, he said, employees are diverting contributions away from  their pension plans in order to maintain health benefits. "I suspect we're  going to see greater numbers dropping by the wayside if this thing continues,"  Dudley predicted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH  </P> <P> Sister Christine Matthews, executive director of the Roman Catholic National  Assn. of Church Personnel Administrators, noted that each Catholic diocese in  the country decides its own medical coverage policy.  </P> <P> While Sister Matthews said she had not noticed any patterns in the ways  dioceses are responding to increasing medical costs, she did say one thing is  clear -- the situation is critical.  </P> <P> Among some of the options being explored are statewide plans that would include  more than one diocese, "cafeteria" plans that give employees more choices on  the kinds of coverage they can purchase, and raising deductibles.  </P> <P> "Dioceses are looking for ways to use the money wisely and still keep the best  benefits for employees." Commenting on the general health care cost crisis, she  said, "I think something has to be done in this country to help cope."  </P></p>

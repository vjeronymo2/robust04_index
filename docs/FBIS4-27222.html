			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Singapore has applauded U.S. President Bill  Clinton's decision on Friday to renew China's Most Favoured  Nation [MFN] status.    "It was the right thing to do," said Deputy Prime Minister  Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.    "I am glad the President took the hard but right decision,"  he told reporters when he officiated at NTUC's [National Trade  Union Congress] May Day Family Gathering at the Singapore  Zoological Gardens.    In a turn-around of policy, Mr Clinton also announced that  he  would sever the link between China's MFN status and human  rights. He had imposed the improvement of China's human rights  record as a condition for MFN renewal.    He is now facing pressure from American legislators,  including those from his own Democratic Party who are enraged by  his about- face on China.    NTUC chief Lim Boon Heng, who was also present at the NTUC  function, also welcomed the move: "Any measure that promotes  world trade will be good for Singapore. Singapore entrepreneurs  should take advantage of the better business climate in China."  [passage omitted]</p>

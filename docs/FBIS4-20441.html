High prevalence  of HBV infection in China is well known, but anti-HDV antibody  positive rate in HBV infected population is very low (0-2.7  percent) except XinJiang, XiZang (Tibet) and NeiMengGu (Inner  Mongolia). In order to study if there are variant subtype of HDV  in China, two Chinese HDV-cDNA fragments encoding HDAg were  isolated from recombinants by PCR with specific primers. They  were inserted into expression plasmid pBV220 and transformed  into E. coli DH5 _a_. The ampicillin-resistant  positive clones were selected by in situ hybridization with  specific Digoxigenin labelled HDV-cDNA probe and ELISA. The  results show that both fragments encoding HDAg either 214 amino  acids or 74 amino acids at the N terminal end of ORF5 (according  to Wang's report 1986) show the activity of HDAg. The ELISA  titer was 1:10,000 to 1:32,000. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and  Western blotting show that the molecular weights were about 29  kD and 10 kD respectively. The large HDAg has the activity of  binding HDV-RNA but the small HDAg has lost the site of binding.  It is interesting that the large Chinese HDAg expressed in  E. coli also has the ability of binding Neo-RNA. The  mechanism of this nonspecific reaction and its significance  should be studied. These antigens reacted specifically with  anti-HD positive serum and anti-HD monoclonal antibodies. These  antigens also had high immunogenicity for production of antibody.    Key words: Hepatitis Delta virus, Expression of HDV-RNA,  HDAg, E. coli</p>

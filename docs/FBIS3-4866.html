Yohei Kono, president of the largest opposition party, told  reporters that the government should commit itself to work on  bringing the sluggish economy back on track and thus now is not  the time to reshuffle the cabinet.    The LDP has insisted on immediately pushing ahead with  economic stimulus measures since last year but the Hosokawa  administration has no idea for shoring up the economy nor  interest in doing so, Kono said.    Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP's Diet Affairs  Committee, also criticized the ruling coalition, telling  reporters the government has lost its function due to a discord  between Hosokawa, and his spokesman and Chief of Staff Masayoshi  Takemura.    Ozato urged Hosokawa to bring an immediate end to the  political turmoil, saying the Diet cannot set up the timetable  for deliberations of the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal  1994, which the cabinet will submit to the Diet on Friday.    Ruling coalition parties have remained divided over  Hosokawa's scheme to make changes to his nearly seven-month-old  cabinet, expected for Thursday.    The primary target of the reshuffle is apparently to  Tamekura, the chief cabinet secretary, who has been reportedly  at odds with Hosokawa since late December.</p>

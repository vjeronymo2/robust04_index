			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / How the exchange rate helps external adjustment CAN CHANGES in nominal exchange rates bring about enduring changes in real rates of exchange? Can changes in real exchange rates bring about changes in the current account? Policy-makers in western Europe seem to assume that the answer to both questions is no. But the experience of the 1980s indicates that this is not necessarily so. That, at least, is is the principal conclusion of a volume of essays published by the Washington-based Institute of International Economics late last year (the concluding essay of which, by Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was published as number 34 in the Institute's series, Policy Analyses in International Economics). In his introduction, Professor Krugman argues that 'the decade's record of huge swings in exchange rates and trade balances gives us the best opportunity ever to sort out competing schools of thought in the economics of international adjustment, and perhaps even to get reasonably solid estimates of some key economics parameters.' The result? The old wisdom about the exchange rate and adjustment may not work in theory, but it certainly worked in practice. In his column on 'why the case against devaluation is not clear-cut', which accompanied the above indicators on 20 January 1992, Edward Balls demonstrated that changes in nominal and real exchange rates were closely correlated for the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK. The same has been true for Japan. But it has been less true in the European Monetary System, where changes in both nominal and real exchange rates have also been smaller. The accompanying charts show that there was also a close correlation between changes in real exchange rates (measured by relative unit labour costs) and the US and Japanese current accounts. German experience is more complex, but as revealing. Having marched to the top of the hill by 1985, the dollar marched back down again. The current account started to turn around two years later. Japan's story is almost a mirror-image. The real exchange rate appreciated rapidly between 1985 and 1988, while the current account surplus fell, from a peak of 4 per cent of GNP in 1986 to a little over 1 per cent in 1990. Cushioned by the ERM, the German real exchange rate appreciated rather less than the Japanese from 1985. Although the surplus did stop rising as a share of GNP, it did not fall until 1990, when it was eliminated by the demand boost following German unification. The German experience reveals that changes in external balances require changes in demand or, more precisely, changes in the relationship between aggregate income and expenditure. Fiscal consolidation and monetary restraint in the US, monetary expansion in Japan and, following unification, fiscal expansion in Germany all played important parts in the adjustments of 1985-91. How then do changes in real rates of exchange interact with those in demand? Ex ante reductions in demand will not, on their own, bring about equivalent changes in external balances in the short to medium run, except when elasticities of substitution in production and consumption are high. They will bring about large domestic recessions, instead. Changes in demand will themselves lower (or raise) real exchange rates in the long run, via recession and lower inflation (or vice versa). But the long run could, indeed, be long. Depreciation of the real exchange rate would bring about external adjustment, without any complementary macroeconomic measures, if the consequent increase in the incentive to produce were greater than in that to spend. But even if all the income generated by the expansion of net exports were spent, leaving nothing for improvement of the external account, the country would still benefit from higher economic activity. The 1980s have witnessed a strong effort to persuade countries to abandon the exchange rate as an instrument of policy. Perhaps this new conventional wisdom needs to be reconsidered. C.

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985. The real exchange rate is an index throughout; other quarterly and monthly figures show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year and are positive unless otherwise stated.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED STATES  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Unit    Real                     Consumer   Producer            labour  exchange                     prices     prices    Earnings  costs   rate 1985                100.0      100.0     100.0     100.0   100.0 1986                101.9       98.6     102.0      99.9   77.1 1987                105.6      100.7     104.0      97.5   64.7 1988                109.9      103.2     107.0      98.4   59.9 1989                115.2      108.5     110.0      99.1   63.0 1990                121.5      113.9     114.0      99.2   56.6 1991                126.6      116.3 1st qtr. 1991          5.3        3.5       3.6       2.3   52.7 2nd qtr. 1991          4.8        3.4       2.9       2.4 3rd qtr. 1991          3.9        1.9       3.2       2.5 4th qtr. 1991          3.0       -0.2 February 1991         5.3        3.4       3.6       2.6   na March                 4.9        3.2       2.7       2.6   na April                 4.9        3.3       2.7       2.4   na May                   5.0        3.5       3.5       2.5   na June                  4.7        3.5       2.6       2.5   na July                  4.4        2.9       3.5       2.2   na August                3.8        2.0       3.5       2.9   na September             3.4        0.7       2.6       2.5   na October               2.9        0.0       2.6       3.4   na November              3.0       -0.5       2.6             na December              3.1       -0.1       2.6             na January 1992          2.6       -0.5                       na  --------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPAN  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Unit    Real                     Consumer   Producer            labour  exchange                     prices     prices    Earnings  costs   rate 1985                100.0      100.0     100.0     100.0   100.0 1986                100.8       95.3     101.4     103.3   125.7 1987                101.2       92.5     103.1     100.6   126.9 1988                102.2       92.3     107.8      96.2   137.4 1989                105.0       94.2     114.0      96.1   131.3 1990                108.2       95.7     120.1      98.2   116.1 1991                111.8 1st qtr. 1991          3.6        2.8       3.8       1.3   118.0 2nd qtr. 1991          3.1        2.3       4.3       3.0 3rd qtr. 1991          3.3        1.7       3.3       4.0 4th qtr. 1991          3.2        0.0 February 1991         3.4        2.8       5.4       1.0   na March                 3.4        2.6       4.1       3.0   na April                 3.0        2.4       4.0       3.0   na May                   3.0        2.4       4.0       2.0   na June                  3.3        2.2       4.6       4.0   na July                  3.4        2.0       1.9       3.0   na August                3.5        1.9       6.5       5.0   na September             3.0        1.1       2.9       4.0   na October               3.1        0.3       2.8       6.1   na November              3.6       -0.1       2.7       5.0   na December              3.0       -0.1                       na January 1992          2.0                                  na  --------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMANY  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Unit    Real                     Consumer   Producer            labour  exchange                     prices     prices    Earnings  costs   rate 1985                100.0      100.0     100.0     100.0   100.0 1986                99.9        97.5     104.0     104.0   111.3 1987                100.1       95.1     108.0     107.0   126.0 1988                101.4       96.2     113.0     107.0   126.2 1989                104.2       99.3     117.0     108.0   122.6 1990                107.0      101.0     124.0     110.0   126.8 1991                110.7      103.4 1st qtr. 1991          2.7        2.1     na        2.8   124.2 2nd qtr. 1991          3.1        2.2     na        3.0 3rd qtr. 1991          4.1        2.8     na        4.9 4th qtr. 1991          4.0        2.4 February 1991         2.7        2.2        -

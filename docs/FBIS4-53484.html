			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Son Yong-tae] </F>   [Text] On 19 May, the government decided to cope strongly  with the student movement to thoroughly block pro-North Korean  acts benefiting the enemy, while immediately exercising  government power against students' radical, violent  demonstrations and pursuing and arresting all masterminds.    The government decided this at an emergency countermeasure  meeting held at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office at which  working- level officials from the Ministry of Education, the  National Security Planning Agency, and the National Police  Headquarters participated under the presidency of Choe Hwan,  superintendent public prosecutor at the Public Security  Department of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.    In accordance with this, prosecutors have begun making a  secret investigation into the Committee for the Fatherland  Unification and the policy-making committee of the Korean  Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon]--the two  committees are virtually pulling the strings of the activities  of the Hanchongnyon--to find out if their acts are benefiting  the enemy.    The government also decided to arrest core cadres of the  students movement--such as Mr. Kim Hyon-chun, 24, senior in the  Shipbuilding Engineering Department of Pusan National  University, who is chairman of the Hanchongnyon; and Mr. Yang  Tong-hun, 22, senior in the Public Administration Department of  Choson University, who is chairman of the Hanchongnyon's  Committee for the Fatherland Unification and concurrently  chairman of the South Cholla Provincial Federation of General  Student Councils; with advance arrest warrants where necessary.    In addition, the government decided to arrest all those  involved in trying to make contacts with the North, while  thoroughly blocking acts of trying to make contacts with the  North through the National Alliance for Youth and Students for  the Country's Reunification.    A rally launching the activities of the Hanchongnyon will be  held at Choson University [in Kwangju] from 27 to 29 May and the  National Children's Sports Meet will be held in Kwangju from 28  to 31 May. Therefore, the prosecutors are going to cope  actively with this situation in cooperation with relevant  organizations in the Kwangju area so the Hanchongnyon's rally  will be held in a peaceful atmosphere and will not interfere  with the sports meet.    Since the inauguration of the new administration, the  government has thus far maintained a conciliatory attitude  toward those in the students movement. The government has now  decided to make a swift hard-line change on the basis of its own  analyses that recent activities by the students movements have  reached a dangerous stage.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Money Markets: German M3 tumbles A BIG fall in German money supply gave initial hope for a cut in interest rates shortly. However, further consideration suggested the drop merely reflected the new base on which the figures are calculated, writes Peter John. The Bundesbank announced yesterday that M3 money supply contracted at an annualised rate of 2.3 per cent in January after an 8.7 per cent rise in December. The news caught the markets by surprise and briefly sent German futures upwards. However, the figure was rebased on the fourth quarter of last year rather than the fourth quarter of 1991. The fourth quarter of last year saw money supply artificially boosted by the heavy intervention to prop up the French franc. Economists said that without the one-off outpouring of money M3 would actually have risen slightly. Mr Brian Hilliard, an economist with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said: 'It is not giving a clear signal of a cut in interest rates. The figures came out the day after a Bundesbank meeting. They must have been known on Thursday and if Germany wanted to cut it would have done so then.' Nevertheless, not everyone took such a bearish view and the June D-Mark future which opened at 92.90 was bid up to 93.00 before profit takers moved in and it settled at 92.97 with 44,000 contracts traded. One dealer argued that the contract was already discounting a 1 3/8 per cent fall. In the UK, short sterling was bid up to 94.08 in the March contract with more than 23,000 lots dealt. March is generally viewed as a stable hedge as most analysts believe there will be no interest rate cut before the Budget. Money market operations were comfortably settled with a reasonably large shortage well taken out. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.55bn. The majority of the shortage was taken out immediately with the central Bank buying Pounds 1,132m of bills. At the late morning round of assistance, the Bank nudged the forecast back to Pounds 1.5bn and bought Pounds 200m in band one bills at 5 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank bought a further Pounds 170m of bills at the same rate. However, concerns continued that the concertina effect of a number of loans expiring next week will mean that money could become very tight.</p>

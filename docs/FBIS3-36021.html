			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- "The eternal Russian  question, `who will defeat whom', might be at the centre of the  upcoming local elections", according to the worried assessment  of Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian presidential  administration's department for work with the territories.    Medvedev told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday there is a danger that  the  federal government will support reforms, "while opposition  forces might come to power at the regional and republican  level". And no matter how constructive the efforts of reformers  in the centre are, they don't stand a chance without the support  of Russia's regions, he declared.    One of the problems revealed by the unfolding local  campaigns  is, Medvedev explained, that "despite reformers' calls for  unification, in actuality we don't have any party structures in  the regions". Those parties who do have local power structures  are the Communist Party and others of the same leaning. They  are now restoring their organisations and will, of course, do  everything they can to defeat the reformers in the upcoming  local elections, Medvedev said. The economic and financial  difficulties in the regions play into the hands of the  opposition forces.    Medvedev voiced his opinion that reformers can improve their  alarming electoral prospects by "honestly explaining their  mistakes made in socio-economic and financial policy, which did  not take reality into account". After recognizing its mistakes,  the Russian Government "should, as soon as possible, determine  how it is going to correct its reform policy". "There is a hope  that the president's address, to be delivered to parliament on  February 18, will be the starting point of a socially-orientated  policy", Medvedev pointed out.    In his analysis of elections already held in Moscow, the  Moscow and Tula regions, and tens of other districts, Medvedev  said he thinks the current office-holders are better than their  predecessors. Therefore, he supposed, if the democratic forces  can unite their efforts, they can be successful in other regions  as well.    However, the presidential adviser admitted, he has little  reason for optimism, since "we cannot rule out the possibility  of the formation of a sort of 'red belt' around Moscow", which  would be made up of regions with anti-reform and anti-president  mind-sets: Tambov, Oryol, Voronezh, Lipetsk, Ryazan, Mordoviya,  and Penza".    Medvedev was able to find one observation which he could  call  "comforting". During his trips around the country, he met with  various political leaders. From his meetings, Medvedev  concluded that many of them, including opposition politicians,  are taking a second look at their potential allies, especially  Zhirinovskiy's party with its inflammatory statements.</p>

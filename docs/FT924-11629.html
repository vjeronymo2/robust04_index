			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Hardy to the life THOMAS HARDY, HIS LIFE AND FRIENDS by F. B. Pinnion Macmillan, Pounds 45 438 pages THOMAS HARDY has shaped our view of England. Although he was a careful researcher, the Wessex of his novels was always more imaginary than historical, a fiction pieced together from memories of childhood and from stories of the heroic pre-railway days when the people of the coast lived under fear of a French invasion. Hardy broke for ever the townsman's idyll of simple happy country folk enjoying uneventful stress-free lives far from the madding crowd. Any Dorset village, with its loves, its jealousies, and its passions of revenge, its acts of arson, its murders and its hangings, could be a setting for tragedy as universal as ancient Thebes was for Sophocles. There are several biographies of Hardy, including one designed by himself as he prepared for the immortality which he knew awaited him. FB Pinion, in Thomas Hardy, His Life and Friends, distances himself from the extravagant tradition. His book sticks closely to the known facts, which he sets down in chronological order, the important and the trivial, with a minimum of explanation or speculation. Pinnion's main interest is to relate episodes in the novels (which he assumes the reader knows well) to real life incidents. He has a strong sense of place and provides detailed maps of the localities that fed the novelist's imagination. His book is accurate and comprehensive, but the style is flat and occasionally awkward. The few explanations that he ventures (for example that Hardy and the first Mrs Hardy would have got on better if they had had children) are timid, conventional, and unrelated to a considered view of Hardy's developing character. I particularly enjoyed the accounts of how Hardy's friends and editors tried to purge his stories of the very qualities which give them their power and their truth - the political correctness of the time. In one story Hardy was persuaded to change the time of his lovers' meetings from a Sunday to a Saturday. Leslie Stephen succeeded in removing an encounter from a churchyard, objecting to the use of the word 'amorous.' The Spectator damned one story for daring to suggest that 'an unmarried lady owning an estate could have an illegitimate child.' No wonder Hardy refused a knighthood.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: German group in Bulgarian transport deal Willi Betz, the German transport company, is buying 55 per cent of Somat, Bulgaria's long-distance trucking company in the biggest foreign investment in the country's privatisation programme. The German group is paying Dollars 55m for its majority stake and will invest a further Dollars 48m over the next seven years. The state will retain 25 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent will be offered to employees. Alpha Transport of France, the competitor for the deal, complained it was not treated on equal terms with its rivals. Both foreign companies have been working with Somat since the 1970s. Somat used to have a commanding position on the route from the Gulf to Western Europe but war and sanctions in the Gulf and former Yugoslavia disrupted the routes. However, the company still controls half the European road haulage market to the Middle East, according to estimates. Somat is recovering its markets in Russia and the CIS.</p>

A U.S. Army colonel was killed  early this morning after a fragmentation grenade blew up when  the aforementioned military officer was taking it from inside  one of the offices of the National Civilian Police [PNC] in  Zacamil Neighborhood.    According to the report, the incidents developed in the  following manner: A U.S. Embassy international mission vehicle  was passing near Zacamil neighborhood at midnight. It was going  at a very high speed. The vehicle was occupied by a driver and  two other individuals who accompanied him. According to a  confidential report provided to the YSKL news center, the  vehicle's occupants were drunk. At midnight, the U.S. Embassy  international mission vehicle was passing by the Zacamil  neighborhood when a PNC patrol ordered it to stop. The  individuals inside the vehicle did not heed the call to stop  made by the PNC. Minutes later the PNC officers proceeded to  contact other nearby units and the vehicle was stopped. The  three occupants of the vehicle were arrested. The three were  Salvadoran citizens and they were drunk. Three drunk  Salvadorans were driving the U.S. Embassy vehicle. When the  police registered the vehicle, they found a Beretta pistol and a  fragmentation grenade. The police then proceeded to turn over  the three U.S. Embassy security officers, who are Salvadoran  nationals and whose names are being withheld for the time being,  to the PNC's Zacamil Barracks.    As usual, the PNC, following precise instructions, allowed  the drunk Salvadorans to make a telephone call. They were able  to contact Lt. Col. Julio Guzman Ramon Rivera, a U.S. national.  According to a U.S. Embassy report, at 0200 the lieutenant  colonel showed up at the PNC barracks accompanied by a woman and  a child. The Beretta pistol and the grenade were on the PNC  guard commander's table. A PNC sergeant, a corporal in charge of  office work, and three PNC security members were in the office.  A U.S. Embassy security member, who accompanied Lt. Col. Julio  Guzman Ramon Rivera, the woman, and the child, remained outside  the building. The woman and the child had come to find out about  the three U.S. Embassy security guards, who had been arrested  for drunkenness and driving at high speeds in an official  vehicle.    According to the report, the U.S. officer took the grenade  that was on the table and proceeded to pull out the safety pin,  saying it was a toy grenade. The PNC members immediately ran  from the PNC office and the grenade exploded. Lt. Col.

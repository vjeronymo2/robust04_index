			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Anti-Mafia Commission Members </F> Resign, Back Violante"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 24 -- Two members of parliament's  joint Anti-mafia Commission, including its vice chairman,  resigned Thursday [24 March] in support of the commission's  chairman, Luciano Violante, who stepped down yesterday after the  commission became embroiled in an electoral dispute because of  ongoing investigations.    The vice chairman of the commission, Socialist Senator  Maurizio Calvi, and Republican Senator Giovanni Ferrara Salute  both announced they were resigning to protest the "attacks" by  Silvio Berlusconi against Violante and therefore against the  entire commission.    Berlusconi, leader of the right-wing Forza Italia coalition,  had requested Violante's resignation after the Turin daily, LA  STAMPA quoted the commission chairman as saying that a top  executive of Berlusconi's media, retail and advertising empire  may be under investigation in Catania for alleged links with the  mafia.    The Catania public prosecutor's office has been  investigating  ties between organized crime, business, politicians and  freemasonry. Violante, a member of the Democratic Party of the  Left, denied the statements published by LA STAMPA but agreed to  step down because, he said, he did not want the commission's  work and its stature to be undermined.    (The Catania prosecutor's office has refused to release  information about the investigations and today reiterated it  would not confirm or deny whether the executive, Marcello  Dell'Utri of the Publitalia advertising agency, was under  investigation. "If we deny we have to intervene because when we  do not deny, people think we are confirming," said one Catania  magistrate.)    A third commission member, the Lower House Left Democrat MP  Gaetano Grasso, also resigned later, saying that "the attack  against Violante...raises doubts on the entire commission and  the work it has carried out over the years."    All the commission members belonging to the Progressive  Alliance later announced they, too, were resigning in support of  Violante and to protest the allegations made by Berlusconi.  Five of the nine resigning members belong to the Democratic  Party of the Left, the others are from the Democratic Alliance,  Network, Green and Communist Refoundation parties.</p>

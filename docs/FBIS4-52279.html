			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Pang-hui: "10 Years of Backward </F> Movement Owing to Purge"]    [Text] The U.S. military technological assistance team  [TAT], composed of eight U.S. Army generals and civilians,  visited the ROK in 1985. The advice given by this team  dispatched by the U.S. Defense Department, after touring ROK  domestic defense industries for a few days, was indeed shocking.  The team asserted that the ROK should take its hands off the  defense industry field because it had no competitive power.    The team also noted that the United States could "consider"  lending to the ROK Government part of the funds required to  purchase defense industry facilities and to abolish them. Paek  Yong-hun, president of the Korea Defense Industry Academic  Society, who guided the team's tour on that occasion, said that  the time when this advise was given could be described as a  moment when domestic defense industries were nearly withering  [kosa].    The ROK's defense industry has been fostered in disregard of  economic logic, which was used as the only assessment standard  by the U.S. TAT. The 21 January 1968 incident [North Korean  guerrilla unit's raiding of presidential offices] and the "Nixon  doctrine" in 1969 were the events that boosted the development  of the ROK's defense industry.    Since then, President Pak Chong-hui urged relevant areas to  independently develop weapons for which the ROK had been  entirely dependent upon the United States in the past. For this,  the Agency for Defense Development [ADD] was established in  1970. President Pak Chong-hui and O Won-chol, second senior  presidential secretary for economic affairs, who led the  development of the defense industry, linked the defense industry  development plan with a strategy to develop the heavy chemical  industry. They also extended enormous financial, tax, and real  estate special favors to the defense industry sector.    As soon as President Chon Tu-hwan came to office, however,  the brakes were applied to the policy of strongly pushing for  the development of the defense industry. He did not think highly  of the defense industry's domestic capabilities for research and  development and did not sympathize with such necessity. His  antipathy was clearly expressed through a large-scale dismissal  of ADD members. Members of this organization, which led the  development of domestic weapons at that time, numbered about  3,000. However, 839 were dismissed first, and soon afterward the  number of dismissed members increased to 1,400.    Most of the dismissed researchers were the scientists who  were engaged in the development of missiles, who President Pak  personally led with special interest. President Chon used as a  pretext for the dismissal the fact that the ROK-made missile,  which was developed with over 100 billion won each year, was  merely a reproduction of the U.S. Niky Hercules missile.    The reason for President Chon Tu-hwan's directive to dismiss  the ADD researchers can be summarized into following categories:  First, Kim Chae-ik, senior presidential secretary for economic  affairs, who was called the "economic president" at that time,  exerted great influence on the dismissal. He abolished the  position of second senior presidential secretary for economic  affairs, who was in charge of the heavy chemical industry and  defense industry, and openly criticized the excessive investment  in the defense industry sector. Some people also believe that  President Chon Tu-hwan was paranoid about the status of this  research institute, which directly communicated with President  Pak without going through the military chain of command.    On the other hand, most of the victims of the large-scale  dismissal believed that the United States instigated this  "large- scale purge." They pointed out that when President Pak  was in office, the United States was nervous about and  interfered with the ROK development of nuclear weapons and  guided missiles. A degree- holding researcher who was dismissed  at that time stressed: No matter what the reasons may be, the  large-scale dismissal forced the ROK defense industry technology  to move backward 10 years. No one can deny this.    Since then, the defense industry was treated unkindly  throughout the Fifth Republic. Nevertheless, it was difficult  for our government to fully accept the advise of the U.S. TAT  that the ROK's defense industry should be completely rooted out.  This being the case, a compromise plan was put forward in the  form of ROK-U.S. defense industry cooperation. In other words,  the ROK was to be incorporated with U.S. defense industry firms,  which gained control of the world's defense industry markets, as  one of their sub-contractors, instead of competing with them.</p>

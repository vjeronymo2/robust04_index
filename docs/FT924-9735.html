			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Observer: Clear as Bell Mystery - what mystery? Amateur sleuths' continuing search for the real-life original of Sherlock Holmes is exasperating Observer, especially the latest claim by devotees that the model was American burglar-alarm inventor Edwin Holmes who had a partner called Thomas Watson. The matter was cleared up some 70 years back by the detective's creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said the original was one of his tutors, Scots surgeon Joseph Bell. Here is Doyle's own description, quoted in The Story of 25 Years published by the News Chronicle company in 1935: 'He was a very skilful surgeon, but his strong point was diagnosis, not only of disease, but of occupation and character . . . . In one of his best cases, he said to a civilian patient: Well, my man, you've served in the army? - Aye, sir. Not long discharged? - No, sir. A Highland regiment? - Aye, sir. Non-commissioned officer? - Aye, sir. Stationed at Barbados? - Aye, sir. ''You see, gentlemen,' he would explain, 'the man is a respectful man, but did not remove his hat. They do not in the army, but he would have learned civilian ways had he long been discharged. He has an air of authority and he is obviously Scottish. As to Barbados, his complaint is elephantiasis, which is West Indian and not British.''</p>

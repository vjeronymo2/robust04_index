			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Mellor defends exports to Iraq GOVERNMENT ministers approved the export of machine tools to Iraq which may have been in breach of the government's own publicly declared guidelines, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday. Mr David Mellor, Foreign Office minister from June 1987 to July 1988, said that he had supported the exports after receiving a Foreign Office report which excluded intelligence information warning of the exports' potential military application. He justified the government's decision, taken in early 1988, on the grounds that the export licences referred to contracts entered into before the guidelines were announced to the House of Commons in October 1985. While accepting the intelligence excluded from the report was important, Mr Mellor refused to blame his officials. He said: 'I don't want to shelter behind the notion that I didn't know all that I ought to know when I was making a decision.' He said that the Foreign Office at the time was facing enormous pressures from other government departments to let the exports through mainly for commercial reasons. 'At the Department of Trade and Industry there were a lot of people nipping at the edges (of the guidelines) and there was a minister who didn't believe in them anyway,' Mr Mellor said. Mr Mellor was being questioned about an internal memo sent to him by Mr William Patey, a Foreign Office official who was chairman of the interdepartmental committee responsible for vetting defence exports to Iraq at the time. Mr Patey told the inquiry in June that advice given by civil servants to ministers on the export of machine tools in January 1988 was 'deficient' in that it glossed over the extent to which they might contravene declared policy. The exports were approved after Whitehall had received intelligence that Iraq was building up its arms manufacturing capability after signing contracts with Matrix Churchill and other UK British machine-tool companies. In further evidence to the Scott inquiry yesterday, Mr Mellor said that during nine hours of talks he held with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and his foreign minister Mr Tariq Aziz in Baghdad in February 1988, he had not once raised British concerns about defence exports. He said that the subject of arms sales had not been one 'you messed about' with the Iraqis, as it might have compromised British intelligence sources. Mr Mellor confirmed that he had approved a Whitehall memo in February 1988 naming Jordan as a country 'known or suspected' of diverting military supplies to Iraq or Iran. In written evidence to the inquiry earlier this summer, Mr Mellor said that he could not recall having been made aware of third countries being used as a route for British defence equipment to Iraq. Mr Robin Cook, Labour shadow trade and industry secretary, said last night that as a result of the inquiry 'the heat is being turned on ministers' as they face questioning about the arms-for-Iraq affair. 'The evidence . . . has been swelling with every sitting,' Mr Cook said, releasing a list of 'unanswered questions' for Mr William Waldegrave, Foreign Office minister from July 1988 to November 1990, who gives evidence today.</p>

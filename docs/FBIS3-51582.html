			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from the Miraflores Presidential </F> Palace in Caracas; from "The News" newscast]    [Text] President Ramon J. Velasquez and President-elect  Rafael Caldera, have said there are no plans to control the  exchange rate of the Venezuelan currency. The two appealed for  calm and for preventing a flight of foreign exchange because  this would not help the situation, on the contrary, it would  worsen it. They insisted that common sense will determine the  dollar exchange rate.    The two agreed that the measures announced last night by  President Velasquez will be maintained and there will be  continuity. President-elect Rafael Caldera has reiterated his  support for the announcements made by President Velasquez.    [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Banking policies will be  conserved, first because they are the product of lengthy  analyses in which bank authorities and bankers have  participated; they are the product of experience; and they are  the result of the banking sector's decision to respond  positively to the Venezuelan situation.    [Calderas] The measures that have been announced have my  support and that of all Venezuelans because the financial  situation is important for all of us. In that declaration there  are very important points. It not only lists the current  government's commitments that will be inherited by the  government over which I will preside, but also lists the banking  sector's commitment making it obligatory for the presidents of  the country's largest banks to maintain a healthy financial  system and a system deserving of the Venezuelan people's trust.  [end recording]    The president-elect reported his government's firm decision  to back judicial rulings because although he has nothing against  anybody, he believes the country wants the implementation of  severe measures to prevent a repeat of past events.    The Banco Latino intervention board was sworn in this  afternoon at the Presidential Palace. Finance Minister Carlos  Silva introduced to the media the three members of the board  noting that the three have much banking experience.    [Begin recording] [Silva] We trust they will objectively  evaluate that bank and adopt the necessary measures.    [Board President Jose Santo Domingo] Regarding our future  plans [words indistinct].    [Unidentified reporter] The scheduled 28 January reopening  of  the bank could be modified now that you have been sworn in as  bank interveners?    [Santo Domingo] I think that date will stay. Yes. The  Deposit Guarantee Fund will supply funds necessary to pay  accounts having a balance under 100,000 bolivares. [end  recording]</p>

The election of this option does not affect the performance requirements specified in S5.6(a) which apply with single leakage-type failures other than failures in a common diaphragm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At the option of the manufacturer, the trailer portion of any agricultural commodity trailer, heavy hauler trailer, or pulpwood trailer may meet the requirements of &sect;393.43 of this title instead of the requirements of S5.6(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=3 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S5.6.7&blank;Maximum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure/Equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the case of vehicles for which the option in S5.6(b) has been elected, determine the maximum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) according to the procedures set forth in S5.6.7.1 through S5.6.7.2.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S5.6.7.1&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trucks and buses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S5.6.7.1.1&blank;According to the following procedure, determine the threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking brakes become unreleasable. With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm). Apply the parking brakes by making an application actuation of the parking brake control. Reduce the pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero, turn on the engine and allow it to idle, and allow the pressures in the vehicle's reservoirs to rise until they stabilize or until the compressor shut-off point is reached. At that time, make a release actuation of the parking brake control, and determine whether all of the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking retardation force to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this procedure with progressively decreasing or increasing levels (whichever is applicable) of leakage-type diaphragm failures or equivalent leakages, to determine the minimum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which all of the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking retardation forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S5.6.7.1.2&blank;At the level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) determined in S5.6.7.1.1, and using the following procedure, determine the threshold maximum reservoir rate (in psi per minute). With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, make an application actuation of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that parking brake application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S5.6.7.1.3&blank;Using the following procedure, introduce a leakage-type failure of the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) that results in a maximum reservoir leakage rate that is three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate determined in S5.6.7.1.2. With an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, make an application actuation of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that parking brake application. The level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) associated with this reservoir leakage rate is the level that is to be used under the option set forth in S5.6(b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

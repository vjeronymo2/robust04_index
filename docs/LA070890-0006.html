			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGALIZING STREET VENDORS: MOVE TO AVOID  </P> <P> Iwould like to comment on "Vendors vs. the Law" (June 27).  </P> <P> I was born and raised in Venezuela where street vendors, although illegal, are  as thick as flies and just as annoying.  </P> <P> In business districts, they take up most of the sidewalk, creating hazards for  the pedestrians and large amounts of trash that wind up on the street. The  vendors are unfair competition for merchants since they do not have to pay rent  or taxes and have no upkeep. Peeled fruit and most foods tend to develop nasty  bacteria that can make unsuspecting customers extremely ill.  </P> <P> If vending were legalized as LAPD Chief Daryl Gates longs for, we would have  uncontrolled vendors all over the city and another incompetent government  agency that will be overworked and understaffed. Councilman Michael Woo should  take a little trip down to Latin America and experience vendors personally  before creating another government monster. Believe me, they are not something  we would like to add to our way of life in this city.  </P> <P> MERCEDES WEIL  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Glimmer of northern light on Tyne - Vanessa Houlder on regenerating Newcastle's inner city Clinging to the steep slopes of the river bank, just downstream from the Tyne Bridge in north-east England, is Newcastle's most spectacular development site. In spite of the grandeur of the setting, the East Quayside area exudes a melancholy air of neglect. After decades of decline, the river banks are today home to dilapidated warehouses and ballast heaps. But East Quayside has now received a potential shot in the arm. Last week, AMEC, a construction, engineering and development group, signed an agreement to build 123,500 sq ft of offices on the western edge of the site. This is the first phase of a Pounds 180m scheme which could lead to the construction of 200 flats and houses, a five-star hotel, 324,000 sq ft of offices and 135,000 sq ft of shopping on the 25-acre site over the next 10 years. The development has attracted its fair share of criticism and praise. Local politicians say the master-plan is misdirected in terms of the overall regeneration of the area, while the Royal Fine Arts Commission has described the scheme as 'an examplar for other city regeneration schemes'. The signing of the deal last week, in a restored sailors' chapel on the site, was described as an 'historical moment' by Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Development Corporation (TWDC). Mr John Redwood, UK minister for inner cities, said of the scheme: 'A vision of the future . . . taking Tyneside into the next millennium.' Besides dwelling on the scheme's development potential, Mr Redwood also acknowledged that the project must have a social dimension. 'It must work for the community as well. There must be jobs and training for people who live nearby.' Mr Redwood's comment touched upon an issue which is dominating the national debate about urban regeneration: namely how to ensure the social as well as physical regeneration of an inner city area. The problem was summed up by the House of Commons employment committee in 1988. 'Urban development corporations cannot be regarded as a success if buildings and land are regenerated but the local community is passed by and does not benefit from regeneration.' The government's opponents believe that its urban regeneration strategy has failed that test. 'The problem has been that the policy is entirely based on property development rather than investment in the residents of the areas concerned or in creating businesses,' says Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman. Since 1987 urban development corporations have spent Pounds 2bn throughout the UK on what critics describe as 'worthless flagship projects' that have done nothing to regenerate the country's manufacturing base. There is also little evidence, they add, to support the idea that the wealth created by bringing offices or tourism to a run-down area 'trickles down' to local communities. Newcastle provides a vivid illustration of the challenge facing those concerned with the problem of urban regeneration in the UK. Indeed the need to improve the lot of the residents of run-down areas was underlined by the riots last September in the west end of Newcastle and the Meadow Well estate in North Shields. Many of TWDC's development sites are surrounded by some of the most deprived housing sites in Newcastle - a fact which graphically reminds the corporation of its social responsibilities. The TWDC has had some success in creating manufacturing jobs. At the Royal Quays, a large development site in north Tyneside, Twinings, a tea packaging company, has put up a 90,000 sq ft plant, which will employ 270 people when it opens in the summer. But elsewhere, some of the projects undertaken by the TWDC provide little suitable work for the local workforce. Historically, a third of Tyneside's workforce has been employed in the coal, steel or shipbuilding industries. The manual skills associated with these industries do not transfer well to service industries. The difficulty for the corporation is that it is easier to attract office users than industry to inner cities. In the absence of new manufacturing employers, the work of the TWDC therefore risks underlining the divisions between the haves and have-nots. St Peter's Basin, a marina project developed built by Barratt at a cost of Pounds 27m with an Pounds 11m contribution from the TWDC, is a case in point. The corporation argues that this development, on an old industrial site, helped change the image of the river-side. However, St Peter's Basin has been described by locals as an anomalous enclave of prosperity sitting in the shadow of one of Newcastle's roughest estates. Consider also the case of Newcastle Business Park, which is situated on a landscaped development built on the former Vickers armaments factory site on the bank of the Tyne. The TWDC sees the park as an 'outstanding success' having let 95 per cent of its space in 18 months. Yet the park is still a short distance away from a housing estate where unemployment is rife and which has secured little in the way of new jobs as a result of the park. The corporation realises that something has to be done for local communities. And it has acted. It is helping to fund social housing to provide more than 600 homes. It also gives grant aid for community schemes and provides funding to retrain people formerly employed in the shipping and coal industries. However, as the TWDC's Mr Balls says, the increasing emphasis on the social dimension of urban regeneration should not distract from the need for investment and jobs. Empowerment of local communities, he says, has little meaning without the prospect of jobs. This view is shared by North Tyneside council. It has put in a bid to win a share of the Pounds 750m available under the government's City Challenge urban regeneration scheme to rebuild the Community Centre on the Meadowell estate and install infrastructure on an adjacent industrial estate. According to Mr John Foster of North Tyneside Council, the two elements - social and employment - must be combined. 'Our view is that one without the other has been tried without success since the 1970s,' he says. The lesson of urban regeneration in the 1980s is that merely attracting private investment to inner cities is not enough, if it does not create the right type of jobs. In spite of the partial success of the 1980s in transforming inner cities, urban regeneration is likely to remain as big a problem in the decade ahead as it was in the decade past.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           RENTAL GROWTH (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to May 92          -1.2    -12.3       -3.6           -6.1 Quarter to May 92       -0.5     -3.9       -1.8           -2.0 Month of May  92        -0.1     -1.0       -0.7           -0.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investment Property Databank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

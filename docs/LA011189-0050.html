			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA REMAINS UNBEATEN  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara, still waiting to shake the distinction of being the nation's  only undefeated but unranked team, pulled away from Cal State Fullerton in the  second half for a 69-59 Big West Conference victory Tuesday night before a  sellout crowd of 6,000 in the Events Center.  </P> <P> The Gauchos fell behind by as many as 6 points in the first half, and held only  a 32-29 halftime lead, but they put the Titans away behind Eric McArthur's 15  second-half points. McArthur, a 6-foot 6-inch forward, finished with a  career-high 25 points, and had 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> The victory was Santa Barbara's 11th without a loss this season, setting a  school record for consecutive victories.  </P> <P> The 11-0 mark is easily Santa Barbara's best start, surpassing last season's  7-0 start.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara is one of 4 undefeated Division I teams in the country. The  others are No. 1 Duke, No. 2 Illinois and No. 20 Providence.  </P> <P> Fullerton had its sixth straight loss, falling to 5-7, 0-3 in the Big West  Conference.  </P> <P> Fullerton took a 22-16 lead in the first half, using an aggressive match-up  zone defense that helped cause several Santa Barbara turnovers.  </P> <P> But Santa Barbara took over the lead on a 3-point shot by Carrick DeHart (21  points) that put the Gauchos ahead, 23-22, with about 7 minutes left in the  half.  </P> <P> Fullerton retied the score and then went ahead by 3 again. But a 7-1 run by the  Gauchos gave them the 3-point halftime lead.  </P> <P> Fullerton went cold at the start of the second half. Cedric Ceballos, who had  dispelled talk of a slump by scoring 14 points in the first half without  missing a shot, missed a layup at the outset. Ceballos finished with 18 points,  and for the Titans, it only got worse.  </P> <P> The Titans didn't score in the second half until more than 4 minutes had  passed, finally making a basket after Santa Barbara had scored the first 8  points. Fullerton fell behind by as many as 14 but cut the lead to 6 with 2:47  left.  </P> <P> But the Titans never got any closer as Santa Barbara made 5 of 6 free throws  down the stretch.  </P> <P> "I'm very proud of our guys," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "I think they  probably played about as well as anyone has played Santa Barbara the first 20  minutes. I thought for 30 minutes we played pretty good basketball.  </P> <P> "(The Titans) haven't surrendered by any means. They're still playing every  night even though we've lost this many games early. I'm proud of that."  </P></p>

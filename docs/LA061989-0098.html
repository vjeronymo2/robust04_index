			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOCAL GAS, KERN-MOJAVE SETTLE DISPUTE  </P> <P> The sponsors of two interstate pipeline companies and Southern California Gas  Co., the nation's largest gas utility, today said they have settled a four-year  regulatory dispute, apparently clearing the way for two natural gas pipelines  into Southern California.  </P> <P> The agreement between Kern River Gas Transmission Co., Mojave Pipeline Co., and  Southern California Gas Co. must still be approved by the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, the companies said.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, both Kern River and Mojave would build and operate  pipelines into California to a point in the desert near Barstow, where the  pipelines would merge.  </P> <P> From there, both systems would continue in a single, jointly owned pipeline to  the oil fields of Kern County. There the gas would be burned to produce steam,  to be used in bringing tar-like oil to the surface.  </P> <P> As a result of the settlement, SoCal Gas, Kern River and Mojave would continue  to compete for customers. The companies must first, however, persuade federal  regulators that sufficient competition remains.  </P> <P> The new pipelines had been opposed by California regulators, SoCal Gas and  consumer groups on the basis that they would bypass existing utilities, leaving  customers unserved by the pipeline with a heavier burden.  </P></p>

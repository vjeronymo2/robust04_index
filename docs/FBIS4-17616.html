			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Chinese `Commuters' Find It </F> Difficult To Obtain Russian Visa"]    [Text] Beijing -- The volume of Russian-Chinese trade has  started to fall off in recent months. In the opinion of Wang  Zongzhang, vice governor of Heilongjiang Province, which borders  Russia, restrictions on the entry of Chinese businessmen  introduced at the end of February 1994 are the cause of this  reduction in trade turnover.    Whereas previously Chinese citizens could, after paying a  small sum to the state, acquire official so-called  general-purpose passports and cross the Russian border without  hindrance, a new agreement whereby they are required to have  visas has now come into effect.    The former liberal system of registration afforded not just  entrepreneurs but also small-time speculators and criminals the  opportunity to get into Russia and stay there for an indefinite  period. Now the invitations on which people come to our country  from the PRC are carefully checked.    The falloff in trade is the other side of the coin.  Russian-Chinese trade exchange has relied to a significant  extent hitherto not on major firms but on "pedlars," who bring  all their goods with them. As soon as the number of such  traders declined, the volume of trade dropped.    A Russian expert, in private conversation with me, said that  this might be not so bad. Too much of what was brought here was  plain junk. In his opinion, the situation could change for the  better thanks to the fact that Russia and China have agreed to  certify goods according to standards accepted in Russia.    These duties will be assumed on the Chinese side by the  Industrial Inspection Service for Import-Export Goods. Liu  Baoyi, deputy general director of the inspection service, says  that the arrangements whereby Chinese foodstuffs, electronics,  and machines, items on which people's health and safety directly  depend, receive an expert quality certificate will be introduced  before this year is out. Quality control will gradually be  applied to other goods.</p>

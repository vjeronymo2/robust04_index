			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Private pensions SHOULD Britain's state pensions be privatised? If Mr Frank Field, the back-bench Labour MP, did not already know how sensitive raising this topic would be, he found out at the weekend. The Labour leadership immediately dismissed him as a maverick for proposing radical reforms. Even Mr Peter Lilley, the Conservative social security secretary, has not dared to question the state pension openly in his current review of the welfare state, though he did welcome Mr Field's contribution to the debate. Mr Field is to be congratulated for airing the issue for three reasons. First, the state pension is already below the poverty line and will become increasingly inadequate as a basis for retirement since it is increased in line with inflation rather than earnings. Second, the growth of occupational pensions and other forms of savings means it is no longer necessary for the state to provide pensions for all to combat poverty in old age. Third, providing state pensions to all in the long run is probably unsustainable. The current cost of over Pounds 30bn a year will rise inexorably as the population ages. Although this demographic time-bomb will not explode until early next century, that is no excuse for putting off decisions. Since pensions schemes cannot be reformed quickly, the sooner politicians debate alternatives the better. Any reform would, of course, face serious hurdles. The biggest would be to find ways to encourage people to take out private pensions while at the same time protecting those who were too poor to save for their old age. Mr Field's solution is to make private provision compulsory and for the government to contribute to the private pensions of those not in work. Another solution could be to bribe people to opt-out of the state scheme by reducing their National Insurance Contributions - the approach taken by the government when it decided to phase-out the state earnings related pensions scheme in the mid-1980s. The main drawback with both approaches is that they could cost the exchequer large sums of money in the short-run, with the full savings accruing only after several decades. A cheaper option would to announce that the state pension would gradually wither on the vine. Such an approach would rely on people receiving a sufficient motivation to save for their pensions from the generous tax-reliefs that are available. Those who still did not save enough for a minimum retirement income would be protected by a means-tested safety net. There may be other, more attractive alternatives. But they will not be devised and get the public hearing they need unless there is a full and open debate on the subject. That debate should not be left to a few brave souls like Mr Field. Front-bench politicians must join in.</p>

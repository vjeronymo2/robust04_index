			<p>BFN     [Text] Varadero is an ideal locale for tourism, but as a  Cuban municipality, it is also involved in defense. A Cuban  Revolutionary Navy [MGR] exercise was successfully held in this  Matanzas Province municipality with the participation of tourism  marina workers, who were grouped into special navy units. In  peacetime, these units work to detect oil spills, illegal  departures and landings, and drug trafficing, among other tasks.  In wartime, they undertake specific tasks in support of regular  MGR units and Border Guard troops, in close cooperation with  ground and air troops.    The workers of the Aqua, Chapelin, and Gaviota marinas  demonstrated the adroitness and readiness attained during  different times of the exercise, which included a tactical  scouting demonstration, the use of the Navy's firing range, and  intercepting a target. Resources built with scarce materials and  a lot of initiative were also presented. These resources help to  increase the protection of Cuban shores against a possible enemy  attack. Specialists from the five provinces comprising the  Central Army were in attendance.    Varadero hopes to become the first municipality in Matanzas  Province to attain the status of ready for defense in the second  phase.</p>

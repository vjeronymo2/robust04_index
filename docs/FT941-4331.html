			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TI Group disappoints City with 43% rise TI Group, the specialist engineering group, yesterday reported a 43 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 125.2m following strong growth in its core businesses and a full year's contribution from Dowty, its enlarged aerospace subsidiary. Shares in the group, however, fell 25p to 409p after the pre-tax figure failed to meet market expectations of up to Pounds 130m. Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive, said profits had been held back by sharply increased redundancy costs of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 1.9m), due mainly to a 25 per cent cut in the Dowty workforce to 4,200. The gain was also dented by a Pounds 9m increase in interest charges to Pounds 13.1m following TI Group's assumption of Dowty's debts and unfavourable currency conversions on the group's US borrowings. At the operating level, however, profits outstripped market expectations - increasing 25 per cent to Pounds 138.6m (Pounds 111.3m). The improvement was underpinned by a 16 per cent increase in profits at John Crane - the seals and polymer division - which defied weak demand in its key markets with a gain to Pounds 61.6m (Pounds 53.1m). Sir Christopher also hailed a Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 39.4m) contribution from Bundy, the specialist tubes and engineering business, which managed to offset the downturn in the European motor components business by making its first deliveries to manufacturers such as Honda, Toyota and Mazda in Japan. Dowty, meanwhile, benefited from a major restructuring to report full-year profits of Pounds 25.8m, against a six month contribution of Pounds 14.6m in 1992. Mr Tony Edwards, the division's chief executive, said the group had reduced working capital levels and had enjoyed improved demand since. Together the divisions pushed group turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.15bn). Earnings came out at 18.1p (15.4p), although headline earnings fell to 18.1p (18.3p). A final dividend of 7.4p makes an 11.25p (10.7p) total. COMMENT Almost 5m TI Group shares were traded yesterday and the price showed the sharpest fall on the FT-SE 100 after the company announced yet another asset reshuffle. The polymer business has been transferred from Dowty to John Crane, the specialised engineering companies have been spun off into Bundy and Dowty has inherited the rings and machining operation. Some analysts complained that trading comparisons were no longer possible and wondered why TI Group's figures appeared so foggy. Yet they admit the underlying business has performed well in extremely difficult markets, and profits have risen sharply at a time when competitors have reported flat or falling returns. Profits of up to Pounds 140m are expected next year which, on a forward multiple of 20.8, makes TI Group a solid if costly buy.</p>

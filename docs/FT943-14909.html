			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigerian supply worries fuel rally in oil prices Oil prices rallied yesterday amid fears of possible supply disruptions from Nigeria, where a strike by oil workers is set to intensify this week. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for September rose by about 30 cents, to around Dollars 17.35 a barrel, in late London trading. Concern over Nigerian supplies, much of which are destined for the US, caused the spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, to rise above Dollars 20 a barrel in New York trading. The rise was attributed to fears that a strike by Nigerian oil workers, which has so far had little impact on exports, could lead to supply disruptions if senior employees joined in. Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at London brokers Kleinwort Benson, said recurrent market fears of cutbacks from politically unstable oil producers have so far not been realised. But they were 'symptomatic of the market turning toward a bull phase', he said. Earlier there was little market reaction to a report that production by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in June was more than 500,000 barrels a day above its output ceiling of 24.52m b/d. The Middle East Economic Survey said that a number of Opec members, including Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria and Iraq, were producing above their quotas. Iran yesterday said it was producing at its Opec quota of 3.6m b/d. But Mees said quota violations by Iran and the others pushed Opec production in June to 25.02m b/d. Production discipline among Opec producers during a period of rising demand has a factor in the recent rally in oil prices from lows of around Dollars 13 a barrel last February. Analysts say any sign of serious cheating could undermine prices. But many think it unlikely that past offenders such as Iran and Nigeria would be able to sustain higher output because they are operating close to capacity.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Defendant in Bank of Crete trial dies GREECE'S former deputy prime minister, Mr Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, a defendant in the Bank of Crete embezzlement trial, died in hospital yesterday, eight days after suffering a stroke while questioning a witness. Mr Koutsogiorgas, who was 69, was accused of accepting a Dollars 2m bribe from the bank's owner in 1988 in return for introducing legislation on bank secrecy aimed at blocking a central bank investigation. The trial, adjourned after Mr Koutsogiorgas' dramatic collapse in the courtroom, can now continue. But without his testimony, it appears increasingly unlikely that Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former prime minister, could be convicted. Mr Papandreou is also charged with taking bribes in the Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal, which helped bring down his Socialist government, but refuses to appear in court. Mr Koutsogiorgas was Mr Papandreou's family lawyer and his closest political associate during eight years in office. He served in a number of ministries during the years of Socialist government from 1981 to 1989 and had been expected to come up with damaging revelations about corruption during that period. He did not run for office in the June 1989 election after accusations concerning his role in the bank scandal. The court hearings will now focus on two other ex-cabinet ministers accused of involvement in the Bank of Crete scandal, but their political significance will be considerably diminished.

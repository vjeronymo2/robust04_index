[passage omitted]    The Geography Department of the University of Oulu has  refined its [demographic] grid system and is now capable of, for  example, showing how Finland has been depopulated over the past  20 years.  <H5>  18,000 in One Square Km in Kallio </H5>   "Rural areas were deserted at a frantic pace in the 1970's  when the migration from country to town was at its peak. In the  1980's this migration slowed down. At the same time, on the  other hand, people were moving from the central areas of the big  cities to communities near rural areas," Professor Arvo  Naukkarinen pointed out. [passage omitted]    As concerns rural Finland, no more than 12 people per square  kilometer live in the occupied squares of the grid. "A fifth of  the inhabited area of the countryside is threatened with  depopulation since no one under age 15 lives there any more,"  Assistant Professor Jarmo Rusanen fears.    People often think that only development areas, in eastern  and northern Finland, become depopulated. Researchers point out  that rural areas have been vacated throughout all of central  Finland. Yla-Savo and the lake country of Finland, especially  Mikkeli Province, have lost a lot of people.    Accurate information has surprisingly revealed that rapidly  depleting rural areas are also found in southern Finland, in the  Loimaa district, and in eastern Uusimaa.  <H5>  Privacy Protected </H5>   When one pokes at a base map with a sharpened pencil point  and with one's eyes closed, one obtains accurate information.    If there are only a few inhabitants in a grid square, the  information on them is not given to outsiders. "People's privacy  is carefully protected," Asst. Prof. Jarmo Rusanen emphasized.  <H5>  Cows or Nothing, Wheat or Nothing </H5>   "The reason for the decrease in population in Loimaa and  Yla-Savo may be the fact that both areas gambled on a single  strength. Loimaa is Finland's grain center, while Yla-Savo is  Finland's milk center. The specialized farms are mechanized --  that eliminated jobs," director Reijo Keranen of the Yla-Savo  Institute surmised.    Nearly one out of every three jobs is in agriculture, that  is, according to Naukkarinen, the situation is the same as it  was in the 1960's throughout the country.    "The usual structural change has not occurred. Sidelines  like  farm tourism, berry cultivation, or farm equipment contracts  have not been produced at the same rate as elsewhere."    Neither area has been able to industrialize or develop  services either.    "Young people's alternatives have been cows or nothing in  Yla-Savo and wheat or nothing in the Loimaa district."  <H5>  One Can See Far Off in Finland's Grain Center, Like a Prairie </H5>   Loimaa -- The heart of Finland's grain region, the Loimaa  district, is like a prairie. Level expanses of fields stretch  out in clear weather almost as far as the eye can see.    "From a suitable vantage point, you can see for 7 km,"  farmer  Jorma Maki-Punto, 57, of the town of Loimaa said. He is the 10th  owner of his family's farm located on the banks of the Loimi  River.    Maki-Punto specializes in seed grain. He intends to plant 60  hectares with it next spring. For additional income, he has two  summer cottages "that keep me pretty busy."    The loose, porous fields of the clayey region customarily  produce wheat, barley, and rye. Over the past few years  compulsorily fallowed fields, which the eyes of the farmers at  least are not used to, have increased. To them fallowing seems  disagreeable and untidy.    The houses of the district are on average in prosperous  circumstances, in the middle of and framed by the yard, erect,  and well tended. People live in them too. The eye rarely falls  on an iced-up window.    So far, the changes appear to be only a worsening of public  services. Village stores, post offices, and banks are closed.  The distances children have to be transported to get to schools  have become longer.    The farm sector is waiting. Farms are neither being bought  nor sold. The price of an arable hectare has dropped to a third  of the 60,000 markkas it was a few years back.    Farmers are not investing in new equipment or buildings. "We  farmers have our hackles up. We won't join the EU [European  Union] under these terms but, luckily for us, we have our own  advisers who know how we think."</p>

With full awareness, I accept  this responsibility that the president has entrusted upon me in  the full exercise of his powers. According to our juridical  system, the president is the only person who may grant such a  responsibility.    Due to the seriousness of the action, everyone is aware of  the importance of the task ahead. In order to comply with this  delicate mission, I will act with an open mind, in a firm and  serene manner. I will respond to those who have appointed me so  that the law will be the main protection of society and the main  instrument of justice.    As you will recall on the afternoon that the president  announced his decision, he explained he was doing this at the  specific request of Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio [Luis  Donaldo Colosio's widow], among other reasons. In fact, Mrs.  Riojas de Colosio called me directly and honored me with her  confidence. I am aware of the magnitude of the investigation  that has been entrusted to me. My public commitment is with the  truth. My method of work will strictly adhere to the juridical  norms and the scientific techniques of an investigation that  will lead us to solve a murder.    I am calling on the most distinguished Mexicans from the  various areas that will be required for this task. I have  designed a strict method of selection that will be applied  indiscriminately to all those who will form part of the  investigating team. I am demanding they present their resumes  in order to analyze them. In the absence of even one  requirement from those we feel are indispensable, they will be  excluded. This method includes everyone, from the directors  general to -- and with much more reason -- to the administrative  staff, and -- of course -- the technical staff. In due time, we  will announce the resumes of the team members who form part of  this Office of the Deputy Attorney General.    The action of justice which allowed the immediate arrest of  the perpetrator of the homicide as well as the profuse  testimonies and other sources of information relevant to this  case, make it possible for me to begin my work with an important  database. As for the investigative matters, we are absolutely  autonomous. The investigation process is the exclusive  responsibility of this Office of the Deputy Attorney General,  with no other limits but those established by the law. All  investigations of this type have their own dynamics and strict  logic.    I share the widespread concern for this to be carried out  as soon as possible. I will seek through means established by  law, new useful information. I ask anyone who has any  information that can contribute to clearing up this event to  make it known to me. I accept the people's demand to speed up  these investigations, however, the very nature of the  investigation determines that it not be subjected to a fixed  timetable.    Neither in Mexico, nor anywhere in the world, should  deadlines be set to conclude an investigation. It will last  however long is necessary; we will strive for it to be brief.  We will investigate and analyze all the possible hypotheses,  even the smallest. We will try to report on the progress  because we know that the Mexican people are waiting for this.  An important part of this public responsibility's success  depends on the fact that anticipated conclusions or versions are  not generated without foundations. I know how to remain calm.  My tool is my attachment to the truth and the law. We must be  very careful not to distort the investigation's goal. I will  also ask everyone to be calm and objective in the handling of  this case, which has significant consequences for the nation.    The investigation cannot be subjected to foreign pressures,  only to its logical and natural development. Every clue  followed up, every witness' deposition, every piece of  information received, can open multiple roads to follow. On  several occasions, information has been made public that has led  to inaccurate or mistaken conclusions. I will request from the  media their support and responsibility so that the conclusions  reached on the event be duly founded on the event. I am certain  the media will responsibly report corroborated facts. To help  them report, we will of course design a method so that  periodically and officially they receive news on the work being  carried out. We will never give out information that can hamper  the ongoing investigation. Nevertheless, we will always make  public whatever we have fully corroborated and which, I insist,  will not hamper the ongoing investigation, or the honor, or  reputation of innocent parties.    I feel the first moral duty is not to contribute to  uncertainty with reports lacking precision that only foster an  environment contrary to the spirit of truth and justice. This  spirit is the superior demand undoubtedly expressed by all  Mexicans at this time.    As of tomorrow I will be in Tijuana to personally take over  this task the majority of leads and data to be substantiated are  located there. I will conduct the investigation to the end with  responsibility and without prejudice. Mexican society demands  that this crime not remain unpunished. Mexican society will  have the truth on the incident. I will establish responsible  coordination and cooperation with the Baja California  authorities. I will remain totally open to any cooperation; I  reiterate, from the public and the media. I stress that the  very sensitive nature of the case forces all of us to act  responsibly and ethically.    I understand I am assuming an immense commitment to the  nation; I will contribute with all my capacity. I conclude by  saying once again that my commitment is only with the truth, so  that out of the truth and only from the truth can justice be  made. Thank you very much.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN IDENTITY CRISIS INSIDE SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger was interviewed late last month by  writer Marc Ullmann of Paris Match. These are excerpts from that session:  </P> <P>  Ullmann: Can the transformation of communism occur peacefully and can the  Soviet national state be kept together in more or less historic national  boundaries?  </P> <P> Kissinger: That is the big question, more important than arms control and many  other issues of day-to-day diplomacy. The second big question is whether you go  from a centrally planned economy to a market economy without the turmoil that  threatens political cohesion.  </P> <P> I don't think anybody knows whether the Soviet nationalism problem is  manageable. The Russian empire never found a way of governing except by Russian  domination of the non-Russian population. The difference between the Russian  empire and the European empire is that the Russian empire is contiguous to the  Russian population. My instinct is that if it begins to look as if the historic  Russian empire is disintegrating, there will be an assertion of state  authority, by the army , the party -- or a combination of both. I do not  believe they will let it disintegrate without fighting.  </P> <P> Q: Would the Ukraine be a more severe test than the Muslim regions?  </P> <P> A: The Muslim populations are the most immediate test, but Soviet leaders may  still believe that they can balance domination of the Muslim populations with  local autonomy -- and maybe they can. They may be prepared to make major  experiments in Muslim areas but will not make the same experiments in the  Ukraine.  </P> <P> In the Baltic republics they are willing to take chances because the Baltic  peoples are culturally and historically different from the Russian people;  theoretically the Soviets can experiment with market conditions there without  risking large migrations of Russians to share in any good economic results. But  that depends on whether the Baltic countries are satisfied with autonomy and a  higher standard of living, or whether they will want total independence. That  is where I suspect the Soviet Union would draw the line.  </P> <P> Q: There are all sorts of experiments in Poland and Hungary; what are the  limits the Soviet Union can accept there?  </P> <P> A: The potential crisis in European diplomacy is in managing the evolution of  the East European countries. My instinct is that if these countries should try  to leave the Warsaw Pact, that would mean an end to Soviet patience.  </P> <P> One can make a case that if the Soviet Union identifies its security with  communist governments in Eastern Europe, then it assumes a permanent position  of policeman, subject to crises it does not control. The Soviets would risk all  their public-opinion achievements in Western Europe if they were driven -- or  even tempted -- into repression.  </P> <P> Ideally, the East Bloc countries should be free to leave the Warsaw Pact. I  suspect that the best way to approach this is in stages, to say that as part of  existing arms-control negotiations the Soviets have to withdraw from  Czechoslovakia and from Hungary but may keep certain forces in East Germany and  Poland if they commit to evolution toward pluralistic forms that leave those  countries free to determine their political future.  </P> <P> That still leaves the problem of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).  In Poland and Hungary it is possible to identify security with national  independence toward East and West. The German Democratic Republic could not  survive as a state once the Communist Party accepts minority status.  </P> <P> The West European countries have an interest in peaceful evolution within a  European context and not a German national context; in a German national  context it is less likely to be peaceful.  </P> <P> Napoleon once said, "If you want to take Vienna, take Vienna." It follows that  if you want to conduct foreign policy, conduct foreign policy. So we have to  solve our foreign policy problems with the Soviet Union. It is naive to believe  that by intervening, benevolently or not, in Soviet internal affairs we can  affect foreign policy. Not even the Soviets understand what they are starting.  </P> <P> The future can go in one of two directions. The Soviet Union will disintegrate  or it will become very strong by succeeding with its economic reforms. If the  Soviet Union disintegrates, which is not in our interest in my view, there will  be unforeseeable international consequences.  </P> <P> If perestroika succeeds, it is naive to think the issues that could not be  settled when the Soviets were weak can be settled when the Soviets are strong.  Therefore the basic problem has not changed. The question is whether the  smaller states on the Soviet periphery can live in equilibrium with that  colossus of an empire embracing 11 time zones. That problem has never been  settled. It needs to be settled now.  </P> <P> Q: Do you see a possibility of a backlash against Mikhail S. Gorbachev reforms  -- would he lead such a backlash himself?  </P> <P> A: Either could happen. He could try to lead the backlash, and given the  powerful position he has developed, it's not out of the question. Or they could  get rid of him. I like him better than any other Soviet leader I have met, but  I would be careful not to tie Western policy to one Soviet leader.  </P> <P> I believe that should Gorbachev die or be replaced, the next Soviet leader  would face the same necessities. He might not operate with the same  psychological skill, but if he were realistic he would have to act in the same  manner.  </P></p>

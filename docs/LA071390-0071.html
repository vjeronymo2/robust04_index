The sloop tried to enter shallow waters and  the patrol boat pursued, catching up to the vessel and taking it under tow,  according to the statement. During the tow back to Staniel Cay, the sloop  capsized.  </P> <P> One Haitian radio station reported that the towline broke, and another said  that panicked Haitians ran to one side of the vessel when Bahamian soldiers  boarded it.  </P> <P> The bodies of the 30 men and nine women were buried Wednesday at Bitter Guana  Cay in the Exumas, about 80 miles from Nassau, the statement said.  </P> <P> The surviving Haitians were brought to Nassau on Wednesday.  </P></p>

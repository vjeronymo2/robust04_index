			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the general heading "Accord </F> Treaty Is Open Book": "Political Passions Should Be Brought  Under Control"]    [Text] "The document on civil accord is not an argument  against any protest actions or events, it is a vital necessity,"  Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian Federation president's press  secretary, stated. "Events show what an excited state Russia's  political circles are in at present. The Civil Accord Treaty  [Dogovor o Grazhdanskom Soglasii] will help to bring political  passions in our country under control."    The situation which developed in the State Duma 27 April in  connection with the murder of a deputy, and the nervousness and  political hullabaloo which reigned in the Duma, is further  evidence of how much civil accord is essential to us all, he  emphasized.</p>

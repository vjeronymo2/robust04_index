			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / China applauds the past as it looks to life without Deng: Beijing celebrates 45 years of communism, while the health of its most radical economic reformer is failing fast China today celebrates the 45th anniversary of the Communist revolution in the shadow of the deteriorating health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader, and burdened by worries over rising prices. But the country's top officials are seeking to ensure these concerns do not spoil the anniversary celebrations that are being conducted with an intensity that seems out of proportion to the occasion. Among planned displays are mass choral concerts in which thousands of voices will be raised in patriotic songs of a bygone era. China's rulers, it seems, are delving into the past to validate the present. Preparations have been under way for months and were given a political focus by this week's meeting of the 320-member Central Committee, which approved a blueprint for revitalising party institutions. The document, with the numbing title of 'The resolution on strengthening grassroots party organisation', was hardly the most self-confident declaration by the world's largest mass political organisation. Its emphasis on bolstering party institutions in this uncertain transitional phase from one generation of leaders to the next, revealed deep-seated concerns about the future at a time when the communist party's prestige is at a low ebb. But for today at least, China's leaders will be at pains to deflect attention from the shortcomings of the ruling party and personal hardship, to the mass celebrations in Beijing. China's attention will focus, as it has so often in the past, on Tiananmen Square, where 100,000 people from across the country will participate in 'flag waving' events to mark the anniversary. Official propaganda has sought, in the build-up to national day, to remind people of their increasing prosperity and to link this with Mr Deng's legacy. A campaign to lionise China's ailing senior leader has moved into higher gear. In Beijing, a photographic exhibition of Mr Deng's life has been mounted at the Museum of Revolutionary History on Tiananmen Square; laser discs of his speeches are being marketed; and news commentaries have been trumpeting his contribution to the revolution. Praise for Mr Deng's theory of 'building socialism with Chinese characteristics', a phrase that means almost anything goes, is the slogan of the moment. Party documents make scant mention of ideology these days beyond pro-forma references to the party's Marxist underpinnings. Mr Deng's dire warnings that China would be 'ripped asunder' unless it adhered to the 'four cardinal principles' now appear a faint echo of the past. China, he had said, should resolutely adhere to the socialist road, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the party, and Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong thought. Emphasis given to Mr Deng's reformist role has fuelled speculation about his possible early demise. Attempts to reinforce his legacy in the public mind are seen as part of enhanced preparations for his death. China's senior leader last appeared in public when he was shown on television visiting Shanghai earlier this year. He was extremely frail, and his health is said to be continuing to deteriorate. Unconfirmed reports circulated in Beijing this month that he had been committed to hospital. But while China might be exhibiting unease about its leadership transition and difficulties managing its economic transformation, it is showing no such diffidence in its foreign relations. Since the US renewed China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in May, Beijing has gone on the offensive. It has toughened its position in the row with Britain over Hong Kong, taken Japan to task for the invitation extended to Taiwan's President Lee Teng-Hui to attend this month's Asian games in Hiroshima, and sharply criticised the US over its decision to make small changes in the way it deals with Taiwan. A mood of self-congratulation was certainly reflected in a commentary published this week by the official Xinhua news agency. 'China has made brilliant achievements in diplomacy over the past 45 years,' it quoted a vice foreign minister as saying.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Norinchukin Bank rating under review MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, yesterday placed the Aa1 long-term ratings of Norinchukin Bank, the financial arm of Japan's agricultural co-operative, under review. The move follows a downgrading of Norinchukin's debts from Aaa last August. Credit ratings at Japanese banks have been downgraded during the past year, because of bad loans stemming from the sharp falls in stock and real estate prices. The rise in funding costs, because of the declines in ratings, is expected to squeeze profit margins at the banks, which are already under pressure from the increasing number of corporate bail outs. Moody's said that though Norinchukin has negligible direct exposure to domestic real estate-related business, the bank has big exposure through loans made to non-bank financial institutions. Norinchukin also faces deteriorating asset quality and profitability at its local agricultural organisations.</p>

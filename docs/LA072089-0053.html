			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: HISTORIC MONTH FOR FRANKFURTERS  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: Did you know July is National Hot Dog Month? It is sponsored by  the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. During the peak summer months  Americans eat more than 5 billion frankfurters.  </P> <P> The frankfurter is generally believed to have been created by a butcher in  Frankfurt, Germany, in 1652.  </P> <P> In 1904, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, an inventive  concessionaire gave birth to the idea of the frankfurter sandwich as we know it  today. He was doing a booming business selling the frankfurters as plain  sausages. So his customers could eat the hot, moist frankfurters, he loaned  them white gloves. When he closed shop, most of the gloves were not returned.  He talked to a baker, who designed the bun to protect the fingers, and that's  how the frankfurter sandwich began.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: We have an awful time removing ice cubes from trays because of so  many minerals in our water. The ice sticks and shatters into tiny pieces. Can  you help?  </P> <P>  -- PATRICIA, San Gabriel, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR PATRICIA: It's as easy as using a non-stick vegetable spray that is  normally used to coat pans for baking or for low-calorie "frying."  </P> <P> Spray the trays before filling them. The ice will pop right out and the cubes  will be all in one piece. So simple to do, yet so effective.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I thought I would send you this recycling hint. With a family of  five children, I've been doing this for years. I cut out the fronts and the  backs of empty cereal boxes. Then I cut each panel into three sections.  </P> <P> I find that these are nice for notes, grocery lists or simply a writing pad for  telephone messages.  </P> <P>  -- ELLA, Shediac, New Brunswick, Canada  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I was given a beautiful old glass decanter that belonged to my  grandmother. There are some stains in it that I don't know how to remove.  </P> <P> I don't want to use anything that can damage it. Do you know what I should use  to clean it?  </P> <P>  -- SARAH, Roanoke, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR SARAH: I have been told by some antiques dealers that sometimes stains  cannot be removed from old glass. What works best for them is to mix about  one-quarter cup dishwasher detergent compound with hot water. When the water  cools, fill the decanter to the top. Let it soak for a few hours or overnight.  Use a bottle brush to try and remove stubborn stains.  </P> <P> Some stains may remain. Rinse well and let dry. Good luck.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I misplaced my dustpan and, of course, needed one quickly. I  improvised by using a plastic foam tray that had been in a package of meat. I  cut the ridge off one long side to make a flat bottom but left the other sides  to give me something to hold onto and to catch the stuff I was sweeping up. I  just threw away the whole mess.  </P> <P>  -- MARGARET, Seattle, Wash.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: This may sound like a silly question but it is the cause of an  argument in my household. When wrapping an item in aluminum foil for the  freezer, does the food go on the shiny side or does the shiny side remain on  the outside?  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Memphis, Tenn.  </P> <P> DEAR READER: We called a leading aluminum foil manufacturer to find out the  correct response, and guess what? It really doesn't matter which side is out.  </P> <P> Usually the shiny side out looks better, but the food will taste the same  either way.  </P> <P> The manufacturer said that when the foil is made, it is rolled and one side of  the foil gets shiny because it comes in contact with the heavy roller while the  other side doesn't, which makes that side duller. This should settle this  issue, and best of all no one was wrong.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I cut out recipes from magazines and copy others from books. I  recently rewrote all of them on colored index cards. I used the different  colored cards for each food category: green cards for vegetables, white for  meat and blue for desserts.  </P> <P> This sure makes finding recipes much easier and it makes me feel like I'm more  organized.  </P> <P>  -- LISA, Salt Lake City, Utah  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I found mid-afternoon a great challenge to my diet because I  would be hungry and ready to eat anything and everything.  </P> <P> To solve this problem, I cut up some carrots and cucumbers and place them in a  bowl. I add a few ice cubes to keep them cool and crisp and when I have a snack  attack I nibble on these nutritious snacks.  </P> <P>  -- RUBY, Flushing, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: The plastic bottoms on one- and two-liter soda bottles can be  recycled into several different and useful things. After removing them from the  bottles, I have used them for flower pots and knickknack bowls, and when lined  with foil, they make great outside ashtrays.  </P> <P>  -- WILLIAM, Washington  </P> <P> </P> <P> Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

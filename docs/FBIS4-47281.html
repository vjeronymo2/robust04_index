Molchanova, A.N. Smagunova. V.A. Kozlov, </F> and N.A. Azmuko; UDC 543.422.8]    [Abstract] Chemical analysis of materials by the x-ray  fluorescence method, such an analysis being based on the  relation between intensity I of fluorescence and the chemical  composition C of the test specimen. The original version was  trial analysis with use of a model without calibrating specimens  (J. Criss, L. Birks; ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY, Vol. 40 No. 7, 1968).  This simple procedure has been later found to be inadequate (R.  Tertian; X-RAY SPECTROMETRY, Vol. 15 No. 3, 1986), inasmuch as  no one mathematical model would simulate the reflection pattern  accurately enough under any circumstances. One of the proposed  modifications of this method was to determine the instrument  errors and to reconcile experimental data with theory (R.  Tertian; X-RAY SPECTROMETRY, Vol. 17 No. 3, 1988), but this  required use of standard specimens and complicated the  procedure. The method of fundamental parameters was proposed  next, first on the conventional premise that determining the  entire composition would require a preliminary separate  determination of the lighter elements by some other method.  Simpler variants of this method, especially effective in partial  determinations, are empirical ones using coherent and  noncoherent reflection of incident light by the analyzed  specimen. Another variant of this method is approximating the  equation I[.sub]i[/]= C[.sub]i[/] (i= 1,2,... constituent  chemical elements in the material) by expanding the function  C[.sub]i[/]/I[.sub]i[/] into a Taylor series:  C[.sub]i[/]= C[.sub]i[/]*(1 + _s_  _a_[.sub]ij[/]'_D_C[.sub]j[/], where C[.sub]i[/]*=  f(I[.sub]i[/] and _D_C[.sub]j[/]= C[.sub]j[/]-  C[.sub]j,c[/] (C[.sub]j[/], C[.sub]j,c[/]-  concentration of j-th significant element in analyzed specimen  and in reference specimen respectively, _a_[.sub]ij[/]'-  differential coefficient characterizing influence of element j  on the intensity of fluorescence of i-th element). Several  mathematical models have been proposed for implementation of  this method, each with a generally different value of each  coefficient _a_[.sub]ij[/] and different expression for  _a_[.sub]ij[/]*= _a_[.sub]ij[/]+ _D__a_[.sub]ij[/] but  all taking into account, though also differently, the dependence  of _a_[.sub]ij[/] on C and on the analyzer geometry. Listed  are six of them: 1) Claisse-Quintin, 2) Tertian, 3)  Lachance-Claisse, 4) Rassberry-Heinrich, 5) Broll-Tertian, 6)  Rousseau. Tables 1; references 160.</p>

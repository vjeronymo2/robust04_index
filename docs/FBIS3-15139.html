			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry finds that the 2,600  Russian servicemen deployed in Estonia act as a destabilizing  force. Their discipline is weak and they have links with both  the illegal arms trade and other crime. The Foreign Ministry  statement says that the Estonian police are investigating  several cases of Russian servicemen selling their arms to  criminals locally. The Estonian police confiscated 500  kilograms of a powerful explosive substance from a Russian  junior officer in February 1993. It would have been sufficient  to blow up the World Trade Center in New York. At the same  location the police confiscated 12,000 cartridges that were  intended for sale.    Two months ago the police found a train standing near the  [training] nuclear reactor at Paldiski [Russian naval base near  Tallinn], which had been unguarded since November. There were  numerous anti-tank shells in its 22 cars. Local people had  already succeeded in emptying several of the wagons and had sold  their booty. According to the Foreign Ministry, it is assumed  that the weapons are now held by criminals, BNS [Baltic News  Service] notes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has affirmed that  Lebanon is determined not to take unilateral action or allow  itself to be isolated in the negotiations. It is treason for  anyone to confront the Resistance, because it the highest duty  of all. Minister Dallul made these statements during a  celebration held today in Saghbin. Minister Dallul said:    [Begin recording] [Dallul] Lebanon is determined not to  take unilateral action or to allow itself to be isolated. We  entered negotiations after reaching understanding with Arab  sides. Unfortunately, there are those who have abandoned this  course or decided to leave these negotiations in return for  trivial and insignificant things. However, we shall continue  our coordination, understanding, and solidarity with sister  Syria until the very end. No one can isolate us, nor will anyone  be able to take unilateral action against us.    [Correspondent] Are there any new developments regarding the  relationship between the authorities or the Lebanese Army and  the Resistance men, or is the relationship firm and will it  continue as it was?    [Dallul] We have repeatedly said and I will stress again  today: Resistance is the right and duty of every citizen who is  capable of resisting, because it is our right to confront the  Israeli occupation with all means available to us. There is  territory occupied by the enemy and there are people, our  people, who are under this occupation. It is our duty to  struggle with all available means to end this occupation and  regain this honorable and sacred land, because it is a cherished  part of Lebanon. It is an act of treason for anyone to confront  the Resistance, because it is the highest duty of all.    [Correspondent] Therefore, the Resistance operations will  not stop until the last inch of Lebanese territories is  liberated?    [Dallul] The Resistance knows its duties very well and no  one can dictate any conditions or stands to it. We, as an  authority and government, believe that it is the duty of the  citizens--as happens all over the world, and as was the  situation in Europe when the German army occupied it and the  popular resistance started--to resist. It is the duty of the  sons of all people who are under occupation to resist with all  the means at their disposal. [end recording]</p>

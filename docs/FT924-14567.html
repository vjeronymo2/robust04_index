			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Trilby's weak hypnosis - Theatre George du Maurier (1834-1896) published Trilby in 1894, renaming the Homburg hat and creating the character of Svengali. Du Maurier's short book became an early bestseller, netting him Pounds 20,000. Herbert Beerbohm Tree adapted the novel for the stage, and at the Haymarket in 1895, Trilby entered theatrical history. It made an awful but successful play. Now, Shared Experience Theatre has made a bold fist of this difficult drama, and has emerged with Trilby &amp; Svengali, a lame production of a halting play. It visits Oxford, Southampton, Belfast, Newtown and London. This Parisian story - drawn from du Maurier's experience in the Latin Quarter - centres on Trilby, an artist's model, and Svengali, a mysterious Jew with hypnotic powers. Trilby loves an English artist, Billee, but feels the social gulf between them, and runs off. Svengali mesmerises her, teaches her to sing as 'La Svengali'. They tour Europe triumphantly, but the hypnosis wears off, leaving Trilby croaking in mid-performance. The final scene, all mesmerism and tension, is worthy of John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps, but with less at stake. This is about influence and power over others, the original modern idea of Svengali. The model with a past and the man with a presence create an alchemy of alteration and manipulation. Trilby &amp; Svengali should explore the boundaries of identity and personal power, but the play never gets that close to its own centre, never becomes intimate with itself. However, it does suggest the almost contemporary Freudian idea of a primal scene, with Trilby reverting to childhood after hypnosis. The action stresses the anti-semitism of the French and English; Svengali is a Jew given no respect: 'Why should they have so much and I have so little.' The acting copes with the chaotic direction, and Teddy Kempner as Svengali maintains high levels of energy and mystery. Tilly Blackwood as Trilby and Dermot Kerrigan as Billee are convincingly drawn into his world. There is a super vignette of a washerwoman from the versatile Mary Roscoe, and moments of musical enlightenment from Dean Brodrick's score. Trilby &amp; Svengali; on tour until December 12: Oxford, Southampton, Belfast, Newtown (Wales), London (071 434 9248)</p>

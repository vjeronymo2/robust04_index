			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN TALKED OF KILLING FAMILY, SELF, FRIENDS SAY  </P> <P> Roxanne Jones, the Reseda woman who shot her three children to death as they  slept and then turned the gun on herself, talked of killing herself and taking  her children with her for as long as two months before carrying out the threat,  police and acquaintances said Thursday.  </P> <P> None of those who heard her discuss suicide took her seriously enough to  contact authorities or to steer her toward counseling.  </P> <P> Some hints that she was suicidal went unrecognized, apparently misinterpreted  as part of her fervent new religious beliefs.  </P> <P> Two weeks before the tragedy, Jones' 7-year-old son, Jeremiah, told his  first-grade teacher that his mother was taking him to "a good place, where God  is, and there are no worries." But the teacher took that to mean a religious  retreat.  </P> <P> The bodies of Jones, 32, daughters Brandy Fernandez, 15, and Leticia Fernandez,  13, and Jeremiah were found Wednesday afternoon in the family's small house on  Tampa Avenue in Reseda. Los Angeles police said Jones had shot the children  while they slept Tuesday morning, then turned the .22-caliber rifle on herself.  The family dog was also shot to death.  </P> <P> Jones, who separated four months ago from her husband, Jeff Jones, 31, left  behind a five-page suicide note in which she asked for God's forgiveness and  outlined the family and financial problems that burdened her, police said. They  said that Jones had previously told several friends and relatives that she was  contemplating suicide.  </P></p>

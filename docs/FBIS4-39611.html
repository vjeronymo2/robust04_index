			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] In an interview with Georgian radio, Georgian head  of state Eduard Shevardnadze has said that the matter of putting  peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia is decided. This has been  confirmed once again by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a  telephone conversation, and details are now being finalized for  this operation, which will unfold just as planned. Any  breakdown in the peacekeeping operation would undermine the  authority of the Commonwealth of Independent States as a  regional organization and would be a great blow to Russian  policy, the Georgian head of state stressed.    Shevardnadze noted that a breakdown in the peace process  would affect Russia deeply, as Russia's ethnic interest has  preserved its status as a peacekeeper in the former USSR.</p>

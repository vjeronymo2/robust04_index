			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Gardening: Planning for perfection - Garden design / Bridget Bloom peruses the latest crop of books dedicated to making your horticultural efforts look better To plan or not to plan? Do you mark, measure and draw up - almost certainly on graph paper and to scale - the garden of your dreams? Or do you trust to your eye and your spade and then dig, more or less as the spirit moves you? Having succumbed to the latter form of garden 'design' in an acre of rough grass a decade ago, I now adhere firmly to the planning school. If I had not been so impatient and impulsive (I tell myself), I might now have a nicely composed and characterful garden, with weed-free and well-drained borders. Certainly, careful garden planning is now in fashion and anyone starting - or altering - a garden can find in the bookshops a clutch of volumes to set them off on a proper path. What has come my way to review this summer are a fraction of those available, but they are a good start. Top of the list is The Well Planned Garden, by Rupert Colby (Conran Octopus, Pounds 15.99), the latest in a collection of nicely produced books from the Royal Horticultural Society on different aspects of gardening. 'Planning a garden is in some respects like designing the interior of a house - involving both structural divisions and decorations,' Colby says 'but there is one important difference: many of the components in the garden are of living material which may not only increase in size but also undergo a change of character as they mature. 'To allow for this, a well planned garden must have certain tolerances built into its concept, with longer term plans as well as immediate solutions.' That is a good statement of part of the problem but, to my mind, it does not go far enough. It seems incomparably more difficult to design a garden than to decorate and furnish a house. The rooms of a house have walls and ceilings as a framework for furniture or colour schemes. Rooms change very little with the seasons, so the decorations you choose are there until you decide to change them. In a garden, not only does what you plant grow and die but it changes all the time. Crucially, too, a garden has only the sky at the top and, often, only the crudest 'boundaries'. I reckon anyone can decorate a room, but to get a garden looking good the year round is a real work of art. Colby's work will not produce a work of art but, well illustrated and written clearly, it is designed to take a relative beginner step by step through the practical business of designing a garden. John Patrick, author of Designing the Small Garden (Anaya, Pounds 14.99), does much the same thing although his focus - confined to the urban or small suburban garden - is more limited. Designing such a garden is certainly less demanding, for its boundaries are set closely. The Traditional Gardening Book (Dorling Kindersley, Pounds 12.99) is a handsome paperback version of a work written by Graham Rose, in association with The National Trust, in 1989. Rose covers many of the same areas as Colby but from an historical - particularly Victorian - perspective. It is a book in which to browse, its many illustrations including delightful drawings of old tools and garden features, from rhubarb and sea kale forcers and handlights for seedlings to a dozen varieties each of spouting fountain heads, urns and arches. It will not greatly help you to plan, but will certainly aid the furnishing. A wild garden, you might think, is quintessentially unplanned, an antidote to Victorian order. Not according to the experts. The Wild Flower Garden is by Noel Kingsbury and part of the RHS series mentioned above (Conran Octopus, Pounds 15.99). Kingsbury explains that you cannot just leave a lawn and expect it to sprout into a meadow. Much work is required, at least in the early stages, and much care must be taken to plant the right sort of meadow for your soil and situation. Still on the general design front is something rather different. A Handbook for Garden Designers (Ward Lock, Pounds 18.99) is exactly what it says. Written by Rosemary Alexander, the principal of the English Gardening School at the Chelsea Physic Gardens in London, with Karen Batstone, this would be much too detailed and probably too technical for most amateurs, but no doubt invaluable for anyone studying the subject Water, virtually all garden designers seem to agree, is an essential element of the well planned garden. According to Sue Fisher, author of The Complete Book of Water Gardens (BBC Books, Pounds 9.99), water is 'the single most attractive feature that can be added to any garden'. After an introductory chapter of do's and don'ts, Fisher examines 10 DIY water projects, from a wildlife pond to a basic fountain, concluding with chapters on planting and problems of cleaning and maintenance. Quite clearly, this is a useful book for beginners. A similar, if rather more lavish, volume is Water Gardens, by Jacqueline Heriteau and Charles Thomas. Published for the American market by Houghton Mifflin of New York and Boston at Dollars 35, there are some aspects of the book which will not be of great use to north European gardeners - raccoons not being among their most feared predators of garden-pond fish, for example. But there is much that would help, including a splendid, long and well illustrated chapter on water lilies. For rather more sophisticated planners, Waterside Planting, by Phillip Swindells (Ward Lock, Pounds 8.99) is to be recommended. His initial chapter describes the construction of bog - rather than water - gardens but the bulk of the book is a compendium of moisture loving plants with concluding words on their propagation and their predators. Next: two books to aid the painterly aspect of garden design. Colour Your Garden, by Mary Keen (Conran Octopus Pounds 9.99) is a recently published paperback version of a 1991 hardback. It is a splendid guide to which colour plants to put where, with a painter's eye to the changes wrought by the seasons. Hear Keen on yellow: 'Blue cannot always be relied upon to produce a feeling of well-being but it is rarely disagreeable in a garden setting. 'Yellow can be horrible. The chief reason for this is the changing quality of light in the garden which affects yellow more than any other colour. 'Under the watery suns of spring, yellows appear clear and fresh, but bright summer sunlight turns all the gold to brass . . . then, later in the year as the light loses its brilliance, yellow becomes acceptable again and the muted sunlight of autumn afternoons mellows golden leaves or flowers.' Well-illustrated, Keen offers planting plans in various colour modes and includes a directory listing plants in colour sequences. (An additional advantage is that, unlike many of the books reviewed here or in publishers' lists, Keen's captions generally tell you in which garden the photographs were taken). The next book is the only one I have seen dedicated to variegated plants: it covers a wide range of perennials, tender plants, annuals and biannuals, and trees and shrubs. Variegated Plants is by Susan Conder, with handsome photographs by Andrew Lawson (Cassell, Pounds 20). While the best part of the book is an illustrated plant directory, there is a good introductory chapter on using variegated plants through the seasons. Less useful, to my mind, is a book on Clematis and the Ranunculaceae, by Deborah Kellaway (Pounds 14.99, Pavilion). Buttercup, winter aconite, meadow rue and clematis may all be from the same family but, from a gardener's point of view, it is not terribly helpful to have them covered in one volume. Others may find Nigel Colborn's Annuals and Bedding Plants (Conran Octopus, Pounds 12.99) fascinating. Perhaps bedding schemes will come back into fashion but, for me, they spell municipal gardening. As all these books show, there is no dearth of advice for the would-be garden designer. The danger, of course, is that you can get so carried away by reading and planning that you never get started in the garden itself. Planning is certainly important - but so, too, is impulse.</p>

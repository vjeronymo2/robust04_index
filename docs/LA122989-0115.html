			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> KENNEDY WILL NOT RUN FOR REELECTION  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ursula E. Kennedy announced Thursday that she does not plan to  seek reelection.  </P> <P> Kennedy's announcement leaves just one incumbent in the race, in which three  City Council seats will be open.  </P> <P> "I am not a career councilwoman, and I feel change is good," Kennedy said. "It  is my hope that all three seats will be filled by newcomers."  </P> <P> Kennedy, who was first elected to the council in 1978, said she had planned for  this to be her last term when she was reelected in 1986 but had been  reconsidering because of the divisive state of the council.  </P> <P> "This last year has been the most exciting year of my life," said Kennedy, who  was mayor until Nov. 20. "I had to keep the council from blowing up, and I  think I did a commendable job. It was like having five sticks of dynamite at  every meeting."  </P> <P> Council members have been bitterly divided over such issues as abortion,  flag-burning, newsstand bans and developer fees.  </P> <P> Councilman John Kelly, who has been opposed to Kennedy on most issues, has  announced that he will seek reelection.  </P> <P> The election is scheduled for April, unless a judge on Jan. 17 invalidates the  council's decision to move elections from November. The judge will also decide  whether then-councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey was a legal resident of the city  when he voted for the election change on Nov. 20. He has since given up his  council seat because he moved from Tustin. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

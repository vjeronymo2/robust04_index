However, rump Yugoslavia, known formally as the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and comprised of Serbia and  Montenegro, envisages introducing visas for UNPROFOR members,  the newspaper reported. The force's mandate, extended on October  4, is due to expire March 31. "The FRY considers the UNPROFOR's  presence in ex-Yugoslavia is necessary until a political  agreement has been concluded on the existing problems," the  paper quoted FRY Prime Minister Radoje Kontic as saying in a  letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Rump  Yugoslavia "supports the Vance (peace) plan (in parts of Croatia  under Serb secessionist control) and wants it to be strictly  applied," Kontic added. However, he recalled that rump  Yugoslavia was hesitant about the force being staffed by  countries which dominated the region in the past, such as  Austria, Turkey and Germany.    Meanwhile the government committee on cooperation with the  UNPROFOR decided, at a session chaired by Kontic, to introduce  visas for UN peacekeepers. The government was to confirm the  move shortly and decide what date the visa requirement should  start, the newspaper said.</p>

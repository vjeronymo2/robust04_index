			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ji Yonghua [0679 3057 5478], Lu Lifang [7120 </F> 7787 5364], Xu Ke [1776 4430], Shanghai Institute of Physiology,  Chinese Academy of Sciences; Hiroyuki Hatori, Suzumu Terakawa,  Okazaki National Institute of Physiology, Okazaki, Japan]    [Abstract] Researchers recently purified and sequenced  three toxin components (AgTx-1, AgTx-2 and AgTx-3) from  Agkistrodon blomhoffii brevicaudus (also called Agkistrodon  halys Pallas) venom. All of them were toxoproteins being  composed of 122 amino acid residues. The three toxoproteins'  LD[.sub]50[/] to mice were 0.075, 0.51 and 6.6 mg/kg  respectively. Toxicological analysis conducted on chicken neck  muscle indicated that AgTx-1 and AgTx-2 were presynaptic  neurotoxins which only blocked transmission between  neurosynapsis, and both AgTx-1 and AgTx-2 had the same  N-terminal 32-peptide sequence. The AgTx-3 was identified as a  newly discovered cytotoxin that paralyzed the muscle cells only.</p>

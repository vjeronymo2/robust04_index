			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Hata appeals for backing on problems ahead Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata yesterday appealed for opposition support to help his minority government tackle the host of urgent issues ahead. In his first policy speech, Mr Hata asked for co-operation in completing the political reforms agreed in January, passing a budget for the current year, reforming the tax system and in defusing trade tensions with the US. But the two main opposition groups, the Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party, were unimpressed. Mr Hata's speech was 'void of substance', Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, former LDP prime minister, said. Both parties are considering a no-confidence motion soon after the budget is passed by the end of June. Mr Hata apologised to neighbouring countries for the offence created by the former justice minister's denial of an infamous wartime massacre. 'It is regrettable such a situation arose,' he said. 'Japan's wartime aggression and colonial rule caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people.' Despite the unpromising outlook for his government, Mr Hata promised to continue business as normally as possible. His administration would use 'plain language,' listen 'even more attentively to the opinions of both ruling and opposition parties' and seek 'as wide an agreement as possible'. The prime minister laid out a busy agenda, sticking to the policy accord agreed by the coalition before the SDP's walk-out three weeks ago. He planned 'as soon as possible' to enact a bill to redraw Japan's electoral boundaries, the final stage of the switch from the current multi-seat constituency system, blamed for fostering corruption, to a mix of single seats and proportional representation. The aim was to hold the next general election under the new system, likely to be in place by late autumn. This could be optimistic, given the growing pressure among SDP politicians for an early election under the existing system, on the grounds the party might do better than under the new rules. It is unclear, however, whether the Liberal Democratic party, the largest opposition group, would similarly benefit. The SDP would need LDP help to vote the government down. Mr Hata said his administration aimed to produce draft tax reform plans in June, the main point of which will be a cut in income tax, seen as essential to stimulate the economy, and a rise in indirect taxes, anathema to the SDP. Legislation is planned by the end of the year. On trade, Mr Hata would strive to re-open economic framework talks with the US, stalled since February. 'It is important to make efforts. . . toachieve a phased reduction of the current account surplus,' including deregulation and measures to stimulate domestic demand. The cornerstone of foreign policy would continue to be the security treaty with the US. Japan could no longer be a mere onlooker in international affairs, Mr Hata added. Mr Hata said Japan would continue to try to persuade North Korea, through dialogue, to open all its suspected nuclear sites to international inspection, but would respect any United Nations decision, a reference to possible sanctions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yali (0702 7161 7787): "Results of Appraisal of </F> State-Owned Assets Nationwide Published"]    [Text] Beijing, 17 May (GUANGMING RIBAO)--Today, the  National Administration of State Property published for the  first time to the public the results of an appraisal of China's  state-owned assets. As of the end of 1992 (1993 data are still  being processed), China's state-owned assets had a total book  value of 3,069.7 billion yuan (excluding resources assets and  the state-owned assets of the armed forces and the armed police  corps), representing an increase of 385.1 billion yuan over the  2,684.6 billion yuan of the previous year or a growth rate of  14.3 percent.    Of total state-owned assets, 47.5 percent were managed by  units of the central authorities and 52.4 percent by the  localities. Judging by the usage of state-owned assets, 72  percent were operational assets and 28 percent were  nonoperational assets, of which operational assets increased by  13.1 percent.    Of total assets society-wide, state-owned assets had an  absolute advantage. In important sectors such as energy,  communications, banking, and foreign trade, over 90 percent of  assets were held by state-owned enterprises.    Sectors in which state-owned assets increased comparatively  quickly were industry, construction engineering, agriculture,  and forestry. Their growth rate was 10 percentage points higher  than the national average. State-owned assets in the real  estate sector and in joint-stock enterprises increased by 69.8  percent and 175.7 percent respectively, representing the fastest  growth rates.    Shandong Province was the region where state-owned assets  grew the quickest. In 1992, they grew by as much as 30.5  percent. Next were the coastal regions of eastern China and  southern China. The first 10 provinces and municipalities with  the largest state-owned assets managed by localities were  Guangdong (165.7 billion yuan), Jiangsu (103.2 billion yuan),  Shandong (102.8 billion yuan), Liaoning (96.5 billion yuan),  Sichuan (87.7 billion yuan), Shanghai (82.7 billion yuan),  Beijing (79.2 billion yuan), Hubei (69.6 billion yuan), Hebei  (66.3 billion yuan), and Zhejiang (62.5 billion yuan).    Moreover, state-owned enterprises have continuously improved  their vitality. In 1992, state-owned enterprises across the  country achieved taxes and profits totaling 329.1 billion yuan,  an increase of 16 percent over the previous year, and they  earned 117.6 billion yuan of profits, an increase of 11.3  percent over the previous year. The 24.3 percent of state-owned  enterprises incurring losses was a 7.3 point decrease from the  31.6 percent of the previous year. The proportion of losses in  operational returns decreased from 32.1 percent to 26.7 percent.  Taxes and profits turned over by state-owned enterprises  accounted for approximately two thirds of total budgetary income.</p>

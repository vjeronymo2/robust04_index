			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Water body urges compensation rise WATER companies should increase compensation for poor service rather than their directors' salaries, according to the Ofwat National Customer Council, the industry watchdog. The council said that the water companies were slow to handle complaints and offer compensation. The council urged the industry to produce a code of practice on compensation and demanded that companies be brought within the scope of the Sale of Goods Act. The water companies rejected the council's criticisms.</p>

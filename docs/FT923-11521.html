			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / USAir blames fares war as deficit rises to Dollars 85m USAIR Group, the US airline in which British Airways plans to invest Dollars 750m in return for a potential 44 per cent equity stake, yesterday reported increased losses in the second quarter of Dollars 84.9m (Pounds 44.4m) after tax. This compares with an after-tax deficit of Dollars 56.8m in the same period of 1991, and takes USAir's net loss for the first half of 1992 to Dollars 147.9m. The combined BA-USAir operation will link the world's biggest international air network with the third biggest US domestic network and carry more passengers than any other airline. Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's president, blamed recent domestic fare wars for the poor results. 'Industry-wide fare reductions that began early in the second quarter sharply eroded the positive momentum that we had developed in the first quarter of the year,' he said. His remarks echo those made last week by American Airlines which, although it returned an operating profit, was also hit by the widespread price-cutting. In the wake of domestic fare wars during the early summer, most analysts have been braced for losses from the nation's biggest carriers. USAir ranks as the sixth largest and has relatively little international business to offset cut-throat business at home. The quarterly loss was scored on slightly higher revenues, at Dollars 1.7bn (Dollars 1.66bn), and came after net interest charges of Dollars 60.1m (Dollars 60.4m). Nevertheless, USAir reported higher operating losses for the second quarter, at Dollars 43.7m compared with Dollars 27.9m in the same period of 1991. The operating loss at the airline subsidiary alone was Dollars 53.5m, against a loss of Dollars 45.3m a year earlier. Revenues were 2.2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.58bn, and the passenger load factor rose from 58.4 per cent to 59.9 per cent. However, the yield on scheduled services fell from 16.98 cents to 16.21 cents. USAir has recently been attempting to reduce its cost base but in the second quarter two main items - labour and fuel - were only reduced by 2.6 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively. However, Mr Schofield said benefits of the recent pilots contract, which the airline claims will take Dollars 100m out of operating expenses, would be felt in the third quarter.</p>

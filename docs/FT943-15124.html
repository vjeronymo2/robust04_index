			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Buyers still shy of South Africa - International South Africa's new government has worked hard to reassure international investors of its intention to keep its budget deficit firmly under control, and to a large extent it has been successful. But bond investors will require further reassurance if they are to keep faith with the new South Africa. The government's first budget on June 22 went a long way towards doing this. It was tough on public spending, with the budget deficit forecast to be 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product for the current financial year, down from 9 per cent two years ago. However, the sharp rise in bond yields on Tuesday following the resignation of Mr Derek Keys, the widely respected finance minister and the man largely responsible for proving South Africa's fiscal credentials, is a measure of how nervous the financial markets remain. Investors fear the government, faced with so many demands on its resources as it embarks on its ambitious plan of reconstruction and development, will overshoot spending targets. To fund the growing budget deficit it might then be tempted to print money, so fuelling inflation, or issue more bonds in world markets, so driving up yields. However, South African government bond yields have risen almost 3 percentage points to almost 15 per cent since the start of the year and only part of this increase can be explained by these fears. The rise in yields is due mainly to the fall in world bond markets; South Africa, like most of the world, has been buffeted by worries about strengthening global economic recovery and rising world inflation. This is understandable, since in South Africa it is international investors who on the margin are the main influence on bond yields, and increasingly so as more foreign investors are tempted into the newly open economy. At the end of 1992, the South African public sector bond market was roughly the equivalent of Dollars 59.4bn in size, about the same as Australia's. Although most of the country's government bonds are owned by domestic investors, they are constrained by foreign exchange controls and tend to hold on to bonds to maturity rather than trade them. It is therefore unlikely that South African bond yields will fall back until international sentiment improves and bond yields, especially in the US, decline. The economy came out of a three-year recession last year and is expected to grow by more than 3 per cent this year, boosted in part by overseas investment and by export growth after years of an international boycott. Inflation has fallen significantly from the double digit rates of the 1980s, to 7.3 per cent in May, and although with renewed economic growth it may not have further to fall, it is still declining, which will have a beneficial impact on the bond market. This relatively bright outlook for the South African bond market, however, has to be tempered with caution as the situation could turn sour. The money supply is expanding rapidly - M0 grew by a preliminary 22.8 per cent in the year to March - an indication that inflation may be more of a problem in the future. That could mean a serious test of the Reserve Bank's, and governor Chris Stals', autonomy at a time when the new government will not be keen to see a rise in interest rates. A further risk is political. So far, the new government of national unity has worked well. But the pressure on the administration is tremendous and the expectations of the formerly disenfranchised population are great; conflicts between the finance ministry and other government departments on spending levels may be unavoidable. The role of Mr Christo Liebenberg, who will succeed Mr Keys as finance minister later this year, will be of primary importance. An experienced banker, with no formal political affiliations, his appointment shows the government intends to keep a firm hold on public spending. However, he lacks Mr Keys' powerful personality, and without Mr Keys' carefully nurtured relationship with top figures in the African National Congress, he may not command the same respect in the new government. 'There may be a change of face, there may be a change of style, but there won't be a change of direction,' Mr FW de Klerk, deputy president, said last week. With such unlikely bedfellows in the new government, the financial markets will take some convincing. There is no doubt that international investors will be watching developments closely, even more so after being unnerved by Mr Keys' departure. As it steps up its efforts to acquire an international credit rating in an attempt to return to the international capital markets, the government may, therefore, be even stricter than it would have been with its public finances and implement the spending controls proposed in Mr Keys' last budget in full.</p>

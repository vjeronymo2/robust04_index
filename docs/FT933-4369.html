			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Accountancy Column: Grand old man battles on to restore the golden age - Andrew Jack examines a persistent quest for reform by feisty New York professor Abraham Briloff A REMARKABLE man sits in a squeaky swivel chair in a small and ramshackle office, sharpening the barbs of his latest critique on the state of contemporary accountancy. His name is Abraham Briloff. 'Abe' Briloff is unusual in many ways. First, because his office - the launching pad of many robust attacks on the profession - is in New York City, more commonly a base for raw capitalism than for radical critique. Second, because that office is the headquarters of a small firm of certified public accountants. For Briloff is a trained accountant in practice and no mere ivory-tower academic nor someone with a simple nihilistic grudge against the profession. Third, because the location is opposite Baruch College, part of the City University of New York system and the institution at which Briloff holds the title of Emanuel Sachs distinguished professor accounting emeritus. For neither is he a mere practitioner too buried in work to take a wider perspective. Fourth, because he matches this breadth with an enormous depth of experience. Mr Briloff, still commuting to New York from the suburbs though now with the aid of a cane and with failing eye-sight, is 76. He turned to bookkeeping in the 1930s as a profession relatively cheap and quick to enter, before falling under the influence of his accounting mentor, Professor Emanuel Sachs, because he could not find a day job during the Great Depression. Fifth, because he has pioneered an approach to the subject which has inspired other radicals among his academic colleagues, in contrast to those in universities whom he calls 'apologists for the profession'. Sixth, because he is not afraid to stick out his neck and openly criticise firms and companies which transgress his standards, notably by penning columns in Barron's, the weekly US business paper. He bears the battle scars of a defamation lawsuit brought against him and the paper in 1976 by Saul Steinberg, the corporate raider and head of Reliance Group. And seventh, because all these characteristics have given him a credibility which means he is regularly invited to appear before Congressional hearings in Washington DC, and as an expert witness in court cases. But what, with all these hefty credentials, does Briloff have to say? Throughout his work - comprising four books and dozens of academic papers - runs a consistent theme, expressed in a forceful, clear style. Briloff argues the accountancy profession has breached the 'sacred covenant' it holds with society through its licence to report on financial statements. It is in terminal decline as it moves along its 'via doloroso'. 'In modern society, the accountant's certificate is more potent than the chisel or the crowbar,' he says. He calls for a return to the 'golden age' of the 1950s and 1960s when, he argues, accountants were more concerned with being professionals than in gathering new business. 'We need the responsibility, accountability, integrity to fulfil the role with which society has vested us and we have assumed willingly and received substantial compensation for doing.' He contrasts the modest offices of large firms at that time with expensive halls and atria of today's headquarters. He looks to a time when partners in firms knew each other and felt a sense of 'direct personal responsibility' for their work. He laments the change from managing partners who were primarily auditors to those who have won their positions through proud boasts of 'rainmaking' - the ability to gather new business - and even dub themselves chief executives. In particular, Briloff regrets threats to the supposedly independent role of the auditor when challenged by issues such as the growing and potentially compromising role of carrying out management advisory services such as tax work and computer consulting for audit clients - what he calls 'riding two horses with one backside'. He says this leads to a 'race for the bottom' as non-accountants become partners, infuse intensely competitive practices and denigrate the firm's independent audit responsibilities. He cites instances of audit partners given loans under special circumstances by a Texas savings &amp; loans institution which then collapsed, and of others who swiftly moved from auditors to chief financial officers of client companies. More generally, he is concerned at the degree to which auditors have become too associated with executives within companies which they audit, advising on the structuring of financing and presentation of financial information and acting as their advocates. 'We have become crucified by the bottom line merchants,' he says. He refers derisively to the 'accounting alchemy' and the accountants' 'magic wand' in favourably presenting information on leases and the categorisation of debt instruments as equity. He cites approvingly Judge Stanley Sporkin, of the US district court in Washington, DC, in a decision in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loans case in 1990, that 'accountants must be particularly sceptical where a transaction has little or no economic substance' even if it might technically meet the standards of US generally accepted accounting principles. But he sees no evidence for optimism that accountants will heed this 'prayerful' plea. At the same time, he criticises the SEC for weaknesses in its findings. Many of its initially tough verdicts have been buried in compromise 'consent orders' reached with companies. He is disappointed with the courts. He has little time for the Public Oversight Board, created by Congress to scrutinise the profession, but all too often in his belief acting as captive to and advocate for it. But his greatest wrath is saved for the accountancy firms and professional bodies. He traces the interlocking power structure, with the 'Big Six' firms influencing the board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which has power over the Financial Accounting Standards Board. He is scathing of the frequent appointment to committees, disciplinary bodies and peer review panels of partners from large firms which have been criticised for their own auditing work. For instance, tracing the background to the widely-cited finding of the profession's 1978 Cohen Commission that there is no evidence that providing other services has jeopardised audit independence, he shows how all the data was compiled by staff and partners in the larger accounting firms - analogous, he says, to 'sending a fox to guard the hen house'. Briloff's advantage is that he is aided in the USA by a mass of material related to regulation and litigation. He has access to evidence obtained from auditors in subpoenas, in front of Congressional hearings and in discovery during litigation; and details emerging through court judgments and rulings from the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is not to say that his views are accepted within the profession. Many see him as extreme, unfair and wholly unrealistic. Few of his remedies have been implemented. Reflecting in an academic article earlier this year on his criticisms of the profession in his 1972 book 'Unaccountable Accounting', he concludes sadly that his vision for reform has 'come to naught' - except that the aberrations he then identified have been extrapolated exponentially to billions and tens of billions. 'If you are a teacher you have got to remain optimistic,' he says. 'You have to feel that ideas have consequences and meaning. Otherwise you are being hypocritical.' Against the predominance of the accounting establishment, a few Abe Briloffs can be no bad thing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 1 SAPA -- A permit issued to an  arms dealer to export 1,000 LM4 weapons to kwaZulu lapsed after  Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] cancelled the sales  transaction with the dealer, police said on Friday night.  Spokesman Maj Burger van Rooyen said Eskom informed the South  African Police on Friday [1 April] that the weapons were its  property, and that it had cancelled the transaction.    The arms dealer, he said, had applied for an export permit,  required for a sale to kwaZulu on Thursday last week, and made  it known the arms were destined for the homeland. With his  application was an official letter from the kwaZulu commissioner  of police, giving authority for the receipt of the weapons.    Maj van Rooyen said there was no legal stipulation for such  a  permit to be refused.    Meanwhile kwaZulu Police Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said  the issue had "a couple of loose ends". He told sapa a press  statement would be released shortly. He had no further comment.</p>

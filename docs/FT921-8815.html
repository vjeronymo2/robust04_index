			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BP shares fall on worries over future dividends SHARES IN British Petroleum, one of the UK's leading stocks, plunged early yesterday in a belated reaction to the previous day's poor 1991 results. Although they recovered later in the day, they closed close to their lowest point in more than a year. At the worst moment the shares were trading at 253p, a fall of 19p. The closing price was 268p, down 6p. Turnover was an exceptionally heavy 61m shares. The fall was triggered by a breakfast meeting which Mr Robert Horton, the chairman, held with stock analysts to brief them on the results. While the meeting did not yield any fresh information, analysts said that Mr Horton failed to provide any guarantees that BP's dividend might not be cut at some future date. BP has maintained a staunch policy in the past of rewarding shareholders with a steady increase in real terms. But on Thursday it left its final quarter dividend unchanged, giving shareholders an overall increase for the year of 4.7 per cent, barely more than the 4.5 per cent rate of inflation. The company said it was 'an appropriate moment to pause for breath'. Mr Paul Spedding, oil analyst with Kleinwort Benson, said the meeting 'was looking for reassurance on the dividend and didn't get as much as it had hoped for.' The results had also driven home to analysts that external factors had become more important for BP's performance than before. Although he did not believe that BP would cut its dividend, it was now possible to construct a scenario where the dividend was under threat. BP's shares began to recover in the middle of yesterday thanks to some buying from US institutional investors. But traders said that UK holders were still selling. Some analysts said they expected BP's shares to lose more ground before they recovered. The fall was reflected in other oil stocks yesterday, including Shell, which closed at 467p, down 11p. The sell-off came despite the fact that many analysts found BP's results slightly better than they had expected. The company reported a fourth quarter profit on a replacement basis of Pounds 72m, down from Pounds 456m in the previous year's final quarter. This gave it a full-year result of Pounds 1.04bn, down from Pounds 1.2bn. Mr Horton blamed the result on the recession, while stressing that BP had taken steps to ensure that it could live with a weak oil price.</p>

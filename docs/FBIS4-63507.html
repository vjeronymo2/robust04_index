			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday [21 May] the Crimean parliament voted to  suspend the resolution of the Ukrainian parliament dated 20 May,  which in turn, suspended the law "On the restoration of the  Constitution in the Republic of Crimea."    As it was reported earlier, on Friday the Ukrainian  parliament suspended the Crimean law "On the restoration of the  Constitution in the Republic of Crimea" and offered the Crimean  parliament to put its legislation in line with the Ukrainian  Constitution within 10 days.    Leader of the Russia faction, chairman of the Crimean  parliamentary commission on legislation, law and state Sergey  Nikulin told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the parliament was not going  to cancel its law "On the restoration of the Constitution in the  Republic of Crimea." At the same time, he said: "We are ready  for dialogue with the Ukrainian parliament."    On Saturday the Crimean lawmakers issued an address to the  UN  Security Council and the CSCE, the president and the Federal  Assembly of the Russian Federation, the people of Ukraine. The  address confirms that "not a single article of the Crimean  Constitution violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine or  leads to the review of the current state border."    The address notes that "Ukrainian mass media backed by  Ukrainian officials launched a campaign aimed at discrediting  the constitutional bodies of Crimea, disinforming the  international community." The Crimean parliament points out  that the law "On the restoration of the Constitution in the  Republic of Crimea" aims to provide the Crimean people with  broad powers in the spheres of economy, education, and culture."    The Crimean parliament expressed hope that the international  community would prevent the Ukrainian state power bodies from  committing illegal actions.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES;  </P> <P> EXPLOSIVE LOYOLA BASKETBALL TEAM PACKS ARENAS FROM COAST TO COAST  </P> <P> Fastest draw in the West?  </P> <P> At the moment, it's no contest. Wherever Loyola Marymount plays, tickets are at  a premium.  </P> <P> Last week the Lions set an attendance record of 4,886 at Portland's Chiles  Center on a rainy Oregon night, then played before a standing-room-only crowd  at Gonzaga. Two weeks before, it was standing room only at Santa Clara and San  Diego, where spectators were warned that if they left the gym at halftime they  wouldn't get back in.  </P> <P> On Loyola's Eastern swing in the first week of January, the Lions set a  field-house record of 3,200 at St. Joseph's in Philadelphia, then played  LaSalle before a house of 10,004 in the Philadelphia Civic Center, a sellout  despite cable television coverage.  </P> <P> In December the Lions drew 9,183 at Oregon State on another wet evening in the  Northwest, and in Cincinnati a season-high Xavier crowd of 8,741 turned out  although the game was on local TV.  </P> <P> Another large crowd is expected Saturday when Loyola plays Louisiana State in  the 14,236-seat Maravich Assembly Center in a nationally televised game.  </P> <P> "We should be getting a percentage of the gate," Lions Coach Paul Westhead  quipped.  </P> <P> At home, the Lions are nearly averaging sellout level, thanks to several  standing-room-only crowds that have topped the official Gersten Pavilion  seating capacity of 4,156.  </P> <P> The Lions' crowd-pleasing style and high-scoring feats have not been lost on  the youngest fans, even on the road, where fans root against the Lions for 40  minutes, then mob their locker room for autographs.  </P> <P> After last week's game at Gonzaga, security personnel at Martin Centre needed  police barriers to keep droves of autograph seekers from Loyola's locker room.  When Hank Gathers emerged, he asked one young Spokane boy: "Who's your favorite  player?" In a sincere voice, the youngster replied, "You are, Hank." He got his  autograph.  </P> <P> Westhead may have taken a cue from Sylvester Stallone, who learned that  whatever the critics say, action is boffo at the box office.  </P> <P> The makeup of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., which loses Cal State  Northridge after this school year, faces a further challenge if a new baseball  conference is in the works.  </P> <P> The CCAA has long billed itself as the Division II "Conference of Champions"  and has dominated nationally in a number of sports. But Northridge is upgrading  its program to Division I next fall, depriving the conference of a perennial  contender in volleyball, swimming, softball and baseball. UC Riverside is  studying a move as well.  </P> <P> Now Chapman College in Orange apparently is considering upgrading its baseball  program to Division I. Chapman reportedly has received an invitation to join  Grand Canyon College of Phoenix -- which has made plans to go up to Division I  in 1991 -- Sacramento State, a perennial Division II baseball power, and U.S.  International, a Division I independent, in forming a new conference. With UC  Riverside also looking at Division I, the CCAA could suddenly be down to five  baseball teams.  </P> <P> However, Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, who is on  the CCAA planning committee, points out that for now that is Chapman baseball  Coach Mike Weathers' desire. Chapman has no athletic director and its  department is in flux.  </P> <P> "The desire is but one (aspect)," Guerrero said. "There's practicality,  expenses, scholarships. There's a lot to consider. (A move by Chapman) would  obviously impact our conference. There's a kind of domino effect. You have to  watch what the other schools in your conference are doing."  </P> <P> The CCAA expects to bolster its membership by adding Cal State San Bernardino,  possibly by the next school year. Guerrero said the NCAA is also studying  several suggestions to make Division II more attractive both to low-level  Division I schools and high-powered Division III members.  </P> <P> Chapman is expected to announce its decision by June.  </P> <P> While the Dominguez Hills women's basketball team has faded in conference play,  freshman center Yvonne Vanlandingham has continued excellent play. The 6-foot  center out of Long Beach Poly High leads the Lady Toros in scoring at 11.3  points per game, which also tops all freshmen in the conference. She ranks  among conference leaders in rebounds (7.2 per game), steals (33) and blocked  shots (14).  </P> <P> Interpreters Apply Within -- This quote last week from Cal State Los Angeles  basketball Coach Henry Dyer after his team lost to Dominguez Hills, 64-62: "We  reacted like the barn was on fire and (Dominguez Hills) reacted like they were  at a funeral. It's tough to win against that kind of play."  </P> <P> Stat of the Week: The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball was 0-8 in  games in which it trailed at the half until Saturday night, when the Toros  erased a halftime deficit of 33-29 and defeated Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,  58-56.  </P> <P> College Notes:Loyola's Bo Kimble was named West Coast Conference basketball  Player of the Month for January. He averaged 34.8 points and 7.8 rebounds and  shot 56.4% in leading the Lions to an 8-1 record. Kimble was WCC Player of the  Month in December as well. Kimble was also named WCC Player of the Week for the  fifth time this season . . . If Kimble leads the nation in scoring, on the  heels of Hank Gathers' doing so last season, they would be the only teammates  to do so in consecutive seasons since Furman's Frank Selvy in 1954 and Darrell  Floyd in 1955 . . . Former Dominguez Hills golfer Pat Burke recently qualified  for the pro tour. Burke earned All-American honors for the Toros as a junior in  1985 . . . Loyola forward Per Stumer has re-emerged in the Lions offense. In  six conference games he is shooting 68% and is 13 of 21 from three-point range  (62%) while averaging 11.2 points and 7.7 rebounds. Since returning from the  team's East Coast swing the first week of January, Stumer has scored in double  figures in all but one game . . . The Loyola lacrosse club will play host to  Humboldt State at noon Saturday and Occidental at noon Sunday.  </P></p>

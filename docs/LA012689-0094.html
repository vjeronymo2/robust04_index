			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM FROM RELIGION OR BULLYING THE PUBLIC?  </P> <P> I am greatly concerned about "Freedom From Religion" groups twisting the truth  and bullying their way into communities such as ours. How dare they claim, with  arrogance, that certain traditions in this great country of ours are abuses of  the laws.  </P> <P> Thanksgiving is a longstanding tradition in our country and, like it or not, so  is religion. The entire foundation of this country is based on freedom to  develop as the general consensus sees fit, not as a few disgruntled people  demand.  </P> <P> The use of churches as polling places does not offend the general public. What  do they think we do, corrupt the minds of the voters?  </P> <P> Separation of church and state refers to protecting us from a prescribed state  religion, or any religious beliefs, not the forcing of religion from society,  as they would insist.  </P> <P> JERRY BLAUER  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

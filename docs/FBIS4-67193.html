			<p>Continue  <H4>    Chuan Denies Ploy To Discredit Opposition </H4>  <F P=102> BK1205050494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 12 May 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> BK1205050494 </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok BANGKOK POST </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday denied that  drug allegations against Chat Thai MP for Nakhon Phanom Thanong  Siriprichaphong were an attempt by the Government to discredit  the Opposition following a recent threat from the Opposition to  censure the Government.    Mr Chuan dismissed reports that a large number of  politicians  were known to be involved in the narcotics trade but conceded  that some of the drug suspects were politicians.    The Prime Minister said legal action would be taken against  any individual suspected of being involved in narcotics  trafficking regardless of who he or she is if enough evidence  could be found to substantiate the charges.    However, he said the Government could not reveal any  U.S.-supplied information on drug traffickers to the media in  Thailand to avoid defamation charges.    PM's Office Minister Thoetphong Chaiyanan, who is also  chairman of the Government Parties Coordination Committee, said  the allegations against Mr Thanong must be thoroughly checked  before the House of Representatives can make further moves on Mr  Thanong's case.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YEARS OF GREATNESS, PLUS 6 MONTHS TO BE BRONZED  </P> <P> Susan Wagner isn't a baseball fan, but each year she sculpts the memorable  visages that represent permanence in baseball history: the Hall of Fame  plaques.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I get a chill thinking about people coming up to Cooperstown to look  at them," says Wagner, who has never seen her work displayed in the Hall.  </P> <P> Wagner does her work for Pittsburgh-based Matthews International Corp., maker  of the plaques since 1984. Each plaque costs the Hall about $1,100.  </P> <P> Wagner's work starts early each year, shortly after the new inductees are  elected. Aided by photos of Johnny Bench, Carl Yastrzemski, Red Schoendienst  and umpire Al Barlick, Wagner sculpted their likenesses with oil-based clay.  </P> <P> "I get the basic form and sculpt it in bas-relief," she says of the form of  sculpture that creates an image raised slightly from the surface. "The photos  are pretty good, though I'd really like the players to model for me."  </P> <P> When Wagner finishes, Hall of Fame director Howard Talbot and curator Ted  Spencer review the work and sometimes request changes.  </P> <P> Matthews uses a sand-casting system to turn Wagner's clay patterns into bronze  plaques. Each pattern is placed in a steel frame. Chemically treated sand is  then hand molded around the pattern, so that a new impression is made in the  sand. When the sand hardens, it creates a new sand mold into which molten  bronze is poured. Once the bronze cools, the plaque is buffed, cleaned and  highlighted.  </P> <P> "From the time we get Susan's models, the process takes six weeks," said Joe  Gabig, manager of architectural sales for Matthews.  </P> <P> The other element of each plaque, the complement to the bronze image, is the  inscription, written each year by Bill Guilfoile, the Hall's associate  director. "I try to limit what I write to 60 or 70 words because anything too  lengthy keeps people from reading it," Guilfoile said  </P></p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall again EUROPEAN currency futures fell again yesterday as the French franc remained under pressure on currency markets and the Bundesbank was forced to intervene on the foreign exchanges to support the currency, writes James Blitz. Dealers were increasingly doubtful that the French franc could survive the continuing tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism without a devaluation. Sterling cash rates firmed slightly amid increasing signs that another easing in UK rates is a distant prospect. Rates in the French franc currency market rose sharply alongside the Bundesbank intervention. Three-month money climbed to 11 3/8 per cent from a previous close of 11 per cent and six-month money firmed from 10 1/4 per cent to 10 1/2 per cent. One London based clearing bank dealer said the Bank of France could not sustain these high market rates for long without raising its official dealing rates. French franc futures fell back sharply. The March contract retreated 6 basis points to a close of 90.51, while the June contract surrendered 16 basis points to end at 91.67. Remarks from Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank chief economist, that growth in M3 money supply would be considerably lower in the next two months failed to check another fall in Euromark futures. The March Euromark contract dipped 3 basis points from its high of 91.96 yesterday. German call money edged up to 9 per cent yesterday as year-end tax payments had their first heavy impact on bank liquidity levels. Call money was at 8.95 per cent initially, but moved up to slightly above 9 per cent as tax payments began coming in to the banks. Both cash rates and futures in the sterling market showed signs of firmness yesterday, after UK indicators underlined that another cut in base rates was unlikely before the spring. UK input prices rose 4.1 per cent in the year to November, the highest year-on-year increase since October 1976, compounding fears that a further easing of UK monetary policy could have inflationary implications. The March short sterling contract therefore fell 12 basis points from its previous close of 93.30. Three-month money firmed to 7 1/4 per cent from a previous close of 7 3/16 per cent.</p>

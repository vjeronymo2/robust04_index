			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S PRO VOLLEYBALL RETURNS THIS WEEKEND  </P> <P> The women's professional beach volleyball tour will return to Southern  California this weekend for the $15,000 Huntington Beach Open.  </P> <P> About 32 two-woman teams will play in the tournament all day Saturday and  Sunday on the sand courts south of Huntington Beach Pier. The winning team will  divide $3,700.  </P> <P> The tour's top team, Jackie Silva and Patty Dodd, will vie for a fourth  tournament victory in five events this season. Silva and Dodd are well ahead on  the tour with $6,000 in winnings apiece.  </P> <P> The money is nowhere near the six-figure incomes of the top players in the  men's game, but things are looking up, according to Craig Elledge, promoter of  the women's tour.  </P> <P> "They didn't even have a tour until a few years ago," said Elledge, who started  in volleyball promotion when he worked for Group Dynamics Inc., the firm that  promoted the men's professional tour until two years ago. "I worked on the  first big women's event for Group Dynamics in 1987. When it started, it wasn't  even worth it for the girls to come out.  </P> <P> "Back then, we had $5,000 events. Then, last year, it was $10,000 and this year  it went from $10,000 to $15,000. So it's been going up in blocks of five."  </P> <P> And Elledge says you can see the difference.  </P> <P> "The girls are taking the sport more seriously. A lot of them came out this  year in a whole lot better shape. They were thinner and they had grown some big  muscles, so they've been spending some time in the weight room."  </P> <P> There has also been changing of partnerships. The most significant involved two  of the most dominating players on the beach, Silva and her partner from last  year, Linda Chisholm. This year, Silva -- the former Olympian from Brazil who  is considered by some the best player on the women's tour -- opted for Dodd, a  Colombia native who is married to Mike Dodd, one of the stars of the men's  tour.  </P> <P> This left the 6-foot-2 Chisholm, an Olympic silver medalist in 1984, to team up  with Janice Opalinski. And, according to Elledge, the result could be  devastating to the rest of the tour.  </P> <P> "I think you're going to see them improve a lot," he said of the pair that won  a tournament in Cleveland two weekends ago -- the only event that didn't go to  Silva-Dodd. "Opalinski is a fiery back-court player who played for three years  with Kathy Gregory (the long-time beach star who retired after last season).  She's not a big blocker and hitter, but she keeps the ball in play.  </P> <P> "Paired with Chisholm, who's a big hitter and big blocker, they could be a lot  like (Sinjin) Smith and (Randy) Stoklos on the men's side. Chisholm can  dominate the net while Opalinski roams the back court."  </P> <P> Another new duo that has found success this season is Nina Matthies and Elaine  Roque, veterans who join Silva-Dodd and Chisholm-Opalinski as the top three  teams on the tour, Elledge said. Also challenging for top spots are Lori Kotas  and Gail Castro, Dale Hall and Karolyn Kirby and the imposing pair of Lisa  Strand (6-foot) and Judy Bellomo (5-foot-10).  </P> <P> The next stop on the women's tour is the John Shaw Open at Manhattan Beach Pier  on June 24-25.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jasminka Ivancic: "`Specialists'--Men for </F> Hellish Missions"]    [Text] Fifteen days in the field, two days of leave,  12 days of training. And this for two or three years. It is the  specialist's duty to be at the state's disposal 24 hours a day,  day in and day out. The specialist is a top-priority policeman,  trained in skills that allow him to perform missions by the  special police, but according to the strictly prescribed rules  of the profession, says Mladen Markac.    We first met Mladen Markac in June 1992, in devastated  Vocin,  when many people would not even speak his name to us. We had  come to that ravaged region while touring the local war zone and  special units of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], which  were working on clearing out the terrain. Besides Vocin, we  visited a dozen other abandoned and ravaged towns in that  region. The more we saw, the more our journalistic respect for  the "specialist" men and their commander, police professional  Markac, grew.    One of their lodgings was inside the sooty, crumbling walls  of a hotel in Zvecevo, in rooms that reeked of the recent fire.  That was one of the many areas where they were eliminating the  consequences of war, chetnik barbarism, and reestablishing the  safety of life.    "When we arrived, there was no life here. We cleared away  barricades, mine fields; in the Papuk region we removed 1,930  mines, there was no electricity, but we needed it, we  reestablished electricity, then water; for communication with  'civilization' we needed telephone service, and then after the  inhabitants returned, they got mail service, like everything  else," Markac summarizes part of his little-known mission, which  has received little public attention over these four years.  <H5>  Professionalism and Ethics </H5>   Of course, it is much easier to talk about this "ordinary,"  accompanying work by the special police. The singularity of  their wartime duties is in fact reflected by the case of Vocin,  or rather the area of the former police administration of Osijek  and Slavonski Brod, meaning the police stations of Podravska  Slatina, Orahovica, and Pozega. The special police oversaw Papuk  and part of Psunj.    The professionalism and ethics of these strong wartime  nomads, who are obviously trained for the most difficult  missions, was not overlooked by the inhabitants of the region in  which they were active. For example, their doctors often saved  the lives of civilians, offering them first aid and needed  drugs. But little is known of this, and it is almost entirely  unnoted in the annals of honor and glory; instead, their wartime  successes remain in their memory and in the stories of those  whom they encountered in the field.    Their wartime activities began with the first "massive  disruptions of public order and peace by the rebel Serbs," with  the first barricades, as increasingly extreme assaults turned  into terrorism, and then into armed conflict, the brigadier  general continues. They carried out missions in Glina, Petrinja,  Dvor na Uni, and Karlovac, and after frequent attacks on  Croatian police, military "skirmishes" began in the Pakrac  region. During 1991, there were attacks on Kostajnica, Kozibrod,  and Topusko across from Glina and Petrinja.    Plitvice was one of their first experiences with war. At the  same time, the barracks of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's  Army] were captured, which was very important since "there were  no weapons and there was an embargo on importing them," Markac  recalls. The weapons captured there were used not only to arm  the police, but also to begin creating an army.  <H5>  First to Oppose Terrorism </H5>   The organization of additional special-purpose MUP units,  known at the time as "strong forces of the MUP," began  immediately after the fighting broke out, first with hidden  enemies, and then with increasingly aggressive ones. At the  beginning of the war, the police, as the only organized combat  force defending the homeland, provided the first experts,  commanders, know-how, arms, and equipment. In time, the National  Guard Corps [ZNG] was formed, and then the professional  brigades--or the Croatian Armed Forces [HV]--as well.    "The police were the first to oppose the forces of  subversive  disorder, attempting to establish Croatian authority in areas  where there was rebellion. The internal police organization of  units distinguished itself in complex war operations, but there  was obviously also a need to create military formations. The  dynamics of events in the field forced the police, and later the  military as well, to seek out new tactical solutions more  appropriate to the imposed manner of warfare," Markac says,  explaining the sometimes incredible events of the war.    With the founding of the armed forces, the police reserves  went over to the ZNG en masse, together with their equipment,  and the police were again reduced to the ATJ [Antiterrorism  Unit]. Terrorism spread throughout rear-echelon regions of  Croatia. But the police quickly created new special units in the  police administrations, with the average strength of one  company. They were the best-armed and best-prepared units and  became the spearhead of the Croatian defense forces,  participating on equal footing with the HV in carrying out minor  tactical missions as well as more complex military operations in  crisis regions.    "We always acted professionally, effectively, and in  accordance with international conventions. The secrecy of the  work was to the specialists' disadvantage, so to speak, because  people were not aware of the many missions that they  successfully completed. But because of that the enemy became  quite familiar with the effectiveness of our forces," Markac  says. They established Croatian authority in the Velebit and  Papuk regions, saw action in Pakrac and Dubrovnik, marched into  Cavtat and Prevlaka, fought in Glina.... Where all were they not  present!?  <H5>  Field, Leave, Training </H5>   But the police also had to do their own basic job, and the  units changed their name to special units of the Croatian  Police, so that the ATJ, because of the specific nature of its  duties, remained as a unit on the state level, while the rest  are in the regular structure linked to the police  administrations and taking action in their region. Because of  the extraordinary conditions under which they worked, the  specialists' course of development went in the opposite  direction--quickly thrown into war operations and combat, it was  only later that they created a more refined structure and  underwent training, but in that case with a certain amount of  experience already under their belt. They had to adapt their  manner of operation to domestic conditions, the imposed war.    "Fifteen days in the field, two days of leave, 12 days of  training... and this for two to three years. It is inevitable  that the regular rhythm of life is lost, but it is the  specialist's duty to be at the state's disposal 24 hours a day,  day in and day out. The specialist is a top-notch policeman,  trained in skills that allow him to perform missions by the  special police, but according to the strictly prescribed rules  of the profession."    In short, this is only a suggestion of the working rhythm of  members of the special units of the police, who over the past  three years have created universal specialists, only for them to  now specialize. What does that mean exactly?    "For three years, we did not train top-notch specialists for  individual tasks; everyone did everything, but now we are  working intensively on that very thing. In the beginning there  were 2,200 policemen, recruited from the ranks of volunteers;  250 were selected as the best, and they underwent an accelerated  program. The one who distinguished himself as a leader in his  group through his natural abilities, standing out physically,  intellectually, and organizationally, became the commander,"  Markac says, explaining how the specialist is now schooled, for  which four to five years are necessary.  <H5>  Chooses This Job Himself </H5>   Cooperative arrangements have been established with the  School of Physical Culture and the School of Criminology, which  train cadre, instructors for the police. After testing and  selection upon acceptance into the police, the school determines  whether the men selected also meet their strict  criteria--whether their super quality makes them stand out. They  then undergo further training, specializing as skin divers,  mountain climbers, spelunkers, or pyrotechnicians, and resolving  hostage situations is the top specialization but also the most  dangerous situation.    ``The specialist has dual responsibilities in his job:  professionally, because he must perform his duty, and morally  because he has the legal authority, for example, to kill someone  who is holding hostages. But no matter what kind of criminal it  is that he shoots, even the most hardened one, that has an  effect on the policeman. That is why it is extremely necessary  to work on psychologically preparing each specialist, so that he  can physically and mentally bear the burden of the most  demanding tasks.    "Moreover, the specialist must choose this job himself, and  from day one a feeling of belonging to a group must be developed  in him, the sense that an action is being conducted by a group,"  says Markac, who judging from our conversation with him brings  together knowledge, police and athletic experience, and  psychological toughness and tenacity, which have helped him in  his four years commanding the special police forces.  <H5>  Deeds Make a Specialist </H5>   In what other areas are specialists trained? As they say in  their own jargon, it is extremely important that they master  "the qualified application of force--that it be applied in the  most humane manner, with the fewest possible consequences,"  aiming at targets selectively, because in a hostage situation,  to use that example once again, "there is a small region of the  body that you can hit" since the hostage is the one that covers  and protects almost all of the abductor. But a master marksman  will do his duty as it should be done.    They are not trained in diving for the purpose of  recreation,  but rather to pursue thieves of coral and other riches of the  sea, for sunken ships and to rescue people and cargos, and so  forth. The specialist does not scale peaks and crags for the  sake of mountaineering success; he scales them under the load of  equipment and the mission that he is carrying out--a military  one now at Velebit, and in other situations capturing a fleeing  criminal, across mountains buried beneath snow, lost in the  mountains' traps....    Finally, Markac emphasizes this: It is not uniforms, medals,  or ranks that make a specialist, it is his deeds and  effectiveness in performing his duties. But under wartime  conditions, the special police has been unable to take advantage  of anyone's experience; the experience gained along the way in  our region has been "unique" and inestimable.  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Mladen Markac, Policeman With Rank of Brigadier General </H5>   Until recently the chief of the Special Police Sector, a  former deputy minister of internal affairs, Mladen Markac is a  policeman with the military rank of brigadier general. An  athlete who completed studies in physical culture and a topnotch  judo wrestler with international medals, he began working for  the police in 1981. He started as an operative for general crime  and later moved to preparing special-purpose units. And that is  where the war found him.    During the war, he was awarded the military rank of  brigadier  general, and the only people outside the military to gain  military ranks were members of the Antiterrorist Unit of the  MUP, because they participated in all the most important  military operations from the beginning of the war. After the  Croatian armed forces were created, specialists and soldiers  fought shoulder to shoulder, at the highest police-military  level of cooperation. Indeed, the special police is almost  autonomous in performing these tasks, as well as in logistics,  with the exception of heavy weaponry, of which they have none.  On the other hand, many HV officers acquired their first  knowledge and experience in the police.    Markac says this, among other things, about the police:  Terrorism was an extended arm of the war, and it was necessary  to create a solid and strong police force. Moreover, under  conditions of war, crime flares up as well. That can be  countered only with a well-structured police force, to which all  operative branches lend strength. The state has entrusted to the  police duties set out by the Constitution and by law, Markac  explains, but the state need not fear a strong police, because  the police is only an adjunct of the civilian authorities.  Moreover, the state controls the strength and power of the  police through its mechanisms.    Indeed, the basic work of the special police is this:  fighting saboteur-terrorist groups, preventing kidnappings and  hijackings, freeing hostages, establishing public order and  peace to a greater extent, preventing ecological catastrophes,  accompanying and ensuring the undisturbed transport of special  cargo, detaining persons whose activities are exceptionally  dangerous, and so forth. Operation "Ring," better known as the  resolution of the "Pintaric case," was a textbook example of a  hostage situation, Markac said, and one that he commanded.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Dismay over US stance on Hanoi THE Vietnamese government and US companies expressed disappointment yesterday at President Bill Clinton's decision to maintain US sanctions against Hanoi. The White House announced late on Monday a softening of the embargo, ruling that US companies could participate in projects funded by international organisations such as the World Bank but would not be permitted to conduct other business. The US administration deemed Hanoi's efforts to solve cases of American servicemen missing in the Vietnam war insufficient. US executives in Hanoi are more frustrated by the decision than the Vietnamese, who are already struggling to absorb more than Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.8bn) of promised investment from Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, French, British and Australian companies. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry described Mr Clinton's decision as regrettable, but added: 'The US embargo does not hinder the economic renewal of Vietnam and the ever-broadening relations in all fields between Vietnam and other countries. 'It merely ties the hands of the American business community and deprives them of the opportunity to compete on an equal footing in Vietnam.' The Vietnamese do, however, want closer ties with the US in the long run to counterbalance the regional influence of China and Japan and to ensure Vietnam has access to US markets, technology and investment capital. None of these is regarded as critical at this stage of Vietnam's economic development - annual gross national product is not much more than Dollars 200 per head - but the communist government is eager to hold open projects for future US involvement. Officials, for example, have made no secret of their desire to have Mobil take part in the development of offshore oilfields. US executives in Hanoi, while hoping Mr Clinton will fully lift the embargo before the end of the year, say the Vietnamese cannot be expected to keep the door open for US companies much longer. 'We're sanctioning ourselves,' said Mr Greig Craft, who heads American Service Co, a consultancy with an office in Hanoi. 'I would have said 12 months ago that the return of the US was critical to the successful renovation of the Vietnamese economy. Now I don't think that's the case. Vietnam has done a brilliant job of lobbying the rest of the world.' The decision to allow US companies to bid for internationally-funded projects may seem a reasonable compromise in Washington, US companies say, but it has no immediate benefit. It was only in July that Mr Clinton ended US opposition to multilateral assistance for Vietnam, and the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are still preparing projects in which US companies will be allowed to participate. A donors' conference is to be held in Paris in November. US companies poised to do business in Vietnam are also irritated because many of the products and services they are forbidden to sell are widely available in spite of the embargo. Coca-Cola has signed two contracts worth Dollars 44m to produce soft drinks, but is forbidden to execute them until the embargo is lifted. Boeing may not sell aircraft, but a leased Boeing 737 from Switzerland is used by Vietnam Airlines. Pirated US computer software is also widely available.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: PO Counters profitable Sir, You assert ('Parcelling up the Post Office', January 3) that Post Office Counter Services loses money. Not so. Since our company was set up as a separately managed subsidiary in 1986 we have consistently hit the profit targets set by government. Last year we made Pounds 26m, a return on capital employed of 10.5 per cent. This year we are well on course for another successful result. Richard Dykes, managing director, Post Office Counters. Drury House, 1-16 Blackfriars Road, London SE1 9UA</p>

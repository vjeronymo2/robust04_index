			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: Little black swimsuit - Flattering swimwear designs When it comes to swimwear there is a beach version of the little black dress  -the beautifully cut all-in-one black swimsuit. The perfectly plain black (or navy) swimsuit is what one reaches for on all those occasions when one's stomach is feeling less than flat, one's thighs seem a strange shade of white and one wishes one had embarked on some . . . any . . . kind of diet at least three months ago. In other words, bikinis or supportless 1920s high fashion numbers are for those whose morale in the figure department is sky-high. But there is a half-way house between maximum coverage and high-fashion  - and that is Sam de Teran. I wrote about her two years ago when her first swimwear collection caused, if not a storm, at least a little flurry in the niche world of swimwear. Today, she is copied by everybody from our biggest chain stores to some very upmarket houses indeed. Her trademarks are classic sober colours (navy, black, cream), skilful cut (she believes that little legs or skirts on swimsuits are more flattering to the average thigh than all those vulgar high cut-aways) and dramatic cut-outs on the body. This year sees a new collection which homes in on what she does best - lots of support (she uses a nylon/lycra fabric which, while heavier than cotton, also offers more support), dramatic simple shapes and flattering lines. She has added more little skirts as they proved so popular and so universally flattering, and includes one number which can be worn straight from the sea to a restaurant, so demure is its little skirt. Her prices are not cheap but then for the little black dress of the beachwear world, it is possibly worth paying for better cut, better fabric and a bit of pizazz as well. Her prices range from Pounds 45 to Pounds 110 and the range can be found in Fenwick of Bond Street, London W1; Way In and First Floor at Harrods; Lisa Sterling in Manchester; Dickins &amp; Jones in London; Kendal Milne in Manchester; and Frasers of Glasgow. Lest the chaps feel left out, Samantha de Teran has a streamlined collection for men - mostly in black and cream. With lots of bold (and flattering) stripes they sell at about Pounds 60 each and for the moment can only be bought from Bodyworks, 40 King's Road, London SW3.</p>

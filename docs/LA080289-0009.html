			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 9 HOUSES WILL BE RAZED FOR SCHOOL  </P> <P> School officials, faced with overcrowded conditions in the area's elementary  schools, are planning to raze nine houses in southwest Pomona to make way for a  new campus, angering some homeowners who claim that they cannot afford to move  out of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The school board has voted unanimously to acquire, through eminent domain, 10  acres of residential land -- including one vacant four-acre lot -- on the  southwest corner of White and Grand avenues and to offer the owners market  value for the property. A private firm has appraised the land at a value of  $3,035,000.  </P> <P> The site will be used for a 20-classroom elementary school for about 600  students. The school, which will cost from $5 million to $6 million to build,  is expected to ease the crunch at Lexington, Madison and Mendoza elementary  schools in south Pomona.  </P></p>

Those sending the funds  moreover often indicated their specific purpose. Zaporizhzhya  Oblast, for instance, sent 100 million karbovantsi for the  construction of housing for naval servicemen, the Ternopil  Oblast Union of Officers of Ukraine sent seven million  karbovantsi for the construction of the patrol craft Bayda  Vyshnevetskyy, and the inhabitants of the city of Snyatyna in  Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast sent more than five million karbovantsi  for the construction of the small ASW ship Pokuttya. The mayor  of the city of Lutsk sent the Ukrainian Navy written  notification of the remittance of 30 million karbovantsi  simultaneously with the commissioning of the small ASW craft  Lutsk on February 12 of this year.    The naval forces of Ukraine are thus truly the people's  fleet, as is proven time and again by the financial assistance  that comes to account No. 200141400, MFO 324106 at the  Sevastopol office of the Ukrsotsbank in the city of Sevastopol.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Mark Two"] </F>   [Text] At the beginning of Bill Clinton's presidency, it  looked as though the candidate would have to expect a 4 [out of  a possible 5] for overall performance on his year-end report  card. In domestic policy, one blunder followed the other,  especially in personnel matters. To date, many of his  candidates are still in limbo between being confirmed by the  Senate and sinking into oblivion. Foreign policy did not take  place -- and if it did, it deserved the rating: "idea good,  execution inadequate."    After one year in office, Clinton deserves a 2. In domestic  policy, he has meanwhile shown a good performance. Cutting the  deficit has begun and a general health insurance and the control  of portable firearms are under way. Following Somalia (3-) and  Haiti (5), he got three good marks in foreign policy: for  concluding GATT, for ratifying the free trade agreement with  Canada and Mexico (NAFTA), and finally, Clinton's top  performance at the NATO summit.    Unfortunately, however, it is not just the bitter cold at  home that troubles him on his first anniversary. In time for  the anniversary, a special public prosecutor was appointed to  look into the Clinton's alleged embezzlements in connection with  the Whitewater company. The same thing happened to Richard  Nixon, and that is why Washington now has a Whitewatergate.  What if the affair ends up in smoke? In this case, Clinton has  the best chances of getting reelected in 1996. For, the economy  is finally recovering and, as we all know, election results are  predetermined by the purse.</p>

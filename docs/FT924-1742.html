			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Russian leaders strive to reassure on reforms: Chernomyrdin to put industry's needs first MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, his new prime minister, strove to reassure the west yesterday that the country's economic and democratic reforms remained on course. Mr Chernomyrdin also made clear, however, that he would put industry's needs at the top of his agenda and would continue controls on energy prices. Mr Yeltsin, in talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who is visiting Moscow with a government team, claimed he had succeeded in protecting the reform process in the past two weeks of stormy conflict with the Congress of People's Deputies. Mr Yeltsin said: 'Of course both congress and the president were obliged to make certain compromises, but in politics that is an ordinary occurrence.' Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former acting prime minister, who yesterday disappeared from public view after his comment that he was going to catch up on some sleep, told ministers they should stay in place if they believed further reform in their areas was possible. German officials said Mr Chernomyrdin appeared determined to reassure Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister who heads the German team discussing Russian and former-Soviet debt issues, about his role in the reform process. 'I was a member of the government not merely as a supporter but as an active participant in working out the (reform) programme. I can confirm I will carry on this course,' he was quoted as saying. Two of his six fellow ministers attending the talks were Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic relations, and Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister - both friends and colleagues of Mr Gaidar. 'I am convinced they are all of the same opinion,' Mr Chernomyrdin said of the ministers. Talks on a debt rescheduling package with the Paris Club of creditor governments would go ahead in Paris this week, he said, with Mr Shokhin leading the Russian side. Later, at a press conference, he said: 'I gave you no reason to claim that the course of reforms will be changed.' However, although he refused to specify his policies, the tenor of his remarks differed from that of Mr Gaidar. He said the chief issue was to stop the decline in industry and a certain amount of finance would be needed for that - relegating the possibility of hyperinflation to a category to be 'thought about'. He said he was a 'confident' supporter of controlled energy prices, although coal prices would rise in the future. Mr Gaidar's government had also controlled energy prices and Mr Gaidar had said he would not raise them for some time. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have pressed for prices to rise in fairly rapid stages to world levels to reduce the subsidies paid and encourage energy saving. The prime minister said he would not freeze prices or wages - although he added a 'yet' for the latter - and said he was for all kinds of property, but did not favour a 'landslide privatisation' of farms. Diplomats and officials of the international financial institutions in Moscow said they believed Mr Chernomyrdin would continue reforms in his own manner - but by giving priority to industry he made hyperinflation worries greater than before.

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: YOUSSOU N'DOUR. "THE LION." VIRGIN **:ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE(POOR) TO FIVE(A CLASSIC) STARS  </P> <P> N'Dour's association with Peter Gabriel and the Amnesty International tour  caused the Senegalese vocalist to become the most visible African musician to  the international pop audience, but "The Lion" stumbles badly.  </P> <P> Dominated by keyboards and percussion, the arrangements fashioned by producers  George Acogny, David Sancious and Gabriel (on one track) strive for an  appealingly spooky atmosphere but only occasionally succeed. The lack of  definable hooks reduces the music to a luxuriant wash of sound that often  buries N'Dour's vocals.  </P> <P> The one outstanding track here is "Old Tucson," where an intricate arrangement  is solidly anchored by Habib Faye's sonorous bass and the nagging guitar of Pap  Omar Ngom. N'Dour's rougher "Immigres" album (recorded in 1984 but released in  America last year) is a superior record -- not because it's more "authentic"  but because it crackles with the personality missing on "The Lion."

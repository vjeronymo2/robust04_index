			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Uneven share of riches fuelled Caracas revolt: An attempt by Venezuelan rebels to tap intopopular discontent THE FAILED coup in Venezuela yesterday took place in an economy that had just recorded its highest growth rate in 27 years - at 9.2 per cent Latin America's highest - but was still unable to feed nearly half its citizens more than one meal a day. It came with a balanced budget and foreign reserves of Dollars 14bn (Pounds 7.7bn). Inflation, which peaked at 89 per cent three years ago, has eased to about 30 per cent. But the coup attempt caps a crescendo of anger and frustration over the economic reforms that have written such a macro-economic success story but have failed to benefit the lives of most Venezuelans and have embittered many. The rebel troops who for several hours seized the Miraflores government palace and the La Casona presidential residence early yesterday were apparently seeking to take advantage of mounting unrest over price rises and poor public services. The rebels were no doubt emboldened by a poll published last week suggesting 81 per cent of Venezuelans had little or no confidence left in 69-year-old President Carlos Andres Perez. Mr Perez has taken pains to try to persuade his people stoically to bear the short-term pain of rising prices that are drawing them to the streets in a surging wave of strikes and protests. About a dozen students and two policemen were killed in demonstrations last year and more than 100 vehicles were burned. News of disturbances brings fears of a repeat of 1989 riots over price hikes in which at least 300 people died. The protests, observers say, stem from the government's failure to match the pace of reforms with social programmes that would ease the impact of economic adjustments. President Perez, who as populist president in the 1970s implemented many of the measures he is now trying to scrap, won full backing from international lending agencies for abandoning state interference in the economy in favour of a market-driven system. After taking office on February 2 1989, he lifted many subsidies, slashed import duties and opened the economy to foreign investment. He also sought free trade pacts with Latin American nations and the US, and started the slow task of restructuring the public sector through deregulation and privatisation. But the reforms have yet to improve the lives of most Venezuelans, almost half of whom earn little more than Dollars 100 a month. Food prices have, in many cases, doubled. An increase in petrol prices, resulting in higher bus fares, has sparked student riots. Electricity rates have risen tenfold. 'We think it's the right policy but the reforms don't seem to be helping the lower classes,' one western diplomat said recently. Among those who have seen their living standards plummet - albeit from a relatively high level - are the officers and men in a military that long prided itself on staying out of politics. Drawn primarily from the poor and middle classes, in the past few years it has seen its pay eroded by inflation and housing allowances and other privileges trimmed as part of the overall belt-tightening. The assault on the government, in which soldiers from at least six army units participated, was aimed at assassinating President Perez, who only two days earlier marked the third year of his five-year term. Little is known about the rebels other than their intention to overthrow the current administration and install a new regime. One who was captured, identified as Army Comandante Chavez, sent a televised message to the rebels who were still fighting at midday yesterday, calling on them to give up to halt further bloodshed. Their goal of seizing power in the capital 'for now, unfortunately, was not achieved', he said. He did not say - or was not allowed to say - what motivated his group's actions. The coup attempt was violently crushed by units of the Venezuelan armed forces who remained loyal to President Perez, their constitutional commander-in-chief. These loyal units represented the bulk of Venezuela's armed forces. Since the last military dictator was ousted in 1958, the great majority of Venezuela's officer corps has supported the constitutional system under which the military are subject to civilian control and are not permitted to participate in politics. Venezuela's military often takes great pains publicly to assert its allegiance to Venezuela's constitutional order, and to reject any suggestion that military adventurers are interested in assuming power by arms. The number of attempted coups, openly defiant officers and other anti-constitutional incidents had steadily diminished since the 1960s. For many years, Venezuelan officers were rewarded for their service via a system that provided them with comfortable pay, government-subsidised plans for acquiring homes, cars and furniture, as well as other benefits. Generals and admirals are retired after times in their early fifties - with substantial pensions and continued access to many benefits. Since 1989, life in the armed forces has become considerably less comfortable, especially for middle- and lower-level officers. Career officers have suffered from the same economic problems - high inflation and lower living standards - that struck most of Venezuela's civilian population since the government initiated its economic reform programme. The freshly-starched public image of the Venezuelan military has of late become grimy. Over the last several years, the armed forces have become fair game for media probes of corruption, and a number of high-ranking officers (usually retired) have been implicated in scandals.</p>

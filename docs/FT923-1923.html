			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Europe's future still clouded THE French endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty does not lift the cloud of uncertainty over the future of the European Community; nor does it mean that the path toward political and monetary union set out in the treaty will be made easier. But the prospect of a political crisis in France, which might have spread to other European capitals, has been averted. The French result does not resolve the many questions about Maastricht and the concept of European Union which the 12 Member states signed up to in December 1991. The narrowness of the verdict in France, the driving force behind European integration since the 1957 Treaty of Rome, is certain to encourage doubters elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Britain. Indeed, last week's turmoil in the financial markets, which led to Britain and Italy withdrawing from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, leaves the goal of monetary union for the Twelve by the end of the century a remote goal indeed. The financial markets imposed this reality last week; France's lukewarm support for Maastricht will not remove the doubts about the economic feasibility of the enterprise, nor the impression of a 'two-speed Europe' with the stronger currencies gathering inside a D-Mark bloc. The French vote will encourage the French and German governments, along with Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, to press ahead as fast as possible with ratification of the treaty elsewhere in Europe. The drive for solidarity may be politically understandable; but it puts Britain and Denmark - the two countries harbouring the most doubts about Maastricht's merits - directly in the firing line. The French vote poses numerous problems for Britain, which holds the rotating six month-long presidency of the EC. French rejection would have allowed Mr John Major, UK prime mInister, to call for European co-operation, but in a looser, less centralised form than in the Maastricht Treaty. Now Maastricht limps on, and a weakened Mr Major must decide whether to hobble along too. He must not only deal with the Euro-sceptics in his own Conservative party, he must also reckon with pressure from Paris and Bonn to put the Maastricht bill before parliament as soon as possible in the interest of the whole Community. The Danes are taking their time, knowing that they need several months or longer to prepare Danish public opinion for a a second referendum. A senior EC official said last week that too much pressure on the Danish people could backfire. Last night, EC officials expressed confidence that the French vote, however narrow, would restore a measure of confidence that the EC could manage its own affairs and that it had a clear vision of its future. Thus, the 12 could focus on the business at hand: the completion of the Single Market, the Delors II package for funnelling new funds to the poorer southern states such as Spain and Portugal; and, more tentatively, the aim of enlarging the Community. Last night, the mood in Brussels was relief mixed with contrition. As Mr Karel van Miert, the Belgian commissioner responsible for the environment, acknowledged that it is important for the European Community to win back public opinion, to remove the feeling that Brussels is run by a technocratic elite out of touch with ordinary people in Europe. The implication is that Brussels has learnt its lessons from the Danish and French referendums and is ready, in some as yet unspecified way, to make amends.</p>

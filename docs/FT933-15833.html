			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Political Notebook: Paying the Tory piper JUST HOURS before Mr John Major left this week for the Tokyo summit, his office quietly released a series of replies to questions from MPs about Conservative party funding. The answers, deposited without fanfare in the parliamentary press gallery, told us two things. The first was that Mr Asil Nadir had not been a guest at Downing Street during the period from November 1990 that Mr Major has been prime minister. But in the preceding five years the fugitive businessmen had crossed the threshold of No 10 six times, on four occasions to attend charity functions but on two others as a prime ministerial guest. Mr Major's second point was that he had not allowed his party to use the splendour of Downing Street to woo potential contributors to Tory coffers. The two dozen events during his premiership had all been sponsored by eminently worthy causes. That is not to say that individual contributors to party funds are no longer invited for a handshake at No 10 after depositing their cheques at Central Office (nor that Mr Major does not dine with overseas benefactors on trips abroad). But the donors are vetted more carefully. And the practice under which the party's treasurers once claimed automatic right of access to the prime minister's study to impress their most valuable catches has ended. The intended inference was clear. Mr Major had concluded that it was better not to mix so blatantly as in the past the business of government and party politics. Put another way, Tory fundraising in Lady Thatcher's day may have become a pretty murky affair but her successor had cleaned up the act. The change, it is said, explains the prime minister's visible fury in recent weeks when confronted with allegations that this or that crook or this or that oil sheikh routinely fills his party's coffers. During his time in No 10 Mr Major has been accused of many things, often justly. But even his enemies are disinclined to believe he is a crook. He is wrong though if he believes that by quietly dis-avowing the more dubious practices of the past he will solve the party's problems in the future. It is true that, barring fresh revelations, the funding issue appears to have run out of steam at Westminster. MPs and the journalists who write about them have short attention spans. The media had discredited its own case with wild and unsubstantiated allegations even before Mr Michael Mates' excursion into the world of conspiracy theory took the pack in different directions. But it will be impossible to return the genie to the bottle. Senior members of the government admit quite openly that the Conservatives can no longer accept with impunity wads of banknotes from Greek shipping magnates and Hong Kong businessmen. Who pays the piper promises to be a potent Labour slogan at the next election. The media will no longer be fobbed off with stories that the bill for the services of Saatchi and Saatchi is being paid out of the proceeds of coffee mornings in Surrey. Some ministers believe also it will be difficult if not impossible for the party to refuse to disclose large corporate donations. At the very least, central office will have to check that such contributors meet their legal obligation to declare the payments in published accounts - and return the money if they do not. The pessimists - and there are some in the cabinet - add that, whatever Mr Major may say now, the party will be driven eventually to accepting disclosure of all substantial donations whether from companies or individuals. All this is grim news for Sir Norman Fowler who is struggling to pay off an Pounds 18m central office overdraft and find money to fight the local, the European and eventual general elections. There is worse. The recent furore has alienated further the Tory grassroots activists who offer the only realistic source of alternative funding for the party. The local constituency associations have long taken a dim view of the way central office spends (they would say squanders) its money. Of the Pounds 18m they raised last year the associations handed over only Pounds 1m to Smith Square. Some refuse to contribute anything at all to central funds. Others are fiercely resisting Sir Norman's attempts to curb their autonomy through a more structured relationship with the centre. The anecdotal evidence offered by Tory MPs after recent visits to their constituencies is that opinion among the activists has now hardened further. Demoralised anyway by the government's incompetence, many have been appalled by the idea that dubious 'foreigners' have been financing the spendthrift habits of the party leadership. Mr Major perhaps should be a little less dismissive of state funding of political parties. He might need it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and his visiting Vietnamese counterpart Vo  Van Kiet failed to sign the treaty on friendly relations on  Thursday [18 June] because of contradictions over several  issues, the ITAR- TASS NEWS AGENCY reported.    It said the disputed issues include prospecting and  production of oil and natural gas by joint "Vietsovpetro"  venture, the problems of the Vietnamese community in Russia and  the Russian naval base in Vietnam's Cam Ranh.    The Vietnamese premier, who arrived in Moscow on Wednesday  for a three-day official visit, held talks with Chernomyrdin on  Thursday morning. He is also expected to meet with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin. The sides were planned to sign a  package of documents including, originally, the treaty.  [sentence as received]</p>

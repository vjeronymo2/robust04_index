			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Sport: Life after the Olympic ring cycle Olympic gold medals are tricky. Or rather, life after a gold medal can be tricky. Like an Oxbridge degree, gold medals open doors. But what happens next depends to a large degree on the ability of the athlete to translate commitment and drive into new fields, yet retain the humility of a beginner. Many believe they can walk on water - and promptly sink. 'In the outside world it's important to recognise your own limitations. Sports people are very bad at that,' says Chris Boardman, the young and virtually unknown British track cyclist who won a gold medal two years ago at the Barcelona Olympics. 'That's because, when you're competing, it's essential to believe you can do anything.' During their event, Olympic champions admit no doubts. But Boardman's career may have entered a new phase on Saturday with the inaugural meeting at Britain's new Pounds 9m velodrome in Manchester, where he triumphed over Francis Moreau of France in a fascinating re-match with the man he beat in Sicily recently to become world 4,000 metres pursuit champion. In the afternoon's other crowd-pleaser, Yvonne McGregor, winner of Britain's only cycling gold at this year's Commonwealth Games, was beaten by world pursuit champion Marion Clignet. Although the fact was well-disguised from the public, neither event would have happened without the involvement of Boardman wearing, for the first time, a promoter's hat. Five weeks ago the original promoters withdrew from the meeting. As this is Britain's first-ever purpose-built, indoor cycling stadium, it may be safe to assume that Britain's market for indoor sprint events is relatively untested. Many people have warned the British Cycling Federation, which is now based in the vast Manchester stadium and will pay its considerable operating costs, that it may have been handed a poisoned chalice. What is certain is that an inaugural event without stars, consisting of largely unknown amateur riders in national teams, would have given the velodrome a send-off to match that of the Titanic. 'Chris would have ridden in the English team, but to be honest it might have seemed a bit like Linford Christie jogging in the park on a Sunday,' said Peter Woodworth, who is Boardman's business mentor and co-director of Beyond Level Four, the company they established to maximise Boardman's potential. 'I brought Francis and the two girls here to add a bit of sparkle to what should be a very special event for British cycling,' says Boardman, 26. 'It sounds corny but it is a chance to put something back into the sport. However, once I started to be involved in doing this, I began to think that in time my company could have a future in sports promotion.' After his Barcelona triumph - riding that futuristic carbon-fibre bicycle built by Lotus - the popular media made much of Boardman's status as an unemployed cabinet-maker launched into sports fame. Is it not an even bigger step in just two years from dole queue to becoming the Mr Fixit of Europe's velodromes? 'The dole business was a myth with some truth in it,' says Boardman, who possesses a remarkably analytical mind. 'I had decided to give up my job in order to invest the time in training to be an international sportsman.' That decision paid off, but others lay ahead. 'When they hang it around your neck, you know your gold medal has the potential to give you security for life, but it all depends on how you use it. It's a desperately big responsibility. At the start I avoided making any decisions because I was too afraid of making a mistake.' Ironically, among Boardman's priorities was to remain an amateur. 'It's a horrendously hard life as a professional cyclist and I wanted to stay in my comfy niche,' he says. However, Peter Woodworth, an ex-cyclist from the same Merseyside club as Boardman (although a generation older) and a businessman, persuaded the gold medallist that he could not stand still in the relatively tiny world of amateur sprint cycling. Last season Boardman made his Tour de France debut in the prestigious Gan team. Wearing the legendary maillot jeune (yellow jersey) after the first stage was the stuff of fantasy, yet it happened. Although he stopped short of the mountain stages, Gan were impressed enough with the newcomer to plan next season's road-racing team around the Englishman. Rumours that Boardman is now earning the Pounds 1m a year paid to retired team-leader Greg LeMond are laughed off. But Woodworth agrees that next year his protege will be the best-paid second-year professional on the Tour. Boardman says he is financially on target to retire when he is 32 - but won't, because he is a happily self-diagnosed workaholic. My final question had to be about that name. Beyond Level Four? It sounds like something from the further reaches of software engineering, or a San Francisco PR company. It emerges that Boardman has for years prepared for races on a unique four-level training regime. The first level is a simple 'recovery ride', the fourth 'a period of maximal intensity'. 'The name means a lot to us,' he said. 'We don't yet know what's beyond Level Four.' And then he laughed.</p>

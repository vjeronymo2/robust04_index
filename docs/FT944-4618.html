			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (3): Welcome mat for foreign investors Zimbabwe's attitude to foreign investment has changed markedly since the 1980s, when it was ambivalent at best and often plain hostile, writes Michael Holman. But trade liberalisation, the abolition of most foreign exchange controls, the end of all but a handful of price controls, and other reforms have changed the picture. Together with the fact that President Robert Mugabe himself laid out the welcome mat for foreign investors at a London conference earlier this year, the business environment has been transformed. At its offices in the centre of Harare, officials of the Zimbabwe Investment Centre promise to provide a speedy, and if possible, one-stop service to investors. Established in 1989 as a department within the ministry of finance, since 1992 the centre has been an autonomous institution, advising on the incentives on offer, ranging from tax breaks to industrial sites on a concessional basis. Its officials paint a picture of Zimbabwe at the heart of regional groupings which represent a potential market of over 250m people with a combined GDP of some Dollars 155bn. Labour costs are as much as third below South Africa's, without the powerful trade unions which are so influential there. The centre promises that projects up to Dollars 10m will get its approval within a week, provided there is no potential health or environmental hazard, and its staff will assist the investor to obtain the licences or permits that may be necessary. Bigger investments will take longer to clear, but the days of red tape and implicit disapproval are over, the centre insists. Unfortunately, Mr Mugabe has not always made their task easy. Recent comments which have disquieted the investment community include his apparent reaffirmation of faith in socialism, made at the mid-year congress of the ruling party, though party officials maintain that he is committed to the economic reform programme. No less disconcerting to some observers was Mr Mugabe's distinction between 'indigenous' businessmen - ie white - and 'indigenous indigenous' businessmen - ie black - made in the course of a discussion on the need to 'indigenise' the economy. What the president has so far failed to spell out is how the government proposes to redress past inequities which have left the minority community in a dominant economic role, while maintaining the confidence of this vital group and not frightening away foreign investment. Most investors are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, not necessarily because they doubt Mr Mugabe, but because they want to find out how post-apartheid South Africa will settle down. Since the London conference in May, and until August this year, UK investment flows have totalled a modest ZDollars 101m (around Pounds 6m), according to the centre. The biggest foreign investment, however, is the ZDollars 1.8bn platinum mining project 80km south west of Harare, financed by Delta Gold and BHP Minerals of Australia. This boost notwithstanding, net foreign investment since independence in 1980 has not reached three figures. Zimbabwe Investment Centre, Royal Mutual House, 45 Baker Avenue, Box 5950, Harare.

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y's US unit needs at least an extra Dollars 30m soon OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S US subsidiary will soon need at least Dollars 30m more than its cash-flow is generating if it is to carry on servicing its US debt and avoid a possible US bankruptcy filing. The Canadian property developer, which has already placed its Canary Wharf project into administration in the UK and filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada, is hoping to sell a major Manhattan property and a series of financial assets before the end of this month in order to raise the needed cash. The danger of O&amp;Y bank creditors breaking ranks was highlighted a few days ago when Svenska Handelsbanken of Sweden brought a lawsuit in New York demanding the prepayment of a Dollars 12.5m unsecured line of credit to O&amp;Y. O&amp;Y is due to respond in court to the Svenska legal action later this month. A ruling requiring O&amp;Y to pay Svenska could eventually trigger cross-default mechanisms among US bank creditors. Negotiations concerning the sale of an O&amp;Y 34-storey Park Avenue building - to Mutual of America, an insurance company - are understood to be at an advanced phase. But the sale, if it goes through, is expected to provide only enough net cash for O&amp;Y to pay off more than Dollars 100m of mortgage loans on the property that are owed to a bank consortium led by First Chicago. The sale of financial assets is meanwhile being pursued in order to generate the Dollars 30m of cash needed to make principal and interest payments on other New York properties. O&amp;Y is in technical default on several New York mortgage obligations, including a missed principal payment on its Liberty Plaza building in lower Manhattan and a missed interest payment on a Euroyen bond related to Tower B of the World Financial Centre. In both of these cases, O&amp;Y has obtained a temporary standstill agreement with creditors and is seeking to restructure its debt obligations.</p>

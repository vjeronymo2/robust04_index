			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLES TO DROP MAY DAY PARADE; IT'S A BORE AND EXPENSIVE  </P> <P> Poland's Communist Party is dropping the traditional May Day parade in Warsaw  this year because party members complained it was too long, boring and  expensive.  </P> <P> It will be replaced by a rally in a central square lasting no more than 40  minutes, followed by folk dancing, fairs and sports, the party daily Trybuna  Ludu said over the weekend.  </P> <P> In addition, the independent Solidarity trade union, restored to legality last  week after a seven-year ban, has received permission to hold its own parade in  a northern district of the capital.  </P> <P> The official May Day parades, long a major event in the Communist calendar,  lasted more than three hours. Tens of thousands marched through the streets  behind party leaders and the event was televised live.  </P> <P> "For a long time now, and in particular last year, the Warsaw party committee  has received letters expressing doubts about the traditional way of celebrating  May Day," Trybuna Ludu said.  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour slams 'sneaky' tax rises 'SNEAKY' TAX increases such as the freezing of personal allowances and the limiting to 20 per cent of tax relief on mortgage interest will yield the Treasury as much as Pounds 2.7bn in 1995/96, Labour said yesterday, David Owen writes. As the Finance Bill implementing the spring Budget started its third day in committee, Mr Nick Brown, a Labour frontbench Treasury spokesman, accused the government of 'scouring the Treasury files' for ways of raising taxes without anybody noticing. Mr Brown argued that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hoped people would not notice the tax relief adjustments because mortgage rates had come down. Labour objected 'very strongly' to the government's enactment of tax changes that were 'noticeably regressive.' There was support for Labour's stance from Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, who argued that the government's extension of the 20 per cent band of income tax was not a measure to help the lowest paid but to raise more revenue. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, retorted that allowances should not be looked at in isolation from other Budget changes. The additional burden to be imposed by the Budget package was being 'fairly shared' right across the income scale. A Labour amendment clearing the way for personal allowances to be uprated in line with inflation was defeated by 277 votes to 236, a government majority of 41.</p>

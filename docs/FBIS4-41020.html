			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol must become Ukraine's naval stronghold,  while the Russian Navy can be deployed there as a navy of a  foreign power, Ukrainian Navy Commander Vladimir Beskorovainy  said.    Speaking in Sevastopol on Tuesday, he said Russia could be  allowed to deploy its navy there for a period of 15 to 25 years  after an appropriate leasing agreement was signed.    The commander hopes that the problem of sharing the Black  Sea  Fleet (BSF) will have been sorted out by the end of next year as  envisaged by the Yalta agreement.    On Speaker of Parliament Alexander Moroz's call for joint  BSF  command to be maintained, Beskorovainy described the task as  technically feasible. However, he stressed that the question  was purely political amounting to the creation of a military  alliance in fact.    Russia and Ukraine ended the final round of talks in Kiev on  9 June by compiling a list of warships to be shared with each  other. However, the question of deployment and sharing the  existing infrastructures remains unresolved.    Beskorovainy also said that a Ukrainian patrol ship would be  sent to France to take part in a final parade at Rouan early  next month dedicated to fifty years since the allied nations'  operation in Normandy.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Canada to reform retail taxes Proposals by a House of Commons committee to reform Canada's controversial Goods and Services Tax (GST) will form the basis for an overhaul of the country's retail sales taxes, Mr Paul Martin, finance minister, said yesterday. The suggested reforms fall far short, however, of promises by the now-ruling Liberal party during last year's election campaign to scrap the 7 per cent GST, which was introduced by the former Progressive Conservative government three years ago in the face of a public uproar. The Commons finance committee was asked to draw up alternatives shortly after the Liberals took office last November. Among its main recommendations is a proposal that the GST, to be renamed the National Value Added Tax, should be made less visible by including it in the retail price of goods and services, rather than adding it at the cash register. The most politically sensitive part of the report is likely to be a proposal that the federal tax be harmonised with retail sales taxes levied by nine of Canada's 10 provinces. Mr Jim Peterson, the committee's chairman, described the present system as 'the worst sales tax jungle in the world. We have 10 different systems using different bases, different rates, different reporting periods and different bureaucracies.' With the exception of Quebec, the provinces have so far resisted Ottawa's efforts to roll their taxes, which vary from 7 per cent to 12 per cent, into the GST. The GST was introduced in January 1991 to replace a manufacturers' sales tax, and accelerate a shift from direct to indirect taxation.</p>

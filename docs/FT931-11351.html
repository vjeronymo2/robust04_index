			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: British Maastricht vote on the line BRITISH VOTERS are to have their say on Maastricht after all. At least, those prepared to pay for the privilege. Baroness Thatcher was at the Palace of Westminster yesterday to help launch Dial For Democracy - a telephone referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The idea is to give eligible voters the chance to express a view by dialling one of two 0891 numbers. Backers of the exercise hope both to build up a picture of how the British electorate would vote and to increase pressure on the government for a referendum. The former prime minister was one of seven cross-party Commons and Lords representatives who hosted yesterday's launch. The Euro-sceptic persuasion was ensured of a comfortable majority on the platform by the presence of Mr Peter Shore and Mr Bryan Gould, both formerly on the Labour front bench, and of Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor, in addition to Lady Thatcher herself. Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP, waved the flag for the Maastricht enthusiasts. In serious if belligerent form, Lady Thatcher interspersed the usual arguments deployed by referendum proponents with more characteristically stentorian calls to arms. 'We alone of the people in Europe have not been invaded or occupied for 1,000 years,' the audience were reminded. 'It to me is unthinkable that the people should not be heard.' Her speech ended with a plug for one of her favourite publications. 'We hope that all newspapers will print these numbers every day. One newspaper has already agreed to do so and that is The Sun.' The organisers' intention is that the poll will be non-profit-making, with proceeds from the telephone calls used to minimise instances of improper, under-age or multiple voting. The organisers say lines will remain open for at least a month. Yesterday's event culminated with Lady Thatcher appearing to cast the first vote of the poll using a pristine white telephone provided expressly for the purpose. On later inspection, the telephone appeared to be dead, so she will presumably have to phone again to record her vote. If she does she will of course have to pay; subsequent experimentation revealed that calls last for two minutes and 35 seconds. They are billed at 48p per minute outside cheap rates.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman -- The Lower House of Parliament on Wednesday  [4 May] cut short a regular session at the request of 31  deputies who demanded the House condemn and protest the  "humiliation" of the self-rule deal signed in Cairo between  Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)    It is not acceptable that the House discuss the draft sales  tax law "on this black day, the day of the sale of Palestine,"  said the deputies in a signed statement, demanding that the  House hold a special meeting to discuss the agreement and  condemn the "Cairo agreement of humiliation."    But the meeting ended in disarray after most deputies walked  out before a special committee assigned with drafting a  statement on the issue finished its work. The House did not  adopt the statement draft by the committee and it was considered  to reflect the views of only those who signed it.    About 20 deputies signed the statement despite efforts by  Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies who chased their fellow  parliamentarians across the corridors of Palriament to get their  signatures. House Speaker Tahir al-Masri did not sign, which  condemns the agreement as a "deviation from the commitment to a  comprehensive solution and a subjugation to Zionists and  American pressures."    The statement also said Jordan, which "did not give up Arab  rights despite the pressures and temptations, is not responsible  for the concessions (in the Cairo) Agreement."    The IAF deputies, however, criticized the government for  attending the signing ceremony of the self-rule accord because  that made it "a witness to the sale of Palestine."    "We condemn the agreement and we condemn those who attended  the signing ceremony," IAF spokesman Hamzah Masur told the  JORDAN TIMES.    Mr. Mansur expressed the IAF's disappointment with the  reported change in the government's position regarding attending  the signing ceremony, saying "we were saddened by the change."    But Deputy 'Abd al-Karim al-Kabiriti said: "No one can  outbid the Jordanian position (on the Palestinian issue) which  was manifest in His Majesty King Husayn's recent speech during  the celebrations of the completion of the restoration work on  the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem."    Mr. al-Kabariti said the Jordanian position is in harmony  with that of the Jordanian people and the Kingdom's  participation in the peace talks was part of a national strategy  stemming from the fact that "we have to negotiate so that we  will be players and not a playing field."    Deputy Tujan Faysal attributed the failure of the House to  adopt the statement condemning the Cairo accord to the  unwillingness of some deputies to "anger the government, the  United States, Egypt or even (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzaq)  Rabin," but other deputies saw in Mrs. Faysal's statement a  distortion of the stand of the House.    Most of the 20 deputies who spoke during the meeting were  opposed to the agreement and no one has the right to question  the position of the lawmakers, said Deputy 'Abd al-Ra'uf  al-Rawabdah in reaction to Mrs. Faysal's statement.    Parliamentary sources said most of the deputies walked out  of  the meeting in protest against giving the floor to IAF deputies  and other opponents of the agreement while others were excluded.    While some lawmakers said the House failed to adopt the  statement due "to outside pressure," others said that the  self-rule agreement is a Palestinian affair signed by the  representative of the Palestinian people and hence their refusal  to sign the statement condemning it.    Mr. al-Kabariti stressed the urgency of formulating a  national strategy to counter the negative economic impact of the  agreement on Jordan, reiterating rejection of partial deals that  could threaten "our economy and our national unity."    Other lawmakers said the "PLO has burnt its bridges with the  Palestinians of the diaspora and become subordinate to Israel"  by signing the self-rule accord. They echoed Mr. al-Kabariti in  saying lawmakers should focus on the impact of the accord on the  interests of Jordan.    The House, which cannot discuss the issue during its current  sessions because it is constitutionally restricted to the items  on the agenda during extraordinary sessions, will hold another  meeting today to further discuss whether it will adopt the  statement condemning the accord.    Islamic Action Front deputies told the JORDAN TIMES they  would try to get the signatures of more than half the members of  the legislature on the statement so that it becomes an official  document of the House.    But Parliamentary sources expected the IAF to fail in its  bid  because most of the deputies who walked out on Wednesday's  meeting has taken a decision not to show up for Thursday's  meeting "in continuation of their protest against not being  given the chance to speak."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Gallup Institute article for BERLINGSKE TIDENDE and Danish </F> Radio: "Nordics Welcome in EU"]    [Text] Gallup has studied [Danish] popular opinion on the  entry of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria into the European  Union (EU).    A majority 54 percent of the population believe that Nordic  cooperation will be strengthened with the entry of the three  Nordic neighbors into the EU. Only 15 percent think that  cooperation will be weakened inside the EU, while 25 percent --  or one in four -- expect no change. In view of the many  initiatives over the past four decades in Nordic cooperation --  including the Nordic Council -- it is quite interesting that a  majority of Danes think that the EU can become a catalyst  further promoting Nordic cooperation.    As many as 62 percent of yes voters in the 18 May [1993  referendum] think that cooperation will be strengthened, while  only 8 percent see it becoming weaker. Among the no voters there  are somewhat fewer, specifically 43 percent -- who see a  strengthening of Nordic cooperation, while more, namely 28  percent, think it will be weakened. Accordingly, among both yes  and no voters there are more who believe in a strengthening than  in a weakening.    This positive attitude toward a peculiar "Nordic dimension"  is also seen in that a large majority think it good that the  Nordic countries become members in the EU. Sixty-eight percent  are happy with a Swedish membership, 69 percent with a Norwegian  membership, and 63 percent with a Finnish membership. At the  same time, few -- namely around 12-13 percent -- think these  countries' membership in the EU is a bad prospect. The fourth  applicant country, Austria, is welcomed by 62 percent. Regarding  Iceland, a Nordic nonapplicant, two out of three Danes (66  percent) say they would welcome that country if it wanted to  apply for EU membership.    If Danes are asked what they think the results will be in  the  EU-entry referendums, it appears that a majority does not think  Norway will follow the other three applicants into the EU.  Fifty-five percent of Danes believe that the Norwegian  referendum will end with a no, while 34 percent -- or one in  three -- believe in a Norwegian yes. On the other hand, most  Danes think that referendums in the three other applicant  countries will end in a yes vote for membership in the EU.    The Gallup survey was conducted 19-25 May 1994. A  representative sample of 1,004 Danes over age 18 were  interviewed by phone.  <H5>  Nordic Cooperation Will Be Strengthened Within the EU </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |"Do you think that Nordic cooperation will become strengthened, become weake-|  |r, or remain unchanged, if Sweden, Norway, and Finland become members in the |  |European Union?"

Forecasts last week ranged from SFr545m to SFr950m, compared with SFr1.55bn for the first half of 1993. The following day brings interims from CS Holding. Its principal operating subsidiary, Credit Suisse, has already reported a 27 per cent decline in gross profits before tax and provisions, notes Hoare Govett, which thinks that a net profit of SFr700m for the group, against SFr882m previously, would be a reasonable result.</p>

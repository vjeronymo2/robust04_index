			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> EINSTURZENDE NEUBAUTEN TRIMS ITS HARD ROCK  </P> <P> Einsturzende Neubauten has cut way back on the hardware. At the German band's  concert at Helter Skelter on Thursday -- a rare L.A. appearance that was a big  event for the local sonic underground -- there was little of its trademark  arsenal: No chain saws or air hammers, no incendiary activity.  </P> <P> In fact, the group spoofed its pyrotechnic past, dousing the stage with fluid  from a gasoline can and striking a match before revealing, "Is vater!" Funny  guys.  </P> <P> There was one power-drill solo on the amplified spring set-up, a shower of  sparks from a sanding wheel, some pipes to pound on the floor. But essentially,  the veteran band showed that it doesn't need heavy machinery to construct its  harrowing environments -- just a front line of bass, guitar and vocals, backed  by an assortment of electronics. It helped that the beats, whether driving and  danceable or slow and ominous, were the product of people hitting things with  sticks rather than keying a computer.  </P> <P> Blixa Bargeld, looking like a tortured, punk-rock Baryshnikov, sang  passionately in German, but no translation was necessary for the chaos and  disintegration depicted in his four colleagues' panoramas of pain: Pounding,  industrial disco and jaw-dropping storms of whooshing, squealing noise. The  demolition derby peaked with a fluttering rumble that put fissures in your  collarbone, gripped your throat so you couldn't swallow and seemed to lift you  off the floor.  </P> <P> Einsturzende Neubauten (rough translation: "collapsing new buildings") is the  indisputable, defining force of its genre. Time and familiarity might have  dulled the novelty, but in today's world, its combination of Germanic torment  and Dada defiance still rings true. RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

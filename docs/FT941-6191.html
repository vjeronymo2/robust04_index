			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Better exports lift Dutch output: Economic watch Dutch manufacturing orders rose by 2.5 per cent in January over December, but were still down 4.7 per cent from a year earlier. The January rise was consistent with an emerging recovery in industrial output, with the latest survey of businesses by the Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS) showing widespread expectations for an improvement in output over the next three months. The Nederlandsche Bank's January index of leading indicators, published early last month, also projected that the economy would continue gaining strength in the next few months. Domestic orders to Dutch industry fell slightly in January, but those from abroad were high enough to compensate for the drop. The Dutch economy is heavily reliant on exports. The biggest increase in new orders was to the intermediate and semi-finished goods sector, with orders up both at home and abroad in the semi-finished goods sector. Austria's current account deficit for 1993 was a provisional Sch10.6bn (Pounds 592m). At 0.5 per cent of GDP the deficit was well inside the range considered normal, the National Bank said. The president of the BDA federation of German employers said unemployment could grow to 4.5m this year, from about 4m in January, thanks to poor demand for German products at home and abroad.</p>

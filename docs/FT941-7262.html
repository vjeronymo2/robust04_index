			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / ICI rises 78% after drive to cut costs A weak pound and cost savings from restructuring pushed ICI's full-year pre-tax profits up 78 per cent to Pounds 290m. The figure excludes businesses sold or demerged last year, notably the drugs company Zeneca, and compares with Pounds 163m in 1992. The first year-end figures since the Zeneca demerger were in line with expectations and were accompanied by a cautiously optimistic trading statement. Turnover rose 12 per cent to Pounds 8.43bn, mainly because of favourable exchange rates. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said restructuring efforts had enhanced pre-interest profits by a further Pounds 150m last year. Sterling's weakness had added Pounds 75m. After payments from Zeneca, ICI had accumulated year-end cash of almost Pounds 1.7bn. Debt was about Pounds 2.2bn and gearing 10.3 per cent, compared with 11.9 per cent in 1992 on a pro forma basis. 'This obviously places the company in a very strong position to capitalise on the opportunities ahead,' said Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive. ICI was looking at the possibility of buying parts of the troubled German industrial group Metallgesell-schaft. There have been no direct talks between the two companies, but they are linked through Ms Ellen Schneider-Lenne, an ICI board member, who also sits on the board of Deutsche Bank, which has a stake in Metallgesellschaft. ICI's markets in continental Europe 'remained difficult', said Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, but growth in Asia-Pacific, the US and UK should mean improvements in 1994. Earnings per share were 20.4p against 3.2p and the company held its total dividend unchanged at 27.5p per share. Mr Hampel said the company's policy was to have earnings of twice the dividend payout. The industrial chemicals business, which accounted for 44 per cent of turnover, made a Pounds 106m trading profit compared with a Pounds 17m loss thanks to better volumes, lower fixed costs and exchange rate benefits. There were signs of improvement in PVC and the new plant in Taiwan making raw materials for polyester fibres was working at full capacity, said Mr Hampel. All sectors of chemicals improved except for tioxide, which was hit by low prices. The paints division, which represented one fifth of ICI's turnover, suffered from tough trading conditions in North America and Europe which cut trading profits by Pounds 12m to Pounds 103m. Materials made an Pounds 18m profit after breaking even in 1992. It was boosted by restructuring benefits, better volumes and a contribution from the acrylics business acquired in July last year from US chemicals company Du Pont. Explosives saw profits fall to Pounds 52m from Pounds 59m, with growth in Australian mining markets offset by weak demand in the US and UK. Exceptional items included Pounds 106m for the loss-making US composites business Fiberite, the majority relating to goodwill, and a Pounds 31m provision covering the closure of Electroclor, a subsidiary in Argentina. ICI shares fell 2p to 750p. Lex, Page 24; Metallgesellschaft, Page 24 and 31</p>

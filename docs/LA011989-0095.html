			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DECIDES JURY CAN HEAR CLAIM AGAINST HUTTON  </P> <P> A jury -- not an arbitration panel -- must decide whether Shearson Lehman  Hutton violated federal securities laws in the way it handled investments of  public funds by Lawndale and other government entities, a federal judge has  ruled.  </P> <P> The ruling is a partial victory for Lawndale, which alleges in a lawsuit that  it lost $1.6 million after its treasurer at the time, Ray Wood, placed city  funds in a highly speculative investment handled by a Hutton broker.  </P> <P> Hutton has declined to comment, except to say that the losses were caused by a  decline in the bond market in 1987.  </P> <P> In an effort to recover the money, the city joined with several other  government entities in filing a suit alleging, among other things, that the  brokerage firm put public funds in risky securities and misrepresented the  nature of the investment. Both actions were violations of federal law,  according to the suit.  </P> <P> Joining Lawndale in the suit, filed a year ago in U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles, are the cities of San Marino and Palmdale, Palmdale's redevelopment  agency, and the Three Valleys Municipal Water District in the San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> Last spring, Hutton asked the court to force the case into arbitration, which  is more restrictive than the court system. Hutton noted that the investment  agreements call for settling disputes out of court and prevent the cities and  the other agencies from suing the brokerage.  </P> <P> Lawndale countered that former Treasurer Wood was not authorized to sign such  an agreement, and that in any case, federal law at the time allowed such suits  when a violation of federal law was alleged.  </P> <P> In a 20-page ruling, issued Jan. 11, U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer said  an arbitration panel should decide whether the agreements were void but said  the court should hear the allegation that federal laws were violated.  </P> <P> "We're delighted," said William Wynder, the plaintiffs' attorney, in an  interview Wednesday. "It would be nice to have the case all in one forum so we  don't have this dog-and-pony show twice . . . but we may end up getting two  bites of the apple."  </P> <P> Hutton attorney Stephen Young said his client was studying the judge's decision  to determine whether it can be appealed and, if so, whether to do so. A hearing  is scheduled Feb. 16 to determine how the trial should proceed.  </P> <P> Although a major portion of the case is now expected to be tried in court,  Young did not view the ruling as a setback for Hutton. He said Hutton is  convinced that it not only will win in the arbitration matter, but will prevail  in federal court as well.  </P> <P> "I think the best analogy is that we asked for a whole loaf of bread, and we  got a half loaf of bread," Young said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, which seeks $8.4 million in compensatory damages and $16 million  in punitive damages, accuses two brokerage companies, Hutton and First  Investment Securities Inc., and six brokers of violating federal and state  securities laws. Among the brokers is William E. Parodi Sr., who worked for  Hutton when he approached the plaintiffs with the investment proposals. Parodi  has denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Wood was fired from his Lawndale job after the losses were discovered. He is  not involved in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> When told of Rymer's ruling, Lawndale City Councilwoman Carol Norman said  Wednesday that "any favorable ruling is obviously something that will thrill  all of us in Lawndale."  </P> <P> The $1.6 million that the city claims to have lost represented about half of  its reserve fund. "Lawndale is just a small city, and that is a considerable  amount of money," Norman said.  </P> <P> Attorney Wynder said that turning the entire dispute over to an arbitrator  could have hurt the plaintiffs. Under the arbitration system commonly used to  settle disputes between brokers and clients, the case would be heard by five  people: three representatives of the public and two with some connection to the  brokerage community.  </P> <P> Unlike a court decision, the arbitration panel's decision could not be appealed  on issues of fact, and there would be no written record of the proceeding.  Also, fact-finding procedures are more limited in arbitration than in a court  proceeding.  </P> <P> Wynder and Lawndale's city attorney, David Aleshire, say the FBI and the  Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Hutton's handling of the  investments. Those agencies have declined to comment.  </P></p>

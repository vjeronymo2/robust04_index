			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Technology: An X-ray provides proof of pudding Christmas in Finland means a cake with a gold coin in it - but how does the manufacturer ensure that all consumers are given an even chance of finding it? One has solved the problem by using a new range of X-ray detection equipment to ensure that the coin is close to the centre of the cake and not too near the surface. A similar difficulty, in reverse, is faced by producers of Christmas puddings in the UK. How can they check for contamination by pieces of glass, stone or metal in a dense mixture of fruit, nuts and suet? TransTec, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering company, came to the aid of the Finnish cake company and has just launched an X-ray machine with which it is hoping to make waves in the food industry. X-ray imaging of food has been available for some years, and simple metal detection equipment for decades. But tougher food hygiene regulations and scares about contamination of products such as baby food have combined with developments in image processing technology to create a new market opportunity, says Sami Ahmed, executive director of TransTec. The food passes through Trans-Tec's Ultrascan System on a conveyor belt travelling at up to 300ft a minute. The machine uses an image intensifier to convert the X-ray beam - which is a tiny fraction of the amount used for irradiating food - into an optical signal for analysis by an image processing system supplied by Data Cell of Reading. It takes about a week to work out the software for each food item, says Mark Graves, an image processing expert at TransTec, but once programmed the machine can switch between foods quickly. It costs between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 100,000. But TransTec hopes that, once the food industry has been convinced that the machine will work reliably, it will buy in bulk. TransTec is now working on the next stage - which will use two detectors working at right-angles to build up a 3-D image of the food. The UK company and its European partners have received a Pounds 2m grant from the European Union to develop the machine.</p>

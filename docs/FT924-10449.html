			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / France cuts repurchase rate to 10.5% FRANCE yesterday proved that it has emerged unscathed from last month's currency crisis when the Bank of France announced it was bringing its 5-10 day repurchase rate back down to 10.5 per cent after temporarily raising it to protect the franc. The bank raised the repurchase rate, the interest rate charged to borrowers of last resort, from 10.5 to 13 per cent at the height of September's crisis to stave off attacks on the French currency from foreign exchange dealers. Yesterday's decision to reduce the repurchase rate indicates that the Bank of France and the French government, are confident that the currency is now safe from the threat of market pressure. The decision to lower the rate has been welcomed by France's banks, which faced a steep increase in their own borrowing costs because of the increase. The rise in the repurchase rate, which was not accompanied by an increase in base rates, triggered an immediate jump in overnight money market rates. If the repurchase rate had not returned to its original level the Bank of France and the government, which is usually consulted on rate changes, would have faced pressure from the banks to raise base rates to alleviate the financial pressure on them. The government, up for re-election next spring, would have been reluctant to countenance an increase in base rates, given high real interest rates are one of the chief causes of the sluggish state of the French economy. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said yesterday he would 'take initiatives' as part of an EC effort to promote economic growth but gave no details. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, minister for industry and foreign trade, said Europe should take joint action to reduce interest rates and promote big public infrastructure investments.</p>

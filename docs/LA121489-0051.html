			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND 'AFTER THE WALL,' WHAT OF SOCIALISM?  </P> <P> I was delighted to read the extremely incisive, well-written "After the Wall"  (Dec. 6). It did an excellent job of addressing a question that various family  members and I have been batting around for several weeks, namely how Marxist  professors are reacting to the worldwide celebration of communism's collapse in  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> My cousin, a philosophy professor in Orange County, reports that his extreme  leftist colleagues are basically laying low and maintaining a conspicuous  silence.  </P> <P> LORNA BREMNER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

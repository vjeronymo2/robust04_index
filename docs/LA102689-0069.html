			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER / ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Shoot My Cat, Please  </P> <P> Among the dozens of 1990 calendars out on the market is one published by  Recycled Paper Products called, naturally, "Cats," which features portraits of  the felines in lush, romantic settings. The cat-catching photographer, Koren  Trygg of Studio City, specializes in shooting animals for greeting card covers.  </P> <P> "Ducks are by far the worst animals to work with," she says. A line of greeting  cards introduced last year called Wise Quacks (also by Recycled Paper Products)  features her duck photos.  </P> <P> "You have to work really fast and shoot a lot of film, because they're always  moving," she explains. "You've got no control, and they respond to nothing,  like food or simple commands. And these were Hollywood ducks that I worked  with! I mean, they came from an animal agency!" Complicating the problem of  constant motion is the problem of constant elimination. The ducks soil the set  frequently.  </P> <P> Trygg finds dogs the easiest animals to work with. "Dogs almost always respond  to food, and they follow simple commands," she says.  </P> <P> Straddling the middle ground are cats. "A lot of times they just turn their  backs to you, because they know what you want. Some cats you can bribe with  turkey, or you call their name, and when they look up you shoot them. But if  they don't respond to food, you know you're through for the day," Trygg says.  </P> <P> The photographer likes to use her friends' and family's cats along with her  own. "The cat sets the pace. Sometimes you won't get the shot that day, so you  have to set up all over again another day."  </P> <P> She has used one of her own cats as a model so many times, he's even gotten fan  mail.  </P> <P> Happy 105th Birthday  </P> <P> The first question you have to ask someone who just hit the big 105 is, "What  is the secret to living a long life?"  </P> <P> Ureva Mann, who lives at the Fallbrook Retirement Center in Canoga Park and  turned 105 Oct. 11, answers, "I always worked. I always had jobs. I always had  something to do."  </P> <P> To be fair, longevity runs in her family. She was the youngest child, and five  of her six siblings lived into their 90s.  </P> <P> Nowadays, she says she can't read or write or see very well, but she's a  veritable speed demon in her walker. "I walk like I do everything else: If I do  it, I do it as quick as I can," she says, adding, "I exercise a lot." Other  than being hard of hearing, her health is excellent.  </P> <P> She thinks the greatest invention she's seen in her lifetime is the microwave  oven.  </P> <P> What advice does she have for young people? "I don't think they'd take it if I  could give it. They're all too independent nowadays," she asserts.  </P> <P> Well, then, what about the shape the world's in? Is it getting better or worse?  "It hasn't gotten any better, but I wouldn't say it's gotten any worse," she  waffles. The difference, she says, is that "people were very satisfied with the  world when I was young. They didn't all go around saying the world was in bad  shape."  </P> <P> Mann has lived in Southern California since 1952 and moved into the Fallbrook  Retirement Center when she turned 100. She has one son, five grandchildren and  two great-grandchildren.  </P> <P> As for vices, hers are limited. "I started smoking cigarettes at 35, and I quit  at 60. I never drank much. Wine is my hardest drink, and I don't drink it  often," she says.  </P> <P> Mums in Bloom  </P> <P> The last week of October through November is prime time for blooming  chrysanthemums, notes Mamoru Tashima, owner of Sunnyslope Mum Gardens in Lake  View Terrace. "This is my busiest season," says Tashima, whose wholesale/retail  business has been in the San Fernando Valley for 34 years.  </P> <P> People tend to gravitate toward yellow mums. "Yellow is brighter than the  bronze, reds, pinks and whites. Those aren't real sharp colors, and they tend  to fade in the background. But you get a bright yellow, and it stands out --  you know it's there," he says.  </P> <P> If you are planting colors other than yellow, put them in a spot that people  pass by at close range, rather than having to view them from afar, Tashima  suggests.  </P> <P> Mums bloom on short days and warm nights. Some people make the mistake of  planting them too close to street lights, so that the mums never get the  requisite hours of darkness they require each night to bloom again the  following year.  </P> <P> At-Home Dining  </P> <P> The formal sit-down dinner is coming back in style. It's formal in that the  good china is brought out, but it's not formal in spirit. Instead it's fun,  relaxed and intimate.  </P> <P> "Because people are investing in homes, they want to use them -- they prefer to  stay there rather than go out," says Shirley Mae Epps, china and crystal buyer  for David Orgell, which has stores in Northridge and Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> Other retailers point out that couples from the ages of 35 to 40 are becoming  parents now, frequently for the first time, which is keeping them at home.  "People are beginning to find that it's much quieter and easier to entertain at  home than to make all the arrangements to go out," says Robert Lamont,  executive vice president of David Orgell.  </P> <P> A mix-and-match look for table decor is popular with some couples. "They'll  still buy the regular five-piece place setting of an expensive pattern, but  they might also buy extra salad plates in a different pattern. Or they bring in  some accessories like sugar bowls, creamers or serving dishes in a different  pattern to change the look of their table," says Renee Singer, owner of Cristal  Palais in Agoura Hills City Mall.  </P> <P> Couples are also beginning to buy additional patterns of china -- with service  for only two, four or six people -- that's different from their everyday china  and their good china. "People in their late 20s, 30s or early 40s are doing  this," Lamont says. Rather than vary the table linens, these people may vary  the china for smaller dinner parties.  </P> <P> "A more formal table setting keeps you at the table longer," Epps notes. "In my  house, we sit around the table for hours, and instead of moving to the living  room for coffee, we drink it at the table and sit around talking, and then  everyone goes home."  </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "I spent a lot of time earning these wrinkles. Why would I want to cover them  up?"  </P> <P>  -- Woman in her 60s to  </P> <P> cosmetics rep in her 20s  </P> <P> at a Woodland Hills  </P> <P> department store  </P></p>

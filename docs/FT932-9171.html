			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Money Markets: European rates fall MONEY market interest rates in Spain and Portugal fell sharply yesterday after both countries announced that they were suspending obligations to support their currencies at present parities in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. The prospect of both countries carrying out significant devaluations of their currencies led dealers to think that their central banks would take the opportunity to reduce interest rates sharply. In Spain's case, a reduction in the cost of borrowing will be particularly welcome to the socialist government only three weeks before its general election. The three-month interest rate for Spanish pesetas opened at around 17 per cent, but later dropped to 12.62 per cent. The cost of three-month Portuguese escudo had fallen to about 15 per cent by the close of trading. Danish money market rates also fell back yesterday as dealers took the view that, one way or the other, Denmark will be able to reduce its interest rates following next week's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The cost of three-month Danish krone declined from 10 per cent to 9.40 per cent. As one dealer put it: 'If Denmark votes yes, the Danes will be able to profit from the general fall in European rates. If they vote no, the Danes will leave the ERM and will bring down rates anyway.' France yesterday lowered both its intervention and five to 10-day lending rates by 25 basis points, in a move that appeared to symbolise that the Iberian currency crisis did not affect hard core ERM members. The intervention rate last night stood at 7.75 per cent and the five to 10-day lending rate at 8.75 per cent. The move triggered another rise in French franc futures and a fall in cash market rates. The June French franc con-tract climbed 5 basis points to close at 92.71. Three-month French francs eased to 7.38 per cent from around 7.50 per cent. The June Euromark con-tract, however, slipped 3 basis points to end at 92.89. German call money was steady at around 7.72 per cent. Sterling markets were relatively quiet. The June short sterling contract retreated 6 basis points to finish at 93.99. In the cash market, three-month money closed at 5 31/32 per cent, up from a previous 5 per cent. There was a daily shortage of Pounds 900m.</p>

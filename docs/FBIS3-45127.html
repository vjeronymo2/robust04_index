Thus, an  unprecedented and good situation has prevailed in the province's  post and telecommunications business. By the end of 1993, the  post and telecommunications departments throughout the province  realized 2.75 billion yuan of business volume, which showed a  76 percent increase over 1992. The increased scale has  surpassed the national average level in this regard by 17.3  percent. The development speed has also enabled the province to  enter the forefront of the nation in this regard. Our province  has, to date, improved its actual economic strength as a whole,  its comprehensive economic strength, and brought the service  standard on its post and telecommunications front to a new level.    Attending the provincial work conference held in Jinan on 11  January on the affairs of post and telecommunication were Jiang  Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee; Zhao  Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  governor of the province; and Chen Jianguo, member of the  provincial party standing committee and vice governor of the  province. At the work conference, they extended congratulations  on the tremendous achievements scored by the post and  telecommunications departments across the province and expressed  their thanks for the tremendous contributions made to developing  the economy in the province by the staff members and workers on  the post and telecommunications front.    In his speech Jiang Chunyun said: Since orienting its post  and telecommunications business onto the high-speed track of  development in 1988, our province has scored marked achievements  in the development that has made great contributions in  accelerating the economic development in the province,  broadening the opening up, and making things convenient for the  people's production and livelihood. Current tasks for building  socialism have entered a new historic period that has set forth  new demands for the post and telecommunications front. In order  to boost the economy, communications on the post and  telecommunications front should go ahead of others. If we  should do a lot in economic construction, we should first do a  lot in the post and telecommunications aspect. He urged cadres,  staff members, and workers on the province's post and  telecommunications front to carry forward their achievements, to  advance on the crest of success, and to meet the needs of  economic construction and the people's livelihood.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Henry Boot advances by 10% despite pressure on margins Henry Boot, the construction and property group, increased pre-tax profits by 10 per cent at the interim stage despite pressure on margins in building and civil engineering. The Sheffield-based company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.57m (Pounds 2.35m) on turnover up 11 per cent from Pounds 64.6m to Pounds 72.1m for the six months to June 30. However, it warned that overcapacity in the market would continue to depress pre-tax margins - down slightly to 3.57 per cent (3.63 per cent) - as increased house sales were not accompanied by price rises. 'There is still a lot of competition for too little work,' said Mr Jamie Boot, managing director. 'We are overcoming that to a large degree by being fairly selective in the type of work we tender for, tendering for building work rather than civil engineering.' The company's outlook on construction activities improved after winning a Pounds 26m contract at Connah's Quay power station, near Chester, from GEC-Alsthom. Housing sales increased in the early part of the year, but have slowed since May. The company said the housing market was still coming to terms with the interest rate rise in September, although demand had recovered this month. The overall performance was helped by property investment and development activities, which enjoyed a high level of enquiries from institutions for ongoing developments. Earnings per share climbed 8 per cent to 6.8p (6.3p). The interim dividend is 1.85p (1.7p).</p>

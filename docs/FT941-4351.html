			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Volvo pays the cost of failed merger The cost to Volvo of rupturing plans to merge with France's Renault became clear yesterday as the Swedish group - the country's biggest manufacturer - announced a pre-tax loss in 1993 of SKr2.64bn (Pounds 222m), the second successive year of losses. The result was a sharp improvement on the 1992 pre-tax deficit of SKr4.8bn. But the company would have been comfortably back in profit had it not been for charges totalling SKr5.2bn associated with the unwinding of the three-year-old strategic alliance with Renault. This unwinding followed Volvo's decision last December to scrap plans for a full merger of its car and truck operations with the state-owned French group. Volvo was at pains to stress that it had staged a strong recovery at the operating level in 1993, with unit sales of cars and trucks rising for the first time in years. The group surged to an operating profit of SKr1.55bn from a loss in 1992 of SKr2.25bn, boosted by last year's sharp fall in the value of the Swedish krona, rationalisation programmes that have eliminated 14,000 jobs in four years, low product development costs and a change in the accounting of some tool costs. However, investors, who have long discounted Volvo's turnround, were unimpressed by the results and an unchanged dividend of SKr7.75 per share. Volvo's most-traded B share fell SKr7.00 to close at SKr683. Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said 1994 had started well, although he declined to comment on prospects for the whole year. He also refused to comment until a shareholders' meeting in April on what moves the group might make to seek a new long-term partner in carmaking. Group sales in 1993 reached SKr111.15bn compared with SKr83bn in 1992, but were up only 8 per cent adjusted for exchange rate changes. Unit car sales were 311,800, up from 303,800, thanks mainly to a 9 per cent increase in the US, Volvo's biggest market. The car group returned to an operating profit of SKr502m (SKr1.83bn loss). Unit truck sales rose to 51,300 from 48,100, with the truck group reporting an operating profit of SKr765m after a loss of SKr641.</p>

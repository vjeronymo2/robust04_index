			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Japan rethinks lifting of rice ban THE Japanese government, having come close to lifting a ban on rice imports, is recalculating the domestic and international political costs of rice market reforms. A poor performance by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) at a weekend by-election has left party leaders nervous about the impact of market liberalisation before an upper house election scheduled for July. Last month, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, suggested that allowing rice imports would not necessarily damage farm incomes, a comment generally interpreted as meaning that the political damage could also be limited. However, Mr Miyazawa has now retreated into ambiguity, proposing no more than that Japan should 'examine' replacing the ban with a tariff regime. The rice issue has, in part, been a contest between the Foreign Ministry, which wants to safeguard Japan's international reputation, and the Agriculture Ministry, representing farmers' interests. Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, has urged the government to announce liberalisation before the March 1 deadline for food trade submissions in the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But agriculture ministry officials privately argue that there remains little likelihood of a broad agreement on agriculture, and Japan would be foolish to make an unnecessary concession. Publicly, the ministry opposes an opening on the grounds of 'food security', and because imports would lead to fewer paddy fields and, perhaps, increased flooding in rural areas. It also suggests that rice has a 'spiritual' importance for Japanese and should be exempt from the Gatt negotiations. Factional heads of the LDP informally agreed more than a year ago that the rice market would be opened. Aware that a decision has been taken in principle, farmers' leaders have encouraged protests in the belief that the ultimate announcement will be accompanied by compensation for farmers, and the larger the fuss, the larger the payout. LDP leaders are hoping to limit the foreign share of Japan's 10m tonne rice market to between 3 and 5 per cent, and Mr Watanabe believes that this could be achieved by replacing the ban with a 700 per cent tariff on imported rice. In spite of the issue's sensitivity, imports are likely to have far less impact on Japanese farmers than the government's own crop reduction measures.</p>

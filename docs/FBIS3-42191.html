This happened in Las Ilusiones, Zone 18,  Villa del Dorado, Zone 8, and the Ulises Rojas neighborhood at  the 21-km marker on the Pacific highway, Villa Nueva  Jurisdiction. Powerful charges downed the towers, causing a  blackout in Guatemala City and the interior of the country. The  blast hit Lirio Bolanos Rosas, a National Police employee of the  National Police, on Zone 18, and had to be hospitalized. Last  night and early this morning, technicians of the electricity  company and INDE [National Institute of Electrification]  estimated the damage caused at 500,000 quetzales. They did not  make estimates on the serious damage the blackout caused to  homes, hospitals, clinics, and computer centers, as well as to  citizens who were the victims of crimes perpetrated under cover  of the hour-long blackout in Guatemala City. The bomb squad  defused a powerful device in the Ulises Rojas Neighborhood.</p>

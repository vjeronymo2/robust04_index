Also, the Secretary is required to publish on or before November 1 the national average wage index for 1993 (section 215(a)(1)(D)), the OASDI fund ratio for 1994 (section 215(i)(2)(C)(ii)), the OASDI contribution and benefit base for 1995 (section 230(a)), the amount of earnings required to be credited with a quarter of coverage in 1995 (section 213(d)(2)), the monthly exempt amounts under the Social Security retirement earnings test for 1995 (section 203(f)(8)(A)), the formula for computing a primary insurance amount for workers who first become eligible for benefits or die in 1995 (section 215(a)(1)(D)), and the formula for computing the maximum amount of benefits payable to the family of a worker who first becomes eligible for old-age benefits or dies in 1995 (section 203(a)(2)(C)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost-of-Living Increases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cost-of-living increase is 2.8 percent for benefits under titles II and XVI of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under title II, OASDI benefits will increase by 2.8 percent beginning with the December 1994 benefits, which are payable on January 3, 1995. This increase is based on the authority contained in section 215(i) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under title XVI, Federal SSI payment levels will also increase by 2.8 percent effective for payments made for the month of January 1995 but paid on December 30, 1994. This is based on the authority contained in section 1617 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1382f). The percentage increase effective January 1995 is the same as the title II percentage increase and the annual payment amount is rounded, when not a multiple of $12, to the next lower multiple of $12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Automatic Benefit Increase Computation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 215(i) of the Act, the third calendar quarter of 1994 is a cost-of-living computation quarter for all the purposes of the Act. The Secretary is, therefore, required to increase benefits, effective with December 1994, for individuals entitled under section 227 or 228 of the Act, to increase primary insurance amounts of all other individuals entitled under title II of the Act, and to increase maximum benefits payable to a family. For December 1994, the benefit increase is the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers from the third quarter of 1993 through the third quarter of 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 215(i)(1) of the Act provides that the Consumer Price Index for a cost-of-living computation quarter shall be the arithmetic mean of this index for the 3 months in that quarter. The Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for each month in the quarter ending September 30, 1993, was: For July 1993, 142.1; for August 1993, 142.4; and for September 1993, 142.6. The arithmetic mean for this calendar quarter is 142.4 (after rounding to the nearest 0.1). The corresponding Consumer Price Index for each month in the quarter ending September 30, 1994, was: for July 1994, 145.8; for August 1994, 146.5; and for September 1994, 146.9. The arithmetic mean for this calendar quarter is 146.4. Thus, because the Consumer Price Index for the calendar quarter ending September 30, 1994, exceeds that for the calendar quarter ending September 30, 1993 by 2.8 percent, a cost-of-living benefit increase of 2.8 percent is effective for benefits under title II of the Act beginning December 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Title II Benefit Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 215(i) of the Act, in the case of insured workers and family members for whom eligibility for benefits (i.e., the worker's attainment of age 62, or disability or death before age 62) occurred before 1995, benefits will increase by 2.8 percent beginning with benefits for December 1994 which are payable on January 3, 1995. In the case of first eligibility after 1994, the 2.8 percent increase will not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For eligibility after 1978, benefits are generally determined by a benefit formula provided by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;216), as described later in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

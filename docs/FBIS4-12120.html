			<p>BFN     [Text] A few minutes ago, Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime  minister and defense minister, wrapped up his testimony before  the Shamgar commission. His testimony lasted five hours and was  given on camera. The prime minister came out from a side door  and refused to answer journalists' questions. Our legal affairs  correspondent Hadar Vismonsky reports:    Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister and defense minister whose  face we did not see today at all because he walked in and came  out through a side door to evade the cameras, gave a long  testimony. For five long hours, Rabin was questioned on camera  by the five members of the commission of inquiry. He was  accompanied by the legal adviser of the Prime Minister's Office  and by Cabinet Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein.    The prime minister's testimony actually concluded the  commission's 15th day of work and the first stage of the  hearings. Within the next few weeks, the commission members will  meet in order to formulate their initial conclusions and to  decide whether any people are liable to be affected by these  conclusions. If there are such people, they will be sent  warning letters and be summoned for another hearing, this time  accompanied by their lawyers.    As said, the first stage of the Shamgar commission's work is  over. Over the next few weeks, the commission will proceed with  consultations.</p>

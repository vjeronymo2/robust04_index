			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Call to postpone Russian elections A senior Russian presidential aide yesterday called for the postponement of parliamentary and presidential elections because of the 'political apathy of the majority'. Mr Mark Urnov, newly appointed head of Mr Boris Yeltsin's analytical centre  -the main presidential think-tank - also said that combining the elections for parliament and the presidency could 'raise the level of political activity of the population' and drive more people to the polls. Another reason for postponement, he said, was that positive results from the tough economic policy being proposed by the government would appear only after the summer of 1996. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for the end of next year, while presidential elections are due in spring of 1996. Postponement of the elections has been a constant theme of presidential aides in recent months - though they insist, as Mr Urnov repeated yesterday, that Mr Yeltsin has not yet decided whether he will again be a candidate. Mr Urnov said Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the reformist Yabloko group and a self-declared presidential candidate, had an 'extremely high' rating as a potential presidential candidate, especially in industrial areas, according to his polls. But Mr Yavlinsky, with other reformist leaders such as Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's Choice grouping, Mr Boris Fyodorov, leader of the Liberal Democratic Union, and Mr Sergei Shakhrai, leader of the Party of Unity and Accord, are considering uniting forces by presenting a joint platform on parliamentary elections and one candidate for president. The move comes in the face of increasing evidence that far-right and far-left parties are better organised, more popular and ahead in local elections. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, warned yesterday of a danger of fascism in Russia. 'There are concrete examples of people who express it,' he said. Meanwhile, one of the far-right leaders, Mr Alexander Sterligov, head of the Russian National Assembly, forecast yesterday a period of 'national liberation struggles' to stop the present leadership from turning the country into a 'servile producer of raw materials for the west' and to express the interests of the 84 per cent of the population who are ethnic Russians. He called for unity of patriotic forces at the next elections and emergence of one presidential candidate supported by nationalist and communist groups.</p>

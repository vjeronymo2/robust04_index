			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (30): Fleet company takes a long-term view - System Selection ONE of Britain's leading fleet management companies, Wincanton Contracts, wanted to take a 'long-term view' of its information services, bringing them in-house to provide better control and a swifter response to customers, according to Marj Laurie, data processing manager When Wincanton considered a new database three years ago, it needed a system which could keep all fleet management details, including road test data, taxation,billing of customers and purchasing records. The system also had to be capable of reading the files of the previous Hoskyns computer system, and of absorbing the data resulting from the acquisition of a smaller fleet company, Arlington. The need to access the previous DEC-based RMS files played an important part in the selection of what was then Cullinet (now CA's) database offering. (See profile, below). Another significant factor was the promise of a client-server version of the software, now available, and the fact that the fourth generation language supplied with the database could generate 'third generation' code in such languages as Cobol, Fortran, Basic or C. This means that the final applications run fast, and high performance was a consideration for Wincanton, since the entire company (150 employees in London and Birmingham) would have access to the database. Cullinet won the contract, worth Dollars 150,000 for software alone, mostly on technical grounds, although Wincanton was also influenced by the style and priorities of the suppliers on its short-list. However, the timing of the CA takeover forced Wincanton to turn to contractors to help with implementation and training in the initial months. Now, says Marj Laurie, everyone has access to the database, for ad-hoc user reports, and minor, but time-saving extras such as centrally updated telephone lists. 'Demand is such that we're looking for a better end-user tool, and we're beta-testing the CA PC product, QbyX, for that,' adds Marj Laurie. 'We haven't yet realised the full benefits of the database, but as far as our customers are concerned, better access to information makes us more responsive. 'We can produce ad hoc reports on maintenance of vehicles, cost, current fleet size and so on. We now have faster response, better service, and improved management of the business.'</p>

'The Cubans do not speak the political language of Caricom members,' said Dame Eugenia Charles, premier of Dominica. 'They cannot just jump into bed with us. There must be a courting period.' Mr Sanchez said his government wanted to increase its limited economic ties with its Caribbean neighbours: 'There are now opportunities for Cuba to work with the rest of the Caribbean in tourism, trade and all economic matters.' 'There is also the prospect for collaboration in high-technology and biotechnology ventures, with firms in the private and public sectors.

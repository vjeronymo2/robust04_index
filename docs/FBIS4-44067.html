			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Cunliffe-Jones] </F>   [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- An argument over the  job of the Europe's top civil servant pushed the subject of  Europe's 20 million unemployed down the European Union [EU]  summit's agenda here Friday [24 June].    Diplomats and politicians engaged in intense backroom  wrangling over the succession to French Socialist Jacques Delors  as President of the European Commission. Gathering in huddles,  journalists talked of little else.    "Sometimes, the interests of the media and the interests of  political people do meet," Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen  told reporters here.    "I'm afraid that today they don't. And I'd rather prefer if  we talk about unemployment or how to make concrete means  available to ordinary people."    The economy was the main topic of discussion at the  afternoon  session of talks between EU leaders, British officials stressed  Friday.    "And we have talked about unemployment many times in the  past."    The discussions among leaders and finance ministers  concentrated on four main topics, the British  said.     -  Macroeconomic policy, covering price stability, sound  public finances and labour market flexibility.    -  A report by  European Commissioner Martin Bangemann on liberalisation of the  markets, particularly in telecommunications.    -  Discussion of ways  to implement the European Commission's Trans European Networks  proposals, covering 11 road, rail and telecommunications  projects across Europe.    -  And a German proposal to set up a task  force on deregulation, tackling the "difficulties of creating  jobs in Europe, and for small- and medium-sized businesses."     The projects for Trans European Networks formed a key  element  in Delors' white paper on unemployment, issued last year, which  set out a massive investment programme for the community.    At a Brussels press conference earlier this week, Delors was  critical of "two or perhaps three EU countries," which have  blocked his plan for significant public sector involvement in  funding the projects.    This was a reference to Britain, France and Germany, which  do  not want to raise their public debt in order to pay for an  ambitious multimillion dollar investment programme for  transport, energy and telecom networks.    Delors said he feared that EU leaders might ditch a  Commission proposal for measures to increase competitiveness and  create jobs, because of signs that their countries were emerging  economic recession.    Even annual economic growth of 2.5 or three percent was not  enough to bring down unemployment which is expected to peak at  11.6 percent in 1995 -- meaning nearly 20 million people will be  out of work, he said.    Officials close to Delors admit that the Commission's plans  -- to pay for the investment programme and to reduce social  charges levied to pay for social programmes and raise the money  through a new energy tax -- have been largely gutted.    Of the 11 projects which were expected to be approved at the  summit, many have already been all but decided, and they  represent just a small slice of Delors' original plans,  Commission officials said.    "Unemployment has not been dropped from the summit. It is  just that the ideas coming to the fore are of a different  political complexion than those that were previously in the  front," a source close to the Commission said.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Interlude in the sun - Missing Glyndebourne this year? Antony Thorncroft ventured further afield in search of alfresco opera, to Barbados SOMEHOW opera suits the great outdoors. Voices drifting across lawns and copses; dusk falling between the acts; the singers competing with the last bird song and the first crickets. A refined architectural backdrop, a Palladian villa, perhaps, or an English country house, helps, for dramatic exits and entrances. Glyndebourne has successfully married the best of nature with the best of opera for over half a century and has provided a template for many wealthy enthusiasts. Look out this summer for Garsington, the former demesne of Lady Otteline Morrell: it is beefing up its opera festival to capture the Glyndebourne aficionados suffering cold turkey while a new theatre emerges in the South Downs. Watching Alfredo stalk down the avenue of the most meticulously modelled Palladian villa outside of the Veneto, and following Papageno into the trees of a lush 'English' garden seems somehow familiar, reassuring, just so - even when you are in the audience for the first professional opera production ever assembled in Barbados. The Caribbean islands can no longer compete on sun, sea and sand. The market is getting bored. Barbados is superbly placed to become the cultural haunt of the region, the spot to go for some mental uplift to add to the tan. It has an uninterrupted history of British colonisation going back to 1625, with 17th century plantation houses decorating the countryside, protected by a vigorous National Trust. It also has a generation of the lively rich who want to make the most of the island - and do a bit for charity, too. Hence the first Caribbean opera festival, dreamed up by Richard Hanlon over a Christmas lunch at the 18th century plantation home of John Kidd, and in place by Easter. The singers came from one of those myriad troupes of chamber operas who make a good living performing at corporate bashes and smart parties. Opera Interludes is from the same stable as Pavilion Opera, Pimlico Opera, Chelsea Opera and the like and shares some of the singers. It is an excellent way for young artistes to learn major roles, and to test themselves as actors. La Traviata took place at Heron Bay, the towering seashore Palladian house that Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe designed for Ronald Tree. It is now owned by the Bamford family. The roar of the sea pushed the performance into the back terrace; a tropical power cut added its moment of drama. La Traviata is not perhaps the most obvious chamber opera. No chorus of gypsys; no Baron, in this four singer version. In Helen Adams, a Donna Elvira at the ENO, there was a Violetta whose voice just about compensated for a sad absence of flirtatious triste. But the set - long gravel walks, decorated iron gates, scented borders and towering tropical trees, was stunning. At Holder's House there was a truncated Magic Flute, no bad idea. Here nature again transformed the performances, with Philip Blake-Jones and Anne Marabini as Papageno and Papagena making the opera almost a bucolic rite. Afterwards there were popular favourites, culminating in the farewell duet from Guonod's Faust, the voices echoing back across a velvet night from a wooded glade. Finally, there were Mozart favourites on the Palm Terrace of the Royal Pavilion, the smartest hotel in Barbados. The attraction of the event was not purely sybaritic. Young music students were invited to the performances and the success of the idea has encouraged a more ambitious programme for 1993, involving local singers in the chorus, and complete operas. Pirates of Penzance, with the chorus entering from the beach, is one; something sparky by Donizetti or Lehar another. The tyros who fell into the idea are currently surprised by its success; the next step is to become more artistically ambitious without losing the sense of fun.</p>

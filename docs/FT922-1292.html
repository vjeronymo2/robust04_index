			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Playing catch-up with private sector fat cats / A look at the arguments for and against high pay increases for top UK public servants When Strathclyde local authority advertised for a new chief executive this year, the starting salary of Pounds 105,000 will have touched some raw nerves among senior employees in other public service jobs. Strathclyde may be the largest authority in Britain but Mr Neil McIntosh, the successful candidate, will earn more than Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service, Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, and Field Marshall Sir Richard Vincent, chief of the defence staff, all of whom receive an annual Pounds 104,750. Until this year, Strathclyde paid its chief executive Pounds 76,000. This level of pay rise for the new generation of public sector executives exacerbates what was always going to be a difficult year for the government on top people's pay. It is caught between pressures to reduce widening differentials between the private sector and the 2,040 senior public servants whose salaries are covered by the Review Body on Top Salaries, and the need to hold down pay in the public sector. The Review Body's 15th report, and the first full-scale review of comparability with the private sector since 1985, is due to go before the prime minister later this week. It is widely expected to recommend a big narrowing of the gap between senior public servants and company directors, especially for those civil servants on a salary of Pounds 50,000-plus at the bottom end of the scale. The case for such a rise is strong. In big companies, earnings of Pounds 140,000 or more for full-time board members, and Pounds 250,000 or more for chief executives, are common. In the past seven years, while pay at the top of the private sector has almost doubled - up 96 per cent according to Hay Management Consultants, if incentives and bonuses are included - rises for top public servants have barely matched inflation. On top of that is the 'Strathclyde' factor. Strathclyde is a Labour-controlled council which realises that it has to offer competitive salaries to get good people. The government is pushing even harder in this direction and its determination to introduce private sector methods into the public services is starting to release a small explosion in the pay of the new public sector bosses. Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive of Guys Hospital, one of the first hospitals to acquire trust status under national health service reforms, now earns about Pounds 90,000, double what the general manager of a large hospital earned five years ago. Mr John Mackintosh, head of the grant-maintained Oratory School, earns about Pounds 60,000, a possible bench-mark for the heads of schools which are opting out of local education control under the govern-ment's education reforms. The most well-paid public servants of all are to be found among the heads of the Next Step agencies, quasi-autonomous public sector bodies, such as the Defence Research Agency whose head, Mr John Chisholm, earns Pounds 140,000. These salaries may be seen as desirable and even necessary to attract suitably qualified managers but they have severely upset the pay balance at the top of the public sector. Those covered by the Review Body - judges, senior civil servants and top military personnel - are not used to being outflanked on pay from within the public sector. They are, however, accustomed to being outflanked by the private sector. Figures collated by the Public Finance Foundation, a pay research group, show that between 1985, the last important adjustment to top salaries, and last year, the pay of the highest earners in the Civil Service rose by 40 per cent and that of Grade Three civil servants - formerly called under-secretaries - the lowest paid in the review group, by 54 per cent. However, the top 10 per cent of non-manual workers in the private sector saw earnings rise by 71 per cent over the same period. Those figures may be distorted by a one-off private sector 'catch-up' for top managers in the privatised utilities. On the other hand, the figures also mask higher rises for the most senior executives in British industry, and exclude perquisites such as subsidised mortgages and company cars. Research for last year's Top Salaries Review Body found that the median salary, plus bonuses, of chief executives at private sector financial companies with turnover of more than Pounds 70m a year was Pounds 230,000 a year, more than twice the Pounds 104,000 earned by those covered by the Review Body. Part of the difference between public and private sector salaries has been justified by superior pension benefits and job security enjoyed by the public servants. To counter this, the Association of First Division Civil Servants, the National Union of Civil and Public Servants and the Institute of Professional Managers and Specialists, which represent senior civil servants, have presented evidence to this year's Review Body based on a report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm. The report says not all job turbulence in the private sector is a result of less secure employment. Job changes reflect a desire by private sector managers for wide experience, and head hunting by employers. 'Even in the midst of recession the length of time on average between jobs does not seem to outweigh the length of time over which financial support is available,' says the report. The unions also argue that if the government wants more job flexibility between the private sector and the Civil Service, pay differentials will have to be narrowed. However, even if the Review Body and the government were to accept this argument, and the case for a catch-up, there are equally strong pressures for resisting big pay rises. First, pay rises for private sector executives have become much more modest in the past year, falling, according to Hay, to 7 per cent from a peak in 1988-89 of 20 per cent. Second, the recession means that the problems experienced by public sector employers in recruiting and retaining staff in the late 1980s have faded. The Treasury says there is no indication of a decline in the quality of candidates for fast stream entry - designed for high-flyers - to the Civil Service and that, apart from some specialist areas, there are an adequate number of high-flyers to fill Grade Three posts, the most junior civil service grade covered by the Review Body, and above. The most powerful argument of all for the government to resist large rises is a feeling that they would send the wrong signals both to the private sector - where pay settlements have only recently fallen below German levels for the first time in many years - and the majority of public sector workers whose pay is determined by collective bargaining. They will only receive an increase of about 4 per cent, the rate of inflation, this year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          LIFE AT THE TOP  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   Highest                    Top Salaries Review Body                   decile                                    Grade 3        Average   non-manual  Inflation   Highest paid    Civil servant       earnings  private sect'   RPI        official      on appointment  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1985    100         100         100          100             100 1986    108         109         103          104             105 1987    116         120         107          108             110 1988    128         133         112          114             115 1989    140         147         121          119             121 1990    154         162         132          128             141 1991    166         171         140          140             154 1992    177         185         146         (182)*          (185)**  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *30 per cent pay rise would bring into line with private sector highest decile** 20 per cent pay rise would bring into line with private sector highest decile  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Public Finance Foundation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

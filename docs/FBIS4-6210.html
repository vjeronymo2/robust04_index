			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, April 18 KYODO -- Labor-related  demonstrations in north Sumatra have spread from the provincial  capital to two other cities and turned into violent anti-Chinese  riots, military and labor sources said Monday [18 April].    The sources said some 10,000 workers held a three-hour  protest Monday morning in Pematangsiantar, 120 kilometers  southeast of Medan and 1400 kilometers northwest of Jakarta, in  which seven people were injured.    Some reports said there were similar protests in Belawan, 40  kilometers north of Medan.    Sunarti heads the central board of the Indonesian Prosperity  Trade Union (SBSI), an independent union which has been  challenging the government's policy of only allowing one trade  union, the All Indonesian Workers' Union (SPSI). [sentence as  received]    At a news conference Monday, Sunarti said at least 81 people  have so far been detained by the police, including two  executives of the SBSI and the wife of a union executive.    They were arrested following five days of rioting in Medan,  during which one ethnic Chinese businessman was killed.    The protesters are calling for better working conditions and  higher wages. They protested the unexplained death of  22-year-old Rusli, a worker at a Medan-based company, after he  took part in a labor strike that was only broken up when the  troops were sent in.    Many believe the SBSI is the motivating force behind the  rally.    The protests, however, have turned into violent anti-Chinese  riots.    Police reports said that some angry demonstrators pelted  shops, factories and vehicles owned by ethnic Chinese.    Chinese account for about three percent of the population of  around 185 million in the mainly Muslim country. They are  widely resented in Indonesia because of their economic power.    In the country, the ethnic Chinese are often the target of  jealousy because of their economic success.    Some anti-Chinese leaflets were distributed among  demonstrators saying, "Kill Chinese people as colonialists of  the fundamental rights of indigenous Indonesian people," and  "Send Chinese people back to China, because Indonesia is not  their land."    Sunarti said, "The pamphlets are not ours. We never  distributed them. There must be third parties who have been  using our protest for their own interests."    The SBSI, Sunarti added, is only responsible for the protest  for better working conditions, higher wages and the  investigation into the death of Rusli, but not for the  anti-Chinese riots.    The situation in Medan is still tense, although Lt. Col.  Agus  Ramadan, the district military commander, said the streets were  quiet and many shops and companies were still closed.    Vincent Wijaya, an executive of the north Sumatran branch of  the Indonesian trade chamber, told reporters that a Malaysian  company had canceled its plans to buy land within the industrial  estate after the riots.    The Indonesian legal aid foundation said the protests would  continue if the government fails to improve its labor policy.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> PIPELINE AGREEMENT OKD  </P> <P> The Santa Monica City Council has approved a new $12,000-a-year, 20-year  franchise agreement for Shell California Pipeline Co. for a 3.9-mile  underground crude oil pipeline.  </P> <P> The agreement also calls for the oil company to increase its liability  insurance on the pipeline from $5 million to $50 million.  </P> <P> The pipeline runs in a north-south direction essentially along 26th Street and  Colverfield Boulevard.  </P> <P> The new franchise comes a month after Shell agreed to pay the city $2.1 million  to settle an eight-year legal dispute over franchise fees. In 1981, after  Shell's 40-year lease expired, the city raised the annual franchise fee to  $237,000, based on the market value of the land above the pipeline.  </P> <P> The oil company sued, but a federal judge ruled that the fee was legitimate.  The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision, and the U.S. Supreme  Court refused to review the case.  </P> <P> Shell then filed suit to obtain an easement on the land and sought a trial to  establish the value of the land. The city countersued for breach of contract.  </P> <P> Last month's $2.1-million settlement resulted in all lawsuits between Shell and  the city being dropped.  </P></p>

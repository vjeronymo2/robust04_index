			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HAS CROSSED ITS MIDEAST RUBICON -- AND CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE;  </P> <P> IRAQ: IF SANCTIONS PROVE TOO UNCERTAIN AND DIPLOMACY UNAVAILING, AMERICA WILL  NEED TO CONSIDER A SURGICAL AND PROGRESSIVE MILITARY STRIKE.  </P> <P> The crisis over Kuwait marks a watershed for the Bush Administration. Success  will boost world morale and the world economy. It will strengthen the  President's domestic leadership. Failure will blight all future domestic and  international efforts.  </P> <P> The Administration, so far, has risen to the challenge with subtlety, skill and  fortitude. But the game has only begun. The President's dramatic decision to  deploy a major military force in Saudi Arabia has raised not only the prospects  of success but also the stakes of defeat. The United States has passed the  point of no return.  </P> <P> It is thus crucial to assess how success and failure are to be defined. The  U.N. Security Council has unanimously demanded the unconditional withdrawal of  Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of the legitimate government. The  United States has justified its interdiction of the sea lanes as a response to  a request of the exiled Kuwaiti government.  </P> <P> Should Iraq manage to remain in Kuwait or exercise indirect control through  some puppet, the American show of force will turn into a debacle. If in the end  Iraq controls Kuwait and U.S. forces stay in Saudi Arabia, the crisis will have  ended in a demonstration of the irrelevance of America and of world opinion. In  any event, neither Arab nor U.S. politics would long sustain significant troop  deployments in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The argument that we have saved Saudi Arabia will be overwhelmed by the  perception of an American failure that would shake political, economic and  financial stability everywhere. Indeed, even attainment of the U.N. objectives  might provide only a breathing space if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein remains  in office and he continues to build up its nuclear and chemical weapons  potential.  </P> <P> Time is not on our side. If after a certain interval the conflict appears to  settle down to a siege, the United States will be obliged to consider new  measures to bring it to a conclusion.  </P> <P> The United States had three choices in dealing with the crisis: It could  passively endorse whatever consensus emerged in the United Nations; it could  support whatever the industrial democracies -- all of which are more dependent  on Mideast oil than the United States is -- were prepared to do in concert; or  it could take the lead in opposing Hussein and try to organize international  support for an effort in which the United States would bear the principal  burden.  </P> <P> There were ample excuses for avoiding a decision. The most fashionable argument  was that the area's defense should be an Arab matter. But none of the Arab  states is strong enough, even in combination, to defeat the Iraqi army. In any  case, such an argument marks the re-emergence of American isolationism,  especially among the conservatives. Allowed to prevail, it would conclude with  America's abdication at the moment when the old East-West conflict has been  won.  </P> <P> Another excuse was that even if Iraq controlled all the oil in the gulf, it  would still have to sell it in a world market governed by the laws of supply  and demand. But were Iraq to achieve its strategic design, it would be able to  determine the level of supply by taking production away from sparsely populated  principalities in the Arabian Peninsula without hurting its own population. The  ability to cause a worldwide economic crisis is not the sort of power to be  left in the hands of a ruler who has attacked three of his six neighbors, is  engaged in mortal conflict with two others and has used poison gas against his  own dissident population.  </P> <P> The Administration must have concluded that the first two options would almost  certainly have ended with making Iraqi domination of Kuwait permanent. That  would produce the collapse of the moderate governments in the region, including  Egypt. Ultimately, a general Middle East war would have been probable.  </P> <P> Having committed the United States to a leadership role, President Bush made  another crucial decision: He and his advisers opted for a massive deployment.  In so doing, they seem to have reasoned that the United Nations' unexpected  sanctions might change Hussein's calculation. He may well not have originally  intended to seize the Saudi oil fields. Had there been no meaningful  resistance, he would not have needed to do so. The rulers of the Arabian  peninsula -- in Saudi Arabia as well as in the emirates -- would have yielded  to Iraqi pressures or been overthrown, more likely both.  </P> <P> But once the sanctions were voted, Hussein's calculus was bound to change. So  long as oil prices remain steady, the sanctions are likely to be sustained. And  prices will remain at more or less present levels if Saudi Arabia increases its  production by 2.5 million barrels. But if Saudi production can be destroyed or  even severely reduced, the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil -- roughly 4.6  million barrels -- will lead to an explosive rise in oil prices. With a  worldwide depression looming, it would become increasingly difficult to  maintain sanctions. Hussein would win the endurance contest.  </P> <P> President Bush and his advisers must have concluded that once they committed  military forces, the best hope of ending the crisis quickly was to assemble an  overwhelming force to overawe such a threat and to be able to go further if  necessary.  </P> <P> There is now widespread public support. The United Nations is nearly unanimous.  NATO countries have sent naval and air contingents. An Arab multinational force  is in place. The test, however, will not be the extent of the support but its  durability. For that reason, this is a time for the Administration to calculate  the window of opportunity it has available to achieve its objectives.  </P> <P> The Administration must take care not to wallow in the domestic and  international support it now enjoys. Public concern about the probability of  success, coupled with insistent reassurances by Administration spokesmen, will,  over time, weaken the credibility of the American enterprise. At some point,  the familiar question of the light at the end of the tunnel is bound to  surface.  </P> <P> The situation within the Middle East is also likely to grow more precarious the  longer the crisis festers. The impact on the Arab world of anti-Western  propaganda from Baghdad and the skillful linking of Kuwait and Palestine must  not be underestimated. The region is now polarized as never before; radicalism  is on the rise. A coup in one of the emirates or sabotage in the oil fields  would send another shock through the region. It would upset the already  precarious balance between supply and demand in the world oil markets, driving  up oil prices, causing unemployment and inflation and risking the solidarity  backing the sanctions. The refusal of France to permit its navy to participate  in the sea interdiction may be a foretaste.  </P> <P> Thus, the time required for the sanctions to work must be balanced against the  factors undermining international cohesion. The acid test of the sanctions will  be not how much oil is prevented from leaving the region but how few supplies  are allowed to enter Iraq. Iraqi oil exports are relatively easily blocked. But  Iraq's frontiers are long and less bulky goods -- food -- can seep in. And the  likelihood of this happening will grow the longer the crisis lasts and the more  Iraq's neighbors conclude that they may have to live with the Iraqi dictator,  however dangerous he may be.  </P> <P> I do not know whether sanctions can work within the time constraints outlined  here. I also realize that the United States must consider the risk that a more  aggressive course might take away some of the current international support. At  the same time, that support would not survive the appearance of an American  defeat. The United States stands to lose the most from a long siege -- whatever  the relative immediate economic impact on Europe and Japan. An ignominious  withdrawal following the debacle in Lebanon -- and any withdrawal however  dressed up without achieving our objectives would be ignominious -- would end  America's stabilizing role in the Middle East. And no other country could take  its place. It would also undermine the single most important asset left in  America's relations with Europe and Japan -- America's contribution to the  security of its allies. It would gravely weaken the Bush Administration's  capacity to overcome the economic crisis that would follow.  </P> <P> It would be a mistake to focus only on America's difficulties. In the end, Iraq  is a heavily indebted developing country with a population of only 16 million  that has just ended a debilitating 10-year war with Iran, and which has hostile  relations with four of its six neighbors. It is in no position to enter into a  protracted conflict with the United States. Saddam Hussein proved during the  Iran war that he is prepared to negotiate when necessary. His most recent offer  agreed to the principle of withdrawal from Kuwait, albeit under outrageous  conditions. It may be the beginning of an attempt at negotiation obscured by  bluster once the reality of the stark choices before Iraq sinks in. Then the  offer to withdraw may reemerge stripped of its absurd baggage.  </P> <P> But the United States cannot afford to be diddled; it simply cannot afford to  lose. If sanctions prove too uncertain and diplomacy unavailing, the United  States will need to consider a surgical and progressive destruction of Iraq's  military assets -- especially since an outcome that leaves Hussein in place and  his military machine unimpaired might turn out to be only an interlude between  aggressions.  </P> <P> It would be irresponsible for an outsider to press for a course of action in a  situation so dependent on information not available to the kibitzer. But it is  important to understand that America has crossed its Rubicon. All those  concerned with global peace and world economic well-being should subordinate  whatever tactical misgivings they may have to standing behind the only policy  that can now succeed.  </P></p>

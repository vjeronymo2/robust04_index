			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Zhen,  vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, met here today  with Konan Koffi, visiting Defense Minister of Cote d'Ivoire,  and his party.    Zhang said that China and Cote d'Ivoire, though far away  from  each other, have developed good relations since the two  countries established diplomatic ties in 1983.    As developing countries, China and Cote d'Ivoire are faced  with the common task of nationwide construction and development  of the economy.    Zhang spoke highly of the Cote d'Ivoire Government's stance  that there is only one China and that Taiwan is an inalienable  part of its territory.    During the meeting, Zhang also briefed Koffi on China's  economic development and the construction of its armed forces.    He expressed the belief that Koffi's visit would enhance the  friendly relations between the armed forces of the two countries.    Koffi told Zhang that just as China does, Cote d'Ivoire pays  much attention to the safeguarding of its territorial integrity,  its people and its traditions.    He noted that Cote d'Ivoire recognizes the People's Republic  of China as the sole legitimate government of China and Taiwan  as one of its provinces.    Chinese State Councillor and Defense Minister Chi Haotian  took part in the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 31 (CTK) -- Top bodies of the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] have assumed a  totally confrontational policy which practically deprives them  of any possibility of constructive dialogue with other left-wing  parties, Left Bloc Party (SLB) Chairwoman Marie Stiborova told  journalists today.    She was reacting to remarks made by KSCM Chairman Miroslav  Grebenicek during the KSCM Central Committee meeting on last  Saturday [26 March] in which he said, among other things, that  SLB and the People's National and Social Salvation Union  (LUNSZ), led by the pre-November 1989 Czechoslovak Communist  Party Prague branch chairman Miroslav Stepan, tried to feed on  KSCM structures.    The Czechoslovak Communist Party was disbanded in April  1992.    In view of last weekend's meeting of the Democratic Left  Party (SDL) National Council, which decided against sharing an  election staff with the SLB, the two parties will form a common  election coordination council.    The SLB Central Committee, scheduled to meet on April 8, is  to discuss the creation of an election staff.    "We see the elections as being based on the civic principle.  We are also aware that in many places, people have asked that  the left insist on its candidates having adequate  qualifications," Stiborova said.</p>

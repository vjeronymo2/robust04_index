			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greece Fund reorganisation THE GREECE FUND, a closed-end investment trust managed by Schroder Investment Management, has unveiled details of a reorganisation proposal intended to improve liquidity in the shares. Last November a group of dissident shareholders in the Greece Fund unsuccessfully sought an extraordinary general meeting to force Schroders to take steps to allow them to sell their shares at a price close to net asset value. Those shareholders argued that although the underlying investments had performed very well, they were unable to realise gains because there had been no marketmaking in the shares. Although the bid was narrowly unsuccessful, Schroders since then has been studying ways to improve liquidity. The measures will include an amendment to the the Greece Fund's articles allowing shareholders to receive cash for up to 30 per cent of their stakes by the beginning of 1993 and an additional five per cent per quarter. Those accepting payments in kind may redeem their entire holdings. Also, the Greece Fund's depositary warrants will be cancelled at a five per cent premium to inherent asset value, while the international depositary receipts will be cancelled in exchange for the underlying shares in registered form. It is intended that the central management and control of the company will be moved to Jersey from the UK and a listing will be sought in Ireland.</p>

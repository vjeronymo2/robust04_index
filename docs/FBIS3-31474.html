			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "U.S. Investigator Is Yet To </F> Come to Prague"]    [Text] Prague--The independent U.S. investigator who is to  verify whether, within the framework of the [1992 U.S.]  presidential campaign, the Bush administration really tried  illegally to obtain compromising information about Bill Clinton  has not arrived in Prague yet. This has been confirmed by a  Czech diplomatic source who did not wish to be named for fear of  difficulties at his place of work.    The claim by the U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST that the  investigator had already visited Prague has also been denied by  Stanislav Devaty, director of the secret service. Devaty said  yesterday that he was not aware of any such person having been  to the Czech Republic.    The Czech diplomatic source said yesterday that the  investigator was attorney-at-law Joseph diGenova, who had been  given this assignment by the U.S. Department of Justice. He  thus set right yesterday's erroneous information about the  investigator's name being Josephine Di Genova.    The U.S. lawyer is to find out in Prague details about  whether the campaign team of former President George Bush had  requested from the Czech intelligence service information about  Bush's rival candidate, Bill Clinton. This information, aimed  at discrediting Bush's opponent in the elections, concerned the  1970's, when Clinton, as an Oxford University student, had spent  a few days in Prague with the family of [widow of Jan Sverma,  one of the founders of the Czech Communist Party] Marie Svermova.    The WASHINGTON POST wrote that the independent investigator  was examining a possible breach of law in the search for  compromising information in passport forms filed by Bill Clinton  in the past. In connection with the search for this data, in  the fall of 1992, Elisabeth Tamposi was forced to resign as  assistant secretary of state.</p>

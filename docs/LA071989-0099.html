			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPE DEVELOPS MANIA FOR CORPORATE MERGERS  </P> <P> It wasn't long ago that "Europeans thought mergers were brash, American and in  bad taste, like stretch limousines or hamburgers," John M. Hennessy, vice  chairman of CS First Boston, recalled at a London conference on mergers and  acquisitions late last year.  </P> <P> "The American raiders and greenmailers of the late 1970s and early 1980s were  as shocking to the Europeans as streakers at a cricket match," Hennessy said.  But, he added, times are changing.  </P> <P> In retrospect, the First Boston executive's remarks look like a stage cue for  Sir James Goldsmith, the flamboyant Anglo-French takeover specialist whose  Yankee-like $21.5-billion bid for Britain's BAT Industries last week put Europe  squarely in mergerdom's major leagues.  </P> <P> The BAT bid, which still faces many financial, legal and political hurdles, was  by far Britain's biggest takeover offer ever -- four times larger than  conglomerate Hanson PLC's well-publicized bid for Consolidated Gold Fields.  Worldwide, it is outranked only by last year's record $25-billion purchase of  RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York leveraged  buyout firm.  </P> <P> But while it is a landmark in its own right, Goldsmith's highly leveraged grab  for the British insurance, retailing and tobacco conglomerate is only part of a  broader overseas merger and acquisition boom that has already transformed  Britain's business climate and that is now having a growing impact on  continental Europe and even Asia as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reshaping the Landscape  </P> <P> "Since the mid-1980s, large tracts of the (European) industrial landscape have  been reshaped by mergers and acquisitions, primarily within countries, but  increasingly across European borders," wrote Guy de Jonquieres, international  business editor, in a recent review for London's Financial Times.  </P> <P> De Jonquieres and other experts caution that because of the difficulty of  collecting worldwide statistics and the fact that few organizations until  recently even tried very hard to gather them, available figures are more a  guide than a definitive yardstick.  </P> <P> These figures show that the freewheeling Britain of Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher is still the capital of Europe's merger trend by a wide margin.  However, flush with cash and credit and facing the challenge of an open,  unified European market in 1992, companies in France, West Germany, Spain and  Italy are also increasingly busy at the corporate mating game.  </P> <P> The BAT deal involves the takeover of one British firm by another, but growth  is fastest, according to the experts, in cross-border activity. Based on large  transactions valued at $100 million or more, the international mergers and  acquisitions market has nearly trebled in just the last two years, according to  Hennessy.  </P> <P> The United States has long been the favored shopping ground for European firms  on the prowl, but lately there are signs of a continental shift, particularly  among smaller deal-makers.  </P> <P> British firms made more acquisitions in mainland Europe than in the United  States for the first time in the first half of 1989, according to Acquisitions  Monthly, a British publication. Said editor Philip Healey: "With several  European countries now reviewing both their takeover policies and corporate  defense mechanisms, the public sectors in countries such as France and Holland  may yet become more active, paving the way to larger deals on the Continent."  </P> <P> And Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG), a big international accounting and  management consulting firm, said in the latest edition of its quarterly "Deal  Watch" report: "While EC companies continue to look to North America for their  largest acquisitions, they have reduced greatly the number of their  middle-market purchases (worth $100 million or less) in North America,  concentrating instead on buying other European companies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Middle-Market Mergers  </P> <P> While the mega-deals valued at $1 billion and up get most of the publicity,  most global acquisitions are in the smaller, middle-market category. Only about  one such deal in five is worth more than $100 million, and six out of 10 are  worth less than $25 million, according to KPMG.  </P> <P> Another trend: growing Japanese involvement in the European merger and  acquisitions market.  </P> <P> "Although Japanese firms have plowed plenty of money into Europe to grow their  own businesses from scratch, they have largely steered clear of the  acquisitions game -- until now," wrote Britain's respected Economist magazine  earlier this month.  </P> <P> The Bank of Yokohama has bid $148 million for Guinness Mahon, a small British  merchant bank; soap maker Kao has put up $133 million for a 75% stake in a West  German producer of hair care products, and just last Thursday, it was announced  that Honda would buy 20% of Britain's Rover Group for an undisclosed sum.  </P> <P> Some of the newly industrialized Pacific Rim countries are also entering the  acquisition scene but, like Japan, they shy away from Goldsmith-style corporate  raids.  </P> <P> "The main reasons for this restraint are both cultural and pragmatic,"  according to a special Deal Watch report. "Japanese firms place great store in  maintaining good relationships with existing management. With trade issues  assuming ever greater political importance, the Japanese are careful not to  come across as 'bullies' in their trade partners' back yards. History also  shows that friendly takeovers are the ones most likely to succeed in the long  term."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy Differences  </P> <P> There remain significant differences in government policy toward mergers and  acquisitions in different European nations.  </P> <P> British firms are by far the most active within Europe, both as transnational  buyers and sellers, playing a role in about two-thirds of all such deals  involving a European Community partner. French firms, in second place, are  involved in about 15%.  </P> <P> While much smaller, Spain has taken one of the continent's most positive  stances toward foreign direct investment and has attracted $20 billion worth in  the last three years as a result. Commented First Boston's Hennessy: "Raiders  and merger kings, much denounced even in today's U.S.A., are admired there as  the rightful heirs of the vanished conquistadors."  </P> <P> In West Germany, where the heavy involvement of banks and insurance companies  in corporate ownership structure has long discouraged mergers and acquisitions,  a recent change in tax law has injected new life. As of Jan. 1, 1990, the  capital gains tax on the sale of companies jumps from 28% to 53%, and smaller,  privately held firms, particularly, are eager to beat the deadline.  </P> <P> According to Klaus Peter Sauer, managing partner of KPMG's Frankfurt affiliate,  the number of domestic merger and acquisition deals within West Germany is  expected to hit about 4,200 this year, up from 1,543 in 1987. He predicts that  foreign firms will scoop up another 600 West German companies, more than double  the 1987 pace.  </P> <P> At the other end of the spectrum from open-door Britain are some of Europe's  smaller nations.  </P> <P> Switzerland's companies, according to Hennessy, "are almost as impregnable as  its mountains." And firms in both Belgium and the Netherlands can, if  threatened by a hostile takeover, issue extra shares to friendly associates or  impose limits on the voting powers of some share holdings.  </P> <P> Even the freest of the free-wheelers have some concerns about Europe's merger  mania.  </P> <P> "The wave of mergers and acquisitions sweeping across large sections of  European industry is all to the good as long as it produces more efficient and  dynamic business groupings," the Financial Times said this spring in an  editorial. "However, the increasingly feverish psychological climate in which  many deals are being made gives rise to two distinct concerns to which  shareholders and policy-makers need to be alert.  </P> <P> "One is that, in the stampede to prepare for the single market, companies will  overreach themselves, allowing opportunism or the pursuit of size for its own  sake to prevail over sound business logic," the newspaper said. "The other is  that mergers will result in excessive concentration and cartelization."  </P> <P> The European Commission in Brussels would like to have more power to rule on  cross-border mergers involving EC firms. "We want to go toward a more  interventionist system," a spokesman said.  </P> <P> But some governments, notably that of Britain, are not enthusiastic for  political as well as practical reasons. And money men like Hennessy fear that,  left to the bureaucrats, 1992 will become a "Frankenstein that will regulate,  not liberate, the European economy." The First Boston executive characterized  cross-border takeovers as "one of the litmus tests" of how serious Europeans  are about opening their markets.  </P> <P> The BAT bid by Goldsmith and his partners -- financier Jacob Rothschild and  Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer -- will be a test even for Britain. "An  important element is how the government is going to react," said Acquisitions  Monthly editor Healey. "Is it good for the UK industry? What benefits will come  out of it besides making three rich men richer?"  </P> <P> Britain's Office of Fair Trading and possibly its Monopolies and Mergers  Commission are expected to study the BAT deal on public interest grounds. A key  question will no doubt be the impact on British employment of Goldsmith's  announced plan to sell off everything but BAT's core tobacco interests.  </P> <P> For all its commitment to free markets, the Thatcher government last spring  blocked the acquisition of brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle PLC by Australia's  Elders IXL.  </P> <P> Also, industrialists and money men are concerned about the structure of  Goldsmith's offer, which many see as heralding the advent of the same "junk  financing" that has come under a cloud in the United States.  </P> <P> Speaking to Scottish bankers earlier this year, Bank of England Governor Robin  Leigh-Pemberton said the authorities would be keeping an eye on all highly  leveraged deals. "I would be concerned if the development of the leveraged  buyout market here were to result in a profusion of unsuccessful financial  arrangements," he commented.  </P> <P> Whatever happens to the BAT bid, however, it is unlikely to slow down the  broader overseas mergers and acquisitions boom.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Honda Motor To Study Auto Production </F> in China; Considering Investing in Local Passenger Car Company"]    [Text] Honda Motor has begun looking into capital  investment in "Dongfeng Automobile Co." (Hubei), a core auto  group of China, in order to embark on passenger car production  in China. They are thinking of constructing a factory for  engines and other parts and beginning mass production of an  "Accord" class passenger car in 1996 in a joint venture with the  corporation. They have exchanged signatures with the Chinese  government to begin study of commercialization soon, and will  decide on a plan within the year. Among Japanese auto makers,  Mitsubishi Motors is studying the construction of an engine  plant by a three-nation joint venture with the participation of  Malaysia, and it seems that full-scale expansion into China by  Japanese auto makers is accelerating.    The Donfeng Automobile Co. with whom Honda is studying  capital participation, is the former Second Auto works and is  positioned as one corner of the "Big Three" of China's priority  auto business group, the "Big Three, Little Three, and Micro  Two."    Honda decided on a plan in July last year to supply engine  and pressed parts of the "Civic" from Japan to the Guangzhou  Yangcheng Auto Corp, financed by Guangzhou city, Guangdong  Province, and assemble them locally. However, the Chinese  government, which is seeking to shift parts technology under  central leadership, would not give permission for such a  regional project.    For this reason, Honda decided to open up an alternative for  passenger car production in the country by investing in Dongfeng  which has deep relations with the Chinese government. Citroen of  France has capital participation in Dongfeng and is building a  passenger car plant for annual production of 150,000 cars, but  according to Honda, it is possible for the Chinese government to  permit passenger car production by Honda separate from Citroen.    In the new auto policy for 1996 and thereafter which China  has informally decided, it is a requirement to have the rate of  domesticly produced parts over 40 percent as a condition for  permitting new participation of foreign capital in auto  production. The idea is that Honda will initially produce  150,000 passenger car engines annually, and while increasing the  [Chinese] domestic content rate, will assemble and produce  2000-cc displacement "Accord" class passenger cars beginning in  1996 to be supplied for the Chinese market. Some of the parts  will be exported to Southeast Asia such as Thailand.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Last Tricks of the North Korean Nuclear </F> Issue"]    [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue approaches a crisis  once again. This is because North Korea has begun changing fuel  rods at its nuclear reactor by ignoring the International Atomic  Energy Agency's [IAEA] request for safety steps regarding the  replacement of fuel rods.    Such dogmatic behavior by North Korea is a challenge that  will throw a wet blanket on efforts by the ROK, the United  States, and the United Nations to peacefully settle the North  Korean nuclear issue. Accordingly, the UN Security Council will  give, sooner or later, a warning to North Korea in the name of  its president or adopt a statement condemning North Korea  regarding its replacement of fuel rods. Also, it will discuss  sanctions against North Korea. Such being the situation, the  government naturally convened a meeting of security-related  ministers, defined the present situation as "a serious  situation," and decided to hurry in preparing against North  Korea's sudden action."    As soon as a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks seemed  imminent, North Korea turned their back from the international  community and suddenly began changing fuel rods at a 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The replacement of nuclear fuel  rods is the last key to uncovering the suspected nuclear  development by North Korea. This is because we can confirm if  North Korea has extracted plutonium, the raw material for  manufacturing nuclear weapons, from the spent fuel rods or  converted it to manufacture nuclear bombs. Accordingly, the  IAEA offered to analyze fuel rods after random selection and  separate preservation to confirm North Korea's claims that the  core rods [nosim] have not been removed since operations began  in 1986, but North Korea rejected this by citing "their unique  status" of having delayed their decision to withdraw from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It has been learned that North  Korea has already removed and is now preserving approximately  4,000 rods out of the 8,010 rods from the nuclear reactor.    We can point out several reasons why North Korea has begun  replacing fuel rods despite the fact that they are well aware  that international community would impose sanctions or pressure  against them, and that they would face destruction: First, this  is to hide the amount of plutonium they have so far extracted  from the spent fuel rods; second, technologically, they could no  longer put off the replacement of fuel rods; and third, this can  be regarded as a strategy to gain something more from the United  States during the third round of U.S.-North Korean high level  talks. Neither can we overlook the fact that North Korea seems  especially intent on acting this way in order to control their  people, who are agitated over the serious food shortage or  economic difficulties, by creating more tension on the Korean  peninsula.    While recklessly taking a hardline attitude regarding the  nuclear issue, North Korea has strongly insisted on holding  talks with the United States. This is attracting people's  attention. A spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry said on  28 May that "the DPRK will make every effort to ultimately  resolve the nuclear issue during talks with the United States."  Also, the Korea Central News Agency stressed that the DPRK  "will accept overall inspections [chonmyon sachal] of nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon if the United States agrees to settlement  of the nuclear issue through a package deal."    Anyway, we can no longer overlook North Korea's last game  with fire regarding the nuclear issue. The government needs to  clearly realize that there is a limit to our position regarding  the principle of peacefully resolving the nuclear issue and of  accepting North Korea as the same fellow men. It must assume a  stern attitude to lead North Korea to suspend replacing fuel  rods at the nuclear reactor and to accept the IAEA's request for  safety in the cooperation with the friendly countries, including  the United States. It is also important to take a strong  position so that the United States does not compromise with  North Korea in a manner it may deem fit, merely for its  diplomatic reputation.    If the UN Security Council imposes sanctions on North Korea  one week from now according to the recommendation by the IAEA  based on the final report of its Board of Governors, the  government should actively participate in it and suspend  exchange of manpower and goods with North Korea. Furthermore,  it is needless to say that the government should prepare for the  possible provocation by North Korea, which will have been thrown  into a corner.    What is most important at present is the government's North  Korean policy. Therefore, security-related officials should be  united in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue.</p>

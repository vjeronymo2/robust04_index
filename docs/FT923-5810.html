			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Jusco in link with Japanese suit maker JUSCO, the leading Japanese retailer, which also has ties with Body Shop, the UK cosmetics chain, has forged a link with Taka-Q, a Japanese maker of men's suits. The move by the two companies, both listed on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange, comes as consumer spending plunges in Japan. Industry analysts said the move amounted to a financial rescue for Taka-Q, although both companies maintained the tie-up was on equal terms. Taka-Q has been especially hard hit by the sharp decline and faces redemption of a warrant bond worth Dollars 100m later this year. It will allot 5.7m new shares to Jusco at Y560 (Dollars 4.48) per share. The allotment will make Jusco the third largest shareholder of Taka-Q.</p>

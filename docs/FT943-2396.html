			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Warning on Russian inflation Russian inflation will 'inevitably' rise sharply in the last months of this year, according to Mr Andrei Illarionov, a former economic adviser to the prime minister and head of the Institute for Economic Analysis. Mr Illarionov said it would rise from under 4 per cent in August to 7-8 per cent in September and move higher in the last three months of the year, reflecting the steep growth of credits in the summer. Mr Illarionov said that the government has so far this year issued credits totalling Rbs25,000bn (Pounds 6.8bn). He said inflation had been kept low because the velocity of money had fallen - but this could be expected to be temporary. However, figures produced by the Centre for Economic Performance, headed by Prof Richard Layard, of the London School of Economics, shows that real consumption has risen by 10 per cent during the year to July and that the real income of households has risen by 18 per cent in the same period. Prof Layard said the recorded fall of 24 per cent of industrial production compared with a year ago was 'difficult to reconcile with the consumption data'.</p>

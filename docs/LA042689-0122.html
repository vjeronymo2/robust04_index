			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: LACK OF CAPITAL TAKES U.S. OUT OF COMPETITION  </P> <P> "For want of a nail," wrote Benjamin Franklin, "the shoe was lost." From a  decision by a medium-sized company in an obscure but crucial business, we can  draw a lesson and a warning.  </P> <P> Perkin-Elmer Corp., a 50-year-old company in Norwalk, Conn., that gets about  $200 million of its $1.2 billion in annual revenue from lithographic equipment  for making semiconductors, announced Friday that it was going to sell that  business and use the proceeds to repurchase shares or pay extra dividends.  </P> <P> The decision was seen by knowledgeable people as terrible news -- a possible  body blow to U.S. prospects in electronics and computers and evidence that the  U.S. financial system is not suited to development of the industries and jobs  of tomorrow.  </P> <P> "This is what happens when you don't have the savings to provide capital for  industry," said Robert N. Noyce, founder of Intel Corp. and now chairman of  Sematech, the government-industry consortium trying to help U.S. companies  develop advanced semiconductor equipment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Worldwide Leader  </P> <P> "Perkin-Elmer's decision is one of the most serious blows to the interests of  the U.S. electronics and computer industries," said Jerry Hutcheson of VLSI  Research in San Jose. "It shows that our financial system is not conducive to  financing long-term technological development."  </P> <P> Are such comments overdone? Not really. Perkin-Elmer is a technological leader  in a worldwide, $8-billion industry that is key to much larger industries. Its  equipment makes integrated circuits, which in turn govern everything from  computers to car engines.  </P> <P> U.S. companies dominated the equipment field 10 years ago, but now Japanese  companies are in the lead. And the industry is so critical that the U.S.  government is spending $500 million, matched by $500 million from industry, to  finance Sematech's effort to keep U.S. companies in the race.  </P> <P> But Sematech can succeed only if there is a vibrant industry. And in that  respect, Perkin-Elmer was one of the great hopes. Its electron beam and  template-making equipment is the world standard and its new $4-million machine,  called Micrascan, is ahead of the field.  </P> <P> No slouch in research, Perkin-Elmer had invested $100 million to develop  Micrascan, a lithography machine that is getting a good reception from  customers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Return Expected  </P> <P> Yet Perkin-Elmer, which got into the equipment field 15 years ago when U.S.  companies were creating the modern microelectronics industry, is weary. It saw  the game grow riskier as American semiconductor makers dropped out under the  assault of Japanese competition.  </P> <P> "The only return we could see on that $100 million Micrascan investment was  break even at best," says Perkin-Elmer President Gaynor Kelley, "and if we went  on to the next generation in equipment (superpowered X-rays), the research  expense would take away from other business (analytical instruments for the  chemical industry) where we see a higher return."  </P> <P> Kelley, 57, a mechanical engineer who has been with the company 37 years,  blames the semiconductor equipment business for Perkin-Elmer's lagging profits  and stock price, which drew complaints from Wall Street's institutional  investors. "You can only expect an investor to be patient for so long," he  says.  </P> <P> Perhaps. Japanese companies face the same research costs -- but not the same  investor pressures. Their secret is that small companies are supported by large  ones.  </P> <P> Nikon, where semiconductor equipment sales now exceed camera sales, is a member  of the Mitsubishi Group, an agglomeration of 42 companies that may be the  world's largest business organization. Advantest, another equipment leader, is  21% owned by Fujitsu. The focus is on winning markets. "In memory chips, the  Japanese companies lost $4 billion," says Noyce. "The U.S. industry blew $2  billion and quit the field."  </P> <P> Clearly, U.S. companies need protectors, too, but who would buy Perkin-Elmer's  operation? "The Japanese would love to buy it," says Hutcheson of VLSI "but  that would be disastrous for U.S. industry."  </P> <P> He mentions Applied Materials, a U.S. equipment maker, or Motorola, which is  resuming memory chip production, as possible American buyers. The deal makes  sense economically, Hutcheson says, because a lot of semiconductor plants are  being built worldwide, which means big demands for equipment.  </P> <P> The catch is that an American buyer would have to be able to sell in Japan.  And, says Noyce, "Japan doesn't buy unless their companies absolutely don't  make it themselves.  </P> <P> "But that's not the heart of the problem," he adds. Not buying U.S. goods,  "that's their fault," says Noyce. But low personal savings and government  deficits that make capital scarce and costly to U.S. industry, "that's our  fault," he says.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't blame Wall Street; it's only the go-between, channeling funds  around a society that gives tax breaks to vacation homes but not to investment  in industry," says Noyce, recalling and repeating the classic line from the  comic strip Pogo: "We have met the enemy and he is us."  </P></p>

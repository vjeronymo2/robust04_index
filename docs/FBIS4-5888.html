			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Minivehicle manufacturers  are seeking expansion of standards for minivehicles to improve  their safety levels to those of regular-size vehicles, an  industry association reported Friday [15 April].    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said the move  was initiated by the association's special committee on  minivehicles headed by Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki Motor  Corp.    The association will formally decide on details of standard  expansion, including the size of vehicles and maximum engine  capacity, association officials said.    They said it is likely that the maximum engine capacity for  minivehicles will be raised to 800 cc from the present 660 cc.    The Transport Ministry will launch a study on the  modification of minivehicle standards after the committee comes  up with a formal proposal, the officials said.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Consumer body attacks Abbey over bank code ABBEY NATIONAL, the retail banking group, was criticised by a consumer group yesterday after deciding not to issue its own code of banking practice for customers. Yesterday was the last day for banks and building societies to declare whether they had accepted a draft code of banking practice agreed last year by banks, building societies and consumer groups. Unlike the other big high street banks which have all produced their own special codes of service for their customers, Abbey National says that it will simply place copies of the code 'Good Banking' in its branches for those customers who ask for them. Mr Guy Dehn, legal officer at the National Consumer Council, said he was disappointed by Abbey National's decision. 'Good Banking is the bare minimum that is acceptable in the market place,' he said. Britannia, the ninth largest UK building society, has launched the first stage of a Pounds 30m mortgage rescue scheme in partnership with Circle Thirty Three Housing Group in East Anglia. The scheme is part of a Pounds 1bn package pledged by mortgage lenders after talks with the government just before Christmas about ways of reducing the number of homes repossessed this year.</p>

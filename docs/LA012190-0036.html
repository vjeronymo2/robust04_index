			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> SAFE CARRIBEAN HOME: Apparently legendary Beatles producer George Martin still  has plenty of clout in pop land. Sickened by the devastation Hurricane Hugo  brought to the tiny island of Montserrat last September, Martin (who frequently  records at AIR Studios there) persuaded nearly 20 pop stars to donate tracks to  a just-released benefit album, "After the Hurricane: Songs for Montserrat."  </P> <P> Released by Chrysalis Records, the compilation features material from the  Rolling Stones, Elton John, Luther Vandross, Dire Straits, Simply Red, Cheap  Trick, Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. All profits from the album will go to  the Montserrat Hurricane Relief Record Fund. . . . Joan Jett has always had a  way with oldies -- remember her crunchin' version of "Crimson and Clover?" So  it's hardly a surprise that her just-released new album is entirely given over  to reinterpretations of rock classics. Titled "The Hit List," it features the  Sex Pistols' "Pretty Vacant," Jimi Hendrix's "Up From the Skies," AC/DC's  "Dirty Deeds," the Chambers Brothers' "Time Has Come Today" and the Kinks'  "Celluloid Heroes," which even features some vocal help from its author, Ray  Davies. . . . And remember the Unforgiven, the club faves who were a  bidding-war bust at Elektra a few years back? After a brief solo career, the  group's leader, Steve Jones, is back in the record business -- as an A&amp;R  exec at Hollywood Records.  </P></p>

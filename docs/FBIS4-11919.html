			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Caroline Faraj in Amman] </F>   [Text] Jordanian ambassador in Washington Fayiz  al-Tarawinah has stated that U.S. officials assured him that the  reasons for postponing the expanded meeting scheduled for last  Thursday [31 March] among representatives of various U.S.  Government departments and bodies concerned with foreign affairs  to discuss available options concerning the naval inspection of  ships bound for al- 'Aqabah port are purely technical and that  the meeting is expected to be held next week.    In a statement to AL-RA'Y by telephone from Washington,  al-Tarawinah said that senior U.S. Administration officials have  understood with complete seriousness [tafahhamu bijiddiyah  tammah] his majesty's stand as expressed during his meeting with  ambassadors of the permanent member states on the Security  Council on the current blockade on al-'Aqabah and that the  situation was very clear to everybody.    During his meetings and contacts with a number of U.S.  officials, al-Tarawinah asserted that Jordan's position on the  al-'Aqabah blockade stems from its being an extremely sensitive  political issue and not a procedural or bureaucratic matter.    He said that some officials gave him to understand that next  week's meeting at the State Department to make a decision on  al-'Aqabah blockade is expected to be in Jordan's interest.    A State Department official said recently that the meeting  was postponed until next week for reasons connected with  revision of schedules and times convenient to representatives of  U.S. departments and bodies concerned with foreign affairs.    It is worth mentioning that Jawad al-'Anani, minister of  state for cabinet affairs and Information minister, told a news  conference last Tuesday [29 March] that Jordan had proposed that  a neutral technical committee, such as the Lloyds company, might  inspect the ships upon docking at al-'Aqabah port.</p>

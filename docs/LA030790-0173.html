			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EX-BOXER GYPSY JOE HARRIS DIES  </P> <P> Former welterweight contender Gypsy Joe Harris, whose promising boxing career  ended with the discovery that he had concealed blindness in one eye, has died  at age 44.  </P> <P> Harris, who suffered four heart attacks in the last two years, died Tuesday at  Temple University Hospital, where he had been a patient since Feb. 10.  </P> <P> His sister, Daaiyah Waheed, attributed the death to heart failure.  </P> <P> Harris was born in Camden, N.J., and raised in North Philadelphia. A street  fight blinded his right eye when he was 11, but he pursued boxing anyway and  won 24 of 25 fights.  </P> <P> He lost his only fight on Aug. 6, 1968, in a decision to former champion Emile  Griffith. A routine physical examination two months later by the Pennsylvania  State Athletic Commission showed him to be blind in his right eye, and his  boxing license was revoked.  </P></p>

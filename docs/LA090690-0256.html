			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW KING OF BABYLON?;  </P> <P> IRAQ: SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS CREATED A PERSONAL IMAGE OF A MAN FOR ALL THE PEOPLE.  HE IS PORTRAYED AS FATHER, DESERT CHIEFTAIN, BUSINESSMAN, FARMER, SOLDIER AND  STATESMAN.  </P> <P> I, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon,  </P> <P>  I am the son of Nabuplossar, King of Babylon.  </P> <P>  I who erected the Ezida Temple,  </P> <P>  I who built Procession Street,  </P> <P>  The Street of the Forgiven Son,  </P> <P>  The Street of Nebu,  </P> <P>  And paved it with shimmering stones.  </P> <P>  Nebu, you the divine minister,  </P> <P>  Grant me immortality.  </P> <P>  -- Inscription at Babylon  </P> <P> The tour guide at a reconstructed palace in Babylon described with enthusiasm  the restored monuments of the ancient city -- the lion sculpture, the brick  reliefs of bulls and griffins, the newly planted hanging gardens.  </P> <P> Then she got to the throne room and, with a sweep of her hand, pointed to the  empty platform. "This is where the leader Saddam Hussein had his throne. This  is where Saddam Hussein sat," she said, voice rising in pride.  </P> <P> The short, stout woman looked around at the quizzical faces, then caught  herself with a nervous laugh. "I mean Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar.  Nebuchadnezzar had his throne here."  </P> <P> The guide could be forgiven for the gaffe, for even here at this 4,000-year-old  site on the banks of the slow-moving Euphrates, the handwriting on the wall  says that Saddam Hussein is Iraq's ruler for the ages.  </P> <P> Hussein, Iraq's president and self-described leader of the Arab world, has  created for himself a regional personality cult unrivaled in the world of the  1990s.  </P> <P> The phenomenon creates a landscape in itself. Giant portraits decorate plazas,  traffic circles and government and private buildings throughout the country.  His mustachioed face greets you at the airport in black-and-white photos, at  the currency exchange desk on color calendars, on roadside signs on  superhighways into Baghdad, at hotel entrances, in government offices. (In the  Information Ministry, one office has four portraits placed so that no matter  which way you turn, he is there.) Television offers no escape: The nightly news  relentlessly begins with reports of the president's daily activity.  Neighborhoods are named after him. Sports arenas. Schools. Bridges. A slice of  newly annexed Kuwait.  </P> <P> To view these images is to gaze at a conception of power and, in no small way,  to get a glimpse of the national obsessions of one of the Middle East's most  fractious societies.  </P> <P> The fatherly image that dominates the personality cult clashes with the violent  means that Hussein used to achieve and keep power. The assassinations,  executions, jailings and persecution of political opponents have made it all  but impossible for anyone to challenge Hussein.  </P> <P> As for the image, wrote Middle East expert Frederick W. Axelrod in his book  "The New Iraq," "Clumsy and rigid as they are, such attempts to inundate Iraq's  political culture with the image of its energetic leader have, by their sheer  weight, imposed on the public mind the suggestion that there is no true  alternative to Saddam Hussein's leadership in Iraq."  </P> <P> In his countless public portraits, Hussein is presented as a man of the people  -- of all the people in this ethnically and religiously split land. Sometimes  he is shown as fatherly, with a child bouncing on his knee, sometimes wearing a  Western suit for the benefit of businessmen and bureaucrats. Sometimes he is  the desert chieftain in flowing robes, the hunter with Tyrolean hat and  shotgun, the dandy in Panama hat and open shirt, the farmer in shirtsleeves  trading chitchat with craggy-faced peasants, the statesman sitting in the gilt  presidential chair.  </P> <P> He is up to date, depicted standing in front of a futuristic landscape of  skyscrapers or in a series of pop art portraits a la Andy Warhol. He is  eternal, as in Babylon, where a billboard has him sharing a scene with  Nebuchadnezzar near the tower of Babel.  </P> <P> For Iraq's Shiite Muslim population, whose loyalty to a state dominated by a  Sunni Muslim minority was long suspect, Hussein is revealed on posters at  prayer, on a rug, palms up in a gesture of supplication, eyes looking to  heaven. The image is striking given the secular nature of the quasi-socialist  Arab Baath Socialist Party that Hussein leads.  </P> <P> As a sop to Iraq's restive Kurdish population, Hussein poses in a blue robe and  turban typical of Kurdistan.  </P> <P> The personality cult flowered during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran, a  conflict that began in 1980 and took hundreds of thousands of lives on each  side.  </P> <P> The war, initially a conflict over the waterway formed by the Tigris and  Euphrates rivers, became thoroughly identified with Hussein. Iraqis came to  refer to the conflict as a new version of the ancient war between Mesopotamia,  the historical forerunner of Iraq, and Persia, which was to become Iran.  </P> <P> Military portraits are the most common homage to Hussein. He's a paratrooper in  beret, an infantryman in helmet, a much-decorated officer holding a ceremonial  saber.  </P> <P> One painting shows him standing in front of a battlefield replete with chariots  and bowmen.  </P> <P> Such heavy-handed efforts to link Hussein's dictatorship with Iraq's past is  one of the most striking themes of his self-aggrandizement. He tries to line up  not only with the most ancient of rulers, but also with more recent ones who  until just a year ago were viewed as corrupt pawns of foreign powers.  </P> <P> Last year, he rehabilitated Faisal I, who led the Arab Revolt against Turkish  rule in World War I. Faisal had been promised rule over Syria by his British  allies but was betrayed and given Iraq as a consolation prize. Last year,  Hussein renovated Faisal's tomb, along with those of other members of the royal  Hashemite family, and he restored an equestrian statue of Faisal to a Baghdad  square.  </P> <P> The Hashemites were overthrown in a bloody coup in 1958.  </P> <P> Hussein has not stopped at just reviving the Hashemites' dignity; he has  decided to join them, in a way. Conveniently, a family tree has been discovered  in the southern town of Kerbala that purports to show that Hussein, just like  the deposed monarchy, is related to the Prophet Mohammed.  </P> <P> Even Jordan's King Hussein, a Hashemite but no kin to Saddam Hussein, has  started calling the Iraqi leader "cousin."  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein makes much of his tenuous contact with another Arab hero --  Saladin, the Medieval nemesis of the Crusaders. Both came from the same  village, Tikrit, north of Baghdad.  </P> <P> No ruler in ancient Mesopotamia is beyond association with Hussein. In the  basement of the Martyr's Monument, a massive Baghdad shrine to the Persian Gulf  War dead in the form of a split Oriental dome, a new exhibit traces Hussein's  life in photos. There's the wattle hut where he was born, photos of him as a  jug-eared schoolboy who got high marks in school in singing and history, of a  gangly teen with only a hint of the mustache that would flourish later in life,  of an underground revolutionary who tried to kill a prime minister and fled  into exile, of a hunted nationalist exile in a variety of disguises, of a  smiling leader with wife and baby.  </P> <P> Punctuating this epic biography is a photo of what appears to be a relief of  the type that originated at Babylon. On the right is a gowned figure of  Hammurabi, who ruled 4,000 years ago and earned eternal fame for devising the  world's first code of law. He is handing a copy to -- who else? -- Saddam  Hussein, who is wearing a suit and tie for the occasion.  </P></p>

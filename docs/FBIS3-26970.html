			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News analysis" by XINHUA reporter Wang Nan (13769 2809): </F> "In What Direction Will U.S.-Japanese Trade Relations Go?";  Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 0853 GMT on 16  February transmits a service message canceling the following  item and asks that it be replaced with another version  transmitted immediately after the service message; differences  between the two items are noted]    [Text] Washington, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor announced here today that because  Japan failed to fulfill the 1989 bilateral U.S.-Japanese  agreement on telecommunications products, the United States  would raise import tariffs -- in other words, impose so-called  trade sanctions -- on Japanese-made cellular phones. Thus, the  U.S.-Japanese trade conflicts that have been boiling for some  time have eventually come to an "end." [variant version reads  "U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced here today  that he was sure that Japan had failed to fulfill the 1989  bilateral U.S.-Japanese agreement on telecommunications  products, and so Japan might be subjected to retaliatory  actions." -- rewording paragraph]    Five year ago, the Japanese Government agreed that cellular  phones produced by the U.S. Motorola company may have access to  Japan, and Japan also promised that by 15 February 1994 the  company's products would account for one-third to one-half of  Tokyo's cellular phone market. Motorola, which is headquartered  in Champion, Illinois, announced a few days ago that owing to  the many restrictions imposed by the Japanese Government and by  business circles, the company's products accounted for only 5  percent of the Tokyo market, which is a far cry from Japan's  promise.    In fact, the cellular phone trade is just a miniscule  portion  in terms of the economic interests of these two largest  industrialized countries in the world. However, since the  announcement of the trade sanctions was made on 11 February  after the breakdown of the U.S.-Japanese summit talks, the  dispute has become particularly eye-catching. The issue of  where will U.S.-Japanese trade go from here has become a major  topic of discussion and concern here. [variant version reads  "Kantor added: `We have said many times that we are determined  to achieve results in carrying out our trade agreement.' He  stressed that the United States would announce within 30 days  certain trade sanctions that had been contemplated." --  rewording paragraph]    Because it failed to reach an agreement on the eight months  of talks on a framework for U.S.-Japanese trade, President  Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa last Friday [11  February] became the sides' first unsuccessful summit meeting  after World War II. During the negotiations, the U.S. side  insisted on using numerical targets as the yardstick for  measuring the two countries' trade relations and said that Japan  should first open for the United States its markets for  automobiles, auto parts, telecommunications products, medical  equipment, and insurance, but Japan stated that this was  unacceptable. The negotiations ended unsuccessfully.    U.S.-Japanese trade relations over the last 20 years show  that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan has soared drastically.  The $1.3 billion trade deficit in 1971 soared to $21.6 billion  in 1983 and to $54 billion in 1992. It is estimated that the  trade deficit in 1993 would reach $60 billion. Meanwhile, the  United States has also started to solve this problem through  various channels of negotiations. The "market-oriented  negotiations in individual sectors" during the early eighties  involved telecommunications products, medical equipment,  pharmaceuticals, timber, and automobiles; and during the latter  part of the eighties, the United States tried to adopt the  so-called "Super 301" section of the trade law to eliminate the  trade barriers that Japan had imposed on U.S.-made  supercomputers, satellites, and timber products. Ever since the  1990's, the United States has started to tackle structural  issues concerning U.S.-Japanese investment and trade -- issues  such as investment barriers, antimonopoly measures, trade  exclusivity, and so forth.    The Clinton administration has described the framework  negotiations on U.S.-Japanese trade -- which started last July  -- as the first U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations that paid  attention to results, but Japan was offended by the U.S. attempt  to "manage trade" using numerical targets.    In President Clinton's words, the 30 or so bilateral trade  agreements that the United States and Japan have reached during  the last decade or so are just "for show" because they have  achieved nothing substantial in opening up Japan's markets.  According to U.S. Government statistics, compared with other  industrialized countries, the Japanese market is the smallest  for foreign goods. Among other goods, [foreign]  telecommunications products, insurance, and automobiles account  for 5, 2, and 3 percent, respectively, of the Japanese market.  Because expanding exports to Japan is one of the measures that  the United States is pursuing to create job opportunities at  home, President Clinton said that the United States can no  longer wait. He said that while the U.S. sanctions on Japanese  telecommunications products would be "just a coincidence," they  may explain where the problems lie.    In their talks with the press, White House officials have  tried everything to avoid using the phrase "trade war."  Observers here maintain that U.S.-Japanese economic relations  have developed to such an extent that they need each other and  that neither side can gain in a large-scale trade war. Laura  Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on  14 February that the time "is not yet ripe" for waging a trade  war with Japan. She added, however, that a trade war might  occur and so the "Japanese should think thrice." Observers here  maintain that the United States has yet to state clearly what  actions it will take following the failure of the U.S.-Japanese  summit, and that the United States wants Japanese business  circles to exercise pressure on the government and to force it  to concede and that it also wants to force the Japanese yen to  strengthen and affect the Tokyo stock market.    Currently the U.S. Government may have these options:  restating the "Super 301" section of the trade law through an  executive order of the President; demanding that the GATT  conduct a special examination of Japan; accusing Japanese  companies in the United States of violating the "antitrust law";  and classifying light trucks and sports cars imported from Japan  as trucks so that the tariffs imposed on them can be raised from  25 percent to tenfold [shi bei -- 0577 0223]. What moves Japan  may take after the United States has contemplated taking  retaliatory measures remain to be seen. [variant version reads  "what moves the United States and Japan will take during the  next 30 days merit attention." -- rewording last sentence]</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Latest opinion poll deals blow to Mitterrand PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand's hopes of a positive result in next month's referendum were dealt another blow yesterday by an opinion poll indicating that a majority would vote against ratifying the Maastricht treaty. The poll, conducted by the IPSOS market research consultancy for Le Point magazine, indicated that 52 per cent of the electorate intend to vote 'no' on September 20. Mr Mitterrand said the poll showed that the French needed better explanations, saying that advocates of European union would have to 'explain, explain, explain in order to convince, convince, convince'. He was speaking after an informal meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, one of the champions of union, on the German North Sea island of Borkum. The poll is the second to show a majority for the anti-Maastricht faction. The first to do so was a BVA study published on Tuesday. The other three polls released this week have shown slender majorities in favour. When the interviewees were asked why people would oppose the ratification of the treaty 47 per cent cited opposition to Mr Mitterrand and 39 per cent hostility to Europe. So far the anti-Maastricht lobby is believed to be running a better campaign: 33 per cent of the poll said so, compared with 19 per cent who praised tne pro-Maastricht campaign. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is considering a request from the French TV1 television channel to make a live contribution to a televised debate on Maastricht next Thursday evening, writes Alison Smith in London. Downing Street said yesterday there was a purely logistical problem, in that the premier had engagements the evening. No decision would be taken, however, until after the close of the London peace conference on the former Yugoslavia. The Foreign Office advice to Mr Major will include an assessment of the likely reaction of President Mitterrand - both to a refusal as well as an acceptance. The prime minister will also want to consider the potentially damaging domestic political effects of a decision to go ahead. Any move to intervene in the French referendum would antagonise Tory Euro-sceptics afresh.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / More armour in Middle East Qatar and Kuwait have agreed to provide bases for additional US armour and attack jets in a Gulf build-up to prepare for any new military threat from Iraq, the US Defence Department said yesterday. Qatar will accept the positioning of tanks and supplies for use by a brigade of over 2,000 US troops should the need arise again to send American soldiers to the Gulf. A squadron of about 24 A-10 attack jets, slow flying and heavily armed aircraft designed to smash tanks, will also be sent to Kuwait. Defence officials said they considered the agreement with Qatar a breakthrough in the Pentagon's push to position more heavy armour in the region to meet any potential Iraqi threat or build-up. Qatar was used as a base for F-16s during the 1991 Gulf War. 'Qatar has allowed us to put in a full brigade's worth of equipment,' the Pentagon said. 'A squadron of A-10s will be deployed in Kuwait.' The US is now seeking to store enough armour on the ground in the Gulf region for three brigades representing about a division of 10,000 troops.</p>

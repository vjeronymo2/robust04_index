			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PETE ROSE DECISION;  </P> <P> SHOW MUST GO ON;  </P> <P> LIFETIME BAN DOESN'T KEEP ROSE'S CABLE CASH REGISTER FROM RINGING UP SALES  </P> <P> Hours after being banned from baseball for life, Pete Rose returned to cable  television Thursday night to sell baseball memorabilia and tell viewers his  achievements on the field still merit Hall of Fame selection.  </P> <P> "I don't think today's ruling has anything to do with me making the Hall of  Fame," Rose told a viewer from San Diego who called on Cable Value Network, a  home-shopping station.  </P> <P> "I'm looking forward to being reinstated into baseball after a year. I did my  part to go to the Hall of Fame, as far as I'm concerned.  </P> <P> "I got the hits, I scored the runs, I made the plays. I don't think anybody can  take that away from me. But you never know. It's not in your hands."  </P> <P> As he spoke, Rose held up an autographed plaque -- selling for $79.92 --  depicting him standing on first base after getting his 4,192nd hit to break Ty  Cobb's record.  </P> <P> Earlier Thursday, Commissioner Bart Giamatti barred Rose from baseball. Rose  can apply for reinstatement after one year under the game's rules. Even if he  is turned down, the game's most prolific hitter will be eligible for election  to the Hall of Fame in 1992.  </P> <P> Thursday marked Rose's second appearance on CVN. He also hawked bats and balls  Wednesday night as word of his impending suspension spread, but didn't comment  then.  </P> <P> Among the items Rose offered Thursday night were baseballs autographed by him  and Steve Garvey with the number 4,192, selling for $79.92, and Red jerseys  with Rose's name and number 14 on the back.  </P> <P> "Here's a piece of history," host Al Skantz said of the jerseys.  </P> <P> "The legend of Pete Rose is available for $399.92, or four payments of $99.98.  These were officially ordered by Pete."  </P> <P> Added Rose: "Tell them we'll give them a letter with that."  </P> <P> "That's right," Skantz said. "We'll give you a letter of authenticity."  </P> <P> Earlier Thursday, CVN chief financial officer Roger Cloutier said the company  was not concerned about having Rose on the station on the day his suspension  was announced.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we're going to go on with the show," he said.  </P> <P> Cloutier said Rose planned to fly back to Cincinnati immediately after his  two-hour appearance ended at 10 p.m. CDT.  </P> <P> Rose had not previously worked for CVN, said Cloutier, who declined to disclose  financial information about the station's agreement with Rose or discuss  Wednesday night's sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GAMBLING RULESection 21 (d) of the Major League Rules reads, in part: "Any  player, umpire, or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum  whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection which the bettor has a duty to  perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible."  </P></p>

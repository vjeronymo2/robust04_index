			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku May 28 TASS -- Azerbaijani President Geydar  Aliyev met with Russian deputies on Saturday to discuss  Azerbaijani-Russian relations and conflict settlement in the  region.    A group of Russian state Duma deputies are in Azerbaijan to  study prospects for their participation in settling the  Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict and boosting relations between the  two countries.    Nikolay Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Defence and  Security Committee, stressed that cessation of hostilities in  the war zone is the major prerequisite for normalising  relations. This opinion was shared by Vyacheslav Lyubimov,  deputy chairman of the Committee for Agrarian Policy. He  pointed out that the way to peace lies through negotiations and  termination of all hostilities.    Aliyev praised Russia's role in settling the conflict and  emphasised that its mediatory role will bring positive results  only if Russian people receive true information about what is  happening in Azerbaijan and the region.    He called for restoring all ties between the two countries  which were severed after the disintegration of the Soviet Union  in December 1991. Speaking about the position of the  Russian-speaking population in the republic, Aliyev said that  despite problems the general attitude toward them has always  been favourable and good. He believes this provides a good basis  for strengthening bilateral relations.    The Russian delegation also met with Azerbaijani Parliament  Chairman Rasul Guliyev and representatives of the Russian  community in Baku.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: PDVSA cuts Dollars 1bn off spending PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, is cutting its 1992 investment and operating budgets by more than USDollars 1bn, according to Mr Gustavo Roosen, the company's president. PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, was forced to reduce its general budget primarily because of lower-than-expected oil prices on international markets. However, the fact that the company must pay its owner - the Venezuelan government - a very high tax rate means funds available for capital investments are severely squeezed. The group pays taxes in Venezuela equivalent to 82 per cent of operating profits. In Caracas, Mr Roosen said the company's capital investment outlays would be reduced this year by around Dollars 530m, or 10.5 per cent, falling to Dollars 4.5bn, while operating expenditures would be cut by some Dollars 485m (10.2 per cent) to Dollars 4.3bn. He also said the company so far this year had arranged international financing of Dollars 1.4bn for its investment programme, and it expected to line up another Dollars 1.2bn over the next few months. Much of this financing for the 1992-97 capital investment programme involves supplier credits backed by government import-export institutions. PDVSA officials have warned that the company's high tax burden would seriously harm plans for investments. Last year, PDVSA reported total international revenues of Dollars 22.3bn.</p>

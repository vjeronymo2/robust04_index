			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  MICRO ... : HAM MAKES EASTER MEAL A SNAP  </P> <P> Ready-to-eat hams microwave superbly and require very little effort from the  cook, which makes preparing the traditional Easter meal a snap.  </P> <P> Any kind of commercial ham will do. And you can glaze it or not, as you desire.  But bear these points in mind.  </P> <P> Trim the ham of all but 1/8 inch of exterior fat. Fat attracts microwaves,  melts rapidly and produces an abundance of drippings that must be ladled off.  Further, a heavy coating of fat will cause the lean areas directly underneath  it to overcook.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Spice Choices  </P> <P> If you like, rub a ham with pepper and herbs before it goes into the microwave.  Sage, thyme, dill weed, crushed caraway or fennel seeds, marjoram and oregano  are all good choices.  </P> <P> Always use a microwave-safe meat thermometer -- or if your oven has one, a  temperature probe -- when cooking ham so you can pull it from the oven the  instant the proper internal temperature is reached.  </P> <P> To keep shank ends and the top edges of hams from drying, shield carefully with  aluminum foil as the following recipe directs.  </P> <P> GLAZED HAM  </P> <P> 1 (4- to 6-pound) bone-in, butt or shank-portion ham or semi-boneless  ready-to-eat ham or fully cooked, smoked picnic shoulder  </P> <P> 1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons prepared spicy brown mustard  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon cider vinegar  </P> <P> Raisin Sauce, optional  </P> <P> Trim outer layer of fat on ham to 1/8 inch. Tie ham with string (to keep fat  from separating as ham cooks) and place on microwave-safe rack in shallow  microwave-safe bake/roast pan. If ham wobbles, prop up with crumpled wax paper.  </P> <P> Smooth sheet of plastic wrap against cut surface of ham, then mold 1- to 2-inch  foil strip smoothly over upper edge where fat joins lean to deflect microwaves  and prevent overcooking. (If cooking shank-portion ham, foil-wrap shank end.)  </P> <P> Insert microwave-safe meat thermometer through plastic wrap in center of  largest muscle not touching fat or bone. Or, use automatic temperature probe  according to manufacturer's directions. Or, test ham with instant-register  thermometer as it approaches doneness.  </P> <P> Microwave ham, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 5 minutes. Reduce power to  MEDIUM (50% power) and microwave 7 to 10 minutes per pound.  </P> <P> At half time, invert ham and rotate pan 180 degrees. Remove foil but not  plastic wrap. Continue microwaving until thermometer registers 130 degrees. If  desired, score fat, criss-cross fashion, 10 minutes before ham is done.  </P> <P> Drain off all drippings, reserving 1/4 cup for Raisin Sauce. Remove plastic  wrap. Combine brown sugar, mustard and vinegar and spread over ham. Microwave,  uncovered, on MEDIUM 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Remove ham from oven, tent with foil and let stand 10 minutes. Serve as is or  accompany with Raisin Sauce. Makes 6 to 10 servings.  </P> <P> Raisin Sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 cup pan dripping (or drippings plus enough bacon drippings to total 1/4  cup)  </P> <P> 1/4 cup flour  </P> <P> 2 cups hot water  </P> <P> 1/3 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1/4 cup medium-dry Madeira, Sherry or Port  </P> <P> Liquid gravy browner, optional  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Microwave drippings in wax-paper-covered 6-cup measure on HIGH (100% power) 40  to 50 seconds.  </P> <P> Blend in flour and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 7 to 10 minutes, stirring  every 3 minutes, until light brown. Mixture will look grainy but will smooth  out once liquid is added.  </P> <P> Pour water into drained ham pan and scrap up brown bits. Whisk liquid carefully  into hot roux being careful of spattering. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 3 1/2  to 4 minutes, whisking at half time, until sauce thickens and boils.  </P> <P> Mix in raisins and Madeira and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-LOW (30% power)  4 to 5 minutes, until raisins are plump. Mix in gravy browner and salt and  pepper to taste. Makes 2 1/2 cups.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (4): The shake-out takes its toll - Manufacturing, the quality as well as the quantity of jobs on offer has decline / The decline of the manufacturing sector and the rise of the services sector leads to a mismatch of local skills ONCE upon a time, when the sun shone on the Coventry economy and never looked likely to set, city unemployment was about half of one per cent. That was in 1955. Now, nearly a generation of change later, the contrast is savage. Over the last six months, said the West Midlands Enterprise Board in latest analysis of unemployment in the old West Midlands metropolitan county, 'the highest rate of increase has been in Coventry where the jobless total has risen by 13 per cent, and the lowest has been in Birmingham where there has been a rise of 6.1 per cent. In the county as a whole, there has been a fall of 0.1 per cent over the last month and a rise of 8.5 per cent over the last six months.' Coventry, in other words, has been faring worse in employment terms than other parts of the West Midlands conurbation. However, within this generalisation, encapsulated in an overall unemployment rate of 14.1 per cent against a national average of 9.4 per cent, there are distinct local and sectoral variations. Firstly, men have suffered from redundancies to a greater extent than women. This is not a phenomenon peculiar to Coventry, but as the City Council noted last year, men were losing their jobs at twice the rate of women, confirming that 'the current recession is affecting mostly male full-time employment.' The latest jobless totals have a male unemployment rate of 18.1 per cent and a female rate of 8.0 per cent. Secondly, and this follows on from the first point, redundancies appear to have been taking place at a much higher rate in the manufacturing sector, where there is the highest incidence of full time male employment, than in the services sector, where there is a high level of female, part-time employment. The list of companies which have announced redundancies in recent months is full of household names: Alvis, British Coal, closing the last pit in the area; Courtaulds, Dunlop Aviation, Federal Express, GPT, Massey Ferguson, Matrix Churchill and so on. Third, the geographic distribution of unemployment in the city shows that some wards are markedly more affected than others - 'there is still a strong north-west/south-east divide,' observes the City Council, 'with much lower rates evident in the areas to the south and east of the city centre and very high rates within the inner city wards.' The worst affected wards are St Michael's and Foleshill, where male jobless rates run at 34.0 and 29.0 per cent respectively. They are also the wards where there is the highest concentration of ethnic minorities  - Asian and Afro-Caribbean. Their male unemployment rate is twice as high as the white rate, and their female rate is three times higher than the white. It is these wards where, says Mr Trevor Cornfoot, head of economic development at the City Council, 'there is a real difficulty of trying to secure adequate employment.' Partly, he notes, this is because the wards are among the early industrialised areas of Coventry and over the last two decades there has been a succession of large factory closures, including Alfred Herbert, the machine tool manufacturer, and Morris Engines. Not surprisingly, the two wards are the setting of Coventry's City Challenge bid for new government urban renewal funding. The steady rise in unemployment, as the recession has bitten deeper, has taken place against the background of a decline in the working population, itself a movement in parallel with a declining population. Official estimates show that the total population is expected to decline to 296,000 by next year from 326,000 in 1979, while the working population will reduce to 177,000 by next year from 193,000 in 1979. But within these declining numbers there has been a perceptible shift in the nature of employment. The string of manufacturing redundancies of recent months has simply exacerbated a trend which has been apparent in varying degrees from the early 1970s: the lower importance of manufacturing and the higher importance of services in the employment mix. The 1989 employment census, coming after a decade of deep cuts in capacity, still showed, however, that 40 per cent of the workforce was employed in manufacturing, against a national average of 23 per cent. The present recession will have reduced that proportion further. Indeed, most local predictions suggest that unemployment will continue rising at least until well into the second half of this year and possibly into 1993. Given the cyclical nature of the engineering industry, broadly defined, the process of reducing dependence on manufacturing may provide a greater degree of employment stability. But there are two problems. The first is that, as a generalisation, jobs with wage rates which traditionally had supported a family have disappeared to be replaced by service sector jobs which offer less money. Labour surveys have shown that the likely maximum wage for office staff is about the median level for industrial earnings. They have also shown that, although basic pay for full-time working women is roughly two-thirds of the level of male pay, it is double the level paid to part time working women. The second problem is that the decline of the manufacturing sector and the rise of the services sector gives rise to a mismatch of skills. Service sector employers do not need people with expertise in industrial working. Given continued expansion of the Coventry services sector, finding new entrants to the labour force will assume a greater importance even as jobs are being lost. The pattern for employment trends has been set. Dr Michael Healey, principal lecturer in geography at Coventry Polytechnic, believes that, in terms of job creation in the city, three factors are likely to be evident over the coming years: there will be more part-time working, more flexible employment practices and, as the present jobless statistics have foreshadowed, there will be an even greater role for women.  ----------------------------------------           WARD UNEMPLOYMENT  ---------------------------------------- Ward                    Number      % Bablake                    587    8.8 Binley and Willenhall    1,376   13.8 Cheylesmore                838   11.7 Earlsdon                   706    9.7 Foleshill                1,703   24.4 Henley                   1,486   16.5 Holbrook                 1,264   14.7 Longford                 1,421   17.1 Lower Stoke              1,066   14.5 Radford                  1,427   19.1 St Michael's             1,746   27.6 Sherbourne                 928   12.7 Upper Stoke              1,033   13.4 Wainbody                   360    6.2 Westwood                   871   13.4 Whoberley                  879   10.9 Woodlands                  937   10.0 Wyken                      968   10.4 District total          19,599   14.1  ---------------------------------------- Source: Coventry Labour Market Review.  ----------------------------------------</p>

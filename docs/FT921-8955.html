			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls for third day on political scandal fears A CALL for a cut in the discount rate by a leading politician briefly lifted share prices, but worries about a potential political scandal sent the Nikkei average lower for the third consecutive trading day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 150.62 at 21,391.02 after a day's low of 21,349.33 and high of 21,596.65. A call for a half-point reduction in the discount rate by Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, boosted the index in the afternoon, but share prices later fell on profit-taking and index-related selling. Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 170m. Declines led advances by 606 to 300, with 196 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 8.73 to 1,586.08, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.15 to 1,214.73. News of a raid by prosecutors on Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery company entangled in a new political corruption scandal, depressed the market. Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Market sentiment is already bad, and people are just looking for excuses not to trade.' Meanwhile, the big four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - presented proposals to revive the stock market to the Japan Securities Dealers Association. They included an increase in profit distribution to shareholders, reducing the minimum trading unit for stocks and reviewing the securities tax system. The brokers also recommended that steps should be taken to ensure fairness and transparency in the stock market, including the relationship between cash stocks and the derivative markets. However, the proposals failed to have much effect on the market. The lack of fresh news prompted some issues to be swayed by rumours. Daito Trust Construction fell Y570 to Y8,780 on a string of earnings and scandal-related rumours denied by the company. Non-life insurance companies weakened on selling by foreign brokers. Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance declined Y30 to Y1,140 and Mitsui Marine and Fire Y8 to Y840. A total of 37 stocks fell to new lows since the start of last year, including Fujitsu, down Y2 to Y768, and Minolta Camera, retreating Y11 to Y459. Oji Paper dipped Y8 to Y854. The issue gained ground on Wednesday after Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, suggested a possible redenomination of the yen. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 113.97 to 23,103.18 in volume of 80.4m shares. The index fell for the fourth consecutive day as construction, pharmaceutical and electric power issues declined. Roundup SENTIMENT stayed mixed in the region yesterday, with Hong Kong at yet another peak, Seoul still on a downtrend and Bangkok setting another turnover record. HONG KONG closed sharply higher in heavy trading, registering its fourth record high in the last six sessions. The Hang Seng index advanced 31.07 to 4,763.50 as turnover swelled to HKDollars 2.74bn (HKDollars 1.99bn). Dealers expect the local banks to reduce their key rate by half a point to 8 per cent at the weekly meeting today. Trading in HSBC Holdings, parent company of Hongkong Bank, was heavy, with more than HKDollars 300m worth of shares traded as the stock rose 75 cents to HKDollars 39.75 on speculation of good 1991 earnings. New World Development moved ahead 40 cents to HKDollars 14.30 in heavy trading, amid rumours of an impending issue of covered warrants. AUSTRALIA had a volatile day, climbing initially on News Corp's strength but falling back as better than expected unemployment data reduced hopes of an interest rate cut. The All Ordinaries index ended 5.7 up at 1,622.9 after a day's high of 1,634.7, in turnover of ADollars 304.8m. News Corp surged ADollars 1.50 to ADollars 17.20 after its well-received 38 per cent increase in first-half profits on Wednesday. BANGKOK chalked up the highest daily turnover in its history, Bt14.83bn against Bt11bn on Wednesday, as the SET index rose 1.76 to 803.20. Three top property issues advanced, offsetting declines in major banks and other stocks. Bangkok Land and Bangkok Bank topped the active stocks list in turnover of Bt2.15bn each, Land gaining Bt5 to Bt198 and the bank closing Bt8 lower at Bt608. SEOUL weakened for the fourth day in a row, the composite stock index finishing 7.74 lower at 656.49 as turnover rose from Won341.5bn to Won349.5bn. Rumours of a lack of cash at Hyundai Group dampened sentiment. NEW ZEALAND was mixed as a lack of support for blue chip issues was partly offset by modest buying interest in small export-related shares. The NZSE-40 index eased 6.71 to 1,470.93 in turnover of NZDollars 14.4m (NZDollars 23.5m). Telecom, due to report its fiscal third-quarter results next Tuesday, slipped 3 cents to NZDollars 2.36, while Fletcher Challenge, with fiscal first-half earnings expected on the same day, softened 2 cents to NZDollars 3.44. TAIWAN rebounded in thin trading, snapping a streak of five losing sessions. The weighted index recovered 26.50 to 5,088.10 as turnover contracted to TDollars 29.7bn, the lowest level in a month.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Good News/Bad News Dept.: After overcoming objections from residents of Carmel  who became overdosed on show business during Clint Eastwood's term as mayor,  Disney Productions this week won permission to film outdoor scenes there for a  movie starring Tom Hanks and Mare Winningham. But now, Henry Winkler has pulled  out as director because of "mutual creative differences." In the comedy,  "Turner and Hooch," a detective's orderly life is disrupted when he's assigned  a big dog as a partner. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

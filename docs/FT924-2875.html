			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind rise at Protean 'Significant contributions' from two sizeable acquisitions made in the last financial year helped Protean, the laboratory equipment supplier and water purification specialist, to report a near threefold profits increase in the six months to end-September. From turnover up Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 15.3m, pre-tax profits of the company, which until February this year was known as Elga Group, surged from Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 1.38m. Protean also announced it was to expand further with the acquisition for Pounds 2.1m of Epsom Glass Industries, a principal supplier to Chromacol, a Protean subsidiary. The acquisition follows the Pounds 300,000 purchase last month of DA Baldwin (Water Treatment). The two purchases will be funded by a Pounds 2.5m share placing. The interim dividend is increased to 0.9p (0.6p), payable from earnings per share of 3.74p (1.94p).</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: Clean Break's Red Anna Reynolds, the writer in residence for the Clean Break Theatre Company, has developed an unmistakeable style. Clean Break means what its name suggests, plus a lacing of feminism: it is a company for women ex-prisoners and ex-offenders wishing to break with the past. Ms Reynolds was once a prisoner. Her writing draws heavily on her experience and suggests that she sees theatre as a kind of therapy for those who are locked up, though I suspect that no one can write as well as she does without considerable background reading. In any case, her works are already appealing to a wider audience, and deservedly so. Her early piece, Jordan, was first performed at the Lilian Baylis Theatre two years ago. The revival of that acclaimed production can still just about be caught (that is, until April 10) at the Battersea Arts. Based on a true story about a woman, Shirley Jones, who was incarcerated for killing her baby son and then committed suicide on the day of her release from prison, it is a monologue full of incident. As in the original, it is superbly acted by Moira Buffini, the co-author, as Shirley. Ms Reynolds's Wild Things was enthusiastically reviewed by my colleague, Alastair Macaulay, when it had its premiere in Salisbury last November. It is now touring. The new work is Red at the New End Theatre in Hampstead. The trouble is that the author has already set such high standards that the immediate comment is that Red is not quite as good as Jordan. There is the slight feeling of having been there before. In Red there are two characters, both of them women in a remand cell beneath a Crown court and both of them charged with a murder of a kind. This may seem an advance on Jordan in that there is an opportunity for dialogue as well as narrative. There are certainly contrasts. One of the women, Gerda, is white English upper middle class, aged 40. She has not directly murdered her husband, but has not exactly discouraged her rough young lover from doing so. If you note a borrowing from Hester in Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea, you will not be alone. Gerda prefers sex to respectability. She is immaculately played by Carrie Thomas, who keeps her make-up in place to the last. Gerda is also socially adept. Kay, her companion in the prison cell, is black. When Gerda asks her where she comes from, there is only momentary surprise when the answer is Essex, not somewhere in the Caribbean. Gerda takes it in her stride. Kay, played very strongly by Leonora Rogers-Wright, is more skilled in the ways of dealing with judges and juries. She has picked up some of the lines from Shirley Jones in Jordan: when to smile at the bench, when to cry and when not and when to try to tell the truth. The women talk to each other, or at each other, a lot. They recognise that they are more or less in the same boat: social and ethnic differences are irrelevant. But there is no great dialogue, and in the end I concluded that there was more variety in the monologue of Shirley Jones. Still, Ms Reynolds can certainly write. Red, like Jordan, is directed by Fiona Buffini, sister of Moira. Continuing at the New End, Hampstead, until April 24. 071 794 0022.</p>

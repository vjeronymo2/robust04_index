			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch seeks decision on Czech brewer Anheuser-Busch has increased pressure on the Czech government to decide the future of Budejovicky Budvar, the Czech Republic's most famous brewer in which the US group is trying to take a minority stake. In two related moves, Anheuser-Busch says it is suspending negotiations on buying 34 per cent of Budvar, and is not renewing a moratorium on legal action in a dispute between the two companies on use of the Budweiser trademark. However, it also said it was no longer linking the purchase of the stake to a resolution of the trademark dispute, which is hampering Anheuser-Busch's plans to market its own Budweiser brand in important European markets such as Germany. Mr Jack Purnell, chairman and chief executive of Anheuser-Busch International, said he hoped the separation of the investment from the trademark dispute would 'advance progress on both issues'. It is expected that the dispute will be resolved before any investment is made. Anheuser-Busch said on Tuesday that discussions on the equity stake would be postponed until the government decided how the Czech brewer should be privatised. Negotiations on making an investment began in 1990, and earlier this year it was named the sole foreign negotiating partner in Budvar's privatisation. However, agreement between the government and Anheuser-Busch has never been in sight. This is partly due to Czech sensitivities about one of its most famous brand names being swallowed by a large multinational, and partly to growing hostility within the country to foreign investment. Anheuser-Busch said that in spite of being given exclusive negotiating access, the government 'could not reach a consensus to follow through on this commitment' and that it had 'concluded that the privatisation process is stalled indefinitely in the Czech government'. The agriculture ministry, which owns Budvar, declined to comment on Anheuser-Busch's decision. However, it is understood that a decision on the brewer's future could be made within a month. While the government decides how Budvar should be privatised Anheuser-Busch and Budvar are to pursue negotiations on reaching a stand-alone trademark agreement. Mr Jiri Bucek, general-director of Budvar, said the moratorium on legal action, which expired on September 30, was no longer being accepted by many courts. 'It must be admitted that it is out of date,' he said. Budvar is keen to link with Anheuser-Busch to expand sales of its own Budweiser brand. Its main export markets are Germany and Austria, but it is seeking to expand into other European markets, particularly the UK. The company reported profits of Kcs133m (Dollars 4.8m) in the first half of this year. Anheuser-Busch said any new agreement reached 'would not be as comprehensive as the one offered to Budvar in combination with Anheuser-Busch's proposal for a minority investment in the brewery'.</p>

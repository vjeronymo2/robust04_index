			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / BOC profits show 30% fall under new accounting rules BOC, the UK industrial gases and healthcare group, yesterday warned that the three locomotive growth economies in the world had stalled. The US, German and Japanese economies were all slow or slowing, it said. Sales of BOC's gases are a sensitive barometer of industrial activity. Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said US demand had recovered only partially during the last 12 months. Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturing activity was now about 7 per cent lower than last year, the steepest decline since 1975. In the UK there had been further weakening of gas volumes during the fourth quarter. The group revealed pre-tax profits down 30.6 per cent from Pounds 310m to Pounds 215m for the year to September 30. The figures reflected the new accounting rules FRS 3 issued by the UK accounting standards board and a Pounds 117.1m adjustment for goodwill previously written off in businesses sold during the year. Earnings per share fell from 41.12p to 19.34p, although before the goodwill write-off they rose 7 per cent to 44.15p. Most of the adjustment related to Glasrock, a domestic medical gases subsidiary. An additional Pounds 25.4m exceptional item was allocated for restructuring the healthcare business. Without the new accounting treatment and after adjusting for exceptional items pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 341.9m, an increase of 6 per cent. Operating profits, as defined by FRS 3 before exceptional costs, asset disposals and goodwill adjustment was Pounds 410.9m compared with Pounds 400.3m on a comparable basis. Turnover was Pounds 2.73bn compared with Pounds 2.72bn, an increase of less than 1 per cent. Exchange-rate fluctuations had a small negative effect on results. Capital expenditure fell Pounds 32.5m to Pounds 394.3m in 1991, although research and development spending grew Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 81.2m, including Pounds 8m allocated to the Delta Biotechnology business. Gearing was 29 per cent, the lowest level since 1987. Interest paid was Pounds 69m against Pounds 79m. The annual dividend for 1993 was increased 5.5 per cent to 23.2p. The company is unusual in announcing its dividend in advance. Mr Rich said since inflation had fallen, BOC wanted to offer a real rate of return on its investment. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 22</p>

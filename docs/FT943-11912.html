			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / French PM casts more watchful eye on EU laws Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has told his ministers and diplomats that France should try to delay decisions on any European Union legislation until its national parliament has pronounced on it. Mr Balladur's initiative has come in the form of a recent circular to all French civil servants. It is a further sign of his determination to step up the defence of French interests in the EU - following gains by anti-Maastricht parties in last month's European parliament elections. According to French parliamentary officials, French ministers and diplomats in future will behave more like their UK counterparts in Brussels, rather than the Danes. UK representatives frequently 'reserve' their position in debates in the Council of Ministers pending 'scrutiny' of issues by the House of Commons. Danish ministers, however, are formally bound by their parliament in decisions on EU legislation. Nevertheless, Mr Balladur's circular of July 18 could delay decisions by the Council of Ministers. This would reverse the traditional French priority for speed and efficiency over democracy in EU law-making. The circular says ministers and officials must check whether the French parliament intends to pass a resolution on a draft EU law due for debate at EU Council meetings, and if so, France will try to get the item bounced off the Council agenda. Last month the French employment minster was criticised by French MPs for approving the EU directive on works councils before parliament had time to have its say. The French National Assembly is handicapped, as it is a part-time legislature, sitting only half the year, while the only month EU Council meetings are not held is August. But the Assembly has a 36-member EU affairs committee that sits more regularly. Mr Balladur has also decided to become the first French prime minister to chair the government's inter-ministerial committee on European issues. In addition, Mr Alain Lamassoure, his EU affairs minister, has instituted regular monthly meetings with France's 87 MEPs. They are now scattered among seven different groups at Strasbourg. Oblivious to the fact that these groups are created precisely to reflect MEPs' differing ideologies rather than nationalities, the government worries that fragmention of the country's Euro-representatives means 'France's voice' will not be properly heard at Strasbourg. In line, too, with his reversion to the old Gaullist dictum that European Commissioners are essentially technocrats to be kept under ministers' political control, Mr Balladur is contemplating nominating a senior official, Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, to the Brussels executive.</p>

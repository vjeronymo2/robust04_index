			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELWAY SICK, BUT ALL'S WELL FOR BRONCOS;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: KUBIAK STEPS IN AT QUARTERBACK AND LEADS DENVER TO A 14-10  VICTORY OVER THE REDSKINS AT WASHINGTON.  </P> <P> It was hyped as a rematch of Super Bowl XXII in which Washington defeated  Denver, 42-10, scoring 35 points in the second quarter.  </P> <P> But there was no John Elway or Doug Williams or Dexter Manley when the Redskins  met the Broncos on a blustery Monday night at RFK Stadium.  </P> <P> And there was little offense as the Broncos downed the Redskins, 14-10, behind  backup quarterback Gary Kubiak before 55,692 fans.  </P> <P> "This is as excited as I've been in a long time, because coming into the game  everything was against us," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said.  </P> <P> Elway was sick to his stomach. The Bronco quarterback came down with a stomach  virus before the game.  </P> <P> While Elway rested in the locker room, Kubiak passed for 123 yards and two  touchdowns. After the game, someone taped the words "Prime Time" on Kubiak's  stall in the locker room.  </P> <P> Kubiak didn't discover he was starting until late Monday.  </P> <P> "John came back from breakfast and said he wasn't feeling well, but I didn't  think anything of it," Kubiak said. "But about 2 o'clock he started throwing up  and I knew something was wrong. But I didn't find out I was going to start  until 5 o'clock."  </P> <P> Kubiak had thrown only two passes this season, and his first two attempts  Monday were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> After overthrowing a receiver on his first pass, Kubiak fumbled as he cocked  his arm to throw his second when he was hit by Fred Stokes, who was playing in  place of Manley. Stokes recovered Kubiak's fumble at the Denver eight.  </P> <P> The Redskins scored on the next play on Jamie Morris' run up the middle to give  Washington a 7-0 lead just 1:07 into the game.  </P> <P> Without Elway, the Bronco defense needed to make big plays to keep Denver in  the game, and safety Dennis Smith came up with two of them, forcing fumbles by  Morris to set up one Denver touchdown and prevent one by the Redskins.  </P> <P> "We lost Elway, but we didn't lose a step," Smith said. "That's what great  teams do. We couldn't make excuses because Elway didn't play."  </P> <P> Smith set up the Broncos' first touchdown when he stripped the ball from  Morris. Cornerback Tyrone Braxton recovered and returned it 35 yards to the  Redskin five.  </P> <P> After Bobby Humphrey gained four yards, Kubiak threw a one-yard touchdown pass  to Melvin Bratton to tie it, 7-7.  </P> <P> Kubiak engineered a brilliant 79-yard, 18-play drive, hitting Ricky Nattiel  with a five-yard touchdown pass with 9:27 remaining in the first half to give  Denver a 14-7 lead.  </P> <P> Kubiak's best plays after that were two quick kicks that pinned Washington deep  in its own end.  </P> <P> The Redskins had a chance to tie it, driving to the Denver 13 on the first  series of the second half, but Smith stripped Morris of the ball, and  linebacker Michael Brooks recovered to end the threat.  </P> <P> When the Broncos review the films, maybe Kubiak's two touchdown passes will  make them forget the one Kubiak threw into the arms of Redskin cornerback A.J.  Johnson to set up a 42-yard field goal by Chip Lohmiller with 6:57 remaining in  the third quarter.  </P> <P> Lohmiller's kick cut it to 14-10, but Washington didn't get close again.  </P> <P> Although the Broncos (9-2) have the best record in the AFC, Reeves complained  that they don't get any respect.  </P> <P> "We won't have any more respect after winning than when we had came into the  game," Reeves said. "But that's fine with me. I can understand it. We haven't  blown anyone away."  </P> <P> It was a turbulent week for the Redskins.  </P> <P> Manley, Washington's All-Pro defensive end, was banned for life from the NFL  after he tested positive for cocaine, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced  Saturday. Manley can petition for reinstatement after one year.  </P> <P> Markus Koch, a veteran reserve, started in place of Manley at right end but  limped off with a sprained knee in the third quarter. The Redskins used Stokes  on pass-rushing situations. Manley was the Redskins' all-time leader in sacks,  with 96 1/2 over the last nine seasons.  </P> <P> Koch wasn't the only reserve who moved into Washington's starting lineup.  </P> <P> Mark Rypien started in place of Williams at quarterback. Williams threw four  touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXII.  </P> <P> Rypien opened the season as the starter in place of Williams, who underwent  back surgery last August. Rypien was benched after he threw five interceptions  and was sacked five times in a 37-24 loss to the Raiders last month. He had  fumbled 11 times in 12 sacks.  </P> <P> Williams returned, leading the Redskins to a 1-1 mark before he reinjured his  back last week.  </P> <P> Enter Rypien to face the Broncos, who have the third best defense in the in the  AFC. Rypien got a standing ovation for not fumbling on his first carry, but he  didn't make anyone forget Williams.  </P></p>

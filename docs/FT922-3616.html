			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Nuclear case to go on TV NUCLEAR ELECTRIC plans to use a new commercial business channel, broadcast nationally by BBC transmitters, to promote its case for resuming nuclear power station construction after 1994. Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, part of the electricity supply industry that was not privatised, has booked a half-hour programme to be broadcast on July 29. The company will pay Pounds 40,000, apart from production costs, for the half hour of national airtime at 5.30am. The programme will be one of the first to be broadcast on The Business Channel - a joint venture between BMH Communications and the BBC - which will use BBC transmitters in the early hours of the morning. Scottish Power is to broadcast its annual meeting the day after Nuclear Electric. Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, yesterday signed with BMH to broadcast his company's annual meeting. At Nuclear Electric, Mr Collier and Mr Bob Hawley, the chief executive, will front the programme. The broadcast will include extracts from a press conference and a briefing for City analysts on the utility's annual results. Mr Collier will say in the meetings that Nuclear Electric has increased its efficiency by 30 per cent over the past two years. He will argue that it is time to consider building more nuclear power stations. 'Our greatest wish is to resume the construction programme,' Mr Collier said yesterday. Nuclear Electric will say that it will soon be 'fit enough' to begin expanding. Mr Collier believes his company has a good story to tell but until now has been considered in the City of London as 'the joker in the pack'.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Move to improve invoice settlement A FRESH attempt to give small companies a statutory right to interest when their customers fail to settle bills within 30 days was launched in the Commons yesterday by Mr Michael Bates (C Langbaurgh). He said it was estimated that small businesses - defined as those employing fewer than 20 people - were currently owed some Pounds 145bn in unpaid bills. Mr Bates was given leave to introduce a private member's bill providing for interest, similar to that normally awarded by the courts, to be paid when contractual debts were not settled within the 30-day period.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYCOTT OF 'PSYCHO' PUBLISHER DEBATED  </P> <P> Regarding the furor over Bret Easton Ellis' third novel: When mediocre prose no  longer draws readers, a desperate writer may resort to shock value. Such is the  case with Ellis, whose second book was a miserable failure.  </P> <P> What a pity he chose resorting to gross and mean-spirited material instead of  striving to be a better writer. And Ellis, in lazy and cowardly fashion, chose  an easy target -- women, who still provide disturbingly easy victims in  literature and life.  </P> <P> What confuses me is why the National Organization for Women plays into Ellis'  hands, particularly with the phone hot line allowing callers to hear excerpts  of this warped material. Objecting to Ellis' misogyny and boycotting his books  are fine. Giving him free publicity by making his brutality available to all  with just a phone call seems counterproductive.  </P> <P> You can't censor Bret Easton Ellis. So why not just ignore him? Don't buy his  book.  </P> <P> JENNY MEAD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

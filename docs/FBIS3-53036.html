			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar: </F> "Careful, Glass"]    [Text] Judging by the messages Yitzhaq Rabin has been  relaying to Washington in anticipation of the Clinton-al-Asad  summit, it is hard to tell what has him more worried: a summit  that ends in a deep rift between the United States and Syria  over the fate of the Middle East, or a joint statement by the  two leaders about an understanding on the establishment of  diplomatic relations between Syria and Israel in exchange for an  arrangement on the Golan.    Whatever the case may be, the Americans are under the  impression that Rabin is uptight about the Clinton-al-Asad  meeting, and they have been sparing no effort to put him at  ease. They agree with the notion that the prime minister cannot  afford to talk about a withdrawal on the Golan while conducting  tough negotiations about a withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza.    On the other hand, it is hard to envision a situation where  the Syrian president informs Clinton that for the sake of  normalization with the United States he is prepared to stomach  normalization with Israel, including the opening of borders and  embassies, and Clinton pleading with him to put off a decision  until Rabin and 'Arafat reach an agreement. In such an event,  Rabin and Clinton will have a problem. Rabin's problem will be  with the Jews in Israel who are still having a hard time  digesting the compromise in Jericho, while Clinton's will be  with the Jews in America who were removed from the political  agenda as a result of the Oslo agreement.    The very meeting with the U.S. President, who will be taking  time off from his discussions about security in Europe, is seen  by the Syrian president as quite a formidable achievement.  Clinton's aides recall that three former U.S. Presidents also  conferred with al-Asad, and that nothing could be more natural  than a meeting with yet another regional leader taking part in  the political process under U.S. orchestration.    This may very well be the way the Geneva summit appears from  the American point of view, but al-Asad experts are sure that he  will make it his business to depict the event in a totally  different light. Even before shaking hands with his young  counterpart and consoling him on the death of his mother,  al-Asad scored important points with the Arab world. He can  argue that all he had to do to obtain such prestigious publicity  was to do nothing; neither to excessively obstruct the PLO in  its negotiations with Israel, nor to demand that Arab leaders  punish 'Arafat for deviating from their agreement to coordinate  moves vis-a-vis Israel. He kept all options in his hands and  did not budge from his fundamental positions, such as the demand  for an Israeli withdrawal from all the territories. Ahmad  Jibril, the murderer of U.S. soldiers in Berlin, is still being  hosted in Damascus, and al-Asad makes no secret of his ties with  Hizballah.    Rabin, Jewish functionaries, and U.S. officials fear that  the  U.S. President -- who is eager for foreign policy achievements  -- will be tempted to buy glass beads from al-Asad and hug him  as if they were diamonds. Al-Asad recently reminded us that the  Americans are prepared to be grateful even for second-hand  beads. Three times he promised to let go of the Jewish hostages  in Damascus and Aleppo, and there are signs that he will sell  them a fourth time, this time directly to the U.S. President.  Clinton will then rush to talk about it in front of the U.S.  television cameras which have a short memory.    The experts, led by Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, an Arabist  and head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, are  telling Rabin that the shrewd Syrian president will not let such  a rare opportunity slip through his fingers next Sunday [16  January]. The meeting with George Bush in the midst of the Gulf  war and Syria's participation in the Madrid conference were  prerequisites for the improvement of its relations with the  West, but two years later these moves are deemed insufficient.  As the Americans see it, he has not done enough when it comes  to relations with Israel on the one hand, and with regard to  Iran, North Korea, and terror on the other. If he concludes  that he cannot "string along" Clinton, al-Asad may deliver the  goods that will help the U.S. President justify the meeting and  pave the way for more tangible changes in the future. Rabin is  now trying to up the ante with regard to the public  manifestation of the change in Syria's position and to make sure  that al-Asad does not profit from the weaknesses of his U.S.  interlocutor.    The prime minister should hope that Clinton arrives at the  meeting with the Syrian president in high spirits, carrying  positive press clippings about his talks with Boris Yeltsin,  Leonid Kravchuk, Lech Walesa, and his NATO partners. Success in  Europe will reduce the danger of Clinton searching for -- and  finding -- consolation with al-Asad for his frustration in  failing to encourage reforms in Russia, to cite just one  example. The more the summit is depicted as a great  achievement, the more the pressure will increase on Israel to  pay its share for success on the Syrian track, despite the  difficulties on the Palestinian track and at home. If it is  real, this achievement could be used to improve positions versus  the PLO and the Likud.</p>

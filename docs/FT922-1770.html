			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nestle bid probe leaves Perrier 'paralysed' SOURCE PERRIER, the French maker of bubbly mineral water, yesterday said it was in 'paralysis' awaiting the results of the European Commission's inquiry into the FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.9bn) bid from Nestle, the Swiss food multinational. Mr Jacques Vincent, Perrier's chairman, told a shareholders' meeting: 'It is clear that we are in a vacuum that is dangerous for everyone, including Nestle.' Earlier this month, the Swiss group revealed that the Commission had serious doubts that the bid might create a duopoly of Nestle and BSN on the French mineral water market. It is contesting this preliminary finding. 'Currently, we are living in a kind of paralysis,' said Mr Vincent. The Nestle bid was suspended in March, awaiting the Commission's ruling, expected late next month or early August. Perrier's turnover rose 5 per cent to FFr3.13bn in the first quarter of this year, reflecting poor mineral water sales in Britain and the US, but growth in the rest of the world. Sales of the Perrier brand in the US and Britain are running at 53 per cent of the level three years ago, just before the group withdrew its world stocks following the discovery of benzene contamination. Mr Vincent said the US and UK mineral water markets remain very gloomy. 'We don't see any recovery ahead but the situation is not truly catastrophic,' he said. Mineral water sales in France are running at 10 per cent above last year's levels. Outside France, the US and the UK, mineral water sales are up 25 per cent this year. First-quarter mineral water sales were virtually static in France at FFr1bn but fell 2 per cent outside France to FFr989m. Cheese sales fell 6 per cent in France to FFr260m but surged 17.5 per cent outside France to FFr609m.</p>

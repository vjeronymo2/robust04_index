			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900): "The First Two </F> Months of the New Tax System"]    [Text] Beginning on 1 January 1994, China has fully  reformed our industrial-commercial [business] tax system, with  the new substance being mostly the flow and income tax systems.  As the new tax system has now been in effect for nearly two  months, all areas are reporting that it has successfully entered  a state of normal operation, having made a basically smooth  transition.    Since the NPC Standing Committee approved the new individual  income tax law on 30 October 1993, the State Council has  published interim regulations on the six taxes of value added,  consumption [excise], business, enterprise income, land value  added, and resource. By now, except for the detailed  implementation rules and regulations for the land value added  tax, the application regulations and detailed application rules  and regulations on the other of the six tax categories have been  published and put into effect. Most recently, the State Council  has issued another circular, deciding to abolish the rural  market transaction, livestock transaction, cooking oil special,  bonus, and wage reconciliation taxes, and to devolve authority  to lower administrative levels for the animal-slaughtering and  banquet taxes, showing that the major substance of China's  overall tax-reform plans, particularly the reform measures on  key tax categories, is in full effect. Revenue reform is the  focus of China's current overall related reforms, with tax  reform being the "priority focus" of revenue reform. This smooth  implementation of the new tax system is providing solid grounds  for the accelerated establishment of China's socialist market  economy.    As this tax reform is comprehensive, overall, and structural  reform, involving an adjustment of the interests of every  enterprise and individual, it is harder, more full of conflict,  and subject to great risk if not done well. The Party Central  Committee and State Council have paid great attention to this  tax reform, with the State Council leadership personally guiding  the work and repeatedly providing key instructions. To ensure  the smooth implementation of this tax reform, tax department  cadres and employees at all levels have done much work.  Beginning in October 1993, tax organs at all levels have  conducted training work in many forms for the large numbers of  tax cadres and enterprise factory directors, managers,  accountants, taxhandlers, and even sales and purchasing agents,  ensuring that the majority of tax cadres and enterprises  recognized the importance of this tax reform, so that they could  basically grasp its key substance and operating essentials.    In addition to the great attention paid to this tax reform  by  the Party Central Committee and State Council, it has also  received much attention and support from the leadership in all  areas and sectors. Many key leaders of provinces, cities,  autonomous regions, and sectors gave speeches publicizing the  new tax system and asking their subordinates to cooperate in its  implementation. At the "National Tax Publicity Day" activities  organized by the State Administration of Taxation [SAT] for 23  January, hundreds of thousands of tax cadres and enterprise  accountants took to the streets under the guidance of the local  Party and Government leadership, publicizing the tax laws and  seeking public advice. Meanwhile, in order to implement well  the new tax system and promptly resolve all issues, the SAT  intensified its command and control. During the nearly two  months since the beginning of the year, the SAT sent out over 60  documents and faxes of all types, as well as holding two  national telephone conferences for tax bureau directors above  the county level, conveying the pertinent spirit and demands  directly to grass-roots tax bureaus, thus ensuring national  accessibility to government decrees.    Tax-reform success will be shown by several very important  signs: whether it touches off price volatility and sharp rises;  whether it brings stable growth or decline to revenues; whether  it causes much disorder through the counterfeiting of  value-added-tax special invoices and the exploitation of  filled-in invoices to evade taxes; whether its impact on  production is positive or negative.    --As to its implementation in the last two months, the most  concerning price problem is not sharp price volatility or rises  due to tax reform. While the consumption tax was misunderstood  by some for a time as an additional tax added onto prevailing  commodity prices, thus causing brisk sales of commodities, such  as home electronics, publicity and explanation brought this  disturbance to a very quick end. And after the value-added tax  went into effect, while some misunderstood the 17-percent  non-price tax as an additional 17 percent on top of the original  tax-inclusive price, repeated explanations and additional joint  checkups with concerned sectors by tax organs essentially  cleared up and rectified this matter.    --Revenues remain in a high-growth trend. By 20 February,  national business-tax revenues had reached 40.7 billion yuan, up  27.3 percent from the same period in 1993.    --The implementation of the new tax system has not generally  had a negative impact on production and circulation, with  industrial production remaining in a state of rapid growth.  Data from the State Statistical Bureau for January show our  national industrial output value at the township level and above  at 290.3 billion yuan, up 33.2 percent from the same period in  1993. While the widespread implementation of the value-added  tax caused certain problems for a time for small-scale taxpayers  and production operations, the tax sector took very quick and  effective steps to improve this situation, solving the problems.    --The value-added-tax special invoices were all distributed  before 1 January, with no major problems in any links, such as  printing, delivery, sales, or use. Moreover, we made  improvements in light of realities in areas such as  invoice-column design, invoice size, and anti-counterfeit  markings and, according to enterprise request, added a  seven-link style to the four-link style invoices. The SAT has  also decided beginning on 1 May 1994 to use on a nationwide  basis anti-counterfeit invoices printed uniformly by printing  plants, to prevent counterfeit invoices.    It could be said that all public circles and most  enterprises  have responded well to the implementation of the new tax system.  Foreign firms with investments in China do not have added tax  burdens due to the the new tax system, which has cleared up  their misgivings about it.    But it also needs noted that the new tax system has been in  operation for less than two months, and that certain frictions  will also unavoidably exist in the course of dovetailing the new  and old tax systems. So SAT Deputy Director Jin Xin [6855  9515] [former SAT director] told reporters the other day that  the current results are merely initial, not yet enough to state  that the implementation of the new tax system has been a  complete success. As many new problems and conditions have not  yet fully surfaced, we need to keep cool heads to promptly study  and deal with all problems as they arise.    It should be emphasized that China's current tax reform is  aimed at establishing a tax system suited to the needs of our  socialist market economy, or one that conforms to both  international practice and China's national conditions. Our  reform guiding ideology is uniform taxation, fair tax burdens, a  streamlined tax system, a rational division of powers, orderly  distribution relations, and a standardized distribution form.  While our reform plan was designed to adhere to the basic  principle of maintaining the overall tax burden unchanged, the  former tax-burden inequality means that the widespread  implementation of the value-added tax will make it impossible  for every taxpayer's vested interests to not be affected. This  means that all will have to take the overall situation into  account, by proceeding from overall and long-range interests to  support the implementation of the new tax system, instead of  driving prices up because the tax burdens of certain enterprises  are somewhat heavier. It needs to be seen that as tax reform is  the grounds for our establishment of a socialist market economy,  so that the implementation of the tax reform and the achievement  of its anticipated results will sharply speed up the pace of our  establishment of a socialist market economy, a long-range view  is of advantage to all.</p>

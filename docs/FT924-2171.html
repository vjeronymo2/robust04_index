			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (4): High point in a hard year - The futures market gets under way DESPITE being the largest bond market in Europe, the Italian market has been rather slow to develop more sophisticated financial instruments based on bonds. So the development of a domestic futures market counts as a high point in what has otherwise proved a difficult year for the Italian bond market. Mif, the Mercato Italiano Futures (Mif), was launched in September, at a time when the bond market was particularly volatile and trading volume unusually high. Mif added a 10-year bond futures contract to the existing Telematico screen-based system, which is used for government bond trading. The new market succeeded in attracting a fresh domestic investor base, which had not previously traded futures. In addition, Mif won some business from the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). Liffe launched its highly successful 10-year Italian government bond contract in September 1991, and saw off a rival contract launched by the Matif, the Paris-based exchange. The contract helped bring more sophisticated investors, including arbitrage players, into the Italian market. In June, the Liffe contract traded an impressive average daily volume of 29,000 contracts in June. Since the launch of Mif, Liffe's market share has fallen to 60 per cent, currently around 9,000 contracts a day, following a decline in volume due to the market's fall from favour. The Italian market is unusual in supporting two actively-traded competing contracts, both actively traded: the other notable example is that of the rival Bund contracts traded by Liffe and the German exchange, the Deutsche Terminborse, with about the same market split. 'It is very likely that the Liffe and Mif contracts will co-exist,' believes Mr Eugenio Namor, head of futures broking at San Paolo in London, since they still serve rather different investor bases. The introduction of the two bond futures contracts has made the market both easier to trade and more attractive to a broad range of investors. The futures market proved its value during the crisis month of September. When the cash market had totally dried up, so that investors were unable to get prices or sell bonds, the futures market continued to trade. Mif is currently preparing a new bond contract, based on five-year bonds, which is scheduled for launch on December 18. Some dealers believe the new contract will help attract more international business to the Italian exchange. 'Most international players have stuck with Liffe, because they are more familiar with it,' says one Italian trader familiar with both markets. 'But the five-year contract will give investors the chance to play the yield curve.' The contract will also be of use provide a vital new hedging instruments for swap traders. Mif is also planning to develop a three-month interest rate future, similar to that traded on Liffe. The introduction of the five-year bond contract could also have an effect on the shape of the Italian yield curve. Currently, the yield curve is flat. However, Mr Steve Major, a bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities, believes that the flatness of the yield curve has been exaggerated by the concentration of activity in the 10-year area, because it is easier to hedge through existing contracts. He argues that the longer end of the yield curve should be more upward sloping, reflecting uncertainty on such issues as the budget deficit. The availability of a hedging instrument for five-year bonds could shift activity from 10-year to five-year paper, causing 10-year yields to rise. Some traders believe that there is currently a liquidity premium on offer in five-year yields, which could disappear once the five-year area is more actively traded.</p>

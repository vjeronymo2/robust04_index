			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Sport: Denver detour - FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world trip. With five weeks to go, they are in North America. There is another Colorado. Off the beaten track, far away from the glitz of Aspen, the might of Vail and the great Ski the Summit circus of Breckenridge, Keystone and Copper Mountain, are the folksy old ski hills of which few British skiers have ever heard. 'Most skiers leaving Denver have tunnel vision,' says Rob Linde at Eldora, the nearest of the 'front range' resorts to the mile-high city. 'They put their foot down on Interstate 70 and head for the Eisenhower Tunnel and the famous resorts on the other side,' he explained. It takes a little imagination, perhaps, to turn off and explore resorts such as Eldora, Loveland and Winter Park which do not have the international clout of Aspen, Vail or Summit County but attract local skiers from Denver. The road to Eldora takes you into another world - through Pickle Gulch and Gold Dust Village into the old gold-mining territory of Black Hawk and Central City. They still pan for gold here - Vic's Panning shack is one of many still operating. And if anyone hits pay-dirt, the casinos - Rich Man, Gold Mine and Bronco Billy's - or Prospectors Poker Parlor and the Silver Hawk Saloon are handily placed to ensure the spoils are quickly ploughed back into the local community. Apart from some good, steep skiing in Moose Glades and Jolly Jug Glades, and some tough runs such as Ambush and Psychopath, Eldora is most famous for being kind to snails. It has won friends by helping in a study of the rare Rocky Mountain capshell variety, claimed to be among the oldest living creatures on earth. After sending in teams of divers to investigate, the resort started limiting the amount of water taken from Peterson Lake for snow-making in case its demands were reducing the snail population. Winter Park is kind to local pond-life too: the trout population has been protected by building a culvert over a stream which crosses the slopes. Owned by Denver, Winter Park supplies much of the city's recreational needs in winter and summer. With 113 trails and a vertical drop of more than 3,000ft it is one of the largest ski areas in the US but has little international traffic. It is also just about the only significant ski area left in the west still served by a ski train. The Rio Grande train leaves Denver's Union Station each Saturday and Sunday at 1.30am for the spectacular 70-mile journey meandering through rocky gorges and almost 40 tunnels to the ski area, leaving again at 4pm sharp. Loveland claims more terrain than Aspen Mountain, a higher base than Steamboat's summit and more snow than almost any other Colorado resort, yet most skiers roar past it on their way to Summit County and Vail.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The region continues to remain on standby as it  awaits word from Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford, of Barbados,  as to what he proposes to do. A motion of no-confidence was  passed in Parliament last week against the Barbadian leader, the  first of its kind in the Caribbean, the humiliating 14-12 vote,  including that of his ministers from his very own cabinet.    It was widely speculated that Prime Minister Sandiford would  have resigned following this defeat, but the leader, reputed for  taking his time when it comes to decisionmaking, has, to date,  not indicated what he intends to do. Sandiford is reported to  have attacked his opponents and the resolution last week by  stating, quote, I will use the last ounce of breath that I have  in my body to deal with that question of the resolution that has  no basis and no validity in terms of being able to stand up to a  truthful record of the situation as far as it relates to me, as  prime minister and as head of the government. I will not rest  until this is done, end of quote.    Sandiford described the outcome of the vote as a miscarriage  of justice in the political arena, where, he says, an attempt  could be made to hang, draw, and quarter him on the basis of the  resolution that, itself, is riddled with lies and untruths.</p>

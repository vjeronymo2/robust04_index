			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LIBYA;  </P> <P> KADAFI WARNS EAST BLOC ON DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> Leader Moammar Kadafi said capitalism and Western-style democracy could ravage  reformist Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> He told a news conference in Tripoli that if Eastern Europe adopts a "Western  European system with its multi-parties and capitalism, I warn you of  unemployment and beggars, of inflation, crises and, in the end, war." In a  surprise departure, the rabidly anti-Israeli Kadafi accused the West of  plotting to rid the world of Jews by placing them in "Palestine, the tomb of  Jews, the mass oven for Jews." The Jews, he conceded, "are oppressed in the  world," adding that Libya "would welcome them back."  </P></p>

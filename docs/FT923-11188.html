			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Halt is called in Ecu bond market THE MARKET in Ecu bonds, one of Europe's fastest-growing financial markets, virtually seized up yesterday as the latest victim of the stresses within the exchange rate mechanism, Richard Waters writes. An official halt was called as banks that deal in the market were excused the obligation to quote buy and sell bond prices to each other. The Bank of England and the French Treasury, both of which have raised substantial sums by issuing Ecu bonds, called meetings with marketmakers to try to restore some confidence. The suspension of normal trading demonstrates how little confidence financial markets now have that European economic and monetary union will be achieved. There has been heavy selling of Ecu bonds since the Danes voted to reject the Maastricht treaty with selling intensifying after Germany raised its discount rate a week ago. ISMA, the body which oversees the international bond markets, said it believed marketmaking would resume on Monday. Dealers reported that investors were still able to deal with marketmakers yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan's semiconductor  industry will take a vital step forward when the  government-financed integrated-circuit development project,  after four years of research, transfers its sophisticated  technology to a spinoff company in October.    The project, which has cost the government NT [new Taiwan]  $6  billion (US$222.22 million) since it started four years ago, has  successfully developed the technology used in the manufacture of  16- megabyte dynamic random-access memory chips and  four-megabyte static random-access memory chips.    "Transferring the hard-won technology to a private company  would be the best approach to get back the research funds," an  official with the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said.    According to the proposal presented by the IDB, the  state-of-the-art technology, together with an experimental  integrated-circuit factory in the Hsinchu Science-Based  Industrial Park, will be transferred to a new privately run  company, in which the government will have a 49 percent stake.    Local enterprises are welcome to bid to take the remaining  51  percent stake in the company, the IDB official said, adding that  prospective investors are required to submit their bids before  June 30.    All the bidders will be judged by not only bidding prices  but  their management and marketing plans, as well as their financial  status, according to the official.    The evaluation will be completed in early September. A  joint-venture agreement will be signed within a month after the  winning bid is made public on Sept. 8.</p>

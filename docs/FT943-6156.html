			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Mr Tiny Rowland will have his work cut out to justify the Pounds 5.5m-plus he costs Lonrho each year in salary, expenses and other costs under his direct control. The issue is not so much that the Lonrho joint chief executive's Pounds 1.2m pay-packet is excessive. It is rather that his expense account for items such as up-keep of his two homes and the company's private jet looks high in relation to group's pre-tax profits of Pounds 172m last year. One could still defend the costs if they provided value for money. Mr Rowland must, for example, entertain his business contacts and jet around the world visiting Lonrho's far-flung trading operations. But this line of defence would be easier to hold if Lonrho's financial performance was good. In fact, the shares have been a poor investment since the late 1980s. Mr Dieter Bock, the other Lonrho chief executive, seems intent on using the issue to wrest full executive control of the group from Mr Rowland. While many question Mr Bock's ability to squeeze more profit out of Lonrho's operations, his plans to 'normalise' the group's relations with the City have been welcomed by most shareholders. This should give him the edge if, as expected, directors at Thursday's board meeting are asked to choose which of two warring chief executives to back.</p>

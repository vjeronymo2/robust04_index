			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: A source of future conflict on the Nile - Worldwide water / Growing need could lead to war IN 1978, the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt warned that if anyone, at any moment, thought to deprive Egypt of its 'life' the country would not hesitate to go to war. He was referring to the Nile, the world's longest waterway, which provides Egypt with more than 90 per cent of its water requirements. The country is now using every last drop of water available to it and the prophecies of war still loom. Only recently, Boutros Boutros Ghali, former foreign minister of Egypt and now secretary general to the United Nations, said the next war in the Middle East would not be over politics, but over the waters of the Nile. 'In the next few years the demographic explosion in Egypt, in Kenya and in Uganda will lead to all those countries using more water; unless we can agree on the management of water resources we may have international or inter-African disputes,' he said. The one existing treaty on the allocation of Nile waters - the Nile Waters Agreement - was signed in 1959 and binds only Egypt and Sudan. According to engineers in the region, both countries stick to its stipulations which allocate 55.5bn cubic metres of water to Egypt a year and 18.5bn cubic metres to Sudan, although Egypt regularly borrows water from Sudan. The official allocation is based on estimations of a mean annual discharge of 84bn cubic metres, with about 10bn reckoned to be lost in evaporation and seepage from Lake Nasser, behind the Aswan dam in Upper Egypt. Ironically, internal conflicts in Sudan, Uganda and Ethiopia have probably done more to forestall inter-state conflicts over the Nile waters than the NWA. Peter Moszynski of Africa Confidential, the respected African newsletter, says that 'political settlements in these countries are likely to lead to much increased demands on the basin's water, especially in Ethiopia, and without a general regional agreement on water usage, conflict is almost certain to increase'. Understanding the source of potential conflicts in the Nile basin requires a look at the route of the waterway. The Blue Nile, which flows from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian highlands, contributes, together with other tributaries, about three-quarters of the main Nile flow. The rest of the water comes from the White Nile which flows through Uganda and southern Sudan. Civil war in Ethiopia means that extensive irrigation and hydro-power generation plans, which could involve damning the Blue Nile, have gone back to the drawing board. Such plans require vast quantities of water and, if implemented, could threaten Egypt's well-being. Exacerbating tensions is the steady increase in the populations of the Nile basin states. The combined populations of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan alone are expected to be about 170m by the end of the century. This will necessitate increased food production and agricultural expansion, which in turn will require more water. But in Egypt the needs of the growing population are already damaging water quality. A plan to increase the output of the Nile has been on hold for almost 10 years, also as a result of civil war, this time in Sudan. Completion of the Jonglei Canal, designed to drain the Sudd swamps of southern Sudan, has been prevented by political instability. The project, while angering conservationists, would have lowered the large amount of water lost through evaporation, opened up the area for agriculture and released more water for irrigation in northern Sudan and Egypt. There is no hope of the project being completed until after a settlement between the north and south of Sudan. At the same time, Moszynski points out that settlement of the war will invariably lead to greater demand for water in Sudan, particularly if the south separates from the north, another source of concern for downstream areas. Meanwhile, a shortage of water in Egypt would intensify the environmental problems the country faces as a result of the frequency with which the existing water supply, particularly groundwater, is reused. John Hennessey, president-elect of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, says the sustainability of recycling irrigation through the aquifer is questionable. 'Water that gets into the ground has been through the irrigation system so it is laced with fertilisers and nitrates. There is very little rainfall which would normally have a cleansing effect on the aquifer,' he says. The sensitivity of water supply in the Nile basin is not an issue that is going to go away. Only last week it was reported that Sudan was threatening to eject Egypt's water management team, based in Sudan to check on the flow of the Nile waters. Talk of war may, for the moment, be far-fetched, but as long as the populations of the Nile basin keep growing, the present accords governing the allocation of the Nile waters may not be sufficient to keep the peace.</p>

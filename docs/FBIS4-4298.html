			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial </F> CPC Committee, delivered at the ninth plenary session of the  provincial discipline inspection commission on 7 April]    [Text] Comrades:    This plenary session of the provincial discipline inspection  commission is a very important session. At this session, we  have relayed and studied Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at  the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission and the guidelines of the third plenary session,  summarized Liaoning's previous anticorruption work, exchanged  experiences, and studied and arranged the work tasks of the next  step of the anticorruption work. Comrade Shangwen has given a  report, and the opinions he spoke on had been approved by the  standing committee of the provincial party committee after  discussions. It is hoped that all localities and departments  will conscientiously implement them in line with their actual  conditions. I will speak on three issues in the following.    1. We should enhance the understanding of the importance and  urgency of the anticorruption work in the new situation.    Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the third plenary  session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission used the  Marxist viewpoint and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to expound the importance  and urgency of the anticorruption work and the dialectical  relationship between reform, development, and stability from the  perspective of adherence to the party's basic line and the  purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. He also  emphasized: "Waging the anticorruption struggle, in the final  analysis, is meant to consolidate and strengthen the party's  ties with the masses in the new situation, to consolidate our  party's status as a ruling party, and to enable the party to  better hold the heavy historical task to lead reform, opening  up, and socialist modernization drive. The relationship between  the party and the masses is a basic political issue concerning  the success and failure of the party's cause. We should  emphasize this repeatedly and sound the alarm for a long time,  and comrades of the entire party should attach great importance  to it." His remarks profoundly told us that the key to whether  the anticorruption work can be carried out thoroughly,  persistently, and more effectively and yield good results at  different stages lies in unifying the thinking of the entire  party, especially the thinking of leading cadres. In line with  the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the  third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, the arrangements made at this third plenary session,  and the specific conditions of Liaoning, all cadres with party  membership, especially leading cadres, should particularly  address the following three issues on the understanding of the  anticorruption work.    A. The previous anticorruption work should be estimated in a  realistic manner. To implement well Comrade Jiang Zemin's  speech given at the third plenary session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission and the guidelines of the  session and to make this year's anticorruption work successful,  we should first correctly estimate the previous anticorruption  work. The provincial party committee recently held a standing  committee meeting to hear and conscientiously discuss the  provincial discipline inspection commission's report. The  provincial party committee held that since August last year,  party committees, governments, and discipline inspection,  supervision, and judicial departments at all levels in the  province had conscientiously followed the arrangements of the  party Central Committee and the provincial party committee to  actively carry out the anticorruption work, with the focus on  reform and economic construction; and that thanks to the  concerted efforts of all fields, the desired purpose was  basically attained, good results were achieved at varying  degrees in the three tasks that should be emphasized as required  by the party Central Committee, corrupt phenomena in some  aspects were checked, and more prominent achievements were won  by the localities and departments which had done a better job.  Through practice, we have achieved a more profound  understanding of the guidelines of the party Central Committee's  instructions on opposing corruption and explored and accumulated  some good experiences and methods. However, this is only a good  beginning, and we must never overestimate it.    We should recognize that there are still many disparities  and problems in the current anticorruption work. The principal  ones were: The work in various localities and departments was  not evenly developed, and some localities and departments failed  to fully grasp this work although they had conscientiously  relayed the guidelines and devised plans in a timely manner.  Leading cadres failed to deeply conduct self investigation to  see whether they were honest and self-disciplined and to make  self corrections, and some situations discovered during self  investigation were not in conformity with the actually existing  problems; some problems had been touched once but not been  realistically solved; and some problems discovered during self  investigation had not been corrected. We lacked strength in  investigating and handling major and appalling cases, and the  progress in this work was not rapid. Some localities and units  had the serious problem of practicing protectionism, failed to  report a case to the security authorities and to file a case for  investigation which they should do, and failed to strictly  handle the cases. Some failed to achieve noticeable results in  checking unhealthy trends, and the masses of people were not  pleased with this. Some leading cadres failed to fully  understand anticorruption work and failed to actively carry out  this work on their own initiative. Judging from the situation  of the whole province, the progress of the previous stage of  anticorruption work still lagged far behind the demands of the  party Central Committee and the masses of people, and the  achievements gained were not consolidated. If we slightly  slacken our efforts in this aspect, some problems will possibly  "come back." These are the problems which the broad masses of  people are mostly worrying about and the party committees and  governments at all levels must resolutely check. Therefore, in  addition to affirming the previous stage of achievements in a  fact-seeking manner, we should also recognize the existing  problems, sum up experience, enhance understanding of the  protractedness, complexity, and arduousness of anticorruption,  firmly cultivate the idea of grasping this work unswervingly,  and carry out anticorruption struggle in a deep, sustained, and  more effective manner.    B. We should correctly understand and handle the  relationship  between, reform, development, stability and anticorruption.  This is a crucial year for comprehensively implementing the  decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  committee, an important year for China to enter the stage of  carrying out comprehensive supporting package reform of the  national economic structure with breakthroughs in key areas, and  a year facing many heavy tasks and severe tests in  anticorruption. Therefore, party committees and governments at  all levels should proceed from the overall situation of the  whole party's work, correctly understand and properly handle the  relationship between reform, development, and stability and  anticorruption, and in addition to exerting efforts to deepen  reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain  stability, act in line with the unified plans of the central  authorities, and conscientiously attend to anticorruption work.  Only by persisting in reform and development can we realize a  long-term social stability. And if we carry out reform and  development, we must have a stable social environment. Social  instability will make us unable to smoothly conduct reform and  development and to successfully carry out all other  undertakings. Reform, development, and stability constitute the  overall situation of the whole party's work, and anticorruption  is an important guarantee for reform, development, and  stability. We should carry out anticorruption work in close  connection with the overall situation of the whole party's work,  consciously submit ourselves to and serve this overall  situation. Judging from the problems exposed in our province's  anticorruption struggle, corrupt phenomena have infiltrated into  all social sectors, and particularly, they have seriously  corroded our party and government organs as well as the ranks of  cadres. Last year, the discipline inspection and supervision  organs across the province filed and handled 7,444 cases on law  and discipline violations and punished 5,527 party-member  cadres. Of these cases, 3,504 were filed for investigation and  handling during four months from September to December, and 40  percent of which were cases on law and discipline violations in  the economic sector, and 175 cases involved cadres at and above  the county (section) level. Procuratorial organs across the  province filed 2,299 economic criminal cases for investigation  last year, 1,452 cases of which each involved more than 10,000  yuan, and 193 cases each involved more than 100,000 yuan, and  these cases involved 77 cadres at and above the county (section)  level.    The large number of criminals who abused power to practice  graft and pervert justice for bribes, the large sum of money  involved, and the mean tricks adopted were shocking and directly  undermined reform, opening up, and economic construction. Some  unhealthy trends characterized by abuse of power for selfish  gains and extortion of money, especially those in some  departments and trades, seriously infringed on the interests of  the masses and aroused strong dissatisfaction among them.  Therefore, we should be determined to eliminate the corrupt  phenomena, punish corrupt elements, and correct the unhealthy  trends. Otherwise, we will dampen the masses' enthusiasm and  lose their support, and stability, reform, and development will  be affected.    This year marks the largest number of reform measures to be  implemented, and the quality, range, and dynamics of reform will  also be unprecedented. The process to deepen reform will also  be the process to adjust the relationship between the state, the  local authorities, enterprises, and laborers in terms of power,  responsibility, and profits. It will unavoidably involve the  interests of many fields and may create social fluctuation at  varying degrees. Because the extension of reform has been  expanded but the formulation of the standards of activities  falls behind, law and discipline breaches committed by taking  advantage of the loopholes in laws, regulations, policies, and  systems may increase. The depth of reform and the wide range of  the adjustment of interests have instilled vigor to social life  and provided favorable conditions for enterprises to compete on  an equal footing. However, they will also create new  contradictions and some sensitive, complicated, and  destabilizing factors. Under such circumstances, it remains a  serious task and test we should not dodge to not only add  impetus to reform and promote development and stability but also  keep the momentum of the anticorruption work going and make the  work more effective. Some state-owned enterprises in Liaoning  are suffering serious deficits and have failed to pay wages to  their workers for a long time. The retired personnel in some  localities also experience many difficulties in their life. In  rural areas, some people still do not have sufficient food and  clothes. Problems in public security are also very conspicuous.  All these problems merit our great attention. Party committees  and governments at all levels, especially principal leading  cadres, must learn to take the overall situation into account;  proceed from the general task of safeguarding reform,  development, and stability to achieve success in opposing  corruption and advocating honesty; comprehensively and correctly  analyze the situation from the perspective of strengthening the  party's flesh-and-blood relations with the masses, consolidating  the political power, and maintaining the lasting order and  stability of the state; and properly address the conspicuous  contradictions cropping up in the process of advancement.  Leaders should go to the places where problems are conspicuous  to resolve the contradictions in a timely manner, safeguard  social stability, and create a good environment for reform and  development.    C. The principle of attaching equal importance to two tasks  should be adhered to. Attaching equal importance to the two  civilizations is Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea and an  important component of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. As early as the initial period of  reform and opening up, Comrade Xiaoping raised the issue of  attaching equal importance to two tasks, one being reform and  opening up, and the other being crackdown on economic crimes.  Later, Comrade Xiaoping again repeatedly emphasized, from  different angles, the need to attach equal importance to the two  tasks and called for "competence in both." He also emphasized  that "we should oppose corruption in the entire process of  reform and opening up." As has been proven in practice, his  theses are totally correct.    The leading collective of the party Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as its nucleus has unswervingly implemented  the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that  both hands are tough," successfully made several important  decisions, adopted a series of major measures, and pushed  forward the work of opposing corruption and advocating  administrative honesty. In his speech at the recent third  plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission,  Comrade Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out again that in  waging the struggle against corruption, the party committees and  governments at various levels should firmly grasp the center of  the economic construction, persist in the principle of taking a  two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough, and  make overall plans and take all factors into consideration. So,  at the time of grasping the economic construction, we are  required to attend to the work of opposing corruption. At  present, some of our comrades do not accurately understand the  importance of anticorruption. Some of them maintain that the  corrupt phenomena are brought about by reform and opening up and  these phenomena are unavoidable. Some maintain that so long as  the economy is developed will the corrupt phenomena naturally be  eliminated. These ideas are wrong. The purpose of reform is to  liberate and develop productive forces and to promote the  economy. Some corrupt phenomena actually emerge due to the facts  that the legal system is not perfect in the course of replacing  the old systems by the new and that some people are affected by  the capitalist corrosive ideas in the course of conducting  reform and opening to the outside world. By no means are the  corrupt phenomena brought about by reform and opening up. But,  these phenomena are caused by the failure to thoroughly or  deeply conduct reform. On the one hand, we should unswervingly  wage the struggle against these phenomena, end their development  trends, and reduce them in a step-by-step manner; on the other  hand, we should deepen reform and perfect the legal system to  fundamentally wipe out the soils and conditions which create  corrupt phenomena. Each and every party member and each and  every cadre should clearly understand that developing the market  economy does not mean giving up socialism, advocating the  coexistence of various sectors of the economy does not mean  giving up the public ownership, and we must persistently attend  to both spiritual and material civilizations to promote the  development of the socialist market economy. On no account do  the corrupt phenomena naturally disappear when the economy is  developed. When the corrupt phenomena spread unchecked, it will  be difficult to promote the economic construction. The economic  construction, even though promoted, is temporarily promoted and  will finally fall. Many facts prove that negative and corrupt  phenomena are major reasons for affecting reform, opening up,  and economic construction. The more profoundly the reform is  carried out and the better developed the economy is, the more we  should resolutely oppose corruption.    The tasks for reform and development in 1994 are very heavy.  The party and government organs and the leading cadres at  various levels should concentrate more energy on grasping the  implementation of major reform measures. That is, we should  continue to enliven state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises, take the increase in economic results as a key  link, deepen reform, accelerate the pace of transformation,  speed up the pace of readjustment, intensify management, and lay  a good foundation for setting up a modern enterprise system.  Simultaneously, we should continue to intensify agriculture's  role as the foundation of the national economy and further  rejuvenate the rural economy. Simultaneously, we should  vigorously cultivate new economic growth points. Under such  circumstances, we should further persist in the principle of  "grasping with two hands" and "play the piano well." We must  never slacken the anticorruption work just because the tasks for  reform and development are heavy. Due to the fact that our  province was deeply affected by the highly centralized planned  economy, our ideology, management systems, and rules and  regulations have many things that are not suitable to the  requirements for setting up the socialist market economic  system. We must exert great efforts to solve these problems.  On the one hand, we should pay attention to guiding the broad  masses of party members, cadres and people to further emancipate  the mind, renew their ideas, bravely make explorations, boldly  engage in practice, suggest ways and means for reform and  development, and make contributions to reform and development;  on the other hand, we should pay attention to grasping the  ideological trends and well grasp the mass media orientation. We  must be sober-headed, tell truth from falsehood, and have a  clear-cut stand to know what we should support, advocate,  restrict, and oppose within a period of time.    As for some wrong thinkings and acts, we should not leave  them unchecked as well as should clear them up and give guidance  to them. We should criticize and educate wrongdoers who deserve  to accept them. We should boldly protect and support the new  things cropping up in reforms. Great attention should be paid  to protecting and bringing into play the enthusiasm of the broad  masses of cadres in plunging into reform and construction. We  should vigorously publicize and commend those who have performed  their official duties honestly; done the administrative work  industriously for the people; engaged in their work  industriously; boldly pioneered roads; and made prominent  contributions to reform, opening up, and economic construction.  By coping with the evil trend cropping up in the administration  honesty in every period, we should remind cadres of the trend in  a timely manner and give an early warning to them so as to  arouse them to pay attention to it and to avoid the mistake. As  for cadres who have attempted to do their best in work  wholeheartedly and committed faults because of their poor  experience, we should help them summarize their experience and  lessons and support them to better do their work in the future.  We should correctly handle the contradictions among the people  and turn the negative factors into active ones. We should  chiefly give criticism and education to cadres who have  committed malpractice. It will be all right for these cadres as  long as they have actively examined and corrected their  mistakes. We should impose necessary party-discipline sanction  on cadres who have refused to accept the education and to  correct their mistakes. We should strictly handle those in line  with the law and party discipline, who have violated the  criminal law and party discipline.    2. We should successfully grasp the implementation of  anticorruption work in various fields this year by closely  following the whole situation in the work undertaken by the  entire party.    The third plenum of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commssion has made overall arrangements for the anticorruption  work this year. In line with the demand of the central  authorities, by bearing the province's reality in minds, and by  closely following the whole situation in the work undertaken by  the entire party, we must further enhance our measures and  reinforce the dynamics in work. A good job should be done in  grasping the implementation of anticorruption work in various  fields this year. Efforts should be made to concentrate efforts  on dealing with the deep-rooted problems; to strive to score  greater achievements; and to ensure the deepening of reform,  economic development, and social stability in the province.  Comrade Shangwen has made specific arrangements in his report  for implementing the three tasks of anticorruption struggle. I,  hereby, would like to stress again the following several issues:    A. We should seize the emphasis of encouraging leading  cadres  to perform official duties honestly and to be self-disciplined.  The focal point of self examination and correction in the  campaign of administration honesty and self discipline this year  is still aimed at the leading cadres at the county (section)  level. By bearing in their minds the reality in their own  localities and units and according to the five provisions set by  the central authorities and the five provisions issued in the  year, party and government organs at all levels throughout the  province should further do a good job in self examination and  correction in the anticorruption work. Leading cadres at all  levels and particularly principal leading comrades should play a  leading role in the work. Leading bodies at province and city  levels should strive to score better achievements in this regard  so as to set an example for their subordinate units. In  conducting self examination and correction, we should  concentrate our efforts on grasping implementation and scoring  practical results. As for the problems that have been exposed  in the course of self examination and correction in line with  the five provisions issued in 1993 but which have not been  corrected, we should enhance the supervision and inspection and  correct or handle them in line with the provisions concerned.  We should organize forces to investigate the problems committed  by some cadres who have not conducted self examination and  correction and about which the mass has lodged strong  complaints. They should be strictly handled as long as they  have been proved as true. As for the problems whose mistakes  have been clarified in line with the limits of policies set the  five provisions issued in the year, we should correct them by  intensively conducting self examination. As for the problems  that have involved in a wider range in the society and whose  contents are more complicated, we should do a good job in  carrying out investigation and study in advance and have the  provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial  supervisory department to organize the departments concerned to  formulate the limits of policies, to successfully conduct the  pilot work, and to handle them in an overall way after gaining  the experience from the pilot work. We should integrate the  self examination and correction with the reports and opinions of  the masses to bring into play the supervisory role of the  masses. Party organizations at all levels and particularly  discipline inspection commissions and organizational departments  at all levels should be practically responsible for the work,  enhance the supervision over party-member cadres and  particularly leading cadres, and regard the results of  administration honesty and self examination as an important  content in appraising and employing cadres.    B. We should reinforce the dynamics in dealing with serious  and appalling cases. Emphasis in handling cases this year is  still directed at party and government leading organs and the  departments of judiciary, administration, law enforcement, and  economic management and should be placed on handling cases that  are disturbing and damaging reforms, development, and stability,  as well seriously violating the law and discipline. In line  with the exposed clues of cases, various localities should  earnestly analyze and study them and formulate explicit and  specific plans for handling the cases that should be dealt with  immediately. They should concentrate their efforts on dealing  with the important and typical cases and the serious and  appalling cases that have a guiding significance on the whole  situation. We should affix responsibility on those who have  blocked or disturbed the handling of cases, hidden the cases,  put off the investigation of cases, and not handled the cases  after finishing the investigation. When encountering  difficulties and problems that have caused the suspension of  carrying out investigation or handling of cases, the principal  leading comrades of party and government organs should take up  the difficulties and problems personally and adopt resolute  measures to do away with the interference and obstruction and to  vigorously make a breakthrough in dealing with them. The organs  of discipline inspection, supervision, and judiciary should  uphold the principles and boldly deal with the knotty problems.  Under the situation in which reform is being continuously  deepened, we should not only investigate and handle the acts  that have not been stopped, though prohibition has been issued,  but also handle the acts of not observing the order. We should  strictly enforce the discipline among those who "have provided  counter-measures for coping with the policies issued by their  higher authorities" and damaged the whole interest in order to  obtain the immediate and partial interest and the interest of  small communities to ensure the smooth enforcement of  administrative orders and the implementation of various reform  measures.    C. We should continuously correct the malpractice. All-out  efforts should be continuously made this year to score obvious  results in dealing with the two problems of collecting fees  arbitrarily and spending public funds on outside and overseas  tours. We should resolutely implement the announcement on the  collection suspension of some fees. By no means should we break  our promise to the people by announcing the collection  suspension on the one hand and continuously collecting fees  arbitrarily on the other hand. As for the administrative fees  and the income accumulated from fines and confiscations, we  should enforce the managerial regulation of "double-track system  between income and spending" in this regard. Departments  concerned should rapidly make contact with their higher organs  so as to formulate as soon as possible specific methods for  implementing the regulation. Efforts should be made to  earnestly implement the regulation on encouraging the economic  entities run by the party and government organs to get rid of  their relations with these organs. A good job should be done  in clearing up and returning the unpaid occupation of property  by the party and government organs to enterprises. Efforts  should be made to intensively clear up and correct the arbitrary  apportioning and the problems of asking assistance from  enterprises on various pretexts. In correcting their  malpractice, various industries and trades should define one or  two targets while handling the existing prominent problems so as  to conduct specialized consolidation over the targets. Various  localities should also select several departments, industries,  and trades to be the key units of taking up the work of  correcting malpractice. Those who did a better job in  correcting the malpractice and scored certain achievements in  this regard last year should concentrate their efforts this year  on consolidating and upgrading their achievements, as well as on  deepening their consolidation to score more obvious results.    D. We should further perfect the supervisory mechanism and  take radical and stopgap measures simultaneously. Developing  the socialist market economy requires the guarantee of law.  Only by perfecting the legal system and establishing the  effective restriction mechanism of supervision can we prevent  and eliminate corrupt phenomena systematically and ensure the  healthy development of the socialist market economy. Therefore,  in the course of anticorruption we must attach great importance  on establishing legal systems, integrating anticorruption with  the establishment of legal systems, and taking radical and  stopgap measures simultaneously. We should not only establish a  complete set of regulations and rules for the market economy,  but also a series of laws and regulations for anticorruption so  as to provide legal basis for more effectively punishing the  corrupt. In coping with the loopholes cropping up in the course  of anticorruption in the fields of management and systems, we  should earnestly summarize the experience and lessons; perfect  the systems; and enhance the management to resolutely block  them. Some regulations and rules that were proved as effective  in the past should be continuously enforced and popularized.  Meanwhile, attention should be made to exploring the new ways of  enhancing the fostering of work style and administrative honesty  and of carrying out anticorruption struggles.    Now, some of our comrades' sense of legal system is getting  blunted. No sooner do we stress the necessity to have the  daring to think, do, and pioneer than these people engage  themselves in unlawful and undisciplined activities. Therefore,  education must be strengthened. We should organize the broad  masses of party members and cadres to conscientiously study the  third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; should  prominently conduct the education on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics; should conduct education on the purpose  of the party, party discipline, and the legal system; should  foster an accurate outlook on life and value; should enhance the  sense of party discipline and the sense of the legal system; and  should ensure that power should smoothly move in the cycle of  policy decisions, implementation, supervision, and feedback.    We should strengthen the improvement of party style and  administrative honesty among enterprises and institutions and  vigorously sum up and popularize the good examples emerging from  the construction of the spiritual and material civilizations.  Leading cadres of the enterprises and institutions should be  honest in performing official duties, be self-disciplined,  observe disciplines, and abide by laws. Various kinds of  negative and corrosive phenomena, such as abusing power for  private gains, engaging in corruption and bribery, and indulging  in extravagance and waste, should be opposed.    3. We should realistically strengthen the leadership over  the  anticorruption work.    The current anticorruption tasks are extremely heavy. The  previous anticorruption work achievements should be  consolidated. The work that has not yet been accomplished need  to be continuously done. Some deep-layered problems should  urgently be solved. New tasks and requirements in the  next-stage anticorruption work have been set forth. That  whether or not we can achieve the work in these aspects and make  achievements in the anticorruption work is related to the  prestige of the party among the masses and to the overall  situation of reform, development, and stability. The party  committees and governments at various levels should  realistically strengthen leadership, carefully organize forces,  and achieve this year's anticorruption work in a down-to-earth  manner.    A. The anticorruption work should be carried out under the  unified leadership of the party committees and the governments.  The party committees and governments at various levels should  put the anticorruption work in the important work agenda. Party  and government principal leaders should personally engage in the  work. They should not only personally mobilize and arrange the  anticorruption work but also attend to the implementation of the  work. Party and government principal leaders should engage  themselves in the solution of major problems. Anticorruption  should be brought into the overall situation of reform,  development, and stability. At the time of studying and  arranging the work of deepening reform, developing the economy,  and safeguarding stability, we should set forth requirements and  make arrangements for opposing corruption and strengthening the  improvement of administrative honesty and ensure that the  anticorruption work and the improvement of administrative  honesty should be arranged in a unified manner and develop  coordinately. There must be both overall plans and definite  targets for the anticorruption work. This work must be carried  out in a step-by-step, solid, and steady manner. The party  committees and governments at various levels should  appropriately convene meetings to hear reports, analyze the  situation, study countermeasures, and promote the anticorruption  work in a step-by-step and profound manner.    B. We should set up and perfect the system of responsibility  for opposing corruption. Party and government principal leading  comrades should assume overall responsibility for the  anticorruption work of their localities, departments, and units.  The members of the leading bodies at various levels in charge  of the improvement of party style and administrative honesty  should directly assume responsibility for the work. Other  members of the leading bodies should assume major responsibility  for the anticorruption work of the fronts that they belong to.  Each level should guide, on a responsibility basis, the  anticorruption work of its lower level. The provincial  discipline inspection commission and the provincial supervisory  department should assume responsibility for organizing,  coordinating with, guiding, and generally analyzing the  anticorruption work of the province as a whole. The work  committee of the provincial-level organs should take charge of  supervising, inspecting, and generally analyzing the  anticorruption work of the provincial-level departments. In  carrying out the three tasks for opposing corruption, the  provincial-level units and all departments concerned should  realistically attend to the work that they take charge of and  pay particular attention to studying and formulating, as soon as  possible, the policies relating to the three tasks so as to  create conveniences for opposing corruption. All cities and  provincial-level departments should report on the fulfillment of  each and every task to the provincial discipline inspection  commission and the provincial supervisory department. Then, the  provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial  supervisory department should collect the data for the  provincial party committee and the provincial government.    C. We should strengthen supervision and inspection. The key  to whether this year's anticorruption work can be more effective  lies in whether the three anticorruption tasks can be truly  carried out. Party committees and governments at all levels  should hold their respective responsibilities, adopt various  measures, and organize people at an opportune time to inspect  how these three tasks are carried out. The central authorities  will organize investigation groups to inspect provinces,  regions, municipalities, and departments directly under the  central authorities in June. The provincial party committee  will also organize investigation groups to inspect cities and  the departments directly under the province. All localities  should strengthen this work in line with the requirements of the  central authorities and the provincial party committee. Through  the inspection, we should find out problems, strengthen  guidance, summarize experiences, and adopt effective measures to  make the anticorruption work successful. This work should become  a system and be carried out on a long-term basis.    D. We should further strengthen leadership over discipline  inspection and supervision work and give full play to its role.  Discipline inspection and supervision departments are the major  organs in charge of the anticorruption work, which shoulder  still greater responsibility and encounter still heavier tasks  in the future anticorruption work. Party committees and  governments at all levels should show concern for and support  their work from the perspective of building the party and  political power, help them eliminate interference and obstacles,  and help them address difficulties and problems in their work in  a timely manner. Under the leadership of party committees and  governments, discipline inspection and supervision departments  at all levels should conscientiously perform their functions,  fully and successfully play their role in the anticorruption  work, and serve as good advisers and assistants to party  committees and governments.    We should fully develop the role of people's organizations,  democratic parties, and personages without party affiliation,  organize them to participate in the work related to the  anticorruption struggle, and earnestly listen to their opinions  and suggestions.    Cadres with party membership at all levels, especially  leading cadres, should intensify party spirit training,  continuously remold their world outlook, foster the purpose of  serving the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the  masses, give heed to their voice, help them resolve misgivings  and difficulties, and share weal and woe with them. We should  overcome bureaucracy and formalism, go deep into the reality of  life to conduct investigation and study, and help the  grass-roots levels and the masses solve problems in a  down-to-earth manner. We should give wide publicity to the  typical examples in honest and industrious administration and  advocate the main theme of this era.    Comrades, Liaoning's tasks of reform, development, and  stability are very heavy this year and its tasks to oppose  corruption are also very arduous. Under the correct leadership  of the party Central Committee and the provincial party  committee, we are convinced that Liaoning will win greater  achievements in the anticorruption work, further facilitate  reform, opening up, and economic construction, promote social  stability, and ensure the smooth progress of its "second  pioneering program" as long as we firmly rely on party  organizations at all levels and the masses and make sure that  the party and cadres are of one mind and act in unison with the  masses.</p>

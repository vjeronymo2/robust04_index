			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Beth Castillo] </F>   [Text] Cotabato City -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front  (MILF) had been implicated in the abduction of an engineer from  Manila who was kidnapped two weeks ago while lodging at a  government-run hotel inside the campus of the Mindanao State  University [MSU] in Marawi City.    As this developed, the Cotabato City Peace and Order Council  (CCPOC) had urged higher authorities to investigate on the  alleged involvement of some policemen and military personnel in  the spate of the "unabated" kidnappings here since 1990.    Reports reaching here said, in Marawi City, authorities on  Wednesday received a letter purportedly coming from the  abductors of Arceo Cruz, 66, who was snatched last 29 March by  armed men in his cottage at the Ayala Resort, a hotel located  inside the 2,500 hectare MSU campus.    The letter, written in an MILF official stationery, stated a  P50 million [Philippine pesos] ransom demand in exchange for the  freedom of Cruz, who is supervising the implementation of a road  project linking two towns in Lanao del Sur.    Among those who signed the same letter were known criminals  facing warrants of arrest: Commander Dimas, the group's leader;  Sulaiman Marohombsar; Ibra "Brix" Cabugatan; Omar Usman; Linog  Sultan; Michael Capal; Saide Caya, and Commander Mujahid.    The kidnappers also included in their demands the  implementation of regular infrastructure projects under the 1993  "seed money" of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao  [ARMM]; a performance audit of the ARMM particularly in Lanao  del Sur; the "enforcement" of a standing truce between the  government and Moro rebels; and the placement of qualified  Muslims in the government.    Police reports said the letter was personally handed by  Assemblyman Benasing Macarambon of ARMM to Brig. Gen. Samuel  Dunque, chief of the Army's 102d Brigade in Marawi City.    It was not however, specified how Macarambon got hold of the  ransom letter. Cruz is believed kept by his captors at Unayan  area, a remote place bordering the towns of Ganasi, Malabang,  and Kalanugas, all in Lanao del Sur's 2d district.    "Even if we sell our souls together, still we cannot raise  the P50 million," said Ernesto Chinjen, 55, brother-in-law of  Cruz, who he said was not even a well-known contractor until the  time of his abduction.    "We cannot do something either with their (kidnappers)  political demands," he said. "Only the national leaders and the  ARMM authorities can do something about it."    Mayor Macacna Pangandaman, who is among those negotiating  for  the safe release of Cruz, said the kidnappers' demand is  equivalent to the total cost of the road project the victim was  constructing.    Chief Supt. Mangigin Magomnang, ARMM regional police  director, said the police and the military have issued  instructions not to give the kidnappers anything as it would set  a bad precedent and would encourage more kidnappings in the area.</p>

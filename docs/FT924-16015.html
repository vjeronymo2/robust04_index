			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Petro lowers profits forecast MITSUBISHI Petrochemical, the leading Japanese petrochemical maker, yesterday reduced its first-half pre-tax profit forecast to Y6bn (Dollars 49.6m) from Y13bn, and cut executive salaries by as much as 20 per cent, write Robert Thomson and Steven Butler in Tokyo. The company blamed the lower-than-expected profits on the slowing Japanese economy, which has led to weaker demand for industrial products and severe price competition. Sales for the first half to end September are forecast at Y190bn, down from Y209.4bn last year, while pre-tax profits last year were Y19.6bn. Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, said yesterday consolidated net profits for the year to March 1993 would drop by 49.4 per cent to Y20bn, a 60 per cent plunge from its forecast made in May. Like other Japanese electronics companies, Toshiba has been forced to slash its profits forecasts in response to the unexpectedly severe downturn. Toshiba said its heavy electrical apparatus business, including power generation equipment, continued to be firm. But sales of information and communication equipment, including computers, remained poor. Toshiba forecast sales of Y4,730bn for the year, 0.2 per cent up from last year. Pre-tax profits would fall 30.4 per cent to Y80bn. On a parent company basis, pre-tax profits are expected to fall to Y60bn from Y70.7bn.</p>

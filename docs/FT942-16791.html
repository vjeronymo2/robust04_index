			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / People: Chief executive becomes first policy director for Tecs A chief executive who has demonstrated considerable flair in the running of his own Tec has been appointed as the first full-time director of policy and strategy for the 82 Tecs in England and Wales. Chris Humphries, who has been chief executive of Hertfordshire Tec since 1991, is expected to take up the position in June. In effect he will be chief executive of the Tec secretariat which supports the work of the Tec National Council, a body which represents Tecs nationally, in particular in their relationship to the government. Responsibility at a national level for policy and strategy has until now been handled in a part-time capacity by Richard Guy, the chief executive of South and East Cheshire Tec and Business Link. Humphries, 44, is expected to play a key role in negotiations between Tecs and the government as well as interfacing between the several specialist committees that develop Tecs' policies. He will report to Mike Bett, the former deputy chairman of British Telecom, who has taken over as non-executive chairman of the Tec national council in succession to Edward Roberts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "cs": "Euphoria Over Membership in the </F> European Union Has Subsided"]    [Text] Linz -- A majority of Austrians continues to endorse  Austrian membership in the European Union [EU], but the number  of supporters has clearly declined since the beginning of April,  and the opponents have won ground again. This is revealed by the  most recent Market opinion poll.    A total of 46 percent are currently in favor of entry into  the EU, and 36 percent are against it. When those who are  undecided or who have not made up their minds were asked whether  they would rather vote for or against EU membership, it is clear  that three out of four who are undecided would rather vote in  favor of entry into the EU. In fact, the April poll revealed a  larger number of EU supporters, but those who were undecided  were more inclined to vote against the EU.    Thus, Market head Werner Beutelmeyer draws the conclusion  that the euphoria that prevailed after the announcement of the  results of the Brussels negotiations has subsided. "Yet the  mood continues to be good, even though the outcome of the  referendum is by no means certain," the pollster stated.    The result among supporters of the Freedom Party of Austria  has changed considerably. A total of 46 percent rejects EU  membership for the first time; 31 percent support Austria's  entry into the EU.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / China wrings 'water' from statistics There are lies, damned lies and, it seems, Chinese statistics. The China Information newspaper has reported that in 1993 alone there were 60,000 cases of 'false statistics' reports in 30 provinces, regions and cities. A recent statistics supervision conference held in Qingdao, south-east of Beijing, was told there was 'a lot of water' in industrial output reports, that birth statistics were frequently understated and grain stockpiles were often exaggerated. In an effort to guard against false reporting, a 1984 'Statistics Law' is being strengthened to include penalties for falsifying records. Among the main culprits are government officials seeking to add lustre to their performances as local administrators. Mr Li Gang, deputy director of the Policy and Law office of the State Statistical Bureau, said problems arose because 'grassroots officials needed to fulfil production as well as birth control quotas in order to retain their positions or get promoted'. 'Serious cases are under investigation,' he added. 'Those who add 'water' to the statistics will be punished according to the law.' He said problems of false statistics had become more prevalent in this transition phase in the Chinese economy from a centrally-planned system to a market-oriented one. 'When the (1984) law was being drafted there was basically only one economic structure in China. Today there are several economic systems.' But false and exaggerated statistics are nothing new in China. During the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s agricultural production figures were wildly exaggerated to conform with overheated propaganda about the success of the communist system. In reality the Great Leap was a disaster and millions are believed to have starved to death as China's communist rulers were proclaiming the triumph of the system. Western economists in Beijing say they approach Chinese statistics warily, but inflation figures appeared to be a reasonable reflection of price trends; although the 'collection methods (of statistical information) is not what we would expect in the west,' said one. The Qingdao conference heard that the two worst-offending provinces were Hebei and Shanxi in the north where 20,000 cases of falsifying records had been uncovered in 1993. In one county in Hebei province the birth rate had been under-stated by half to avoid censure over the failure of local officials to curb population growth. Among the most prevalent examples of false reporting in Hebei and Shanxi was an over-statement of per-capita income of peasants. This was to avoid revealing the extent of impoverishment and allied to that the failure of local official to improve living standards. In other areas, such as the wealthier coastal regions, peasant incomes were under-stated to minimise tax. Speakers at the Qingdao conference criticised the present law which lacked 'teeth' to punish violators; did not give representatives of the central State Statistical Bureau the automatic right to 'audit' local statistics; and was inadequate for the requirements of a rapidly evolving market economy, especially in the monitoring of a fast-growing private sector.</p>

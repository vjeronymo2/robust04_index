			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HUNGER FOR ATTENTION PROPELS TAGGERS ON THEIR NIGHTLY ROUNDS  </P> <P> The four teen-agers sauntered down a darkened Long Beach street until they  reached a delivery truck parked at the curb. Three of the four stationed  themselves as lookouts. The fourth approached the truck's broad white side.  </P> <P> He produced a spray can from under his coat and painted in quick, deft strokes.  Moments later, the only trace of the outlaws was their handiwork: a string of  black, stylized letters marking the fleeting presence of these vandals of the  night.  </P> <P> Time elapsed: about 20 seconds.  </P> <P> "I like to see my name up," said a 15-year-old called Acer, one of the lookouts  on that recent night.  </P> <P> "What a bunch of jerks," says Paul Miranda, a homeowner who lives nearby.  </P> <P> This is no ordinary graffiti, but a quick-hit variety known as tagging. The  challenge as the youths see it is to be the fastest, the boldest, to scrawl  one's name on the most surfaces in the shortest time. The challenge for  authorities is to try to stem the staggering increase in property damage that  results.  </P> <P> Indeed, tagging, imported from the subways of New York City, has dramatically  proliferated on the streets, buses and freeway overpasses of Southern  California. Stylized insignias are everywhere, and they are frustrating law  enforcement officials, neighborhood leaders and taxpayers who pay millions  annually for cleanup.  </P> <P> But a strange transformation has occurred somewhere along the route from East  Coast urban plague to West Coast youth craze. Police say that tagging, long  associated with gang activity, has become more or less a street sport in Los  Angeles, albeit a destructive one.  </P> <P> Tag teams of teen-agers compete for style and space. Star performers worry  about their reputations among peers. Leaders hold practice sessions to improve  the skills of their teammates.  </P> <P> "It's better than being in a gang," said one member of a Long Beach-based  tagging crew called Knocking off Suckas -- or KOS. "This is a hobby."  </P> <P> KOS members -- who generally carry markers with them and admit to spending many  of their waking hours tagging -- say they know of at least six other active tag  teams in Long Beach alone.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, they say, dozens of other known crews patrol the streets,  including the Notorious Kings (NTSK); Kings With Style (KWS); King Time Lords  (KTL) and Under The Influence (UTI).  </P> <P> Generally based in the neighborhood where its members live or attend school, a  crew may have hundreds of adherents between the ages of 9 and 18.  </P> <P> When tagging, the youngsters inscribe their crew's initials along with their  own stylized "signatures," or tag names. Favorite targets include trucks, sound  walls, buses, buildings and street signs -- any surface that is likely to be  seen by large numbers of people.  </P> <P> Strategies for reaching overhead freeway signs include shimmying down  embankments or overpasses to get to them, the youths say.  </P> <P> "We just want to be known all over the city," said a tagger who goes by the  name Crazie.  </P> <P> "We're just signing our autographs, but on walls," said another, known as  Saker.  </P> <P> But what of the anguish, exasperation and cleanup costs the taggers cause  homeowners, store owners, other property owners and government agencies?  </P> <P> "We don't care," a youth called Biser said. "They don't do nothing for us."  </P> <P> Psychologists who have examined the phenomenon say personal and group  recognition is a big part of what fuels the trend. There is little  understanding of the realities of property damage.  </P> <P> "These are people who don't feel that they have any recognition or power in the  world," said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist who specializes in  youth trends. "This is their way of making the only statement that they know  how to make and, at least in their group, it makes an impression."  </P> <P> B. David Brooks, a psychologist and educator who trains police how to deal with  gang members and graffiti artists, agrees. "It's a way that they build a pseudo  self-esteem," he said of taggers. "They get a big rush."  </P> <P> The number of taggers in Los Angeles County is estimated to be 3,000 to 5,000,  up to four times what it was believed to be in 1986, experts say. Originally,  many came from lower-income Latino backgrounds, but tagging has begun to draw  practitioners from almost all ethnic and economic groups, including  upper-middle-class kids.  </P> <P> "In the last year, it's really gotten out of hand," said Los Angeles Police  Detective Robert Contreras, adding that the youths seem more and more  unrepentant. "Now it's more of a sport. It's no longer just gangs."  </P> <P> On the streets, tag crews tend to stay within their neighborhoods and in some  cases even assign specific areas to specific taggers. But occasional "battles"  do break out. Recently, for instance, KOS members decided to take on a crew  called BES for encroaching on their turf. During a single day of concerted  "mobbing," the taggers said, they virtually "took out" the rival club by  covering each of its painted insignias with one of their own.  </P> <P> The results of all this spraying, marking and inscribing, of course, have been  devastating to the property owners, local municipalities and public agencies  that have been hit.  </P> <P> The Southern California Rapid Transit District, whose buses are favored  targets, spent about $10 million in 1989 cleaning the stuff off -- three times  what it spent just four years ago. During the past year, according to RTD  officials, a special anti-graffiti unit has cited or arrested more than 800  people -- most of them juveniles -- for vandalism. Yet the problem keeps  getting worse.  </P> <P> Many cities have increased the amount of money set aside for battling graffiti,  and some law enforcement agencies are offering sizable rewards for information  leading to the arrests of taggers. They are also trying to catch taggers by  videotaping their activities.  </P> <P> Residents of some areas are beginning to fight back by organizing informal  neighborhood patrols to either ward off or capture the vandals in the midst of  their destructive behavior.  </P> <P> "People are really getting disturbed by all this garbage," said Miranda, a  retired city employee who has lived in the same Long Beach neighborhood for 35  years. "(Residents) are going to have to start taking care of what's important  to them -- this is our community and we have to start doing something. We can't  just let these idiotic little jerks go around painting everything."  </P> <P> Said a Long Beach parks employee who spends much of his time painting over  graffiti-splattered walls: "We just painted and it's back up already. It makes  us feel like we're wasting time."  </P> <P> Getting caught isn't much of a deterrent. Although tagging is a misdemeanor  carrying fines of $40 to $250 for repeat offenders, law enforcement officials  say first-time offenders often get off with a warning or probation. Some judges  are beginning to mete out public-service sentences that include time spent  cleaning up graffiti, but officials say the tactic so far has not had a  measurable effect.  </P> <P> "The judges lecture them up one side and down the other," said Art Close, a  Lakewood attorney who has represented taggers, "but what can you do when you  have a kid coming in at 14 for a minor offense while you have other guys coming  in for rape and murder? Looking at the judges' caseloads, (they) can't spend  much time on this type of offense."  </P> <P> At a recent gathering of KOS members at a Long Beach park where they meet about  every two weeks, the legal ramifications for their actions were low on the  agenda.  </P> <P> "I want you guys to know how to write," 14-year-old Ciper told the more than 20  kids sitting quietly at picnic tables, some marking their names on the wood. "I  want you to learn. You guys know my phone number -- if you need any help, just  ask me."  </P> <P> In recent months, Ciper told his followers, he had personally "booted" a number  of taggers from the group. The quality of their tagging styles had fallen below  club standards, he said, which require tags to be attractive and have letters  that match.  </P> <P> "Wherever you guys live," said Saker, another tagger, "try to write more. We  want everyone to know KOS. If you get caught, don't let that stop you."  </P> <P> At night, on the streets and alleyways, the obsession gets fully vented. After  marking up the white delivery truck on a recent evening, the KOS team fanned  out quickly on both sides of the street, defacing signposts and storefronts.  </P> <P> Earlier the same night they had been threatened by a gang member who,  apparently mistaking them for rivals, had waved a gun in their faces. So now,  they figured, they had two enemies, the gangs and the police. Shortly  afterward, a third one appeared -- a man who worked in one of the buildings the  crew was tagging. Stepping outside, he questioned them pointedly, shook a fist,  and appeared to make for a telephone.  </P> <P> The taggers scattered in panic. Then, running down a side street, they  regrouped in front of a large clean block wall, only to have to retreat again  moments later when the headlights of a passing car appeared.  </P> <P> Finally, they reached an alley in which the lights were low and the traffic  sparse. They sprayed and marked with impunity, hitting garage doors and  back-yard walls as they went. As they emptied spray cans, they dropped them  where they were and resumed the assault with grease markers.  </P> <P> In less than an hour the taggers had made a wide loop of several blocks, ending  at the burger joint from which they had begun.  </P> <P> "It's a habit," explained a tagger called Dsire. "Once you start, you can't  stop."  </P> <P> "It's addictive," Saker said. "You see someone's name up there and you just  want yours up too."  </P></p>

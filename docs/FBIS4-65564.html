			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Maurizio Boccacci, leader of the extreme </F> right-wing, by Gianluigi Pellegrino; place and date not given:  "Fini, Watch Your Step or We Will Again Establish The True  Social Movement" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance leader]  must really watch his step. Otherwise he will lose his  grassroots support with incredible speed, and we are ready here  to reconstruct the true Italian Social Movement [MSI], with the  help, among others, of many of his own men, including all those  from the Salo Republic [fascist republic in northern Italy in  1943] and the MSI grassroots groups." Thus spoke Maurizio  Boccacci, the 37-year old leader of the Italian extreme right  and formations which were disbanded last year through the  Mancini law.    [Pellegrino] How come? The whole world is clamoring against  the risk of a fascist comeback, and you who profess to be  fascists are not satisfied?    [Boccacci] The question is not whether we are satisfied or  not, but rather that no one can join forces with [Prime  Minister] Berlusconi and be a fascist at the same time. At  most, you can be a Freemason -- a full-fledged freemason of the  worst kind. Remember that [former Freemason leader] Gelli said  of him "he is quite a nice young lad." Since then, the  magistrature has rehabilitated the P2 [outlawed Masonic lodge],  and Berlusconi has become prime minister. If you put two and  two together. We do not want to have anything to do with  Freemasons. Let me tell you that I am much more concerned that  today, as fascists, we are associated with Berlusconi, than I  was concerned when they called us fascists and blamed us for all  the evils in the world.    [Pellegrino] Let us go back to Fini.    [Boccacci] If Fini does not watch his step, if he does not  uphold the values of fascism which nourish his broad electoral  base, he runs the risk of becoming an empty shell, of losing his  most genuine voters, and of having to rely increasingly on the  traditionally Christian Democratic voters who have such a good  understanding with the P2 members and the Freemasons. Great  opportunities will then open up for us to reorganize -- for us  who abhor unbridled capitalist liberalism even more than we do  communism.    [Pellegrino] [MSI member] Pino Rauti started his electoral  campaign in the European elections by commemorating Bombacci,  the Communist who became a Mussolini supporter and was then  executed at Dongo, and who certainly was not a capitalist.    [Boccacci] In fact, this is the hub of the question. If Fini  pays heed to this kind of demand from the people as he only  seems to do when he says that Mussolini was the greatest  statesman of the century, it is one thing.    [Pellegrino] Otherwise?    [Boccacci] Otherwise a genuine reconstruction of the MSI  might take place around Rauti and others like him.    [Pellegrino] On what issues, then, will Fini be put to the  test?    [Boccacci] Broadly speaking, he should be adamant, rather  than unconditionally accept Berlusconi's hyperliberalism, and he  should relaunch an anti-Zionist policy which is opposed to  international big business. I am also thinking in terms of a  number of anti-immigration measures, of reclaiming Istria and  Dalmatia, of abolishing the Mancino Laws and the Scelba Law,  which prohibit the reconstruction of the Fascist Party. This is  what the MSI grassroots movement claims and demands.    [Pellegrino] So, for the time being, you will remain  bystanders.    [Boccacci] Not at all. Great opportunities are already  opening up for us. Engrossed as he is in his portfolio-hunting  and thirst for power, I really do not think that Fini will be  capable of displaying the consistency which the grassroots  expect from him.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- The working out of the  common customs legislation for the CIS member states is one of  the indispensable factors in the creation of common economic  space within the CIS framework, the restoration of the disrupted  economic ties, the improvement of the effectiveness of foreign  economic activities and the consolidation of the new  commonwealth, said Anatoliy Kruglov, chairman of the Russian  State Customs Committee, at a session of the CIS Council of  Heads of Customs Services which was held here today.    The adoption of the fundamentals of the CIS customs  legislation is one of the main items on the agenda. They will  become the basis for further activities of CIS customs services.    Kruglov pointed to the topicality of the meeting, which is  being held on the eve of the CIS summit in Moscow, and stressed  that multilateral agreements on cooperation and mutual  assistance in the tackling of customs problems, as well as an  agreement of customs services on the struggle against the  smuggling of cultural values would be among documents, prepared  for signing at tomorrow's summit.    The meeting discussed measures, stemming from the resolution  of the Council of Heads of the CIS Member States, adopted at the  September conference in Moscow, about the temporary application  of the treaty on the creation of an economic alliance, which  would form the basis of customs relations between CIS member  states. Participants in the meeting discussed possibilities of  harmonizing the customs legislation of the CIS countries,  simplifying the customs clearance at the borders and introducing  a single form of customs documents for foreign trade customs  statistics.    They adopted the conceptual basis for the work of the  communication centre of law-enforcement agencies of the CIS  customs services and approved regulations on the national  communication centre.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oversupply makes forest thinning uneconomic WEAK DEMAND, oversupply and falling prices for pulpwood and other small-sized wood have made forest thinning operations uneconomic in many areas of Europe, with damaging social and environmental consequences, according to two United Nations agencies. In a joint statement, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation and the Economic Commission for Europe, which has its headquarters in Geneva, warn that in many countries there is a serious risk of a reduction in 'the forest's stability, vitality, productivity and its contribution to the rural economy and society'. Paradoxically, the statement puts the blame for this situation largely on a supposedly environment-friendly development, the big increase in the recycling of used paper in Europe. The two organisations call for the development of new outlets for small-sized wood, including its use as an energy source, and the possible use of waste paper as fuel to free up the paper market for pulpwood. Reporting on market developments for forest products in 1993 and prospects for 1994, the ECE notes that prices for pulp are at their lowest level for many years and that many mills are running well below capacity. Apart from more use of waste paper, this reflects overcapacity in the pulp sector and production of higher grades leading to a higher proportion of coatings and fillers, the ECE says. At the same time, pulpwood is being imported into the European market, mainly by Finland and Sweden. The report says markets for pulpwood are increasingly being internationalised as large importers draw supplies from a wide range of sources which compete against each other. More generally, the ECE report shows that European markets for forest products have remained marked by weak demand and strong competition on increasingly global markets. In North America markets were stronger and prices rose. For countries moving to market economy systems, 1993 saw steep drops in demand for forest products combined with supply bottlenecks. The outlook for eastern Europe remains sombre. The ECE says almost no quantitative information is available for Russia 'due to the complete breakdown of the state information system'. However, the report expects Russian sawn softwood exports to fall by 25 per cent in 1993 and then to remain constant at around 5m cubic metres due to supply constraints.</p>

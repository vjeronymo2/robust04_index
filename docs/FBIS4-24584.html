			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 27 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin  said today that Russia has no extra and unnecessary land and  will firmly defend the integrity of its territory.    The Russian president made these remarks while explaining  his  concept of defense on the Russian border at a frontier force  festival here, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported today.    Yeltsin pointed out that Russia has no territorial claims  over other countries and favors civilized settlements of border  disputes.    Russia is a young nation and there is still a lot to be done  before it completes demarcation of borders with neighboring  countries, ITAR-TASS cited him as saying.    Yeltsin stressed that Russia's border should become an  impassable barrier for terrorists, drug-traffickers, smugglers  and illegal immigrants.    The priority for frontier guards is to cope with armed  provocation, he added.    But he stressed that Russia favors peaceful settlements of  border disputes and will resort to force only under  extraordinary situations.    The border should not become an obstacle for international  cooperation and exchange, he added.    On border defense, he said that because Russia's relations  with neighboring countries vary with political situation, Russia  should treat different countries with different approaches.</p>

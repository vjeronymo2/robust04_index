			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Miti issues apology over pro-government memo Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday apologised for sending out memos which suggested Japanese business organisations should comment favourably on the government's recent economic stimulus package. Mr Hideaki Kumano, Miti vice-minister, apologised for what he said was a 'misunderstanding' caused by a ministry document which urged support for the government's proposals. The document was sent to leading business organisations, including the Federation of Economic Organisations and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The suggestions were sent by the ministry last week to the private business organisations, which represent many of the industries Miti has shaped through 'administrative guidance'. The document recommended the organisations evaluate the government's economic package 'highly' and express support for the proposed tax reforms. Mr Kumano admitted the wording of parts of the document was 'inappropriate'. The unprecedented move by Miti was widely seen as an attempt by the ministry to influence the comments of the influential organisations and was sharply criticised after it was revealed in a Tokyo daily newspaper. The ministry's attempt to elicit favourable comments from business comes amid a trend towards reducing bureaucratic influence over industry and deregulating the country's markets. Deregulation is one of the stated goals of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government. The incident also coincides with the ministry's successful deflection of US pressure to use government influence over industry to boost foreign imports into Japanese markets. The trade ministry, notorious for its large number of industry regulations, succeeded in countering US proposals that Japan set numerical indicators to measure progress in opening the country's markets to foreign cars and car parts, on the grounds that such a move would constitute undue bureaucratic meddling in private business. Miti denied it intended to influence business organisations and explained the document was meant primarily for internal use. However, the document was sent on Miti's initiative and not at the request of the business organisations involved. 'We read the newspapers so we knew more or less what would be in the economic package,' a representative of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said. 'We felt that was the way Miti wanted us to evaluate the package.'</p>

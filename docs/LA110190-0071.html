			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL GAMBLING IS A BONANZA FOR DEADWOOD  </P> <P> The take has surpassed everyone's expectations in the year since slot machines  and card games became legal in this Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was  gunned down in an 1876 poker game.  </P> <P> Actors dressed as Hickok and Calamity Jane will fire guns on Main Street at  noon today to celebrate the first anniversary.  </P> <P> A statewide vote in 1988 amended the South Dakota Constitution to authorize  gambling in Deadwood. The Legislature limited bets to $5.  </P> <P> State and city officials had estimated that Deadwood's share of gambling taxes  and license fees would provide the city with about $500,000 a year to restore  aging buildings. But the city has received $6.2 million as its cut of the first  year's action.  </P> <P> Gambling taxes have also contributed nearly $786,000 to the state and more than  $196,000 to Lawrence County.  </P> <P> During the first 11 months, players wagered more than $253 million and about 75  gaming houses were licensed. Don Gromer, executive secretary of the state  Gaming Commission, said officials had expected only about 20 gaming halls.  </P> <P> The gambling industry has created about 1,400 jobs in Deadwood. Industry  executives estimate that casinos have already spent more than $30 million to  renovate historic downtown structures.  </P> <P> Success has had its price, however.  </P> <P> State and city officials have scrambled to keep tabs on the rapid growth, which  has strained water and sewer systems in the narrow city built in a canyon.  Retail stores have nearly disappeared from Main Street as buildings have been  converted into a long stretch of casinos to handle crowds of gamblers.  </P> <P> Success has also brought a faster-paced lifestyle to what was a quiet,  uncrowded town.  </P> <P> Mayor Bruce Oberlander said many people are upset that it is no longer easy to  find motel rooms, parking spots and uncrowded bars when they visit Deadwood.  But they do not realize that the businesses were struggling to survive before  gambling, he said.  </P> <P> Franklin Hotel owner Bill Walsh said people who mourn the loss of the old  Deadwood are holding a wake for the wrong corpse. The city's best period was  the boom times of the frontier or the early years of this century, not the  recent years.  </P></p>

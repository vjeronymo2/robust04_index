			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / De Klerk attacked on failure to act after siege SOUTH AFRICAN president FW de Klerk faced mounting criticism last night after he failed to fulfil a promise to act swiftly against rightwing groups which staged an armed siege of constitutional negotiations last Friday. Mr de Klerk had promised arrests within 24 hours of the attack, in which some of the country's leading politicians were chased through the corridors of the constitutional conference centre by armed men from the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement). The excuse given by police for failing to make the promised arrests - that suspects had given them false names - was dismissed as ridiculous by Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. He pointed out that the attack was openly led by well-known politicians such as Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the rightwing Conservative party and head of the official parliamentary opposition, along with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the AWB leader, and General Constand Viljoen, head of the Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella rightwing group. Mr de Klerk had promised to arrest these men, but last night they remained at liberty. Constitutional talks were scheduled to continue this week despite the attack, with Afrikaner self-determination - the issue which Friday's protest was meant to promote - at the top of the agenda. However, progress in the talks has clearly been delayed by the attack. Mr Mandela said on Saturday, as he left for a visit to the US, that he would not call as planned for international sanctions against South Africa to be lifted. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom party leader, stressed in response to the attack that the fears of white South Africans could be 'terribly destructive' and should be taken seriously. His party, which is in alliance with the Conservative party within the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag), has been severely criticised for siding with the racist right.</p>

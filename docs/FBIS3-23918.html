			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Belotserkovskiy: "Shameful Solidarity: </F> When Politicians Are Incapable of Defending Their Own People"]    [Text] Munich--The unity of almost all factions of the  State Duma and the executive authorities on the Serbia question  is the most shameful disgrace. For it is clear to even the least  informed (it is clear even to Zhirinovskiy, I am sure) that the  Serbs are the aggressors and the main culprits of the orgy of  brutality in the former Yugoslavia. More than merely beginning  to tear away Serbian enclaves from Croatia and Bosnia (and  wanting prior to this to compel by force even Slovenia to remain  part of Yugoslavia), they captured entirely foreign territories,  expelling from and driving out of them the indigenous population  with the aid of terror and violence--a practice and crime wholly  monstrous at the end of the 20th century, in Europe, what is  more, at the center of Christian civilization! All this is as  clear as two times two is four. Yes, brutalities are being  perpetrated there now by all sides, and there is no  justification for this, but it was Serbia's aggression that  started it, and it alone can end it, having ceased the  aggression and having returned the captured territories, wholly  foreign territories--in which Serbs do not live--at least. And  it is further clear to everyone that this aggression was begun  and continues in accordance with the wishes and under the  leadership of the nomenklatura communists, who still hold sway  in Serbia, and that they are doing this to hold on to power,  distract attention, and appear as patriots of a Greater Serbia.  And to whom if not us former Soviet people should their behavior  be very understandable, we, of all people, should know of what  demagogy and brutality communists are capable for the sake of  power. Finally, it is clear also that the European countries  should long ago have intervened and stopped this medieval war,  just as it is clear that it cannot be stopped by political  measures alone, without the use of military force or the decided  intention of its use. And it is a disgrace that the NATO  countries have not yet done this. Compare this with Kuwait! If  there were oil in Bosnia and Croatia, all would have been ended  a long time ago. But flowing there, instead of oil, is merely  blood, which is not quoted on the world market. The democratic  community of the West considers the incapacity of its  authorities to halt the orgy of cannibalism at the heart of  Europe the breakup, virtually, of Western civilization,  capitalist civilization, I am sorry to say. And only the Russian  political elite, which is represented in all branches of power,  thinks otherwise, more precisely, pretends to think otherwise,  and wants once again to put Russia in a position in opposition  to the world's democratic community.    The profound immorality of Russia's politicians, who for the  sake of gaining political dividends within Russia are prepared  to hamper the efforts to finally halt the bloodshed and violence  in Bosnia, can be seen behind this position. Is not the shelling  from guns at Bosnian cities, in which peaceful people, old men,  women, and children, are dying, reminiscent of the shelling of  the White House, in which there were women and children also?  But the deputies of the Federal Assembly are not demanding an  investigation or trial of those guilty of shelling the House of  Soviets. They are demanding (of the Foreign Ministry) protection  of Serbia's "Special Militia" against possible strikes, which is  far easier and safer (for the deputies). We should, generally,  clearly understand the cause of the clamorous attempts of all  branches of power to protect the "Slav brothers" in the Balkans  (as though Bosnians and Croats are not Slavs!) or the Russian  speakers in the Baltic. They are caused by the fact that the  authorities are incapable of protecting Russians in Russia!  Incapable of protecting them against gangsters and hired  killers, incapable of changing the situation engendering a  tumultuous growth of crime, incapable of protecting people dying  from the lack or cost of medicinal drugs and inadequate medical  assistance and on account of the scant diet and polluted  environment, and incapable of protecting them against state and  mafia robbery. But let us imagine: Inflation has been halted,  prices are headed down, production is up, housing is being built  once again, crime is being suppressed. Zhirinovskiy, of course,  would be shaking his fist even here (what else could he do?),  but the majority of deputies and leaders of the executive would  not for anything be going against the Western governments in  their attempts to halt the war in Bosnia. They would have no  need to earn political capital from dubious protection outside  of Russia or to kindle hysteria over the dubious violation of  the rights of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic  (which is not comparable to what is being done against Russians  in some southern republics of the CIS, where, however, Russian  troops are protecting the local authorities against the  opposition!). Just as there would be no need either to conduct  ethnic purges in Moscow and Petersburg in order if only in this  way to attempt to win sympathy among the most embittered and  unethical people. But in defending the interests of the  nomenklatura, the majority of members of the executive and the  legislature cannot defend the interests of the people. The two  are incompatible. It is necessary to deprive of power and  ownership (of the means of production) either the nomenklatura  or the people. The "democrats" are defending the interests  chiefly of the new and center nomenklatura, the "communists,"  the old and peripheral nomenklatura, and the "national  patriots," both and, particularly, the interests of the  nomenklatura of the power departments. Under these conditions,  how could they all not defend the interests of the Serbs in  Bosnia?    More precisely, rattle the air in their defense or not  approach the hot line with Washington.    The world is now anxiously conjecturing whether fascism is  possible in Russia. The appearance of the majority of  politicians in Russia in the wake of Zhirinovskiy against an  ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia indicates that it is possible.  An atmosphere of immorality and cynicism is the vital  environment of any fascism and an essential condition. The  unimpeded and endless decline in the living standard of the  majority of the population is a complementary condition.    P.S. When I had already completed this article, there came  the report of a statement of Churkin, deputy minister of foreign  affairs, whom this report called the personal representative of  the president (!), to the effect that the Western governments  were misinterpreting the latest UN resolution giving its  secretary general the right to sanction the use of military  force in Bosnia without Security Council confirmation. No,  Churkin declared, the Security Council must on each occasion  confirm such a sanction. Thus Churkin, as the personal  representative of the president, has, aside from anything else,  disavowed the statement of Vorontsov, ambassador of Russia at  the United Nations, who had declared earlier that the secretary  general was "absolutely right" and that Security Council  confirmation was not required. Together with everyone else, the  Russian delegation at the United Nations voted for the  above-mentioned resolution, but after Mr. Zhirinovskiy had  scored a success at the elections, the authorities fouled their  pants somewhat and in an endeavor to keep up with Zhirinovskiy  and the other national patriots in Slav solidarity are  renouncing their vote at the United Nations, going back on their  own word. The former nomenklatura communists and their retinue  are showing the world what the rules of the game mean for them  when they are to their disadvantage. All that is useful for the  cause of the proletariat is moral. All that is useful for the  cause of the nomenklatura, the president, and the government is  competent.</p>

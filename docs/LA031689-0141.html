			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST VALLEY SCHOOLS PULL APPLES FROM MENU AFTER CANCER SCARE  </P> <P> Most San Gabriel Valley students are not eating apples at school this week  because food services directors said publicity about safety has caused them to  yank the fruit from menus.  </P> <P> "Publicity has really done apples in," said Marilyn Wells of the Alhambra City  and High School Districts. "The children are saying, 'We are not supposed to  eat apples because they are bad.'  </P> <P> "There has been so much publicity that it is not feasible for us to serve them  until we have further information from the state Department of Education," she  said. The high school district serves Alhambra, San Gabriel and parts of  Monterey Park and Rosemead. The district's elementary schools are in Alhambra  and Monterey Park.  </P> <P> Other districts no longer serving apples include Mountain View, Temple City,  Arcadia, Azusa, Charter Oak (which serves Glendora and Covina), Covina-Valley,  Duarte, Hacienda La Puente, Monrovia, Pomona, Rowland, South Pasadena, and West  Covina unified school districts; the El Monte Union High School District, and  the Garvey, Rosemead and San Gabriel school districts.  </P> <P> Several districts, including Pasadena, Claremont and El Monte City, are still  serving apples. Baldwin Park Unified School District officials plan to use the  supply on hand and then stop offering them. San Marino school officials say  they plan to resume offering apples soon.  </P> <P> Concern about apples has grown in light of a national study that found children  at an "intolerable risk" of cancer from pesticide residues on fruits and  vegetables. The Washington-based National Resources Defense Council reported  last month that the pesticide daminozide, which is sold under the brand name  Alar, could increase the incidence of cancer in children. Applied chiefly to  apples, it slows the ripening process and improves appearance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bans in L.A. and New York City  </P> <P> The nation's two largest districts, Los Angeles Unified and New York City, have  banned the use of apples.  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley's largest school district, Hacienda La Puente Unified,  served the last of its U.S. Department of Agriculture surplus apples on Tuesday  because they had not been treated with Alar, said Peggy Reible. She said no  more servings are scheduled this month.  </P> <P> Reible and other food services directors hope that the state will be able to  clarify the issue at a conference of the California School Food Service Assn.,  which begins in Oakland on Friday.  </P> <P> She also pointed out that school menus are sent to every home so that parents  know whether apples will be served. Most districts said they had received only  a few inquiries from parents.  </P> <P> The San Marino Unified School District stopped serving apples for three days  but will put them back on the menu soon, said Robert Thompson, assistant  superintendent for business.  </P> <P> "We had withdrawn the product out of concern for the health of our students,"  he said. "But we have been assured by our suppliers that they do not use Alar."  The Pasadena Unified School District is still serving apples after receiving  letters from suppliers used by the district that the apples have not been  treated with Alar, said Henrietta De'Ora.  </P> <P> "There is always a choice of fruit so the children don't have to eat apples,"  she said.  </P> <P> The Baldwin Park Unified School District is still serving USDA apples but will  not purchase any more until notified by the state that there is no problem,  officials said.  </P> <P> The Claremont Unified School District has not yet made a decision, said Mary  Polster, but will provide an alternative fruit.  </P> <P> "We are trying not to panic but there has been so much media hype," she said.  "Some of the little kids are saying, 'Apples are poisoned,' so the kids  probably will bypass the apples."  </P> <P> Apples are not on the menu this week in the Azusa Unified School District and  spring vacation is next week so the situation is on hold, said Sandy Perrin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Apples on Menu  </P> <P> "I don't see a problem, and it has been blown out of proportion, but it becomes  a problem when parents read these things," Perrin said. "So to be safe we are  not serving them until we get word from the state."  </P> <P> In the Arcadia Unified School District, some junior high school students have  refused to take apples, said Debra Amos, who stopped serving them on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bonita Unified School District officials got lucky when they discovered that  there were no apples on the March menu. The district doesn't serve apple juice,  and apple sauce is not scheduled until the last day in March. They hope by that  time a decision won't be necessary, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Some districts that have dropped apples are continuing to serve apple juice and  apple sauce because they have letters from their suppliers attesting that no  Alar was used.  </P> <P> The Bassett and Walnut Valley Unified school districts could not be reached for  comment.  </P></p>

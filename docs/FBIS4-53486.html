			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on  Tuesday called upon the nation's scientists and science-related  officials to redouble efforts to further develop science and  technology.    While presiding over a meeting of the State Advisory Council  for science and technology at Chongwadae [presidential office],  President Kim emphasized the need of using available science  resources most effectively because he said such resources are  limited in the country compared with advanced countries. The  meeting was called to observe the first anniversary of the  advisory council.    The president also asked for the resolute removal of what  stand in the way to the nation's internationalization.    "The extent of our internationalization ranks 11th among  developing countries, undermining our efforts to enhance the  country's international competitiveness," Kim said. Following  the meeting, President Kim hosted a luncheon at Chongwadae for  the advisory council members led by chairman Yi Sang-ui.</p>

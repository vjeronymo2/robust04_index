In principle this jump can be considered insignificant in  percentage terms. However, it is of special note that the  demand for hard currency 5 January reached a record level for  the entire existence of the exchange - initial applications to  buy stood at $182,850,000, but the final volume of transactions  was recorded at a level of $180,550,000. Thus are we witnessing  a new flurry of heavy demand on the currencies market, with  attendant consequences for the ruble?    I think that to draw such a conclusion would be premature.  It is entirely possible that the record volume of hard currency  trading could be caused by the factor of delayed demand -- after  all, the exchange had not operated for almost a week. On the  other hand, the influence of another factor on the change in the  situation on the currencies market is being viewed extremely  seriously by specialists.    It is well known that an instruction from the Central Bank  of  Russia banning the sale of goods and services for foreign cash  anywhere on the country's territory came into force at the  beginning of the year. And many trade firms -- and also  wholesalers supplying goods from abroad -- will be forced right  from the first days of the new year to convert their ruble  proceeds via the exchange so as to settle with foreign suppliers  and maintain trade turnover at its previous level. This should  objectively lead to an increase in the demand for hard currency  and to a growth in the daily levels of exchange dealing.    Incidentally, here it is worth noting the formerly  unheard-of  law-abiding behavior of Russian businesmen, since the  overwhelming majority of hard currency stores refused to accept  foreign cash after 1 January. Well, if anyone refuses to accept  the rubles of Russian citizens anywhere, V. Smirnov, deputy  chief of the Central Bank of Russia's Main Administration for  Currency Regulation and Currency Control stated, the bank calls  on such citizens to inform it about such incidents, and the most  decisive measures will be adopted.    However, so that misunderstandings should not arise, let me  point out that the Central Bank's instruction banning hard  currency trade has some exceptions. They regard stores situated  in the extraterritorial zone, that is to say, after you have  been through customs, or, say, foreign airlines selling tickets  on Russian territory.    All the same, discrimination against the Russian ruble can  now be considered to have been eradicated in principle in our  country. But here the question naturally arises: What is there  to balance the increase in the supply of rubles from trading  organizations on the currencies market, so that the exchange  rate of Russian money should not fall even lower?    Only the more active sale of foreign currency by Russian  citizens could be such a counterweight; according to  specialists' estimates, the public have already accumulated  several billion dollars' worth. But such a change in behavior  patterns cannot, unfortunately, be observed at the moment.    At any rate, in the words of S. Stolyarova, chief of the  "Rossiyskiy Kredit" bank's department of exchange outlets, at  the end of last year their volume of sales of hard currency to  the public reached a near-record level. And in the first  two-three days of the new year the trend has not changed.    Nevertheless, it can be hoped that the situation will change  markedly in two-three weeks' time, when the majority of  customers of former currency stores will be forced to begin  exchanging their dollars or German Marks for rubles. After all,  they will not want to give up frequenting expensive stores and  restaurants, and foreign cash will not be accepted in these  places.    However, there is no doubt that a radical change in the  behavior patterns of Russian citizens with regard to foreign  currency will occur only when the dollar ceases to be a means of  accumulation and when inflation falls to a level covered by  interest rates on bank deposits. In this sense December has  aroused in us real hopes; after all, inflation was at its lowest  for the whole of the past year -- only 12 percent per month.</p>

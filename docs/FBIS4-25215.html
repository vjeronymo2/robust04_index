			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Leaders Urge Talks to Solve Nuke Crisis"] </F>   [Text] Talks between top Chinese leaders and the visiting  Maltese Premier Edward Fenech Adami yesterday in Beijing focused  on the strengthening of ties and the sharing of views about the  nuclear issue in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK).    China and Malta enjoy close bilateral ties and the prospect  of such ties are bright, President Jiang Zemin told Fenech Adami.    Shortly before the meeting of the two top leaders, Chinese  Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with  his Maltese counterpart Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Guido  De Marco at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.    Qian told De Marco that China opposes resorting to sanctions  in the nuclear inspection issue of the DPRK.    He said that, China has not changed its position of solving  the problem through negotiations among the four parties  involved: DPRK, the Republic of Korea, the United States and  the International Atomic Energy Agency.    "Sanctions are not a sensible choice, as they would only  aggravate the crisis," Qian noted.    He added that China holds that efforts should be made to  maintain peace and stability and achieve denuclearization on the  Korean Peninsula.    Qian expressed his support for Malta's application to join  the European Union as a member of the European family.    He also said that, compared with Europe, the Asia-Pacific  region has felt less impact from the ending of the Cold War.    De Marco agreed with Qian on the need to settle  international  disputes, including the Korean issue, through peaceful talks.    He said his country believes that China, as a permanent  member of the United Nations Security Council, can perform a  substantial role in the international community and the  Asia-Pacific region in particular.    It was China that first proposed the establishment of a new  global political and economical order, De Marco said, adding  that Malta also regards it as a very important issue.    During the meeting between President Jiang and Premier Adami  later at Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Chinese government,  the Maltese leader was told that his visit will help to bring  mutual relations to a new high.    Productive results have been achieved since diplomatic  relations were built up between the two countries in 1972, Jiang  said.    The reciprocal visits of both countries' top leaders have  reinforced the friendly link between the two countries, Jiang  said. He added that mutual economic and trade co-operations so  far are also fruitful.    "We are Working together to seek new frontiers of further  collaboration in economy and trade," Jiang told Adami.    Past experience has proved, Jiang stressed, that both big  and  small countries, regardless of their differences in social  systems, can co-exist peacefully and co-operate beneficially on  the basis of mutual respect.</p>

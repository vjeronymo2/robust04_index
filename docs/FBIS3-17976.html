Its results were determined last  night. The first question was: Are you in favor of renewing the  provision in the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea dated 6  May 1992, which defines the regulation of relations between the  Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of agreements and  treaties? This question was answered in the affirmative by 78.4  percent of the people. Dual citizenship was backed by 82.8  percent of those polled. Around 80 percent of Crimea's  population believe that the Crimean president's directives on  the issues, that are temporarily not settled by the Republic of  Crimea's legislation, should be granted the status of laws.    Over 1 million Crimeans took part in the plebiscite.</p>

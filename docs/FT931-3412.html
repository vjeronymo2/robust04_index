			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pfizer wins ruling on heart valve case review PFIZER, one of the fastest-growing US pharmaceutical companies, has won a favourable ruling in a California Supreme Court regarding litigation over the company's Shiley heart valve. The company had petitioned the court to ask the Court of Appeal to review two cases which would allow out-of-state recipients of the Shiley valve to file lawsuits in California. The Supreme Court granted Pfizer's petition, paving the way for the decision to be re-examined. The California decision is important for Pfizer because California courts are believed to be more supportive of consumers than other courts. Pfizer has been trying to keep the Shiley litigation out of California, especially for patients who do not reside in the state. The earlier court decision ruled that foreign valve recipients did not have the same constitutional rights as US citizens to sue in California. About 50,000 people have received the heart valves made by Pfizer's California unit. Pfizer, which has been trying to put the Shiley litigation to rest for several years, last year filed a comprehensive plan in a Cincinnati court, including a Dollars 215m class action settlement and an additional Dollars 300m in reserves to settle fracture claims. The plan was accepted by the court but in Pennsylvania is awaiting a federal appeals court review. Smith Corona, the US maker of portable typewriters, has predicted a substantial decline in third-quarter earnings. The company, 48 per cent owned by the Hanson group of the UK, blamed lacklustre economic recovery in the US and recession in Europe for its disappointing outlook. Although the company expects a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings, it expects to remain in the black. In last year's third quarter to March 31, Smith Corona earned Dollars 4.9m, or 16 cents a share.</p>

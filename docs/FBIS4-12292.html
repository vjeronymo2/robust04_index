			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elias Tohme] </F>   [Text] Damascus, April 6 (AFP)--President Hafiz al-Asad has  criticised the United States for bowing to Israeli pressure in  the Middle East peace process, a Syrian official said Wednesday.    Al-Asad accused US President Bill Clinton of going back on  what was agreed during their summit in Geneva on January 16, the  official said, asking not to be named.    "The Geneva summit brought us hope that we could advance the  peace process," he said.    "But nothing has been done because of Israeli intransigence  and the Zionist lobby which is preventing the United States from  playing an effective role," he added.    Al-Asad voiced the criticism during a meeting with Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak in Cairo on Tuesday, warning the peace  process was in crisis "because of irresponsible Israeli  positions," the official said.    After the talks Mubarak called on all parties in the stalled  Arab-Israeli talks to "show flexibility" and said he hoped the  negotiations would resume at the end of April in Washington.    Syria maintains there has been no progress following talks  between Syrian and Israeli leaders in January and February in  Washington because the United States did not put any pressure on  Israel.    A foreign ministry spokesman said: "Syria committed itself  to the peace process in the hope that the US administration  would keep to its promises and play its role as an honest  partner.    "But that role has never been put into action on the  ground,"  he said, adding Syria would not give into blackmail.    Damascus has accused Washington of blackmailing it by  refusing to remove Syria from a list of countries known to be  sources for drug- traffickers.    Damascus said it had made considerable efforts to end drug-  trafficking, particularly in Lebanon's al-Biqa' valley, but the  US decision means Syria will be unable to receive certain aid  handouts.    Meanwhile, in Washington senior Israeli Labor Party official  Nissim Zvili said the US administration backed Syria's call for  a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.    "They (the United States) completely support Syria on the  sovereignty issue. It is not easy for us," he said, adding  Israel was not ready to trade the plateau for peace.    President Bill Clinton's administration has sought to  mediate  differences between the two sides over the strategic land seized  by Israel in the Middle East war in 1967.</p>

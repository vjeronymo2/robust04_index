			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ivanov: "Mayor's Office Removes Traders </F> From the Streets"]    [Text] Order is being brought to Moscow street  trading.    The Moscow authorities have decided to put a complete  stop to any unorganized street trading, to limit the activity of  commercial kiosks, and to concentrate all trade at flea markets.  This is the essence of the city government decree "On Additional  Measures To Regulate Free (Street) Trading and Organize Flea  Markets in Moscow" which was issued yesterday for official  distribution.    The decisiveness of the Moscow Government in its struggle  against street trading is easy to explain. As Moscow officials  have been constantly emphasizing, unorganized trade brings  practically no revenue into the budget of Moscow, while  seriously hurting the city's image. It goes without saying that  a certain competitiveness between the leaders of Moscow and St.  Petersburg also played a part here: Comparatively recently,  Anatoliy Sobchak issued orders "On Regulating Small-Scale Street  Trading" (KOMMERSANT wrote about this this month) which  contained draconian measures on limiting street trading. Thus,  one can observe a certain shift in tendency in the economic  policies of the mayor's offices of the two major cities:  Previously the authorities tried to illustrate their market  economy orientation by encouraging free trade in the streets,  but now they are trying to strengthen administrative control  over all, even the most insignificant, traders and to remove  them from the streets altogether, if possible.    According to the new decree of the Moscow Government, any  unorganized sales done by hand, from stands, carts, or cars have  to be discontinued. Moreover, the authorities intend to cut down  considerably on the number of commercial kiosks and stalls and  to suspend their right to trade in manufactured goods and  foodstuffs. They will only be allowed to sell soft drinks,  cigarettes, fruits, souvenirs, flowers, and newspapers (in other  words, the same goods they used to sell in Soviet times).    The document emphasizes once again an idea that has in a way  become traditional for the Moscow authorities: Concentration of  all trading at large wholesale and flea markets around Moscow,  as well as at small flea markets in all municipal districts. The  administrative district prefects are requested to improve the  performance of the 70 already functioning municipal markets in  Moscow. The decree demands that the GUVD [Main Administration of  Internal Affairs] improve the efficiency of the militia's work  at markets and periodically replace assigned militiamen. At the  same time, the government sets the task of opening eight new  flea markets in 1994. It may be interesting to mention that, for  the first time in the practice of the Moscow authorities, the  decree sets specific provisional rules for organizing flea  market trading: According to the document, admission to the  market should be free of charge and retail stands are to be  provided for a fee to all citizens without exception.    In order to stimulate the emergence of flea markets, the  decree provides for the extension of lease terms for plots of  land utilized for organized sales. Besides, it plans to use the  plots that were previously earmarked for building storage  facilities to set up wholesale markets. Finally, it was also  decided to open additional bus routes to bring traders to the  markets at special commercial rates.

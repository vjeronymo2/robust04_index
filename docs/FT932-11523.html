			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Banks remain the key to staying afloat: An end to recession may be a poisoned chalice for small and medium-sized companies. Charles Batchelor assesses their chances THE BANKS, as ever, hold the key to the survival of small and medium-sized businesses. Larger companies have access to the stock market and the international capital markets, but smaller companies are disproportionately dependent on borrowings and retained profits. The banks have an estimated Pounds 40bn on loan to business and, having taken losses on their small-business books, have tightened lending criteria. Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, warned last week that borrowing costs could rise for businesses both large and small. But the banks say there will not be a shortage of funds. Mr Mike Shaw, head of business services at Lloyds Bank, said: 'We don't have a problem with the availability of funds and could double our lending if the right proposals came along.' Mr David Laverack, head of small-business services at Barclays, said: 'We have significant capacity to lend.' National Westminster, the largest lender to small businesses, stressed that access to finance ranked only eighth in the table of concerns in the recent NatWest-Small Business Research Trust survey. Mr Terry Bryant, deputy head of small-business services at the bank, said: 'There is less of an appetite for borrowings and the indications are that people prefer to use their own savings.' Businesses are having to put together more convincing business plans to obtain bank finance. The banks have also shifted the emphasis of lending decisions from a reliance on security to prospective performance. There are some signs that the banks are more willing to provide equity finance alongside loans. Mr Michael Pearse, chief executive of Midland, urged recently that banks should be more ready to swap debt into equity - not as a last resort but also to help sound businesses put their finances on a more balanced basis. In 1982-84, when Britain last came out of recession, the venture capital industry was very small and still dominated by one large operator - 3i. Now it numbers between 100 and 120 venture funds which invested Pounds 1.4bn last year. Worryingly, though, the venture capital industry is concerned about the availability of finance. Independent venture capital concerns, which account for just less than half of all the sector's investments, raised only Pounds 300m from institutional investors last year - the third successive annual decline. Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture Capital Association, said: 'I did think we might run into a shortage of finance in the late 1990s but the industry is using up its cash faster than I anticipated and we could face a squeeze in the next 12 to 18 months.' The factoring industry appears to face no such financing constraints. It too expanded rapidly in the late 1980s and overcame much of the prejudice - that it was last-resort finance for businesses in trouble - which dogged its early days. It provided more than Pounds 1.3bn to more than 9,000 companies last year. Mr Malcolm Smith, managing director of Alex Lawrie, one of Lloyds Bank's two factoring subsidiaries, said: 'There is no problem from the funding point of view.' Mr Mike Davis, managing director of Barclays Commercial Services, the bank's factoring subsidiary, said: 'Companies which come through the recession with weakened balance sheets will not be able to go to sources of conventional (bank) finance. This is an opportunity for us to provide finance until the customer's balance sheet is strong enough for it to go back to the bank.'</p>

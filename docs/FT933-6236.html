			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Fashion: Picked to be perfectly packed - Forget those struggles with big suitcases. Avril Groom knows how to travel with the minimum fuss and luggage THE PERFECT holiday traveller is a magician. She arrives without fuss carrying one small suitcase from which she apparently pulls an endless stream of clothes so that she looks elegantly and appropriately dressed on every occasion. You do not believe she exists? Then read on and find out how anyone can turn themselves into her. It may not all be done with mirrors but it is a matter of illusion. This paragon knows how to get a gallon of clothes into a pint-sized bag. The secret, of course, is interchangeability based on a narrow range of colours, giving the maximum number of permutations from a limited number of pieces. The successful packer knows that the easiest colour combinations around which to work are neutrals because they all go with each other and you need only a few accessories to go with all of them. The black, white and cream combination chosen for the wardrobe on this page is ideal. She also knows that clothes pack more tightly and emerge less creased when rolled rather than folded, and that anything which will not fit into the largest acceptable aircraft cabin bag (55cm x 24cm x 31cm according to Louis Vuitton, which makes one) is not worth taking. This applies just as much to two as one week holidays; the laundry bills or, for the parsimonious, a few minutes' washing, are minor inconveniences compared with lugging a larger suitcase. If a short-notice invitation to the south of France arrives just when she thinks her summer is over, the perfect holidaymaker will already know (as the FT photographic team discovered) that an easy way to get there is with Air UK from Stansted, which has a speedy check-in to help you go from central London to your hotel in the Nice area in about 3 1/2 hours. She will also know exactly where to go to replenish her holiday wardrobe in the dog days of summer when many stores have already decreed that autumn has arrived. As efficient a shopper as she is a traveller, she will home in on Whistles, Jaeger, Ronit Zilkha, Dorothy Perkins, Jeffrey Rogers and The Hot Shop at Harrods and top House of Fraser stores, all of which are joining the trend for an extra 'transition' collection of high-summer separates to fill in the awkward period between ever-earlier sales and serious autumn arrivals. Some fabrics such as the textured viscose which Ghost use year-round, are non-seasonal, and smaller-scale designers who work to order, such as Amanda Wakeley, keep their summer styles going longer. If she has more notice, the traveller may order one of the pale silk dresses, pyjama-style trousers, waistcoats or loose shirts re-created from original 1920s patterns by the Gallery of Antique Costumes and Textiles. These take about two weeks to make and are available all year round, so the really organised are ordering now for their winter holidays. The ideal holidaymaker's glory is that she is the perfect guest, with the appropriate outfit for whatever she is invited to do, although even she would probably not make so many changes in one day as we show here. Coupled with all the extra combinations that these pieces make, this wardrobe should supply enough fresh looks for a week's warm-climate holiday. Each item can be used in several different ways. Both pairs of shorts go with each swimsuit and the striped body. The swimsuits themselves can also be used as bodies, while the velour robe, minus its belt, doubles as a grand evening coat. The fitted linen shirt-jacket adds a touch of formality to the longline shorts, the silk dress or the crushed silk skirt, while the loose linen shirt gives these same pieces, or the black trousers, a more relaxed mood. It is also useful as a beach cover-up, as is the printed georgette shirt which, worn loose with the trousers, makes an informal evening outfit. The silk skirt dresses down when worn plainly with a body or swimsuit but looks more evening-style with a scarf and the crepe top, which also goes with the trousers. The crepe skirt looks slim and sophisticated with a body while the cream knit looks good with everything, especially the silk dress, for cooler days. Subtract from these clothes one non-crush outfit to travel in - perhaps the black trousers, the body and the knit - and add the jewellery we show, a roll-up hat, three pairs of shoes (deck-shoes, espadrilles and smart sandals), a nightdress and a modicum of lingerie and you should still have room in that hypothetical bag for an extra top and a sarong. The only piece of poetic licence is, perhaps, the robe. Carry it over your arm - it could be useful on the aircraft. As you are also allowed a handbag, take advantage of a large, squashy style to hold your toilet bag, suncream, sunglasses, paperbacks, tickets, money, passport and embroidery or other anti-delay device. And as you stroll calmly through the most crowded and frenetic of airport lounges, no-one will know that, as perfect travellers go, you are merely a novice.</p>

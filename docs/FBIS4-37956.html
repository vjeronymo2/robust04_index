			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Two civilians were  killed and two wounded as Katyusha rockets slammed into a  northern suburb of Aden late Sunday [26 June], hospital workers  said, bringing the day's toll to 18 dead and 114 wounded.    Northern troops fired six Katyusha rockets which exploded in  the Khormaksar suburb near the airport.    The dead and wounded were taken to Aden's main Al-Jumhuriyah  hospital, which admitted a total of 14 dead civilians and 94  wounded during the day.    Bombardments also continued in the evening at frontlines  around this southern stronghold, and at the Hiswah power station  and Aden Radio station occupied by northern forces on Saturday.    Earlier four children were killed and 20 people wounded by  Katyusha rockets in the Tawahi district near the port, workers  at the Basahib military hospital said.    One rocket destroyed a house and another exploded near a  school where refugee families were sheltering.    An earlier toll from hospital workers said 16 civilians were  killed and 74 wounded as northern Yemeni troops advanced into  the western suburbs of Aden.    Hospital workers said dead and wounded southern soldiers  were  admitted during fighting at the Hiswah power station and Aden  Radio station about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the city  centre.    At least 409 people have been killed and nearly 1,000  wounded  in the bombardment of Aden and fighting near the city centre  since June 11, according to AFP figures based on hospital and  official sources in the south.    War broke out between northern troops loyal to President  'Ali  Abdallah Salih and those of his southern rival Ali Salim al-Bid  on May 5.</p>

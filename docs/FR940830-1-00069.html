			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the completed RI/FS, the ROD was issued on May 28, 1991, and EPA successfully negotiated a Consent Decree (lodged February 25, 1992, entered April 23, 1992, Case Number 3&hyph;92&hyph;CV&hyph;10028 in the United States District Court, Southern District of Iowa, Davenport Division) for Remedial Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA) activities with DuPont. DuPont completed the RA at the Site in September 1993. As required by the ROD, the RA included: (1) All surface waste materials not amenable to the selected technology, such as metal, grinding balls, and paint cans, were to be removed and disposed at an off-site RCRA-permitted hazardous waste landfill prior to stabilization/ solidification, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Construction of an on-site waste disposal cell, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Stabilization/solidification of contaminated soils and placement in the on-site disposal cell, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Construction of a soil cap over the disposal cell. Restrictions on the future use and development of the Site were included to ensure the integrity of the cover and the underlying, solidified soil mass and to prevent human contact with treated soils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA in consultation with the State of Iowa, has determined that all fund-financed response activities under CERCLA at the Dupont County Road X23 Site, Lee County, Iowa have been completed, and that no further response is necessary. Therefore, it is proposed that the Site be deleted from the NPL. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Dennis Grams, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Regional Administrator, Region 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21366 Filed 8&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

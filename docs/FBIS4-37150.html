			<p>BFN     [Text] Marwan Kanafani, adviser to the Palestinian  president, has said that reports on 'Arafat's visit to Gaza and  Jericho are untrue. He said the Palestinian president will  announce his final return to embrace his people day and night  after he and the Palestinian leadership have completed the  necessary organizational, administrative, and financial measures  for a final return and for beginning the construction of the  homeland, as he put it.    Earlier, Palestinian and diplomatic sources said that  'Arafat  would pay a short visit to the autonomous areas over the next  seven days. However, Kanafani did not decisively rule out the  idea that 'Arafat might visit the autonomous areas before his  final return.</p>

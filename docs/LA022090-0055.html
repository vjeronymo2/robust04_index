			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Anderson Returns: Legendary actress Dame Judith Anderson, 93, returned to the  stage Sunday night, giving an emotional and rare performance to benefit the  140-seat Ensemble Theatre in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "I must say I'm always nervous before a performance, but especially tonight,"  said Anderson, who has made only rare stage appearances since retiring more  than 20 years ago. "Here I thought I'd read a little 'Macbeth' and 'Hamlet' and  it wouldn't be so bad. But oh, dear, it is." The Tony and Emmy award-winning  actress performed for more than an hour.

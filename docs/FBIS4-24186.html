			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 25 June (PANA) -- A Nigerian federal high  court in Lagos on Friday [24 June] ordered the Nigerian police  to produce detained millionaire politician, Moshood Abiola on  Thursday. [sentence as received]    The order by Justice Tajudeen Odunowo on the police  inspector-general, Ibrahim Coomassie, followed an application by  lawyer Kolawole Ajayi on behalf of Abiola.    The judge fixed hearing on the application on the same day,  Thursday, after he rejected Ajayi's plea to discharge Abiola  from police custody.    Another Lagos federal high court is expected Monday to begin  hearing yet another suit by Abiola challenging his arrest and  detention on 23 June.    The suit was filed by Lagos lawyer, Gani Fawehinhmi, who  told  the court that Abiola's arrest was unconstitutional and a breach  of his fundamental human rights.    Pro-democracy groups in Nigeria, including the National  Democratic Coalition and the Campaign for Democracy, which are  leading the campaign for the military to surrender power to  Abiola, have protested the arrest of the millionaire, who  claimed victory in Nigeria's 12 June 1993 election, which was  annulled by the country's military.    Meanwhile, there were indications that Abiola, who  reportedly  proclaimed himself president of Nigeria on 11 June, could go on  trial either in Lagos or Abuja, next week.    But in an interview with PANA on Saturday, the deputy  inspector- general of police operations, Nuhu Aliyu, declined to  confirm the report, but said that the police were trying to  ensure law and order throughout the country.    Aliyu said the police would tighten security against those  he  called "paid thugs," who may try to cause a breach of public  peace.    Apart from reported scattered protests in Lagos, especially  in Ikeja, near Abiola's residence, north of Lagos, on Thursday  and Friday, no major incidents were reported in the country.</p>

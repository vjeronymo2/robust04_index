			<p>BFN     [Text] A high-level source in the multiethnic army of Chang  Sifu or "Khun Sa" denied a report on the recapture of several  towns on the western bank of the Salween River by Rangoon  government troops.    The source confirmed that Khun Sa's soldiers are still in  full control of all strongholds, noting that the report on the  recapture of towns from Khun Sa's army was merely propaganda  from the Burmese Government. He admitted that goverment troops  are present in the region, but they have not yet launched any  offensive against Khun Sa's positions.    Both the government's side and Khun Sa's army suffered heavy  casualties in the fighting, which broke out opposite Lak Taeng  village of Wiang Haeng District, Chiang Mai Province, since 7  May. It was reported that the Burmese Government has recaptured  eight strongholds earlier taken over by Khun Sa's men. On 20  May, some 7,000 government soldiers, together with 1,200  porters, were reportedly rallying in the vicinities of Mong Chot  and Mong Tuan in preparation for crossing the Salween River to  the western bank to launch attacks on Khun Sa's positions.    The source said he was unaware of the report on the U.S.  financial assistance given to the Burmese Government for the  suppression operations against ethnic rebel groups, adding that  the Burmese Government probably cited narcotics problem as a  pretext to request the U.S. help.    Our correspondent reported that although the fighting was 18  kilometers away, the sound of artillery shelling could be  clearly heard in Wiang Haeng district town. No wounded soldiers  from Khun Sa's army crossed the border to seek treatment from  Wiang Haeng district's hospital as in the past because Khun Sa  has set up field hospitals at the strongholds captured earlier  from the government side.    District Clerk Phongsakon Thirabadi said he had instructed  officials to closely monitor the situation along the border with  Burma. However, he anticipated gruesome battles if the  government troops are able to cross the Salween River to the  western side, and this can trigger refugee influx into Thailand.</p>

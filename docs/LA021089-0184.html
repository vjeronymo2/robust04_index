			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> CASE CLOSED IN CLEMSON PLAYERS' BRAWL  </P> <P> Solicitor Joe Watson said today that no criminal charges will be filed in a  fight involving several Clemson basketball players and two campus security  guards.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to submit it to the grand jury," Watson said in a telephone  interview from his office in Greenville. "It's over as far as a criminal  investigation."  </P> <P> Saying that both sides share the blame for the fight, Watson added that the  security guards acted "unprofessionally," cursing at and chasing the students  after police arrived. He said the two security guards eventually had to be  subdued by police.  </P> <P> The fight occurred Jan. 21 in the parking lot of an apartment complex that  serves as the basketball players' dormitory. Watson declined to identify the  players involved, but sources said 6-foot, 11-inch junior center Elden Campbell  was among those who took part in the fight.  </P> <P> The two Crowe's Inc. security guards involved in the fight suffered minor  injuries. The fight, which Watson said lasted two or three minutes, occurred  shortly after Clemson downed Western Carolina at Littlejohn Coliseum.  </P> <P> "It was basically a case where both sides acted immaturely. Basically, there  were aggravating points on both sides," Watson said. "I'm not pointing blame at  any one of them."  </P> <P> The fight prompted the Clemson Police Department to ask for help from the State  Law Enforcement Division. Watson said that probably neither he nor the state  officers would have been involved in the investigation had athletes not been  involved in the fight.  </P> <P> "That was the thing that made it bigger than it was, because some Clemson  athletes were involved," he said. "The Police Department wanted someone who was  independent to look at their findings."  </P> <P> Watson said statements were taken from 20 to 25 people during the probe, which  took longer than expected because those involved initially lied about what  happened.  </P></p>

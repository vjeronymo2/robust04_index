			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Econimic Diary: Other economic news Monday: Consumer credit figures will give a further guide to the strength of the UK recovery. Analysts will be watching to see if consumers are starting to curtail their borrowing as the April tax increases approach. In recent months, borrowing has been quite strong, but analysts expect a slowdown to Pounds 300m in January, from December's Pounds 443m. Tuesday: Figures for fourth quarter West German GDP are expected to show a 0.5 per cent fall from the third quarter, indicating that the economy suffered a double dip after two successive quarterly rises. Pan-German unemployment, which topped an unadjusted 4.03m in January, is expected to show a further rise. Friday: Whole world visible trade figures for the UK in December are expected to show a deficit at around the same level as the Pounds 1bn recorded in November. Since the December deficit with non-European Union countries has already been announced, at Pounds 671m, the new element of the figures will be trade with the EU. The accuracy of the EU figures, compiled under the Intrastat system and based on VAT, has been questioned.</p>

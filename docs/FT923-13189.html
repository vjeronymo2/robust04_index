			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Thames wins Pounds 29m ITV deal THAMES Television yesterday announced it had won a larger than expected Pounds 29m programme deal with ITV for the first eight months of next year. The deal includes a third-weekly half hour edition of The Bill, its police drama series. These account for more than half the value of the programme package which will launch Thames as an independent producer. The group lost its licence to Carlton Television in last year's competitive tenders and ceases to be a broadcaster at the end of this year. It said yesterday that the deal had been blocked for a time by Carlton which did not want past episodes of The Bill to be available for UK Gold, the new Thames-BBC satellite channel. The channel, to be launched in the autumn, will concentrate on library programmes. Thames had to threaten that The Bill would not be available to ITV next year before a deal was agreed. The Pounds 29m deal over 8 months compares with the Pounds 70m-Pounds 80m worth of programmes Thames now sells to the network in a full year. It has lost its current affairs programmes such as This Week, daytime programmes and most of its comedy programmes. Apart from The Bill the package covers a new series of Minder, This Is Your Life, Wish You Were Here?, The Best of Tommy Cooper, Mr Bean and Count Duckula. Once the planned new central networking system is in place Thames will begin negotiations for the supply of programmes to ITV beyond August 1993.</p>

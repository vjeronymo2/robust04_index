			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- Viktor Linnik, former  editor-in-chief of the PRAVDA daily, was reinstated in his post  on Wednesday following a court inquiry. Under the resolution  passed by the court, Linnik will receive his salary for two  months during which he was compelled to stay away from work and  an administrative sanction against him will be lifted.    A conflict in the editorial office of the PRAVDA daily  flared  up following claims made by Greek partners to founder's rights,  trade mark and property of the newspaper. Linnik shares the  position of part of newspaper workers who believe that any  encroachments on the oldest Russian newspaper are inadmissible.  The court ruled that a decision to dismiss Linnik was adopted  at a meeting of journalists in the absence of quorum and  overruled the decision as invalid.    Another court inquiry will be held to establish whether  Greek  claims are legitimate.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA: ** "STRANGE TOO" DEPECHE MODE WARNER REPRISE VIDEO ($16.95)  </P> <P> Sure, the Mode is the champion of the adolescent alienation and isolation set,  and these six clips of songs from the current "Violator" album are Mode at its  most alienated and isolated.  </P> <P> But the triumph of the band's success and of its mass concert rituals is in  demonstrating the universality of these feelings. For the most part, these  videos -- shot in grainy Super 8 by photographer-filmmaker Anton Corbijn --  fail to illuminate or expand on that. Only singer David Gahan's bored and  lonely king of all he surveys in "Enjoy the Silence" and singer Martin Gore's  curiously fatalistic make-out scene with a gorgeous woman in "Clean"  effectively illustrate the songs. The others offer little more than bored  fatalism. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

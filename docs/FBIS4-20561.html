Social Awareness </H5>   The number of motor vehicles in Japan as of March 1993,  excluding two-wheeled vehicles, was about 62 million (39 million  passenger cars). That figure is approximately 21 million  vehicles more than it was 10 years ago (passenger cars  accounting for 13 million of that increase).    The Ministry of Construction, meanwhile, is planning to  spend  about &yen;76 trillion on road maintenance and improvements in  the 11th in a series of five-year plans on road maintenance that  starts this year.    Also, in April of this year, an additional 6,000 kilometers  of roads were promoted to the status of national highways, and  next year, 10,000 additional kilometers of roads are scheduled  to be promoted to primary regional highways.    The road extensions currently include 6,000 kilometers for  high-speed expressways such as the Meishin (Nagoya Kobe) and  Tomei (Tokyo Nagoya), and 130,000 kilometers for metropolitan  and prefectural roads. Including all other roads, the total  number of road extensions will come to 1.1 million kilometers.    Sometime this fiscal year, a portion of the Tokushima  Highway  will be open to traffic in Tokushima Prefecture. This will mean  that all prefectures and metropolitan areas throughout Japan  will be connected by high-speed expressways.    Adding on new roads like this, however, results in increased  demand on the roads including more things shipped by motor  vehicle, more economic activities including private business,  and more leisure activities that traditionally were not done by  means other than motor vehicle. When we add on to that the  lack of geographical knowledge, it only adds that much more time  to get to one's destination.    That being the case, if there were an appropriate support  system, that is, if a traffic information system were available  that included a car navigation system, drivers would then be  able to select the most convenient and lightest traveled routes  to get to their destination.    If there were a substantial number of cars using such a  system, it would help ease traffic congestion, help conserve  energy by cutting down on traveling times, and cut down the  number of traffic accidents.  <H5>  2. Automobiles in the Electronics and Information Age </H5>   It is becoming more and more common now to see basic  functions of the automobile such as "driving," "turning," and  "stopping" being controlled electronically by on-board  computers. This includes electronic control of the engine,  automatic transmission, suspension, and brakes. All these,  moreover, are becoming part of one integrated system.    It is also common now to have comfort features such as  air-conditioning and stereo systems in the car be controlled by  microcomputers, so when we talk about electronics in  automobiles, there is a mile of difference between the  automobiles of 30 years ago that used diodes in the AC  generators and transistors in the AM radios.    Generally speaking, people want the inside of their homes  and  the inside of their cars to have similar environments. The CD  (compact disk) made its debut in 1981, and later, in 1984, the  CD player found its way into the automobile. It is not unusual  now to see automobiles equipped with auto-changing CD players.  In the section below, we will discuss the role of the CD player  in the implementation of a car navigation system.    This system not only pertains to audio but to video as well.  The idea of putting televisions in cars has been around for  quite some time, but what is truly remarkable is to see a  million small liquid crystal televisions being sold each year,  and most of them are said to be used in automobiles. Besides TV  broadcasts, these miniature televisions are also being used as  monitors that reproduce images taken by no more than a video  camera.    The liquid crystal display is also one of the key elements  used in displaying the electronic maps (digital maps) in car  navigation systems.    Traffic information is at the head of the list as far as  information needed by a car driver. Most drivers have been  getting traffic information either from AM or FM radio stations,  or from display boards and roadside broadcasts on 1620 kHz as  they pass through different areas.    These ways of acquiring traffic information, however, are  unsatisfactory in terms of timing and relevancy of the  information given. If a car is equipped with a car phone or  portable cellular phone, it is possible to get traffic  information via a telephone service provided by the Japan  Traffic Information Center, but it will take more time before  ordinary drivers have access to mobile telephones in their cars.    Starting in April of next year, a system is scheduled to be  instituted for selling mobile telephones (these are now leased  from telephone companies), so this along with a new rate  structure should make it a lot easier for people to use mobile  telephones in the future.  <H5>  3. Navigation System </H5>   As far as traffic information is concerned, the ideal  situation is for drivers to be able to obtain the information  they need at the time they need it, but the complex network of  roads in Japan makes it necessary for cars to have road maps or  driver guides in the door pockets. In recent years, we are  seeing more and more road signs being put up as the new road  construction continues, but it is very rare, indeed, for the  driver of a car to be able to find the sign they want at the  time they need it.    Moreover, to turn the pages of a map while driving at night  just to confirm one's location is dangerous and very hard to do.  At times such as this, there is nothing more convenient than to  have your location displayed on a map automatically, and be able  to make decisions immediately based on the direction you are  heading and the surrounding geographical conditions.    With ships and airplanes, needless to say, navigation is  taken care of by electronic navigation methods, but car  navigation is a rather recent phenomenon which only got started  in the 1970s and was put into service in 1987.    A compact disk is the best form of media when it comes to  storing digital maps containing digitalized road map  information, so not only have CD players been commercialized but  are suddenly finding altogether new uses. Initially, CRTs were  used for the color display units that display the maps, but most  now are liquid crystal displays.    At the present time, car navigation systems are broadly  divided into two types of electronic navigation methods, namely,  self-contained navigation (dead-reckoning navigation) and GPS  (global positioning system) navigation.    In the self-contained navigation system, the position of the  car has to be input before the car is started, but in the  electronic navigation system, data on the absolute position of  the car can be obtained continuously. The systems that car  manufacturers are installing in their cars tend to combine both  the self-contained system and the global positioning system.  Also, the after-market systems that can be purchased at any car  supply store and be installed by hand are generally based on the  GPS method (cf. Table 1).     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-05A>      Table 1. Car Navigation System </FIG>    I would now like to introduce some of the main features of  car navigation systems now on the market.    (1) Can set destination and routing freely and always  display  the direction in which you are heading. Has an audio feature  that lets you know when you are turning left or right.    (2) Can file coordinates while driving which can then be  used  again on the return trip or future trips.    (3) Can easily access maps from reference lists when looking  up maps of destinations (3,000 cities, towns, and villages;  9,000 train stations, golf courses, and expressway ICs, SAs, and  PAs).    (4) System also provides service information about hotels,  restaurants, art galleries, museums, and sports facilities by  means of still pictures, graphics, and audio.    (5) Besides general road maps, there are city maps available  that feature lots of local information, and also CDs that  contain special resort guide information.    (6) In addition to maps, there is also a full lineup of CDs  including games and "karaoke" singing that people can enjoy once  they reach their destination.  <H5>  4. Digital Maps </H5>   A database of digital maps was started in 1984 as the result  of a project undertaken by the Ministry of Construction and  private companies entitled "A Road/Vehicle Information System,"  which came out of an immediate need for data on national roads  and highways. In 1988, the Japan Digital Road Map Association  was formed. It is made up of members from automotive,  electrical, surveying, and map-related companies, and has been  at work preparing, updating, and making the database available.  This database has basically digitalized many of the 1:25,000  topographical maps produced by the Ministry of Construction's  Geographical Survey Institute (4,400 maps to cover all Japan).    The most recent database contained a total number of 2,200  digitalized 1:25,000 topographical maps, or 50 percent of the  total number of maps, and covering 80 percent of the population  distribution. The remaining areas are maintained by 1:50,000  topographical maps. The contents of the database consists of a  network of roads that is formed by digitalizing the linear  latitude and longitude changes in the road, and by linking these  numbered nodes together with links connecting the nodes.    The areas maintained by 1:25,000 topographical maps include  all roads classified as more than 3 meters wide, and the areas  maintained by 1:50,000 topographical maps include all roads  classified as being more than 5 meters wide. Needless to say,  the data includes rivers, shoreline routes, and railway lines.    Furthermore, these roads being living entities, are rebuilt  and changed almost every year, so hundreds of revisions have to  made in the topographical maps themselves, and the database must  accurately reflect these new changes and revisions.    A database such as the one described above is, simply  speaking, only an output map made up of lines, so is incomplete  in terms of being a navigational tool. Therefore, the map must  be set up in such a way that the person driving the car is able  to confirm his/her location easily with the display. The work in  this area cannot be done without the cooperation of map makers,  so we at Pioneer have been working together with the Hokkaido  Chizu in the manufacture of navigational maps.    Out of that work has come a CD-ROM disk which contains a  complete record of map data, but we are also marketing a  navigation system that uses IC cards as recording media.  <H5>  5. Position Sensors and Global Positioning System </H5>   In Section 3, we touched on the different car navigation  systems, but as Table 1 shows, we are unable to obtain data on  absolute position with the self-contained navigation system.    The position of a car in a self-contained system is  calculated by geomagnetic sensors that calculate the azimuth,  speed sensors that calculate the distance the car has traveled,  and gyros that detect turning angles. There are instances also  in which the wheel velocity and steering are used as aids in  calculating the turning angle. A map-matching technology is also  used for restoring the car's position based on road data and  pattern verification when there are errors produced, such as the  car leaving the road.    Next, we outline the Global Positioning System which has  recently been attracting a good deal of attention.    This is an excellent system that lets you know in real time  your latitude and longitude coordinates at any point on the  earth.    More specifically, it is a global positioning system using  artificial satellites that the Department of Defense of the U.S.  Government has been working on for the past 20 years or so, and  is formally called NAVSTAR/GPS (Navigation System with Time and  Ranging/Global Positioning System). The system consists of 24  satellites each equipped with atomic clocks (orbiting the earth  about every 12 hours in 6 orbital tracks at altitudes of 20,000  km), five monitoring stations, and a control station.    There are L1 radio signals for standard positioning and L2  signals for high-precision positioning, but the L2 is  exclusively from military use (Figures 1 and 2 [figures not  reproduced]).    The positioning system works by calculating the distance  between a moving vehicle and the satellite in real time based on  the propagation time of signals received from three to four  satellites, and establishing the real position of the moving  vehicle.    (1) When three satellites are used, two-dimensional  positioning (latitude, longitude) is possible.    (2) When four satellites are used, three-dimensional  positioning (latitude, longitude, and altitude) is possible.    From the data received, we can also determine traveling  direction, speed, and time.    There are a total of 24 satellites in operation at present  including the first experimental satellites, so it is possible  to have 24-hour tracking (Table 2).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |07                       |05-13-1993               |Yes                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |09                       |06-26-1993               |Yes                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |05                       |09--1993                 |Yes                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |30                       |10--1993                 |Yes                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The system is still in the experimental mode, but a formal  announcement is due with regards to the first stage of operation  which is scheduled to take place at any time. The operation is  not scheduled to be completed until all 24 Block II satellites  are in place.    An advanced positioning system such as this should be useful  in a wide range of activities including, tracking moving  vehicles, surveying, and supporting disaster prevention work  (predicting earthquakes and volcanic eruptions).    In 1990, Mazda and Pioneer jointly became the first in the  world to come out with a car navigation system.    This is a system that the U.S. Government developed and is  controlled and operated by the United States, so it is important  in terms of the user that the use of the system be appropriate  and that care be taken not to cause any new trade frictions.    For that reason, GPS makers and users in Japan are planning  to form the Satellite Positioning System Association whose job  it will be to begin conducting international exchanges,  researching appropriate uses of the system, and providing  accurate information.  <H5>  6. Future Car Navigation and Road Traffic Information Systems </H5>   Making cars more intelligent and informed contributes to  road  safety and smoother traffic flow, so that is why there is so  much research being done in this area.    One of the things that current navigation systems have been  able to provide is information on surrounding geographical  conditions and the distance and direction to one's destination.    As explained in Section 2, dynamic traffic information is  presently being provided by audio systems from radio broadcasts  or telephone services, or by display boards along the roads, but  to enable more effective use of the information collected, and  to provide drivers with a system that they can use anytime and  anyplace, a new organization called the VICS (Vehicle  Information and Communication Systems) Promotion Council was  formed in 1991 with the cooperation of the National Police  Agency, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the  Ministry of Construction.    This will be a system that uses radio beacons, light  beacons,  and FM multipliers (a new broadcasting method in which  characters, graphics, and additional information is multiplexed  and sent out on FM radio broadcasts) installed along roads and  highways to be used to send information to drivers on traffic  jams, time requirements, traffic regulations and warnings.    We have been studying different modes of display from simple  ones that display only written characters to more complex ones  that involve navigational maps. A public demonstration of the  system is being planned for November of this year, but when this  system is in place, we expect it will dramatically improve the  decision-making ability of drivers.  <H5>  7. Conclusion </H5>   As we have explained in the foregoing, this car navigation  system was developed for commercial use by concentrating a  diverse range of technologies. At the present time, there are  about 300,000 systems in use. We believe that the market for  this product will continue to expand, and that we will see  further technical innovation.    If there are more cars on the road equipped with car  navigation systems and data terminals, it will likely lead to  smoother traffic, therefore, we are trying to make the system as  easy and as simple to use as possible.    Meanwhile, we continue to see more and more mobile-type  management systems, which are applications of car navigation  technology, being used in business (trailer trucks, taxis,  police cars, etc.).    For example, positional information on the location of a  vehicle is sent by radio from a GPS transceiver in the moving  vehicle to an operational control center. The center uses that  information to ascertain the position and operating status of a  number of moving vehicles, so is able to immediately send  appropriate instructions and messages. This area should see an  enormous amount of growth in the future. (Yushiyuki Kosaka)</p>

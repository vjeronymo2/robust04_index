			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS) -- Noted Chinese economist  and member of the CPPCC Mr. Gao Shangquan recently suggested  that three measures should be adopted to solve the grim problem  of inflation. These are a strict restriction on fixed assets  investment, restriction of the issuing of currency and the  amount of credit and restriction of fiscal spending [sentence as  received]    Mr. Gao said that excessive investment in fixed assets and  having too many projects under construction had resulted in the  scattering and ineffectiveness of such investment. The  investment system, therefore, should be reformed with the scale  of investment and the size of credit being strictly controlled  and the investment structure improved to better profit from  investment. The work efficiency and simplification of the  administrative structure should at the same time be implemented  on order to reduce spending and waste.    Effective control of inflation, Mr. Gao said, in fact  depended on the changing from a speed-seeking economy to one  bringing benefit. Developing speed and expanding investment  should not be pursued blindly while the management level,  technological standard and economic results should be enhanced.    Enterprises should speed up their running on modern company  lines, Mr. Gao said, and reform for strengthening macro-control  and improving the social security system should also be  quickened. In order to guarantee social stability, the  establishment of an unemployment insurance system and vocational  training schemes as well as the development of tertiary industry  should be speeded up.</p>

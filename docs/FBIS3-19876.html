			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kemal Burkay, leader of the Kurdistan </F> Socialist Party, PSK, in Iraq, by Mithat Bereket in northern  Iraq from the "32d Day" program; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Burkay] We could have resorted to arms just as the  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. We did not opt for terrorism  because we were aware that the price would be too high and we  see that now. We supported a peaceful political struggle to  develop a solution to the issue until unfortunately we were  stopped. Once an organization like ours, which prefers a  peaceful political struggle, gets involved in terrorism it is  restricted.    [Bereket] You had certain opportunities, such as access to  the DEP [Democracy Party] representation in the parliament. Do  you think that the DEP used this opportunity to its advantage?    [Burkay] I do not think that the DEP has made good use of  the parliament. In the beginning they undertook demonstrative  actions. They could have undertaken wiser actions. However, the  DEP was not even given the opportunity for these actions. I do  not think that the DEP politicians have much experience. How do  you expect them to have experience when the Kurdish movement  receives big [word indistinct] every three, five, or 10 years.  Under these circumstances, the politically experienced are being  pushed out of the political arena therefore leaving the way open  for less experienced individuals who were not given an  opportunity to express themselves.    [Bereket] You are very cautious when assessing the recent  suggestions of Apo [PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan] and are  refraining from commenting on the proposals submitted by the  PKK. Do you believe that the real solution lies in discussion?    [Burkay] The important thing is to see that the solution to  this issue lies in dialogue, whatever the reasons for the PKK  proposals. The issue is political, therefore political channels  should be open. As we see it, this can be achieved and the  chaos of today -- the dirty war -- stopped. The prospects of  the country should not be wasted. The young people of the  country should not die in vain. Our country should not be  transformed into hell and it is possible to prevent this. The  government can prevent this.    [Bereket] Would you cease your struggle for independence and  coexist in Turkey if the government grants you the right to  establish Kurdish schools, television, and radio?    [Burkay] Being considered equal means independence. I think  the source of the problem is inequality and pressure. I believe  that under the basis of equality everybody can live in  brotherhood, and I think that the Kurds would not even think nor  want a separation. I think that two peoples coexisting is much  more beneficial -- for both sides -- than their separation and  will stop migration. Of course, it is better to achieve  success by a peaceful democratic process and therefore avoid  more bloodshed.    [Bereket] Why don't you, as the PSK try and emerge as an  alternative to the PKK?    [Burkay] We were not established as an alternative to the  PKK. We were established in 1974, before the PKK, and we have  our own program. We work within the framework of this program.    [Bereket] Has the Turkish state approached you against the  PKK? Has it searched for ways to establish a dialogue with you?    [Burkay] We have sent our messages to the Turkish state and  government by the use of various channels -- press statements  and interviews I've done. These statements have also been  published in Turkey. I sent a long letter to Mrs. Ciller when  she formed the government. I indicated my views in that letter  and submitted various proposals for a peaceful solution to the  issue. Unfortunately, as I have said before, these calls of mine  have received no responses.    [Bereket] What will be the PSK's stand during the 27 March  elections?    [PSK Central Committee member Unal Yardimci] We have issued  messages stating that patriotic democratic candidates should be  supported wherever they are and that citizens everywhere should  cast their votes.    [Bereket] Do you believe that in case a political solution  is found to the Kurdish issue the PKK will disappear and new  balances established?    [Burkay] We do not find the PKK's policies that agreeable.  Nobody has [word indistinct] the PKK as much as us but you  cannot conduct politics in Turkey without first recognizing the  PKK. For that reason, the state should recognize the PKK. We  are impartial in this issue. Both community and political life  will be reshaped when new democratic conditions are established.  There are other Kurdish organizations apart from us. It could  be that other powerful Kurdish organizations may develop from  the PKK and us. The road that will enable this formation should  be open.</p>

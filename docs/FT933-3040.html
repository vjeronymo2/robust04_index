			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Croats pull back after clashes in Krajina CROATIAN forces yesterday withdrew from three villages wrested last week from Serb control in Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia, as United Nations peacekeepers were deployed between the warring Croatian troops and rebel Serbs. But with the Serb forces threatening to retake the villages, the fighting in the last five days has rekindled fears of a wider war in the enclave. Although the battles in central Bosnia have overshadowed the rumbling conflict in Krajina in recent months, it is the broader struggle between Croatia and Serbia that seems set to shape the future of any peace - or further fighting - in the former Yugoslavia. The Croat offensive against the Serb-held villages last week was not, it seems, a serious attempt to recapture territory lost to the Serbs after the six-month war in 1991. Instead it appears to have been an attempt to flex Croatia's military muscles in the face of pressures from the Serbs and the international community. One of the pressures facing Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, is the knowledge that the UN mandate for the peacekeeping forces in Croatia is due to expire at the end of the month. Since the January 1992 ceasefire, the disputed areas in Croatia have been monitored by 15,000 peacekeeping troops in UN zones known as Sectors North, South, East and West. Although UN officials expect the mandate will be renewed, the uncertainty about the UN's role, and the future of the enclaves, has renewed Croatian fears that partition of Bosnia could lead to a division of Croatia as well. With a third of Croatia under Serb control, Mr Tudjman is now at pains to deflect domestic attention from Zagreb's apparent weakness. He is also under pressure to dampen domestic suspicions that Croatia has struck too close a deal with Serbia. Since Croatia would be hard pressed to fight on two fronts, the conflict with the Serbs has apparently prompted Mr Tudjman to try for a reconciliation with Mr Alia Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president. Meanwhile, fighting continued in central Bosnia yesterday in spite of Tuesday's apparent ceasefire. A meeting of the Nato council in Brussels yesterday agreed to start formal planning for a force of around 50,000 troops to police a future peace agreement in Bosnia.</p>

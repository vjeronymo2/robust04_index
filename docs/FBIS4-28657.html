			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2230 GMT on 11 June carries in its "News 2001"  program a live 68-minute interview with Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party) Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa on the DPRK nuclear issue  and Japan's political situation by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa  and Megumi Sekito, Keio University Professor Yoshiaki, and  political commentator Kenichi Takemura at the FNN studio in  Tokyo.    At 2309 GMT, Kuroiwa begins the interview by asking Ozawa  for  his opinion on the present DPRK situation. Ozawa says: "I do  not think they are changing their basic position. But when we  discuss and review the matter, we must try and use dialogue to  bring them to a compromise and a change in their policy. That  would be the best, and we will have to do our best towards that.  But if we have done all that, and if things still do not go  well, we will have to take a firm stand."    He adds: "Maybe the DPRK sees some political significance in  owning nuclear arms; anyway, I do not think they are giving up  their position yet."    Kuroiwa asks whether Japan, the United States, and the ROK  should join together to mete out sanctions against the DPRK if  the United Nations fails to agree on sanctions. Ozawa says: "I  do not think China will reject or exercise its veto right (on a  UN proposal for sanctions). China will gain nothing by doing  so, and it is possible that China itself may become isolated  (from the international community). I do not think it will do  such a foolish thing."    Speaking on alleged differences of opinions on how sanctions  against the DPRK should be implemented, Ozawa says: "It is only  natural that they be implemented step by step. It is not that  Japan, the United States, and the ROK differ on the question of  implementing them step by step, but rather, I think there are  some differences in opinion on what types of sanctions should be  implemented in a step by step manner."    Even before the United Nations formally passes a resolution  on sanctions, he notes the possibility of other nations calling  on Japan to take action to discontinue commodity trade and money  remittances to the DPRK. He explains: "I am afraid about the  possibility that Japan, as it is, will not be able to do  anything when that happens." He adds: "What I am worried about  most is the possibility Japan will lose trust in the  international community. I think damages to Japan (if it cannot  take the called-for actions) could be such that they will not be  repaired even in the next scores of years or next several  generations. Hence, I think, action in the preliminary stages  will be very important and tough for Japan."    Professor Kobayashi asks Ozawa if he thinks Japan should  agree to the U.S. proposal that Japan, the United States, and  the ROK join together to punish the DPRK economically if the  United Nations is unable to agree on sanctions. Ozawa says: "So  far I have said that Japan should act only in accordance with UN  resolutions when compulsive actions are concerned. But what is  being discussed and called for now are preliminary actions that  involve domestic matters, such as halting money remittances and  regulating visits. These are not actions that cannot be carried  out without a UN resolution. That being the case, Japan is in a  very difficult position."    When asked about Japan's crisis management capability under  the Shinseito led coalition government, Ozawa states:  "Officials of concerned government agencies are studying  various fields very hard. However, neither the government nor  the Diet openly discuss this issue. The government has no  official position on the subject, that is the actual situation  in today's Japan. While I think some quarters in the government  are continuing informal studies, we are not yet prepared to have  an improved system." In regards to this, Ozawa expresses  concern over Japan's taboo to fully discuss defense issues, and  says: "In particular, the mass media still deal with important  topics in very old-fashioned ways. Such a tendency by Japanese  society creates a national crisis."    In response to Kurosawa's comment that Japan seemingly has a  consensus to deal with the DPRK issue within the Constitution's  limitations, Ozawa notes: "Many people have a different  definition of constitutional limitations. For instance, the  Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) says, under  constitutional limitations, Japan must not take part in any  compulsive actions, even indirectly. In their opinion, Japan is  not allowed to supply provisions or fuel to U.S. Forces in case  of emergency since it aids in compulsive actions or military  force. Even if the nation has a consensus on actions within the  constitutional limitations, there is no accord on the definition  of the limitations."    [Editorial Report] When Kuroiwa asks if Japan, under  Oazawa's constitutional concept, can assist U.S. Forces with  regard to the DPRK issue, Ozawa answers: "In my own  understanding of Article 9 of the Constitution, the Japanese  Government must not, at is own judgment, be allowed to dispatch  the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to any international dispute.  Article 9 strictly prohibits such behavior. On the other hand,  the Constitution's main concept is international pacifism. When  the United Nations has a clear policy for certain disputes and  member nations agree to jointly conduct law enforcement or peace  activities, that does not conflict with the Constitution at all.  That is my understanding."    Asked if the government intends to fully cooperate with  anti-DPRK sanctions if imposed at the United States' initiative,  Ozawa says: "I do not think so. My opinion is that, when  compulsive forces are to be used, Japan must take part in the  actions only within the framework of the United Nations.  However, controlling money remittances from Japan to the DPRK  is a matter of Japan's domestic economic policy. Since this has  nothing to do with Article 9 of the Constitution, we have to  take necessary actions in consultations with the United States  and the ROK. When the United Nations clearly decides to impose  sanctions against the DPRK and asks member nations to support  the sanctions, as a matter of course, Japan will have to assist  with its SDF or all other possible means because it is an event  in Japan's neighboring region."    In reply to a question asking if Japan should be admitted to  the UN Security Council (UNSC) as a permanent member with a  limited military role, Ozawa says: "If Japan becomes a  permanent UNSC member, it should meet the same qualification as  other members. But I do not really think Japan should seek such  a position. The UNSC is an organization to deal with  international security. I think Japan has neither the  determination nor public consensus to obtain the position. It  is too much for today's Japan, although Japan has strong  economic power." Ozawa adds: "What Japan can do would depend  on individual cases, but if Japan becomes a permanent UNSC  member, it cannot stay away from what everybody else does. The  international community would never accept such a foolish offer.  If Japan says so, it would become a standing joke in the world.  If Japan wants to stay away from certain UNSC duties, it had  better not become a permanent member."    When asked if the minority Hata administration can survive  the difficult political situation, Ozawa says: "While people  often say the Hata administration is in trouble because it is a  minority government, I am not worried. If we really had a  serious problem, the administration would have collapsed  already. However, nobody can draw a picture of the post-Hata  political scene. The Liberal Democratic Party is not united in  backing Mr. (Yohei) Kono as the next prime minister, and neither  is the SDPJ. Under such circumstances, we should not be  scrupulous about winning back the majority. This is the time  for all politicians to overcome party barriers and to seek  policy-oriented allies.    In connection with Ozawa's positive stance on the SDPJ  rejoining the coalition, Kuroiwa asks if the coalition would  have a clearer policy accord when discussions are held on the  SDPJ's return, Ozawa says: "If we had a clearer policy accord,  it would put the SDPJ in a difficult position. I am positive  about clarifying coalition policies if the SDPJ agrees to it."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Compilation by Lubomir Sedlak: "National Property Fund: At </F> the Helm of Privatization"]    [Text] The National Property fund, currently embroiled in a  400 million Kc ($13.3 million) lawsuit regarding its issuance of  stocks, has become a dominant player in the Czech economy over  the past three years.    --Takeovers. Since its establishment in 1991, the fund has  taken over state property worth 576 billion Kc, including 148.5  billion Kc worth of property in the second wave of  privatization, which ends this spring.    --Revenues. Between 1991 and 1993, the fund's revenues  amounted to more than 54 billion Kc through large-scale  privatization, including more than 23 billion Kc generated  through selling shares in companies, 18 billion Kc through  direct sales of companies and other revenues generated through  public auctions and competitions. Small-scale privatization  generated more than 36 billion Kc in revenues. The fund has  deposited 20 billion Kc of that sum into the Ceska sporitelna  savings bank, with the interest being used to privatize the  country's health system.    --Expenses. The fund has paid out almost 43 billion Kc on  large-scale privatization since its founding, spending more than  half of this sum in 1992 on bond purchases to pay off the debts  of formerly state-owned enterprises. It also spent almost 4  billion Kc on small-scale privatization, mainly on liquidating  state enterprises and helping municipal budgets.    --Receivables. The fund requires entities that wish to buy  property from it to make an advance payment of 10 percent of the  final price. Various buyers currently owe the agency 6.5 billion  Kc for the acquisition of 240 enterprises. The fund has already  filed suits against 93 of these debtors, who owe a total of  almost 2 billion Kc.    --Foreign investment. Almost 41 percent of the fund's total  revenues, amounting to 22 billion Kc, came from abroad. But the  share of foreign investors declined in 1993.    --Self-assessment. Fund Chairman Tomas Jezek says the fund  has "the worst behind it," because the coupon privatization  process is ending this spring with its second wave. There will  not be a third wave, Jezek says, since there is basically  nothing left to be privatized in this country.    But fund officials note that entities interested in buying  companies from the agency are facing increasing problems in  obtaining money from banks, which have become more cautious.</p>

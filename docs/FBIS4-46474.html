			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "To Naval School Entrants"] </F>   [Text] If you have decided to tie your fate to the sea,  this is possible! To do that, you need to enter one of the  higher naval schools. If you have not yet been promoted to the  9th grade, you can become a student of Nakhimov School where  young men from 15-16 years of age are accepted (you must reach  your 15th birthday during the year of matriculation), have state  of health that is suitable for study at military schools and  desire to become a Naval officer in the future. The mandatory  condition -- is study at an English language school.    Parents or individuals who substitute for them submit  requests for acceptance to Nakhimov School by 1 July.  The documents required to do that are completed through rayon  military commissariats (city military commissariats) at the  place of residence. Among them are:    the entrant's personnel request addressed to the head of the  school;    the parents' request which states that their son will  continue to study at a naval school after graduation from  Nakhimov School; an original certificate of birth; a medical  examination by a military medical board under the rayon military  commissariat (city military commissariat) at the place of  residence; and, a progress report card for the first three study  quarters (the candidate submits the original education  certificate upon arrival at the school), which must mandatorily  indicate which foreign language was studied;    a school reference;    information from the parents' work location or the residence  location on the composition of the family and, in the case of  the absence of either of the parents or of a divorce -- a copy  of the death or divorce certificate.    Those persons permitted to take the entrance examinations  receive a summons that gives them the right to request travel  documents at the rayon military commissariat to the place of  residence.    Upon arrival at the school, young men undergo a medical  examination, a physical fitness test, and take competitive  entrance examinations on the Russian language (dictation) and  mathematics (oral).    The term of study at Nakhimov School when matriculating  after  the 8th grade is three years. Upon completion of the school,  graduates (without examinations) are sent to higher naval  schools for further study.    The school's address: House 2/4, Petrogradskiy Naberezhnaya,  P-46, St. Petersburg, 197046.    Russian Federation male citizens who have a middle education  are being accepted at higher naval schools:    from among civilian youth who are 17-21 years of age;    compulsory service military personnel and those soldiers who  have been released into the reserve who are under 23 years of  age; and,    army and navy warrant officers upon expiration of two years  of service in the positions of army and navy warrant officers  and officers, and also compulsory service military personnel who  are up to 24 years of age.    Servicemen who desire to enter schools submit requests  addressed to the unit commander prior to 1 April.    Individuals from among civilian youth submit applications  (requests) prior to 1 May to the rayon (city) military  commissariat at their place of residence, addressed directly to  the chief of the selected school. The following is attached to  the request:    three certified 4 x 6 cm photographs (without headgear);    an autobiography;    a reference from the place of work, study or service;    a copy of the middle education document (middle school  students submit information on their progress at this period of  time).    The graduate personally submits a passport, birth  certificate, military service card (or residence permit) and an  original middle education certificate to the acceptance board.    A special medical examination of candidates is conducted  beforehand at military commissariats. Military draft boards  carry out their selection to naval schools from among civilian  youth prior to 25 May.    Matriculation of candidates who meet acceptance conditions  is  conducted based upon the entrance examinations. As a rule, this  is Russian language and literature (written), mathematics  (written), and physics (oral or written).    Servicemen and young men from among civilian youth, who have  been awarded a gold or silver medal upon graduation from middle  school or who have received diplomas with distinction upon  graduation from middle special educational institutions or  middle professional-technical school, take one examination on  the profiled discipline. Upon receipt of a grade of  "outstanding", they are released from having to take further  examinations and, upon receiving a grade of "good" or  "satisfactory", they take examinations on the remaining  disciplines.    The term of study at higher naval schools is five years.  Cadets are under full state support. They are annually provided  two-week winter holidays and also a month-long summer leave.  During the period of leave, they are provided with free  transportation to the location where the leave is spent.    All cadets who have passed state examinations and who have  defended their graduation thesis (project) are awarded the  military rank of "lieutenant" and are handed a higher education  diploma and the prescribed badge.    Having received a lieutenant's ceremonial dagger and  shoulder  boards, you will become a part of the glorious Naval officers  corps. Modern equipment, surface combatants and submarines, and  naval aviation aircraft will be under your control! Everything  is in your hands.  <H5>  Addresses of Naval Schools: </H5>   Higher Naval Orders of Lenin and Ushakov, Red Banner  School imeni M.V.

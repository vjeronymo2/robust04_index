			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Staying one step ahead of the pack - Charles Batchelor looks at tips on how to handle the sale of your company Once the economy starts to come out of recession there will be owners of private businesses whose thoughts turn to selling their company. Acquisitions of private companies are expected to increase in 1993, according to one recent survey. But if you are contemplating the sale of your business you must adopt a professional approach, warns Geoffrey Dalton in What is Your Business Worth?* You will probably only sell one business in your life so you will not have the opportunity to refine your sales techniques. The skills you learned in, for example, marketing heating systems are unlikely to be of any help, he notes. Yet there is a good chance you will be up against a professional buyer or buying team. Many public companies have assembled formidable merger and acquisition teams who have probably bought six businesses already in the past year. 'Their pace, systematic approach, assurance, presentation and, indeed, bonhomie are awe-inspiring,' writes Dalton. 'For them this is just another day and just another deal. For you, in contrast, it is an emotional parting of the ways.' The buyer's approach may start with an offer which you cannot sensibly refuse. You will be encouraged to think of how you might spend the money and urged to sit back while he does all the hard work. Once you are hooked the would-be buyer will ask for additional information - on markets, pricing, costings, products. It will obviously be necessary for the buyer's team to meet your key employees and before you know where you are your whole team is dedicated to producing reams of information, all of which must be checked and cross-checked. Soon you start to accept the fact that the sale is all but sewn up. Your employees begin to realign their loyalties and imagine their vastly enhanced career prospects under the new owner. At this point, when everyone is aboard, the squeeze starts. The buying team discover, to their surprise, that there is more slow-moving stock then they first thought, there are doubtful debts and they will need to invest more capital than originally envisaged. You begin to convince yourself that they are doing you a favour by taking the company off your hands. It is logical, therefore, in deference to their own shareholders, that they cannot continue with their original offer. At this point you are exhausted, your staff's loyalties are divided, your sales drive has faltered because everyone has been busy with the negotiations. Legal and accountancy fees are mounting. How did this happen? You realise you were so dazzled with the initial offer that you did not approach other potential buyers or challenge the original bidder's assumptions. You allowed it to become a one-horse race. The scenario may appear exaggerated but this type of conduct is not at all unusual, says Dalton. To avoid it arising business owners must decide their own objectives and priorities. They must establish a target price and an acceptable minimum price; decide the form and timing of the payment; consider whether they are willing to remain involved in the business after the sale; and decide which assets are to be included in the sale. Most owners of a private company have only a very hazy idea of what it is worth, often based on golf club locker room gossip or comparisons with the prices achieved by completely dissimilar businesses sold in a very different economic climate. Obtaining a realistic valuation will not only help the owner to be prepared for a bid approach but will show whether the business is making an acceptable return. One family-owned business run by a delegated management team was paying a dividend of Pounds 40,000 a year, a fraction of the Pounds 300,000-Pounds 400,000 the shareholders could have earned from a similar investment in government securities, Dalton notes. Ultimately, the value of your company depends on what a buyer is willing to pay. A 'jigsaw buyer' who is assembling a national network and needs your business to complete the picture, is likely to offer the best price. But you cannot value your business on this basis. You will have to calculate your value to a predictable buyer. If you are considering selling your company you may need to make changes well in advance. If the business is too dependent on your daily presence it may have little value to another owner once you have sold out. You may need to delegate more to managers and offer them equity. You may also need to reduce the amounts you take out of the business to enable investments and improvements to be made with the increased retained profits. If your accounting procedures have been designed to minimise profits you may need to adjust them. You will need to do this well in advance. A sudden adjustment which shows a sharp uplift in value will make buyers suspicious. Where do you turn for advice on valuations and on handling a sale? Dalton, a specialist in the purchase and sale of unquoted companies, is not surprisingly sceptical of the skills of non-experts. Among these he includes the smaller accountancy firms, the family solicitor and the bank manager. Unless they handle a large number of deals, they will not have the specialist skills required and may well learn at your expense, he warns. A survey by the Imperial College Management School in London showed that most vendors do not use any outside adviser and while accountants are the most common source of help even the large firms handle relatively few deals each. This lively guide meets a clear need. *Kogan Page, 120 Pentonville Road, London N1 9JN. 178 pages.

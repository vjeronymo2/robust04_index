			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> DOW RISES 8.34 TO 2,687.97, A 3.98 GAIN FOR WEEK  </P> <P> Wall Street's blue chips rose modestly Friday, helped by a late burst of  computer-directed buying, while transportation issues surged on takeover fever  to end the week at record levels.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.34 points to finish at 2,687.97, a  gain of 3.98 points on the week.  </P> <P> Once again, the market's biggest gains were concentrated in the transport  sector. The Dow Jones transportation average jumped 14.05 points to a record  1,442.39, helped by speculation that a bidding war may emerge for UAL Corp.,  the parent of United Airlines.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 145.81 million shares, down from  157.56 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 776 issues up, 661 down and 544  unchanged.  </P> <P> Stocks opened weaker in response to a slide in the bond market after a Labor  Department report on consumer prices that raised concern about the inflation  outlook over the next few months.  </P> <P> The Labor Department's consumer price index rose 0.2% in July, in line with the  market consensus. But without food and energy costs, the most volatile  components of the index, consumer prices rose a heftier 0.4%, raising inflation  worries.  </P> <P> Stocks firmed slightly at midday as bonds turned higher and by late afternoon  prices were strengthening.  </P> <P> But uncertainty about the impact of the the so-called double witching hour --  the expiration of stock-index futures and options that don't expire quarterly  -- dampened the rally.  </P> <P> Reports that at least three parties are interested in acquiring UAL pushed up  the airline company's stock 4 5/8 to 271. Besides Marvin Davis, who has bid  $275 a share for UAL, rumored potential suitors include Texas investor Robert  M. Bass and another group that includes Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and British  Airways.  </P> <P> Other airlines benefited from the takeover talk. AMR rose 3/8 to 76 1/8, Delta  Air Lines gained 1 3/4 to 77, USAir added 1/8 to 50 5/8 and Texas Air rose 1  3/8 to 19 1/2.  </P> <P> McGraw-Hill rose 6 to 85 1/2 on renewed speculation that it may be the target  of a takeover or leveraged buyout. The company declined to comment on the rise  in its stock.  </P> <P> C. R. Bard fell 1 1/2 to 20 after the company said it had stopped shipments of  its new Probe angioplasty catheter pending Food and Drug Administration review  and approval.  </P> <P> Bard said it expects that the development will cut into its profits, leading  several brokerage firms, including Prudential-Bache, Shearson Lehman and Piper  Jaffray, to lower their annual earnings estimates for the company.  </P> <P> Sci-Med Life, which also makes catheters, benefited from Bard's troubles. Its  shares jumped 12 1/8 to 48 1/8.  </P> <P> Georgia-Gulf climbed 3 1/2 to 54 1/2 on news that investor Harold Simmons, who  owns about 9.4% of the company, is considering seeking control.  </P> <P> Maytag rose 1 3/4 to 23 1/4 on a report that it may be a takeover target.  Analysts said Chicago businessman Lester Crown, who owns a 5.5% stake in  Maytag, is rumored to be planning to buy more shares.  </P> <P> The Tokyo stock market took a breather, closing mixed in thin trading, after  jumping to record highs earlier this week. The key Nikkei 225-share index  dipped 26.97 points to close at 35,063.14.  </P> <P> In London, share prices continued climbing, as bullish corporate news,  encouraging economic data and scattered speculative buying pushed the main  index to a 1989 high. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 15.1 points  higher at 2,375.1.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices finished mixed as buying by bargain hunters offset the early  declines that followed the consumer inflation report.  </P> <P> Prices of long-term Treasury and corporate bonds edged up, but prices of  shorter-term Treasury issues and tax-exempt bonds slipped.  </P> <P> The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/16 point, or less  than $1 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield dipped to 8.15% from 8.16%  late Thursday.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term issues lost  1/8 point, intermediate securities fell 3/32 point and long-term issues rose as  much as 3/32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial  information service.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.875%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar slipped in worldwide trading as dealers cashed in on the currency's  dramatic run-up in the previous session.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for  current delivery lost 20 cents to finish at $368.10 an ounce. Republic National  Bank of New York said gold was bid later at $366 an ounce, down 20 cents from  Thursday.  </P> <P> Buying interest in the dollar abated following the climb triggered by  Thursday's release of a better-than-expected U.S. trade report for July, which  boosted the U.S. currency to levels not seen since its most recent rally in  June.  </P> <P> "The dollar is right back to where we were before the trade number came out,"  said Michael McDonald, a trader with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in  Chicago.  </P> <P> Currency traders characterized the Labor Department's consumer price index  report a non-event since it was largely within expectations.  </P> <P> Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.52 Japanese yen, up from 142.32.  Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 142.75 yen. In New York, the dollar  closed at 142.60 yen, down from 143.53 yen on Thursday.  </P> <P> In London, one British pound cost $1.5655 late Friday, more expensive for  buyers than Thursday's late $1.5590. In New York, one pound cost $1.5659, more  expensive than $1.5605 on Thursday.  </P> <P> Gold prices were higher overseas. In London, gold closed at $366.65 bid an  ounce, up from $366.35. The Zurich closing price was $366.75, up from $365.25.  Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $366.50 bid, up from $366.45.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Profit taking put an end to a seven-day run-up in copper futures prices Friday  on New York's Commodity Exchange but chart-watchers said technical signals  pointed toward further gains.  </P> <P> "This might actually help," analyst Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  said of the moderately steep decline. He said the market had fallen back to  prices it had skipped over on its way up and cited a theory that markets must  fill such gaps before resuming a trend.  </P> <P> On other futures markets Friday, futures prices for energy, grains, soybeans,  livestock and meat were mixed.  </P> <P> Copper settled 1.50 cents to 2.35 cents lower, with the contract for spot  delivery at $1.2465 a pound and the more actively traded September contract at  $1.2390.  </P> <P> Spot prices had climbed as high as $1.2680 on Thursday, which represented a  gain of more than 15% since Aug. 8.  </P> <P> The rally had been linked to indications that production problems, including  ongoing miner strikes in Canada and Peru, were beginning to make a dent in  copper stockpiles.  </P> <P> Analysts said Friday's decline was largely due to profit taking after the  nearly vertical run-up.  </P> <P> Platt said prospects for a settlement of the five-day-old Peruvian strike  appeared to be improving. He said the miners must return to work to qualify for  wage bonuses and some observers believe those bonuses are enough incentive to  bring the strike to an end.  </P> <P> But both Platt and Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal  &amp; Co., said the market continued to look strong from a technical  perspective.  </P> <P> Wheat and corn futures prices retreated on confirmation of large foreign  purchases of those grains while soybean futures closed higher following a  private forecast for a surprisingly small crop.  </P> <P> Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc. pegged the U.S soybean crop at 1.84  billion bushels compared to the Agriculture Department's estimate last week of  1.91 billion, and Sparks pegged the corn crop at 7.05 billion bushels compared  to the USDA's projected 7.35 billion.  </P> <P> Wheat settled 1.5 cents to 5 cents lower, with September at $3.9225 a bushel;  corn was unchanged to 1.25 cents lower, with September at $2.3475 a bushel;  oats were unchanged to 1.25 cents higher, with September at $1.3825 a bushel,  and soybeans were 4.25 cents lower to 7.75 cents higher, with August at $6.1575  a bushel.  </P> <P> Reports of a gasoline refinery shutdown in Venezuela boosted gasoline futures  prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P></p>

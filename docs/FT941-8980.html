			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Tunnel attackers face life sentences Terrorists attacking the Channel tunnel or trains could face life imprisonment, Mr Roger Freeman, public-transport minister, told the Commons yesterday. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, urged the government to ensure that British Transport Police would be in charge of security at passenger and freight terminals in the UK. Mr Freeman said the 'expertise and services' of British Transport Police would be at the disposal of those responsible for running trains through the Channel tunnel.</p>

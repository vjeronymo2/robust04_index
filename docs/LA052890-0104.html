			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASEBALL;  </P> <P> L.A. HARBOR BEATS CHABOT, GAINS FINAL  </P> <P> L.A. Harbor College held off a ninth-inning rally to defeat Chabot, 10-9,  Sunday to advance to today's championship of the state community college  baseball tournament at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Harbor led, 10-5, to start the ninth, when Chabot's Corey Quinn led off with a  double.  </P> <P> He scored on a single by Brian Thompson. A single by Barney Dion chased Harbor  starter Pat Ahearne, who was replaced by Chico Limas.  </P> <P> Aaron Ledesma lined a three-run home run off the scoreboard to cut the lead to  10-9. Limas got Chad Burns to fly out for the first out before being replaced  by John Ingram, who got the game's final two outs.  </P> <P> Chabot (43-11) also reached today's championship game by defeating Santa Rosa,  18-6, later Sunday.  </P> <P> Chabot and Harbor meet again today at 11, with Chabot having to win twice for  the title. A second game would follow, if necessary. Harbor (50-5) last won the  state title in 1984.  </P> <P> The ninth-inning home run Sunday was the 10th consecutive time Ledesma had  reached base safely in the tournament. His streak grew to 11 when he walked in  his first at-bat against Santa Rosa (32-19), but he flied out in the third  inning. Ledesma is nine for 12 with two home runs, three doubles, 10 runs  scored and 10 RBIs in three tournament games.  </P> <P> Santa Rosa defeated Riverside, 11-5, earlier Sunday to eliminate the Tigers  (32-17) from the tournament.

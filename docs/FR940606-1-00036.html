			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Electrodeposition, or metal plating, is an additive process for metal substrates in which another metal layer is added to the substrate in order to enhance corrosion and wear resistance necessary for the successful performance of the component. The two types of electrodeposition typically used are electroplating and plasma arc spraying.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP emissions from metal finishing operations occur in the form of gases or vapors that evaporate from the surface of processing solutions. Evaporation of solution also occurs from the parts as they are removed from the processing tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Coating Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A coating is a material that is applied to the surface of a part to form a decorative or functional solid film. The most common coatings are the broad categories of non-specialized primers and topcoats. There are also numerous specialty coatings ranging from temporary protective coatings to radiation effect coatings designed to shield aircraft from radar detection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coatings are applied to aerospace vehicles and components using several methods of application. The methods most commonly used are spraying, brushing, rolling, flow coating, and dipping. Spray application systems include conventional air spray, airless spray, air-assisted airless, electrostatic, and high volume low pressure (HVLP) spray. These latter two methods are generally accepted as having better transfer efficiency than other spraying methods and are gaining increased use as a means of using less coating and, hence, reducing emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nearly all aerospace coatings contain a mixture of organic solvents. Organic HAP emissions from coating application occur from the evaporation of the solvents during mixing, application, and drying. Inorganic HAP emissions of metal compounds (e.g., chromium and cadmium) also occur from overspray, which is exhausted from spray booths or paint spray hangars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Depainting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The depainting operation involves the removal of coatings from the outer surface of aircraft. The two basic depainting methods are chemical depainting and blast depainting. Chemical depainting agents are applied to the aircraft, allowed to degrade the coating, and then scraped or washed off with the coating residue. Blast depainting methods utilize a media such as plastic, wheat starch, carbon dioxide, or high pressure water to remove coatings by physically abrading the coatings from the surface of the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic HAP emissions from chemical depainting occur from evaporation of the solvents in the stripping solution. The amount of emissions from the process is directly related to the surface area being stripped, the type and thickness of coating to be removed, and the effectiveness of the stripper. Inorganic HAP emissions occur from the various blast depainting methods. The inorganic HAP are contained in the coatings being removed (trace amounts of inorganic HAP may also be found in some blast media) and are emitted as particulates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Composite Processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Composite processing consists of seven basic operations: Layup, thermal forming, debulking, curing, break-out, compression molding, and injection molding. Layup is the process of assembling the layers of the composite structure by positioning composite material in a mold and impregnating the material with a resin. Thermal forming is the process of forming the layup in a mold, which usually takes place in an autoclave. During the thermal forming process, debulking also may occur, which is the simultaneous application of low-level heat and pressure to the composite structure to force out excess resin, trapped air, vapor, and volatiles from between the layers of the composite structure. The curing step, which is the process of changing the resin into a solid material through a polymerization reaction, also occurs in the autoclave. After curing and removal from the autoclave, the break-out process removes the composite structure from the molds or curing fixtures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two other methods of forming composite structures are compression molding and injection molding. Compression molding is the process of filling one half of a mold with a molding compound, closing the mold, and applying heat and pressure until the material is cured. Injection molding uses a closed mold, where the molding compound is injected into the mold, maintained under pressure, and then cured by applying heat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic HAP emissions from composite processing occur from volatilization of a small portion of the solvent components during curing, because the majority of these solvents are consumed in the curing reaction of the resin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nearly every aerospace manufacturing and rework operation has the potential to generate wastewater. For example, metal finishing operations use water to rinse parts after each processing step. These rinse steps are typically carried out in large tanks with either a continuous or intermittent water flow. The wastewater generated is usually treated to some extent at the facility, then discharged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

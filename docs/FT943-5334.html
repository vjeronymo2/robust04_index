			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Monks speaks out for signal workers Britain's striking signal workers will receive massive support this week from the Trades Union Congress which opens in Blackpool today. Union leaders were rallying around the RMT transport union's cause last night. Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, addressing a thinly-attended pre-congress meeting, said: 'This is a thoroughly modern strike. It is fully balloted, fully legal, overwhelmingly supported by signal workers and strongly supported by the public. 'There are people who are trying to divide congress by saying the RMT's strike is a throwback to old-fashioned trade unionism and at odds with what the new TUC aims to do. They are wrong.' He added: 'People who say that strikes like this should be a thing of the past are right. But that's a message for the government and Railtrack. It is only a bad employer - in this case backed by a hostile government - who can't settle differences with their employees by negotiating fairly and openly. 'The new TUC does not stand for cosying up to employers,' he said. 'It stands for confronting employers with ideas and debate. But at the end of the day where unions have strong muscle we will support them.' Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, told the rally that Mr Robert Horton, the Railtrack chairman, should stop his 'macho games'. 'Give us a proper acceptable interim offer. Then we'll discuss the future,' he said. Mr Knapp added that government ministers should get their 'fingers out of the pie'. He said: 'Let Railtrack meet us openly and honestly and we'll do a deal.' Aslef, the train drivers' union, is to move a motion calling for an immediate public inquiry by the Health and Safety Commission into the safety aspects of the dispute. The conflict will be debated by delegates on Thursday, when the next 24-hour strike by signal workers is to take place. Mr Horton last night launched a new attack on the RMT for its 'stubborn resistance' to change, saying the current dispute was not just about a pay claim but about how a vital industry and its workers tackled change.

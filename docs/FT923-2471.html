			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / France and Maastricht: Gamblers bet on Yes vote IG INDEX, the London financial bookmaker, was last night quoting a 53.25 per cent Yes vote in bets it is taking on the French referendum result, Our Foreign Staff writes. It showed a marginal rise from 53 per cent recorded in the previous two days but was down from its peak of a 56 per cent Yes on September 7 and 8. The low point was a 50 per cent dead heat on August 25. Bettors specify the outcome they expect when placing their stake. Winners are repaid this amount for each percentage point between the result and the level they were quoted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PvdA Banks on Prime Ministership in </F> Cabinet With D66"]    [Text] Amsterdam -- The PvdA [Labor Party] is counting on  gaining influence now that it has become the biggest party in  the country. The loss in votes compared to the parliamentary  elections of four and one-half years ago is significantly large.  But on Tuesday evening [3 May], leading figures in the party  referred to the possibility that the PvdA would provide the  prime minister for a new cabinet consisting of the progressive  majority together with D66 [Democrats 66].    For that reason, T. Woeltgens, the former chairman of the  Parliamentary Party, spoke of a "victorious defeat." He said  that the situation was the opposite to that in 1986, when the  PvdA gained five seats but could not win governmental power.  The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], which at the time made  bigger gains than the PvdA, continued to govern with the VVD  [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]. Since then, the  PvdA has regarded 1986 as an "election defeat."    Jacques Wallage, the PvdA's second in command, cautiously  anticipated that his party's defeat will be of lesser importance  for the formation of government. Not only because the PvdA was  the biggest party, but also because "there has been a  fragmentation of both the Left and the Right." Wallage also  counted on close cooperation with D66 in the formation of a new  cabinet.    Interior Minister Van Thijn said that it was "virtually  inevitable" that Wim Kok would become the new prime minister.  "There are three reasons for that," he said, counting them off  on his fingers.    "One: the PvdA is the biggest party. Two: in opinion polls  a majority of the people have always indicated that they saw Kok  as their preferred candidate. Three: no one else is such an  old hand at politics as Kok."    Woeltgens referred to the past again when he said that Kok  had a good chance of getting the highest office. "In 1973, Den  Uyl became prime minister even though the PvdA was smaller than  the Christian parties," he said.    No PvdA leader could be tempted into making quick comments  about the combination of parties necessary to form a new  cabinet. Van Thijn, known for his role as negotiator in the  1977 cabinet formation, does not expect "the formation process  to last long. But the problem in the formation is that it will  be a three-party cabinet."    Like Wallage, Woeltgens, and Kok, he is assuming that the  PvdA will work with D66 and choose the CDA or VVD as a third  party. Both possibilities are acceptable, as long as agreement  on programs can be reached, it is said.    It is not clear to everyone within the PvdA whether such a  cabinet could be called left wing. Paul Kalma, a member of the  PvdA's scientific bureau, said that "the Left as a whole has  lost."    He referred to the results of his own party and those of  Green Left, and apparently concluded that the gains of D66 were  an insufficient counterbalance. Woeltgens left the question  unresolved, saying that "D66 calls itself progressive in any  case."    Cooperation and Development Minister Jan Pronk refused to be  dragged along by the euphoric mood among his colleagues. "Kok  as prime minister?" he said. "Something like that must be  decided in the negotiations. It could be more difficult than  many people think at present."    Nor would Pronk hazard any predictions about the  configuration of the new cabinet and whether the "progressive  bloc" of the PvdA and D66, which his colleagues are talking  about, could dominate such a cabinet. "Every combination is  possible," he said. "Especially now that the four biggest  parties do not differ in size from one another so much."    Will the CDA be able to content itself with a subordinate  role in a cabinet where D66 and the PvdA form the majority?  Outgoing Minister Van Thijn did not want to talk in terms of  subordinate or dominant.    Separately from that question, he regarded the psychological  objections in the CDA as not insurmountable. "The present  political leaders take a business-like attitude," he said.  "They can make quick decisions."    The theoretical possibility that the AOV [General  Association  of Elderly People] could play a role in the upcoming government  formation is regarded as small. "You do not veto anything in  advance," Wallage said, "but a cabinet has to make decisions  about many things. A party which represents only one interest  does not fit logically."</p>

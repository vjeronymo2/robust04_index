			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK'S FINEST ANSWER A NEW CALL;  </P> <P> ORGANIZATIONS: RETIRED NYPD OFFICERS WHO MOVED TO CALIFORNIA HAVE SET UP THEIR  OWN '10-13' CLUB TO MEET THEIR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS.  </P> <P> Theirs is an unspoken, unbreakable bond, a "blood brother" kinship nurtured  3,000 miles away on the streets of New York City.  </P> <P> For years, these four men -- Joe Vanderhoff, Jerry Murphy, Frank Lamden and  Jack Feehan -- worked as New York City cops, patrolling some of most desolate  and deadly neighborhoods in the Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn, handling  everything from domestic violence and robberies to riots.  </P> <P> Then, when each retired from the New York City force and sought escape from the  sweltering summers and freezing winters, the frenetic pace and the overwhelming  blight, each moved West and resettled in Southern California to take on new  jobs and start new lives.  </P> <P> "Living out here is like paradise, a Shangri-La," said Murphy, 51, who served  22 years as a NYPD patrolman. "You know what? Every morning, I face Sacramento  and kiss the ground."  </P> <P> Despite his offhanded, jovial comment, Murphy, like the others, knows also that  the memories of their days on the force can still haunt them -- 3,000 miles  away.  </P> <P> Vanderhoff, 42, a patrolman who retired in 1980 after suffering line-of-duty  injuries, put it this way: "All of us have seen enough blood and death and  human suffering to last a lifetime. A lot of it never really leaves you."  </P> <P> Which helps explain why these four Orange County men have become members of a  highly specialized, little-known organization called the California 10-13 Club.  </P> <P> Indeed, in a society that seems to have a support group for virtually every  conceivable cause, the California 10-13 Club is one of the most unusual yet: a  group exclusively for retired officers of the New York City police force.  </P> <P> True, this 250-member club, whose members are mostly from San Diego, Orange and  Los Angeles counties, has its social side -- a time for rollicking,  alumni-styled joking and remembering of good times.  </P> <P> But the club also serves a solemn role. Quietly and behind the scenes, the  group acts as a support network for members in mental or physical distress,  including those suffering traumas from having worked in one of the most  harrowing of jobs.  </P> <P> This function of the club is written into the group's name, "10-13," which is  the NYPD's radio code for "officer needs assistance."  </P> <P> "No matter who our guys are, no matter where they live," Vanderhoff explained,  "we answer their call for help -- just as if we were still out there with them  on the city streets."  </P> <P> During all their years on the New York City force and their early years in  Orange County, these four retired officers had never met.  </P> <P> "It's not surprising when you think about it. I mean, New York is a big city,  and we had 30,000 men on the force. And when you moved out here, the guys just  seemed to vanish," said Feehan, 58, who retired in 1972 as a sergeant after 18  years on the NYPD force.  </P> <P> Four years ago, Feehan and the others met when California 10-13 Club  organizers, using a NYPD retiree roster, mailed club flyers throughout the  state.  </P> <P> In fact, the biggest surprise for these police expatriates was the sizable  numbers of retired officers found in California. Out of the 250 club members,  55 are in Orange County, 20 in Los Angeles County, 150 in San Diego County --  the rest scattered as far as Northern California.  </P> <P> "I never thought there were that many out here," said Lamden, 51, who spent 16  years as a NYPD patrolman. "You figure Florida, yeah, because that's always  been a New Yorker retiree colony. But not this far, not 3,000 miles away."  </P> <P> Although the California 10-13 Club has grown steadily since 1986, particularly  in San Diego and Orange counties, it is still overshadowed by the vastly larger  memberships in New York State (10,000 members) and in Florida (6,000 members),  where the first club was founded 12 years ago in the Palm Beach area.  </P> <P> "We're still the only club network like this in the nation -- one that is only  for the retired members of a single city police department," said California  10-13 Club president Norman Finkelstein, 47, of San Diego, a retired police  lieutenant. (Prospective members can call him at (619) 232-1815; the next  meeting is Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. in the El Toro Marine Corp Air Station officers  club.).  </P> <P> The membership age range in California, typical of all the 10-13 clubs, is 40s  to 80s. About a third work at other jobs, such as private attorneys --  Finkelstein is one -- as private or public investigators or as businessmen.  </P> <P> For example, Orange County member Feehan is a welfare-fraud investigator for  Orange County. Murphy is a partner in a surveillance and legal services firm.  Lamden is a private security guard. And Vanderhoff, who has worked as a federal  Treasury investigator, is now studying law.  </P> <P> Like the other "10-13" clubs, the California group also serves as an advocate  for improving retirement-benefit programs.  </P> <P> But it is as an emotional support group that the club has had its most poignant  moments. The California contingent has provided 10-13 Club honor guards at  funerals for members. It has assisted families of deceased members for things  like housing relocation. It has kept in close touch with critically ill  members, including those suffering from cancer, strokes or Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> And there are the visits with members who have undergone major emotional  disruptions that can be traced directly to the darkest memories from their time  on the New York City beat.  </P> <P> "It's no secret that this kind of mental stress can be devastating -- the  occupational hazard of just being a cop," said Vanderhoff. "Our kind of job has  resulted in one of the highest divorce, alcoholism and suicide rates of any  field."  </P> <P> "So we have (club members) who need one-on-one help -- to be able to talk their  problems out, to deal with them by sharing with other officers," added Murphy.  </P> <P> Murphy remembers this kind of relentless stress all too well.  </P> <P> "You couldn't escape it. It was all around you. The stabbings, the shootings,  the bodies," said Murphy. "But cops are like anyone else. After a while, all  this takes its toll. You begin to hurt. You begin to bleed -- mentally."  </P> <P> Feehan depicted it this way: "You learned, emotionally, to try and throw up a  protective wall. You tried to leave it when you got off your shift. But it  became harder and harder to turn off. To really forget.  </P> <P> "I still have a lot of my old case notebooks," he added. "But I never go  through them. There's too many bad memories in them -- incidents that I want to  put out of my mind."  </P> <P> Vanderhoff still remembers with painfully vivid detail his involvement in four  shoot-outs -- especially the first one, after a taxi-garage holdup during which  the dispatcher had been shot.  </P> <P> "We were chasing down the three guys. Each of them was armed. Then one of them  stopped and fired right at me," recalled Vanderhoff. "The bullet just grazed my  head. It was that close. I fired back, killing him."  </P> <P> For years, said Vanderhoff, "I had the feeling that I would never survive as a  cop, that I would be killed in my 30s or 40s. I even had my cemetery plot all  picked out -- I was that sure. I never thought I would live long enough to  retire."  </P> <P> Today, 3,000 miles away, some of the memories of being police officers are now  calmer, more personally rewarding for these California 10-13 Club members.  </P> <P> "I always felt we were doing something for the social good, for the whole  community, despite all the digs some people have made about police. We had a  real purpose," said Lamden. "It was a feeling that stuck with you, a real sense  of job satisfaction. It helped carry you through the bad days."  </P> <P> For some, this sense of pride in being a cop showed in the job lineage.  Vanderhoff wore the same shield (badge), No. 5348, that his paternal  grandfather, Francis, also a NYPD patrolman, had worn.  </P> <P> Murphy's two sons, Dennis, 27, and Timothy, 25, are on the New York City force,  as well as Timothy's wife, Anne Marie. And Dennis is wearing his father's old  shield, No. 8745.  </P> <P> Murphy's feelings are mixed about this. "I was real proud of them because they  picked my profession. It was reaffirmation for me and my profession -- because  I really loved that job," he said.  </P> <P> At the same time, "I was furious when they told me they wanted to join the  force," Murphy said. "I had always wanted something better for them. Hell, I  didn't want them to go out on the streets . . . "  </P> <P> Such darker memories resurface whenever Murphy and the others read of a slain  law enforcement officer.  </P> <P> This was the case last June , when Fullerton police officer Tommy De La Rosa,  43, an undercover narcotics agent, was shot to death in Downey in an ambush.  </P> <P> The funeral was attended by more than 5,000 fellow officers, including Murphy.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I wanted to be there," said Murphy, who that day had proudly pinned his  old NYPD No. 8745 to his dark civilian suit.  </P> <P> Quietly, Murphy added: "Sure, I had to be there -- to represent the 10-13 Club  guys. He was our blood brother, too."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hitotsubashi University Professor Yukio Noguchi] </F>   [Text] Although in a declining trend in recent days,  long-term interest rates have been rising since the beginning of  the year. Frequent concern has been voiced that the trend may  delay the economic recovery.    However, such views are wrong. The reason is that the cause  of rising interest rates is based on the expansion of government  spending as part of the comprehensive economic package. Even if  the effects of expanded effective demand based on government  spending are erased by rising interest rates, we should not  experience additional negative effects.    In reality, it is not unusual for government spending to  cause a rise in interest rates. In fact, that phenomenon  conforms with the theory of macroeconomics. In closed economies  which shut off transactions with outside economies, rising  interest rates lead to constraints on private-sector investments  and, as a result, the effects of effective demand created by  government spending is erased. This phenomenon is called  "crowding out."    In open economies such as that of Japan where capital  transactions with foreign nations are unregulated, rising  interest rates, assuming unchanging interest rates in other  nations, causes an inflow of capital. This causes Japan's  currency to rise in value and for a shrinkage of international  payments surpluses. In other words, the crowding out of foreign  demand results in erasure of the effects of effective demand  expansion based on government spending.    There is the possibility that actual trends will not follow  this scenario because U.S. interest rates are rising sharply  during this cycle, although there will be the effect that the  yen will rise if Japan does not expand its government spending.    However, during spring of 1993, the situation developed  along  the lines of the above theory. First, under the comprehensive  economic package a conspicuous increase in public works  investments was implemented from the fall of 1992. Increases of  3.4 percent and 7.0 percent were recorded in the third and  fourth quarters of fiscal year 1992 over the same periods the  prior year. During that period those increases were in sharp  contrast with negative growth in private-sector investments.  However, long-term interest rates began to rise in February and  the value of the yen rose in foreign exchange markets. And, the  international payments surplus shrank substantially by 27.1  percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 1993 below the same  period in 1992. Gross domestic product showed negative growth  during the period.    Thus, in those economies where interest rates float freely,  government spending increases do not have an expansionary effect  on the economy. Accordingly, there is no significance in  expanding government spending for the sake of economic measures,  while the same can be said of cuts in income taxes.    However, this is not to say that expansions in government  spending are unnecessary. The reason is that shrinkage of the  international balance of payments surpluses translates into the  diversion of capital from overseas investments to domestic  capital formation, especially social capital formation. Looking  at the situation in Japan today, such a trend is desirable.    The reason for that statement is that Japan's social capital  is in such a miserable condition. This can be said most aptly in  terms of social capital governing lifestyles in urban areas.  Sewer systems, road systems, and neighborhood parks are  inadequate, while commuter trains provide conditions which are  basically inhuman. Fortunately, Japan today has the  macroeconomic resources to invest in such areas. The reason for  that is that the savings rate is high, which is exemplified by  none other than the international payments surpluses.    Aging of the population will lead to the rapid decline in  those favorable conditions. It is our responsibility in relation  to future generations to improve social capital and leave a  legacy of quality assets, while the savings rates are still high.</p>

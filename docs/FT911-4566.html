			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Observer: OAP directors What does Sir Lindsay Alexander (ex-chairman of Ocean Transport) have in common with Sir James Hamilton (former top civil servant), Sir Rowland Wright (ex-ICI chairman) and Quinton Hazell (who founded the company of the same name)? Apart from getting a bit long in the tooth, they are all well-worn directors of Hawker Siddeley who, unusually, have been promised an annual pension of Pounds 7,000 apiece on retirement. It is the cosy sort of deal which would probably not be allowed in the statement of best practice for directors which the Institutional Shareholders' Committee is due to release later today. Non-executive directors are supposed to be independent souls. Awarding them pensions might be thought to mar their impartiality. Hawker says the pensions reflect undertakings previously given to the directors concerned. In future, remuneration receivable by non-executive directors will not be pensionable. About time too.</p>

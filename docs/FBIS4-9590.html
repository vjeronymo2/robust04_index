			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Momcilovic: "The Courage and Risk of </F> Mesokombinat in Leskovac"]    [Text] Leskovac, 5 April -- Mesokombinat of Leskovac has  become the new boss of the sheep farm on Cemernik, above Crna  Trava, whose capacity has been increased to 4,000 head following  reconstruction. This move on the part of the people from  Leskovac is risky and brave, to say the least, since that farm  -- in which the republic invested immense sums -- has never  operated as it should have. The original investor was the work  force of Vlasine-Produkt of Surdilica, which at one time was  raising a herd of more than 2,000 sheep there.    Crnotravka of Sastav Reka, the only agricultural  organization  in Crna Trava Opstina, which is close to the farm, expressed a  willingness to take it over, provided of course it was fitted  out for the sheep to overwinter. The republic had nothing  against that, and it opened its purse for reconstruction of the  farm, but Crnotravka, which at that time was part of Delisec of  Vladin Han, was not able to develop livestock raising. The farm  was vacant for two years, neglected and fleeced to the point  where now investments are being made to equip it for the third  time.  <H5>  Inexpensive Source of Raw Materials </H5>   A farm on Vlasina experienced a similar destiny. When  brucellosis decimated the herd, the people of Surdulica threw up  their hands, and Simpo of Vranje jumped in and is now  undertaking the development of livestock raising along with  other things.    "We are going into the hill-and-mountain region of Crna  Trava, we are taking over abandoned facilities in order to round  out the process of primary production and processing. We are  creating an inexpensive source of raw materials for the  production of livestock feed; we want to make full use of the  natural resources of this region," says Sreten Ristic, director  of Mesokombinat and people's deputy in the Yugoslav Assembly.    Mesokombinat, Ristic adds, intends to develop livestock  raising which will include not only the sheep farm on Cemernik,  but also small, private sheep and dairy farms, and plans also  call for a small horse farm to meet the needs of tourism. Plans  also call for production of seed potatoes and silage corn, for  which the conditions are ideal, and in the abandoned fittings  factory in Crna Trava they will open a plant for processing  herbs and edible forest products. Plans call for building a  drier and cooler in that facility, and in the future they will  have an operation to produce fruit juices and jams.    Crna Trava is ecologically clean, and we will adopt a clean  processing operation that will not threaten the environment. We  will be involved with mushrooms, blueberries, medicinal herbs,  and other edible forest products, Ristic said.    "We are investing in the natural resources, while  Mesokombinat is investing knowledge and money. We want to  preserve what has been achieved in the past, to employ new  people, and to halt the migration," says Milos Jovasevic,  manager of Crnotravka.  <H5>  There Is No Livestock Feed </H5>   They do not seem to be very worried at Mesokombinat about  going to a place from which others have fled.    "The main problem is livestock feed. We have already  undertaken to revitalize the neglected soil, and we have begun  improvement of a 380-hectare pasture. We have also prepared 30  hectares of land for the production of seed potatoes and silage  corn. In this area there are about 3,000 hectares of forests,  pastures, and plowland. All of this is neglected, but it can be  put into shape," Sreten Ristic warns.    "Mesokombinat's advantage is that it has its own retail  network, so that the route of the finished product to the  customer will be shorter, and that also means cheaper. Aside  from creating a source of raw materials for their processing  plants, this well-known producer and processor of meat will also  be involved in a health food program. The Crna Trava climate  offers excellent conditions for the production of milk, yogurt,  and Kackavalj cheese.    When it completes all these projects, which are already  underway, Mesokombinat will round out conditions for development  of rural tourism in the area of Crna Trava.</p>

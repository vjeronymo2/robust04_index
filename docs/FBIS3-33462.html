			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Alvin Guthrie Rivers] </F>   [Text] After the elections of 25 February 1990, the date on  which the people elected the president and vice president of  Nicaragua, the representatives to the National Assembly, the  members of the regional councils of the Autonomous Regions of  the Atlantic Coast, and the members of the municipal councils  (in the latter case, only on the Pacific Coast), we, the  citizens and residents of the Atlantic Coast, were the first  Nicaraguans to participate in an election campaign and later, in  elections for members of the regional councils, in the RAAN as  well as the RAAS, which make up the Atlantic Coast with  approximately 50 percent of the national territory and 10  percent of the national population.    It should be noted that in the RAAS, for the purpose of  elections, Article 84 of the existing Election Law divided our  region into 15 districts. By means of universal, equal, direct,  free, secret voting, the people will elect three councilmen in  each until 45 members have been chosen to make up our Regional  Council, this in accordance with Article 19 of Law 28, known as  the Statute on the Autonomy of the Regions of the Atlantic Coast  of Nicaragua. One unique feature is that in Zone 8, which  includes Haulover, Rocky Point, Laguna de Perlas, Raitipura,  Kakabila, Set Net, and Tasbapauni, the first candidate on all  the lists presented by the political parties, alliances, and  associations supported by the people must be Misquito. In Zone  9, which includes the Corn Islands, the first candidate must be  Creole or "Criollo" or, as they say on the Pacific Coast, a  Black candidate, a term that is pejorative in our region.    In Zone 10, which includes the mouth of the Rio Grande, the  first candidate must be a Sumo. In Zone 11, made up of Brown  Bank, La Fe, San Vicente, Orinoco, Marshall Point and Wawashang,  the first candidate must be a Garifono. In Zone 12, which  includes the area of the Rama and the communities of Ramacay,  Turswani, Dukunu, Cane Creek, Punta Aguila, Monkey Point, and  Wiring Cay, the first candidate must be a Rama. Finally, in the  area of El Tortuguero, the first candidate must be a Mestizo.  The purpose of all this is to guarantee the presence on the  Regional Council, which is the highest legislative authority by  virtue of its resolutions and ordinances, of the six ethnic  groups that survive in our region and that are, in sum, the  following: the Mestizo, Misquito, Creole or Criollo, Sumu,  Garifon ethnic groups, or peoples and their branches, who  obviously wish to join in the development of the Atlantic Coast  by preserving their own culture.    In my opinion, the Supreme Election Council, together with  the regional, municipal, and communal authorities, continue to  conduct a civic crusade to see that all participants respect the  existing Election Law, the regulation of election ethics and the  statute on autonomy. They do so in order that the elections on  the Atlantic Coast, which are obviously a prelude to the  national elections in 1996, will become a civic event in which  voters may freely debate their ideas and in which our people may  vote for the government platforms that are the best supported  and most viable. In other words, they wish to ensure that  persuasion and conviction take the place of the threats and  coercion of decades past and thus continue to build in practice  the state of law that we coastal residents and Nicaraguans in  general have dreamed of for centuries, bearing in mind the words  of Jose Marti to the effect that men who love build and those  who hate destroy. We coastal dwellers must not hate one another,  when the idea is for all of us to join together in solving our  problems: the lack of infrastructure, jobs, food programs,  housing construction, clothes, medicine, health centers, and  education, all in keeping with our social realities.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Smaller civil service forecast The top civil servant in the Office of Public Service and Science yesterday predicted a 'generally smaller' government and civil service in the mid-1990s with its functions limited to the essentials. Mr Richard Mottram, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office responsible for carrying out the government's public-service reform initiatives, said government would concentrate on a few core functions over the next few years  -resource allocation, strategic and policy issues, procurement of services, and essential finance and personnel work. He acknowledged this amounted to a 'very large challenge in raising quality and reducing costs' - but defended progress to date in putting out to tender Pounds 1.5bn of work done by departments. Mr Mottram, addressing the Royal United Services Institute, said about Pounds 1bn of work had been hived off since last November - either contracted out or entrusted to executive agencies - with a further Pounds 800m due to be allocated in the current year. On the defence sector, Mr Mottram - who previously served in the Ministry of Defence - said there was still scope for reform.</p>

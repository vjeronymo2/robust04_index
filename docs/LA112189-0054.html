			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. TO APPEAL JURY'S AWARD TO FIRED  OFFICER  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles announced Monday that it is appealing a federal jury  award of $154,747 to a police officer who was fired three years ago after he  refused to give police investigators a urine sample to be used to test for drug  use. He was subsequently reinstated.  </P> <P> Instead of giving the sample to police on Feb. 21, 1986, Officer Johnny Lee  Jackson had the drug test done at a private hospital. It came up negative, but  Jackson was fired for insubordination for not submitting to the original order.  A six-member jury sided with Jackson on Sept. 14 after deliberating two days.  </P> <P> The city's appeal, said Deputy City Atty. Arthur B. Walsh, is based on its  continued belief that the Police Department had the right to demand the sample.  Neither Jackson nor his attorney could be reached for comment.  </P></p>

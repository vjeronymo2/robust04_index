			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BAA Despite BAA's 49 per cent profits increase, it is hard to argue that its shares are undervalued. Viewed as a retailer, BAA already trades on a similar forward multiple to Marks and Spencer. As a property company, it is on much the same discount to net assets as MEPC. As a loosely-regulated monopoly, BAA yields considerably less than the electricity supply companies. Stripped of exceptional charges, its underlying profits increase last year was just 7 per cent. Since BAA's earnings are likely to grow more slowly than the market average over the next two years, it is easy to understand its recent share price softness. Still, it would be unwise to dismiss BAA's attractions altogether. Last year, the company made impressive productivity gains - largely by shrinking its workforce by 19 per cent. Expanding its retailing activities is also proving lucrative given the marginal costs involved, although its reliance on duty free sales is a concern. Any company making Pounds 324m of operating profits from Pounds 952m of revenue must be on to a good thing. That, in turn, suggests the CAA, BAA's regulator, has been too soft despite its formula for airport charges of RPI minus 8 percentage points. In three years' time, BAA will be even better off. It will be able to charge RPI minus 1 percentage point. Calls for a tighter regime will then be tempered by the need for BAA to fund Heathrow's fifth terminal. Shareholders would doubly rue a more rigorous regulator if BAA had to ask them for the cash.</p>

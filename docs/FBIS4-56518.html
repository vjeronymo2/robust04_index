			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said today that  Chile is putting the finishing touches on an agreement to link  up with the Common Market of the South, Mercosur.    Figueroa explained that Mercosur is seen by the great powers  and by international investors as one of the most interesting  centers for investment. Mercosur includes the two largest South  American countries, Argentina and Brazil, which are Chile's main  trade partners.    [Begin Figueroa recording] In all of the bilateral meetings  between the Mercosur country presidents and then President  Patricio Aylwin, and now with President Eduardo Frei, the  Mercosur countries' interest in having Chile become a member has  been very clear. [end recording]    Figueroa said that the decision regarding Mercosur cannot be  delayed. He explained, however, that Chile cannot join Mercosur  as a member due to the high tariff rate of that common market.  This is why, he said, the Foreign Ministry is preparing a  formula to reach an agreement with Mercosur as a whole.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / ITV may take legal action to change timing of News At Ten THE ITV companies have not yet ruled out a legal challenge to the insistence of the Independent Television Commission that News At Ten has to stay in its traditional time slot. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV companies, told the Commons national heritage committee yesterday that ITV had obtained a legal opinion which disagreed with the ITC's interpretation of the law. On Wednesday the commission wrote to all ITV chairmen warning that the companies would be in breach of their licences if the programme was moved without permission. Mr Dyke told the committee: 'We will not rush off to law. We will not rush into a decision.' It is clear, however, that challenging the ITC's interpretation of the law will be one of the options at Monday's meeting of the ITV council, when the News At Ten issue is discussed. Mr Dyke, who is also chief executive of London Weekend Television, told MPs he did not believe his company was commited to running News at Ten in its present slot. The commitment, he believed, was to run a main news in prime time, which the ITC has defined as 6.30pm to 10.30pm. Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Network Centre, set out the commercial case for moving News At Ten. At 10pm, Mr Quinn said, BBC, Channel 4 and BSkyB were eating into ITV ratings. In May an ITV audience share of 46 per cent at 9pm fell to 35 per cent at 10pm - and the audience was older and less up-market. Mr Quinn added that advertisers were prepared to pay a premium of up to 100 per cent to advertise in programmes such as Inspector Morse instead of News At Ten. The audience for News At Ten is volatile - in the week ending June 6 the audience ranged from 9.8m to 3.7m when scheduled against the BBC's 999. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central, told MPs that this year ITV would pay the government a total of Pounds 367m. Under the old levy system the total would have been Pounds 150m. On the News At Ten issue, MPs expressed surprise that ITV was trying to make such a fundamental change only six months into new franchises.</p>

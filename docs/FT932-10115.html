			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Education department denies test clash THE Department for Education last night vehemently denied reports that tests for 14-year-old pupils were not to be compulsory this year. Signs late yesterday that Mr John Major was considering a compromise on the tests, which are due to be start next month, seemed to contradict Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Yesterday he insisted that national curriculum tests in schools will go ahead this year, in spite of opinion polls showing that a majority of parents thought they should be abandoned. 'If we were to bring these reforms juddering to a halt now, I believe we will find them extremely difficult to get back on the road again,' Mr Patten said. The education department said last night: 'It is not an option to call off the tests for this year. They come at the end of three years' compulsory schooling, they provide useful diagnostic information to parents and on top of that they will be useful in the review of the national curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing.' Two teachers' unions, the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, are boycotting the tests. The largest, the National Union of Teachers, is expected to join them when it announces the results of its ballot on a test boycott on Thursday. Mr Patten, speaking on the BBC's Today programme, denied that last week's setbacks for the government in the Newbury by-election and the county council elections meant that the tests should be made voluntary. He said: 'We are at a critical moment in the introduction of our education reforms. Sometimes the price of success is a period of unpopularity.' The department yesterday stepped up the publicity campaign supporting the tests by distributing an information pack called 'Testing: The Facts'. The pack, which has been sent to trade unions, employers' organisations, universities and church leaders, says that testing is inseparable from the process of introducing a national curriculum. Two polls published yesterday showed parents supporting the claim by teachers that the tests should be abandoned. In another setback for the government, the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations has voted to ballot its members on a boycott by parents of the tests. The department ruled out making tests for 11- and 14-year-olds voluntary, citing majorities among parents of 85 and 82 per cent respectively in favour of these tests in the survey in The Independent newspaper yesterday. Sir Ron Dearing, who has been appointed by Mr Patten to review the curriculum and testing, tried to distance himself from the political row surrounding the tests. Four weeks ago he called for the tests to go ahead to provide him with information to improve them next year. Yesterday, he said: 'I don't think it's for me to get involved in what has become an industrial relations issue.'</p>

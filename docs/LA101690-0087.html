			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHEROKEE SCRAPS $40-MILLION INITIAL PUBLIC STOCK OFFERING;  </P> <P> APPAREL: THE SUNLAND FASHION MANUFACTURER CITES WALL STREET'S SLIDE IN  CANCELING THE SALE.  </P> <P> Cherokee Inc., citing the stock market's severe slump, said it scrapped plans  to go public with a $40-million-plus stock offering.  </P> <P> The decision was not a surprise. Cherokee, a privately owned Sunland apparel  maker that specializes in women's sports clothing, had said last month that  unless the market enjoyed a quick rebound, the company would probably cancel  its offering.  </P> <P> Many companies, in fact, have been forced to withdraw or postpone initial  public offerings because of the market's slide. Investors, especially  institutional investors such as pension funds, are refusing to buy new untested  issues at a time when even the market's blue chip stocks are taking a pounding.  </P> <P> Cherokee was particularly vulnerable because of the inherent fickleness of the  fashion business, and the checkered health of the apparel industry's customers,  the retailers. However, some analysts have said Cherokee's primary customers,  such as the Mervyn's department-store unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., are in  relatively good shape.  </P> <P> Some aspects of Cherokee's offering also might have put off some investors.  Cherokee offered 4 million shares of Class B stock that it expected to sell for  between $10 and $12 a share, raising between $40 million and $48 million.  </P> <P> However, the Class B shares would have had only a 10th of a vote each, compared  with the full vote accorded each of Cherokee's Class A shares, which are held  by Cherokee's current owners and executives. In other words, buyers of the  Class B stock would have contributed significant equity to Cherokee, but would  have had very little impact on Cherokee's governance.  </P> <P> Cherokee planned to use the offering's proceeds to whittle down its debt, which  totaled $171.1 million as of June 2, when its fiscal year ended. (In fiscal  1990, Cherokee lost $224,000 on sales of $208.6 million; the loss stemmed from  $28.1 million in debt interest costs.) Now, the company will have to find other  means of paring the debt.  </P> <P> Most of the debt was incurred last year, when a group led by Cherokee  executives and investment banker Jeffrey S. Deutschman bought the then-publicly  held company from its stockholders in a $174-million leveraged buyout. In a  leveraged buyout, the company is purchased with mostly borrowed money secured  by the company's assets.  </P> <P> Cherokee had stated in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that  even without the offering, the company's operations generate enough cash to  cover Cherokee's debt payments.  </P> <P> The canceled offering also means Cherokee President Robert Margolis and  Cherokee's other owners will be deprived of a paper profit of more than $40  million. The executives were not planning to sell their stock in the offering,  but had the sale gone through, the market value of their stock -- at $10 to $12  a share -- would have been $40 million higher than what they originally paid  for the shares.  </P> <P> But Cherokee's executives aren't hurting. Cherokee paid Margolis a $1.2-million  bonus in fiscal 1990 in addition to his $400,000 salary, according to  Cherokee's annual financial report to the SEC. All of Cherokee's eight  executive officers were paid a total of $2.84 million in bonuses that year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC TOUCHDOWN CONJURES UP BITTER MEMORIES  </P> <P> Why can't USC win the big games?  </P> <P> 1. No discipline. When Notre Dame has a dumb, stupid penalty, Lou Holtz pulls  the player and chews his butt on the sidelines. Why doesn't Larry (Smith) do  the same?  </P> <P> 2. No replacement for the quarterback. When will USC have a Nelson-Beathard  combo again? In baseball, pitchers are recognized as having bad days requiring  relief. Why not with USC football?  </P> <P> V. B. KNIGHT, South Laguna  </P></p>

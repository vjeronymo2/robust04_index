			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Canada base plan for satellite launch A GROUP of Canadian investors plans to revitalise the far-northern grain port of Churchill, Manitoba, by building the world's first privately owned satellite launch centre there. Akjuit Aerospace said it already had funds to complete preliminary engineering studies for the CDollars 250m (Pounds 126m) project, which involves refurbishing and expanding a disused rocket range. Churchill is on the western shore of Hudson Bay and best known for polar bears and Beluga whales. The 'spaceport' is predicated on a surge in demand for small telecommunications satellites in polar orbits a few hundred miles above the earth. Ms Siobhan Mullen, Akjuit president, declined to name potential customers. Among the companies planning communications satellite networks are Motorola, Iridium, Loral, and Orbital Sciences Corporation. Churchill is competing for the small-satellite business with launch sites in California, Alaska, Australia, the CIS, Sweden and Norway. Ms Mullen predicted no more than two polar spaceports will be commercially viable - 'whoever gets there first, wins.' Akjuit's chairman is Mr George Richardson, a prominent Winnipeg businessman. Its board includes a former chief executive of Telsat Canada, the government's satellite agency, and the head of Bombardier Capital, a finance subsidiary of the Montreal-based transport equipment group. Local aboriginal groups are involved in the project. Akjuit aims to begin satellite launches from Churchill by late-1995. The facility will accommodate rockets with payloads of up to 6,000 pounds.</p>

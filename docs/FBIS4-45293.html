			<p>Traffickers   <F P=102>   PY2705221994 Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 15 May 94 p A-2 </F> <F P=103> PY2705221994 </F> <F P=104>  Lima EL PERUANO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] The Shining Path (SL) terrorist group--once  described as the most lethal and bloody terrorist group in the  world--is in the final throes of its alliance with drug  traffickers. The harsh and devastating blows it has received at  the hands of the forces of order over the last couple of months  have considerably undermined its criminal activities in the  Peruvian jungle.    In the Huallaga Front, where most clashes are taking place,  the Armed Forces and the Peruvian National Police [PNP] have  separated terrorism from narcotrafficking by attacking it to  such an extent that any possibility of a future alliance is  almost nonexistent. The Aries offensive is no coincidence. The  military command has information on subversive movements in the  Cuchara region.    This military offensive compelled the SL people's guerrilla  army--the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Army] is almost  totally annihilated--to desperately take refuge south of the  Upper Huallaga region while drug traffickers headed north of  Ayacucho and more recently to Madre de Dios where the Army and  the PNP are dealing with them harshly.    In the Cuchara and Primavera regions--where the Aries  operation is being conducted--SL commanders are being severely  questioned by their subordinates who, in view of the  intensification of military actions, are taking advantage of the  Repentance Law.    These desertions are prompting SL commanders to  indiscriminately kill any SL member who disobeys orders.    Carlos, a 13-year-old boy who escaped with his father from  the theater of opeations, said: "SL members are killing each  other because they do not know what to do in the jungle any  more."    This can only be interpreted as a desperate move by the SL  commanders, who interpret these "rebellions" as the end of their  Maoist ideology. The Ashasninkas indigenous group are taking  advantage of this situation and escaping the long and ruthless  captivity they have endured at the hands of SL.    Eight SL terrorists, among them little Carlos, who endured  the most deplorable living conditions imposed by the SL  commanders, surrendered five weeks ago at the Quiteni  antisubversive base in Satipo, in the Frente Mantaro  jurisdiction. The living conditions in the Army bases in the  jungle are very different.    The Army has installed 15 countersubversive bases with  military personnel to welcome repentant SL members and to offer  them the best conditions and treatment.    A Tingo Maria military officer says: "We are not saying  this.  This is being said by the SL members who surrendered at our  bases. They do not want to leave. In our installations they  find food and work and they receive the best treatment."</p>

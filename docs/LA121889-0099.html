			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C.-BASED GROUP'S HOME DRUG TESTS SPARK DEBATE  </P> <P> The war on drugs is turning into a battle of credibility for the promoters of a  do-it-yourself eye test that some of the nation's leading medical experts say  is useless in helping parents ferret out drug abuse on the home front.  </P> <P> Since its introduction more than a year ago, the "Winners Program" kit marketed  by Athletes for a Strong America has become the center of a debate over whether  it is an effective tool or a gimmick to make a buck off the country's alarm  about drugs.  </P> <P> In August, a federal judge in Colorado deemed the eye test extremely  inaccurate. A month later, prominent doctors and researchers cut through the  exam's glowing testimonials from sports figures and concluded that the $49 kit  was almost worthless. Family counselors too have joined the fray, saying the  weekly regimen of home testing could destroy trust between parent and child.  </P> <P> "The wholesale use of the eye test needs to be evaluated very carefully," said  Dr. Don Catlin, a UCLA professor of medicine, who directed drug testing for  athletes in the 1984 Olympic Games. "I am concerned about this product and  other products that go out on the market in an attempt to diagnose things."  </P> <P> But Athletes for a Strong America, a nonprofit organization based in Mission  Viejo, is undaunted by its critics. The group's directors say that the kit,  with its handy penlight and tips on drug prevention, is a trust builder in the  family and the best available tool to screen children for drugs.  </P> <P> "Our critics don't see enough addicts to put in a thimble," said Dr. Forest  Tennant, a drug adviser to the National Football League, who helped adapt the  eye examination for the home. "If people don't start learning how to recognize  drug use and get people off drugs by using this test, I don't think we have any  choice but to legalize drugs."  </P> <P> Tennant, a former mayor of West Covina and the owner of a string of drug  treatment clinics in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Fresno, developed the test  for home use more than 14 months ago at the urging of Athletes for a Strong  America.  </P> <P> Since then, support for the organization has come from more than 100 of the  nation's professional and college sports figures, including Los Angeles Dodgers  manager Tommy Lasorda, Los Angeles Rams head coach John Robinson, former Green  Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr and Denver Broncos head coach Dan Reeves.  </P> <P> Besides a penlight, the kit contains a scale for measuring pupil size, an  instructional videotape and a 32-page manual to teach parents how to recognize  and prevent drug use. It also contains tips on how to maintain a child's  self-esteem. The program, which has been revised, expanded and renamed several  times, is now called the "Super Deluxe Winner's Kit."  </P> <P> A key part of the program, however, is an eye test similar to that used by law  enforcement officers during field sobriety tests. It takes no more than a  minute or two.  </P> <P> During the exam, parents check for redness, puffiness and excessive tearing.  Next, pupils are checked for dilation or constriction and whether they react  properly to light. Finally, the eyes are observed for involuntary jerking and  the inability to focus on an object coming toward them.  </P> <P> If drug use is suspected, the kit recommends that urinalysis can be done at  Tennant's Community Health Projects Medical Group, which owns 25 drug and  alcohol clinics. Urine tests can cost up to $100.  </P> <P> Tennant and David Hannah, president of Athletes for a Strong America, hope the  eye check will become as commonplace as the toothbrush or thermometer. To  institutionalize the technique in the family, they suggest that parents start  the test when their children are about 7 years old, and administer it every few  days from then on as a deterrent and detection device.  </P> <P> Although much of the group's activity is in Southern California, colleges,  school districts and businesses in several states have adopted the test. The  promoters also have appeared on radio and television talk shows across the  country, and Hannah estimates that the group has sold kits to about 10,000  families in the Southland alone and made enough money to cover its overhead.  </P> <P> "We are struggling with a tremendous drug problem," Hannah said, "and the eye  test is the best method we've got. As a screening tool, it can be tremendously  helpful. If there is a better deterrent you can give to parents, I want it."  </P> <P> But a group of ophthalmologists, pharmacologists, medical researchers, and  sports medicine experts at UCLA Medical Center and the University of Iowa are  not convinced. They became concerned about the eye test last summer after the  media reported that the device, then marketed under the name "Rapid Eye Check  Kit," was being sold for home use.  </P> <P> Members of the group from UCLA also said they were worried that Bruins head  football coach Terry Donahue, who was co-chairman of Athletes for a Strong  America, was lending his name and the university's reputation to something they  thought didn't work.  </P> <P> After reviewing the eye test and the kit's videotape, the doctors contacted the  news media about their conclusions.  </P> <P> UCLA physicians said in interviews with The Times that the home test is based  on some medical fallacies about the eye's reaction to drugs. Research by Dr.  Robert Hepler at UCLA, for example, shows that marijuana has very little if any  impact on the pupil -- a result that prompted warnings to law enforcement about  using eye tests in the field as a basis for marijuana arrests.  </P> <P> On the other hand, heroin constricts the pupils, while cocaine can have the  opposite effect in large doses. But, the UCLA doctors said, it is unknown  whether low and moderate doses of cocaine consistently change the eye in ways  that can be measured by the home drug test.  </P> <P> More important, they said, many eye conditions indicative of drug use, such as  jerky motions while following an object, dilated or constricted pupils, the  inability to focus on an object inches from the face, frequently occur for  reasons unrelated to drugs.  </P> <P> Because of this, the group concluded that the test will be highly inaccurate in  the hands of parents and could cost families thousands of dollars for  unnecessary urine tests. They said many symptoms of drug use are readily  noticeable without the home drug test, and that parents would be better off  consulting their family doctors if drug use is suspected.  </P> <P> "A lot of us get upset in these witch-hunt days," said Dr. Robert N. Pechnick,  an assistant professor of pharmacology, who teaches drug abuse classes at UCLA.  "The scientific community must take action to see that something that doesn't  work doesn't get promoted."  </P> <P> During the review, the UCLA group asked Dr. Stanley Thompson, a widely known  pupil expert at the University of Iowa, to further evaluate the kit. Thompson  and four other neuro-ophthalmologists agreed with UCLA's conclusions.  Ophthalmologists at USC and Dr. Irving Leopold, a retired UC Irvine professor  and an expert on the effect of drugs on the eye, had similar concerns.  </P> <P> "It seems to us that the pupil test is a sham and the flashlight is just  something for parents to wave about in the hope of scaring their kids into  staying clean," Thompson wrote to UCLA in October.  </P> <P> Coach Donahue, who appeared in the kit's videotape, has dropped out of Athletes  for a Strong America. He declined to comment on the reasons.  </P> <P> "The last thing we in the substance abuse field need are Oliver North-type  loose cannons rattling around," said Dr. J. Thomas Ungerleider, a UCLA  psychiatry professor and former presidential appointee to the National  Committee on Marijuana and Drug Abuse during the Nixon Administration.  </P> <P> Tennant and Hannah, who say they never have been confronted with UCLA's  concerns, defend the test, saying the physicians and researchers are ignorant  about the program and its successes. It was never meant, they say, to be the  sole criterion for suspected drug use and must be combined with more accurate  urine testing.  </P> <P> Tennant pointed out that it is common knowledge among law enforcement  officials, drug treatment experts and medical professionals that drugs  frequently affect the eyes in ways that can be easily detected with a little  training.  </P> <P> "You don't have to be a whiz kid to do the test," said Tennant, who has run  drug abuse clinics for almost 20 years. "I want these people at UCLA to tell me  about their drug clinics, and how many people they examine that have eye signs.  The eye test works, and if you are a parent and you don't have it, you have  given your child another chance to get on drugs."  </P> <P> Athletes for a Strong America claims that if done properly, the eye test can  detect drug use 80% to 90% of the time. Tennant said that has been his  experience testing drug users at his clinics as well as that of law enforcement  officers.  </P> <P> Even if the test were inaccurate, Hannah says, the screening regimen gives  children an excuse to stay off drugs. He added that parents are wrong if they  think they can detect drug use by merely watching for falling grades, changes  in behavior and undesirable friends. By then, he says, it's too late.  </P> <P> Contrary to Tennant's and Hannah's accuracy claims, an August court decision in  a civil rights lawsuit challenged the credibility and reliability of the eye  test, which was given thousands of times to University of Colorado athletes.  </P> <P> The suit alleged that the athletic department's drug testing program, which  included the eye test used by Athletes for a Strong America, was  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Joseph Bellipanni, armed with the university's own  statistics about the test, concluded that the examination falsely indicated  drug use 97% to 98% of the time. Medical experts said the tests are also  capable of yielding false negative results -- failing to detect actual drug  use.  </P> <P> The plaintiff in that case, David Derdeyn, a former University of Colorado  track team member who now lives in Hollywood, flunked the eye test, qualifying  him to take a urine test, which later detected no drug use.  </P> <P> "This thing has Orwellian overtones and a terrible potential for abuse," said  Derdeyn, who described the eye test as "kind of hokey" and "voodoo science."  </P> <P> Similar inaccuracy rates were reported at Youngstown State University in Ohio,  where trainer Dan Wathen estimated that 80% to 90% of athletes fail the test  although they haven't taken drugs. Nevertheless, Wathen said he considered the  eye exam useful for screening.  </P> <P> Tennant and Hannah contend that University of Colorado trainers improperly  flunked athletes for failing one part of the test instead of at least two  portions as required. Court testimony indicated otherwise.  </P> <P> The University of Colorado lawsuit is under appeal.  </P> <P> Besides questions about accuracy, family counselors and others in the drug  abuse field contend that home testing can undermine the trust between parent  and child during the already trying time of adolescence.  </P> <P> They say the exam could bring a heavy-handed, police atmosphere into the house  if parents insist on testing children who are not using drugs and should be  suspicion-free.  </P> <P> "To create a situation where the parent is playing detective with teens might  fuel resentment and anxiety," said UCLA Assistant Prof. Tom Kennon, a family  counselor. "Overcontrol could have a reverse effect and widen the gap between  parent and child."  </P> <P> Naomi Siegal, a licensed clinical social worker in Los Angeles who deals with  family problems, said approaching an adolescent with a home drug test is bound  to threaten an already difficult stage in the parent-child relationship.  </P> <P> "During adolescence, there is experimentation and rebellion," said Siegal,  former director of psychiatric social work at St. John's Hospital in Santa  Monica. "If you have a heavy-handed and authoritarian kind of practice, it  could really give the kid something to rebel against."  </P> <P> But Hannah and Tennant say trust is not an issue. Parents routinely check the  whereabouts, health and appearance of their children, so adding another check  won't matter, they say.  </P> <P> "I test my son, and his eyes respond pretty well," Hannah said. "I have come to  realize that this is actually a trust builder in the home and brings out better  communication. Kids and parents feel comfortable with it."  </P> <P> As proof, Hannah said, a survey by Athletes for a Strong America found that  only six of 400 parents felt they could not give their children the eye test.  If the test is given in a caring, understanding way, there should be no  problem, Hannah said.  </P> <P> Yet some parents remain skeptical.  </P> <P> "From a medical standpoint it is not functional, and as a parent I'd be  ill-advised to use it," said Dawn Ahart, a registered nurse and chairwoman of  Orange County Parents Against Drug Abuse.  </P> <P> Ahart said the group did not endorse the technique because the membership was  afraid of a high inaccuracy rate. When members of Parents Against Drug Abuse  got a look at the kit for the first time a while ago, "some of them laughed,"  Ahart said.  </P></p>

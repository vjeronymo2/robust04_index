			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Italian budget raises taxes THE government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi yesterday unveiled a L12,500bn (Pounds 5.3bn) mini-budget raising taxes and cutting spending to hold down Italy's public sector deficit. Most of the L5,950bn extra revenue will come from raising the tax on petrol and increasing the size of the end-of-year advance VAT payments required of companies. Spending cuts will mainly affect central government transfers to local authorities, block hiring of new teachers (Italy has the highest number of teachers per capita in Europe) and involve a selective freeze on disbursements from the treasury's numerous special funds. 'This sort of action is certainly not popular; but it is unfortunately necessary,' Mr Ciampi said after yesterday's cabinet meeting. The former central bank governor, who assumed the premiership on April 26, added: 'This is a correction during the course of the year because the deficit was moving away from the target.' The clear commitment by the Ciampi government to austerity, combined with encouraging signs of continued falling inflation and a fresh cut in the Bank of Italy's discount rate, boosted the lira. Yesterday the Italian currency was trading close to L900 against the D-Mark, a strengthening of nearly L100 in a month. In January the Amato government agreed with the EC as a condition of obtaining a Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.3bn) loan facility that Italy's 1993 deficit would be held below 11 per cent of GDP or around L150,000bn. The new measures should ensure that the deficit is around L154,000 - providing the L7,000bn promised from privatisation materialises. Officials estimated the petrol price rises would add no more than 0.2 percentage points to inflation during the year. Yesterday, preliminary figures in the big cities for May indicated inflation was running at an annualised rate of 4 per cent - the lowest since 1969. Although work on the mini-budget was begun by the previous government, the final shape was provided by the new economic team. This is still headed by Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, but now includes Prof Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister, and Mr Franco Gallo in the Finance Ministry. Yesterday Prof Spaventa said the primary deficit would be L37,500bn for the year. This small primary deficit underlines the extent to which servicing Italy's huge debt weighs on the budget. But the cost of interest payments on the debt was eased this week by the cut in the discount rate to 10.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Seton rises 43% to Pounds 2.13m and makes Pounds 13m cash call SETON HEALTHCARE Group, the rapidly expanding medical products and sports equipment company, yesterday announced a Pounds 13.1m rights issue to fund further growth. The 1-for-4 issue was priced at 240p. Seton's shares closed 11p lower at 281p. Seton also reported a 43 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.13m for the six months to August 31. After adjusting for disposals in the US and the discontinuance of French business, turnover of the continuing businesses rose by 35 per cent Pounds 17.8m. The proceeds from the rights issue will be partly used to buy Cupal, a Blackburn-based company which makes and distributes Meltus cough medicine; Cupanol, a children's liquid painkiller; and Cuprofen painkiling tablets. Seton has also agreed to buy the UK and Eire manufacturing and distribution rights for the Betadine range of antiseptic products from Ladenburg, a Dutch pharmaceuticals company, for an initial payment of Pounds 2m, plus royalties. Seton is paying Pounds 6.8m in cash for Cupal and issuing 500,000 of its shares to the vendors of the private company, which employs 150 people. Last year Cupal made trading profits of Pounds 581,000 on sales of Pounds 5.7m. Seton said the acquisition was in line with its strategy of building a branded healthcare portfolio and would add several over-the-counter products to its range. It believed that although Cupal's main brands were well established, their sales could be substantially increased by marketing them alongside existing Seton brands with the benefit of integration with Seton's wider community, wholesale and retail selling network. The remaining proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce Seton's borrowings to about Pounds 2.5m, giving gearing of 15 per cent. The cash call was underwritten by Robert Fleming and joint brokers to the issue were Beeson Gregory and de Zoete &amp; Bevan. Earnings per share were 6.1p (4.7p). The interim dividend was raised to 1.7p (1.5p). COMMENT This rights issue and related deals fit in snugly with the strategy which Seton has been pursuing with such vigour since it came to the market at 130p a share in the summer of 1990. The group is paying a high multiple for Cupal, but such calculations are often of limited application to small private companies. Seton is confident that the deal will enhance earnings next year and the management has an impressive track record. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m put the shares on a prospective multiple of just over 17. That rating looks justified, but a constraint on further advances is the thought that this will not be the last cash call to shareholders.</p>

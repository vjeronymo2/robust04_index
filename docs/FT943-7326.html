			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Oftel backs cable groups in phone war The cable industry has won a significant victory which should help it to gain telephone subscribers from British Telecommunications. The Office of Telecommunications has decided that BT subscribers who decide to move to cable operators for their telecommunications services should be able to take their old telephone number with them. An announcement is expected from Oftel today. The cable companies, many of them large North American telephone groups, have been installing nearly 25,000 new telephone lines a month in the UK this year. But the fact that subscribers had to change their number when they moved to a cable service has been seen as a considerable barrier, particularly for business users. Oftel is responding to a formal application from Videotron, one of the largest cable operators with franchises in London, Southampton and Winchester. Similar applications have been submitted by other groups. As an interim measure BT will be asked to provide call-forwarding until number portability starts, but it is not clear who will pay for this. BT said yesterday: 'We are surprised at the piecemeal approach that Oftel is taking.' The Cable Television Association yesterday welcomed the change, which it believed would be important in the business market. The CTA said: 'The business market is the most lucrative and the least likely to change numbers.' Cable companies say that they can offer discounts of more than 10 per cent on telecommunications services, and by the start of July had installed more than 460,000 lines. Oftel yesterday also published a study suggesting that a significant number of telephone company staff were unaware of fair trading rules. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'There are many more telephone companies competing for customers than there used to be. This study was about whether any of the behaviour of these telephone companies was anti-competitive.' No evidence was found of anti-competitive pricing in breach of licence conditions. Although some examples of inaccurate or misleading information were discovered, there was nothing systematic. Mr Cruickshank made it clear, however, that he wanted companies to review and strengthen their compliance programmes on fair trading. Among telephone company frontline staff the study had 'identified the absence of such knowledge as a real problem.</p>

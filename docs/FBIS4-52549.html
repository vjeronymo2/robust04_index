			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- A resolution was adopted  at the 1994 meeting of Christians for Peace and Reunification of  Korea held in Washington over April 19-21 under the sponsorship  of the Federation of Korean Churches for Peace, Justice and  Reunification.    It urged the United States to take such steps for detente as  the cancellation of the deployment of Patriot missiles in South  Korea and a final stop to the Team Spirit joint manoeuvres and  apply a fair nuclear nonproliferation standard to all the  nations so that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and  the world may be promoted.    Noting that the issue of "nuclear inspection" of the North  must be treated as part of the plan for denuclearizing the whole  of the Korean peninsula, the resolution contended that it must  contain the verification of the withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear  weapons from South Korea and the U.S. promise not to use  regional or strategic nuclear weapons and not to threaten the  use of such weapons against North Korea.    The resolution stressed that the crisis of the Korean  peninsula must be resolved only through diplomatic negotiation,  not by threat, "sanctions" or force of arms.</p>

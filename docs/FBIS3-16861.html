			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the4 "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is back in Moscow  after his visit to Kaliningrad. But as has become known, his  visit should have continued today as well. Our correspondent  reports on details of this unexpected change in the program.    [Correspondent Sablin] Baltiysk, the town of naval seamen,  has already gotten used to visits by prominent guests. But  nevertheless, one could describe the latest visit there by  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as historic; in a few  days the fate of the oldest navy of Russia will be decided at a  collegium of the Military Department.    It seems that the minister already has his own opinion: the  Baltic Navy, even after reduction by 40 percent, should remain  the main core of the defense area which is being set up in the  Western part of the country. The second important point of the  program of Pavel Grachev's visit to Kaliningrad Oblast was the  settlement of social problems of servicemen who were withdrawn  from the Baltic countries. But the minister did not manage to  solve the complex of problems on construction of accommodation  because of extraordinary, almost detective-story circumstances.  Literally the day before, the special services of Lithuania  arrested Vladas Laurinavicius, the head of the "Selma" firm in  Kaunas. This is the firm which is building blocks of apartments  for Russian servicemen.    [Begin Grachev recording] This action was planned. Our  conversation with him and all that happened after this  conversation was monitored. I am the author of this project and  the matter is that in essence "Selma" worked with its own money,  so to say, on credit, and they were patiently waiting for us to  pay them. Moreover, Vladas was informed that I would bring  instructions from the prime minister concerning conditions of  payment. I brought them a barter deal, as it were. We should  have paid him in oil as we agreed. You know, these instruction  are here, in my case, but I cannot give them to him. [end  recording]    [Announcer] This is some kind of a detective story which has  made the problem of accommodation for the servicemen even more  difficult.</p>

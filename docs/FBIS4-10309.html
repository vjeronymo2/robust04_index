			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by Juan Manuel Pereira from the "Early </F> Morning" newscast]    [Text] Mario Aburto Martinez has already given a  preliminary deposition from Cell No. 3 at the high security  prison in Almoloya de Juarez, Mexico State. Before he gave his  deposition, which began at 1730 on 5 April and ended in the  morning of 6 April, Aburto watched five videocassettes on the  Tijuana events on 23 March, when he killed Luis Colosio. [video  shows footage of Colosio walking at the Tijuana campaign rally  at which the presidential candidate was shot] Images similar to  this one -- sometimes in slow motion and sometimes frame by  frame -- depict Aburto's part in the crime, as well as other  people's contribution. A Television Azteca Network camera  filmed this event on 23 March.    After Aburto assassinated Colosio, many people beat and  virtually crushed him. In this other shot, we can see Vicente  Mayoral Valenzuela, Sr., wearing a white leather jacket. [video  shows Mayoral walking behind Colosio at Tijuana campaign rally]  It seems he was also beaten after initially being mistaken for  the murderer because of the blood stains on him. His son,  Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer, later appeared on the scene and  attempted to rescue his father. It seems he was able to rescue  his father, because little by little, father and son are left  behind by the group that was violently apprehending Mario Aburto  Martinez.    Despite all depositions in the hands of judicial authorities  who are trying to clarify Colosio's murder, Aburto denied in his  preliminary deposition that Colosio's murder was premeditated.  He also denied he knows the four people presumed to be his  accomplices. He said those who appear in these videotapes and  are alleged to be his accomplices are innocent. He insisted he  worked alone.    In addition to Aburto, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, Rodolfo  Mayoral Esquer, Rodolfo Riva Palacio, and Tranquilino Sanchez  also gave preliminary depositions.    Television Azteca Network is in the position to confirm the  identity of Mario Aburto Martinez. This follows claims that the  person apprehended on 23 March and the one who was taken to the  Almoloya de Juarez prison two days later were not the same  individual. Television Azteca Network was able to film these  shots when Mario Aburto, after being arrested in Lomas Taurinas,  Tijuana, enters the quarters of the Attorney General's Office.  This is Mario Aburto Martinez after he was cleaned up. [video  shows clean-shaven Aburto behind glass, being presented to  media] There are no doubts whatsoever that he is indeed the  same person who murdered Colosio.</p>

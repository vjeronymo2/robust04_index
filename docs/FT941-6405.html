			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / BR goods managers hope to buy Freightliner Managers in British Rail's freight division yesterday announced plans to buy out its loss-making Freightliner business. Freightliner, which transports containers from British ports to inland rail terminals, is expected to be one of the first parts of BR's freight operations to be privatised. Several companies have expressed an interest. The value of bids for Freightliner will depend in part on the value which BR puts on its assets in an information memorandum to be published later this month. It will also depend on the level of charges levied by Railtrack, which will take over ownership of BR's track and signalling from April 1. Freightliner's financial performance has been poor, however, with estimated losses of Pounds 30m on turnover of Pounds 75m a year. Freightliner, the domestic arm of BR's Railfreight Distribution arm, carries 500,000 containers a year for deep-sea shipping lines serving UK ports. Railfreight Distribution's international business does not form part of this privatisation, but will be sold off later. The five-strong buy-out team is headed by Mr David Rutherford, finance director of Railfreight Distribution and formerly with Plessey, the electronics group. The managers plan to involve other employees in the buy-out. Mr Bill Shiplee, commercial director of Railfreight Distribution and a member of the buy-out team, emphasised that its plan would not lead to a break-up of Freightliner's operations. It intends to own and operate its own locomotives and rolling stock. Hambros merchant bank is adviser to the buy-out team. Rival bids for Freightliner have been announced by Russell Davies, a container services and distribution group, jointly with P&amp;O Distribution, part of the quoted shipping company, and by a consortium of British ports. The Scottish Office intends to amend the bill to reform local government to enable Strathclyde Regional Council to conclude a deal to lease Pounds 36m of trains for its passenger transport executive. The leasing has been held up since last autumn because Lombard North Central, the leasing company, feared inadequate security because Strathclyde is to be broken into 10 councils.</p>

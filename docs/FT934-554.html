			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Christmas is coming - even in Bethlehem Christmas will be celebrated in Bethlehem for the first time in six years tomorrow, amid hopes of growing reconciliation between Jews and Christians. The Biblical town has not officially celebrated Christmas since the Palestinian uprising against Israel erupted in December 1987. But the Palestine Liberation Organisation has just made Christmas a national holiday, allowing the town to celebrate openly. Christmas in Bethlehem is special too this year as next week the Vatican and Israel will sign an agreement to establish relations, in what many people hope will prove to be a landmark on the road to reconciliation between Jews and Christians. Pope John Paul II has said he will visit the Holy Land soon. Nevertheless, enormous problems remain in bringing peace and goodwill to the peoples and the religions of the land of Israel. Indeed, a dispute almost stopped Christmas from happening at all in Bethlehem when the Palestinian major threatened to cancel the festivities unless Israel withdrew its demands for the Palestinian flag to be taken down. Last night senior PLO officials had taken up the matter with Israel's foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres. Despite the peace process, the lives of Palestinians have yet to change for the better. Israeli troops with machine-guns yesterday lounged on the wooden stand used by the Christmas choir in Manger Square - a potent reminder of the continued occupation - and last night defused a small bomb there. Arab-Jewish violence continues unabated. And even if the self-rule peace agreement is finalised in the coming days the Palestinian state which Arabs yearn for remains distant. For Jews, too, getting into the spirit of peace and goodwill remains difficult. The killings of Jewish settlers by Palestinian gunmen has left a shadow over the peace process. And many Jews remain deeply uneasy about Jewish-Christian friendship. Professor Sergio Minerbi, a Jew who has made the Vatican his special academic interest, says the Holy See's establishment of relations with Israel has been made possible because the church has separated politics from religion. It now treats issues on principles of international law rather than theological doctrine and has tacitly dropped its teaching that the dispersal of the Jews out of the Holy Land was punishment by God for the refusal of the Jews to acknowledge Christ as the saviour. Like many Jews, Professor Minerbi believes that persecution by the Nazis was due partly to the theological anti-semitic teaching of the Catholic Church, which, until 1965, held all Jews collectively guilty for the crucifixion of Jesus by virtue of descent. Among Christians in Jerusalem too there are profound question marks about the possibility of a reconciliation between the religions. 'The theological thing is either they are right or we are,' said Father Jerry Murphy O'Connor. 'Either Christ was the saviour or he wasn't. The rest is tea parties.'</p>

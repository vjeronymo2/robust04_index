Present at the meeting were Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the  State Council; Chen Muhua, vice premier of the State Council,  vice chairman of the NPC standing committee, and chairman of the  national women's federation; Liu Qi, minister at the Ministry of  Metallurgical Industry; and leaders of the state departments  concerned. Quan Shuren, chairman of the provincial people's  congress standing committee, chaired the meeting. Gu Jinchi,  secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech ahead  of others.    He said: Premier Li Peng's report is of essential,  comprehensive, and profound importance and embodies the ideas of  seeking truth, dealing with concrete matters relating to work,  doing pioneering work, and making progress. I completely agree  to it. As for Liaoning, an urgent task for understanding the  basic guidelines of the report and fulfilling the tasks as set  forth in the report is to start from the change of the  managerial mechanism to speed up the enlivening of state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises. This is the key to  deepening reform, promoting development, and realizing the  second pioneering work.    After that, Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech. He talked  about the understanding about the report; introduced, in detail,  to Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and NPC Vice Chairman Chen Muhua the  province's achievements in reform and opening up made in 1993;  and reported on the province's problems and difficulties in  accelerating the setup of the market economy.    Deputies (Li Huazhong) and (Bo Xilai) set forth their  suggestions and viewpoints on how to accelerate the development  of large and medium-sized enterprises and to promote  agricultural production and the opening of the province to the  outside world.    Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, finally made  a  speech.    He said: Today, we mainly want to hear your opinions on the  report and what methods you have to solve the existing problems,  to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas, to  make preparations for the next-step arrangements, and to ensure  a sound and orderly development of the economy.    He said: Last year, Liaoning made better economic  development and made a big headway in agriculture. Being  self-sufficient in grain and nonstaple foods was a great  achievement. Agriculture is the foundation of the national  economy. Therefore, strengthening the agricultural development  is of great strategic significance and must be persisted in.    He expressed his views on accelerating the transformation of  large and medium-sized enterprises. He said: I completely  agreed to your suggestions on conducting technological  transformation. Liaoning's state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises have a good foundation. So, these enterprises  should fully be transformed and utilized so as to become  vigorous.    He also stressed: The products produced after technological  transformation must be marketable. Without marketing channels,  the products, no matter how good they are, will be of no use.</p>

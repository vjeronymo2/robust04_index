			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Fortis rises 35% in first three months Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, posted a 35 per cent increase in net profits to Ecu109.7m (Dollars 95.4m) in the first three months. In insurance, pre-tax results rose by 19 per cent to Ecu132.9m, while profits in the banking sector almost quadrupled to Ecu55.1m. The group - jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and Groupe AG of Belgium - said the sharp increase was attributable to successful operations in most of Fortis' businesses. The profit for Groupe AG, the insurance company, was BFr1.85bn (Dollars 54.5m) in the first quarter, up 35 per cent on the same period a year ago. But Mr Maurice Lippens, president of Groupe AG, said full-year 1994 profit growth for both Groupe AG and its joint venture Fortis was unlikely to reach the high levels of the first quarter. He added that profits for Groupe AG were high in the first quarter as costs had been kept closely in line with last year's levels. Profit per Groupe AG share rose by 35 per cent in the first three months of the year to BFr54.3, from BFr40.2 in the same period of 1993. Fortis announced that from yesterday, its two parent companies - Groupe AG and Amev - would be known as Fortis AG and Fortis Amev respectively.</p>

The Belgian general said that the activities of the UN force in  Bosnia were completely paralyzed by the lack of personnel and  political will. This inefficiency undermined the credibility of  future UN operations. Interviewed in his office in the UN  peacekeepers' barracks near Sarajevo hospital, Gen. Briquemont  wondered whether the leaders of the three warring parties cared  at all about the fates of their compatriots. They talk only  about their war aims and objectives, he said, adding: I think  that they like power above all else.    The United Nations, however, is also guilty in the general's  eyes. It has voted resolution after resolution without giving  itself the means to implement them effectively. There is a  yawning gulf, he said, between all the UN resolutions and the  means made available to implement them on the ground. The  general estimated that he needed at least a further 10,000 men  in order to carry out his mission in Bosnia. Instead of that,  he said, France and Great Britain speak of withdrawing their  contingents in the spring if there is no sign of solution to the  conflict.</p>

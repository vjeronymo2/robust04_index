			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Modern plumbing for a shaken house / Assessing the reforms at Salomon, the US securities firm brought low by scandal last year Mr Deryck Maughan, the softly spoken Englishman catapulted into running Salomon Brothers, the scandal-stricken US securities firm, simply calls it 'a tremendous amount of sewer and pipeline work'. It is a classic understatement. For what Mr Maughan is talking about is nothing less than reforming the management systems of one of Wall Street's biggest firms - including tackling the sensitive issue of pay. Furthermore, the overhaul of Salomon's plumbing has been largely carried out in just four months, in the shadow of a bond trading scandal which came close to destroying the business, and which may yet cause it serious harm. Crisis management does not come much tougher. When Salomon's new management team of Mr Warren Buffett, interim chairman, and Mr Maughan, chief operating officer, took over last August they faced three main challenges. The first, accomplished with some deft financial footwork and delicate politicking, was to prevent a liquidity crisis which could have bankrupted the firm. The second was to regain a reputation for honest dealing. This had been shattered by the revelations that Mr Paul Mozer, the firm's senior bond trader, had faked orders at US Treasury bond auctions; worse, Salomon's former management, led by Mr John Gutfreund, its ousted chairman, had failed to report Mr Mozer to the authorities when it discovered his wrongdoing. The third, much more complex, challenge was to shake up Salomon's management systems and improve the basic profitability of its businesses without further damaging the group's shaken morale. On this the jury is still out. Many securities firms are prone to weak management. But it is now clear that even by Wall Street's standards, the management systems at the old Salomon were poor and promoted intrigue, indecision and croneyism. Mr Gutfreund, the man once dubbed 'The King of Wall Street' by BusinessWeek magazine, presided over a structure resembling a mediaeval court. Charming, contemptuous and and ruthless by turns, he had built Salomon up from a US bond trading business into a leading integrated global securities house. Mr Gutfreund devolved power onto a group of independent fiefdoms, each running a main business line, but made sure their leaders remained dependent on his patronage. For example, department managers had overlapping responsibilities, making it unclear who was responsible for what - a situation Mr Gutfreund reportedly seemed to encourage. Nor was there a modern budgeting system, with revenue and expense targets coherently defined for departments at the start of the year. 'The game was allocate the expense and see if anyone objects,' Mr Maughan recently admitted. The link between pay and performance was also weak, with the allocation of bonuses depending substantially on a individual's relationship with Mr Gutfreund and Mr Tom Strauss, his deputy. In 1990, a year when operating profits were flat, the wage bill leaped by Dollars 120m (which at the time prompted an unsuccessful and secret boardroom revolt by Mr Buffett in his capacity as a non-executive director). It was a system lacking accountability, guaranteed to create strife, and perilously dependent on strong central leadership. That, say insiders, is what it increasingly lacked: both Mr Gutfreund and Mr Strauss tended to procrastinate over difficult decisions, and the former became increasingly remote from day-to-day operations. Reform has been left by the hands-off Mr Buffett largely to Mr Maughan. A 44-year-old coal miner's son who once worked in the British Treasury, he joined Salomon in 1983 and made his name running its highly successful Japanese operations. He had only been back in New York a few months, as co-head of investment banking, when the scandal broke. One of his most basic reforms has been to make clear just which managers are responsible for what businesses. The starting point has been to define Salomon as a series of global product lines. One, for example, deals in US fixed income securities, another in Japanese equities. Next, Salomon needed to decide which centre should have responsibility for these operations. For example, should someone trading Japanese warrants in London report to an executive in the British capital, New York or Tokyo? The old Salomon, in common with some of its Wall Street rivals, had always fudged this issue. Now, the Japanese warrant trader would report to a London manager on a day-to-day basis, but the strategic direction of his business and his pay would be set in Japan. This is because the businesses dealing in Asian securities will now be run out of Japan, European ones out of London, and US securities out of New York, which is also the centre for the global investment banking business. With business units more clearly defined, Mr Maughan has also been able to draw up revenue and expense targets for each, as well as making pay much more closely related to a department's performance. The reshaping of compensation began last autumn, when Dollars 110m previously allocated for bonuses was clawed back, making 1991's total wage bill rather smaller than 1990's - even though profits rose by two-thirds. This year, the firm is implementing a new wages and bonuses system. Each department has been guaranteed a minimum pool of money, substantially lower than last year's pay packet, but it can earn much more if it exceeds its revenue targets. A much higher proportion of bonuses will be paid out as Salomon stock, to link an individual's interests more closely with those of the company. These changes in pay have caused unrest and numerous defections. Apparently unnerved by the departures, in January the firm offered pay guarantees to six members of its US equity research department to prevent them quitting - breaking its own ban on such ironclad offers. Staff unrest has been exacerbated by the Buffett/Maughan changes in Salomon's business mix, for in an attempt to boost profits they have made made cuts in parts of its two weakest areas, equities and investment banking, which the Gutfreund regime was prepared to subsidise from bond trading activities. In equities, Salomon has abandoned speculative proprietary trading, which means it no longer takes large shareholdings for itself in US stocks in the hope of making a profit. It now admits this business was unprofitable and absorbed too much capital. In investment banking, some 50 staff have been trimmed across the board, most notably in real estate, where about 20 out of 40 jobs have gone - a troubled area for all Wall Street. However, many of these cuts were planned before the scandal broke, because of market changes. The cuts have led to accusations from departing employees that Salomon is abandoning its commitment both to equities and investment banking, retreating to its origins in bond trading. This is a serious charge to level against a company which aims to be one of a handful of integrated global securities houses, a role which demands a strong presence in all three areas. Salomon's leaders insist it is quite wrong. 'It is unthinkable that we would come out of the investment banking business,' says Mr Maughan. 'It is unthinkable we would give up underwriting.' What Salomon is simply trying to do, he says, is manage these businesses better. The firm insists it is adding to its equity research and distribution capabilities. Nevertheless, it is ironic that both equities and investment banking have suffered far more from the bond trading scandal than the department which caused it. This is not just because of the cuts. Their trading operations have also been hit hard. For while companies have continued using Salomon for bond issues, they have been reluctant to give it the lead management of sensitive equity underwritings or takeover advisory work while the firm is still under government investigation. In US equity underwriting - normally an extremely profitable operation  - Salomon slipped from fifth in the Wall Street league table in the first eight months of last year to ninth position in the August 1991-January 1992 period. This was reflected in Salomon Brothers' minuscule Dollars 27m fourth quarter pre-tax profits - at a time when the rest of Wall Street was making hay. (Parent Salomon Inc, which includes its Phibro Energy business, had a Dollars 29m net loss.) Salomon's rivals are predicting that the firm, Wall Street's former bully boy, will emerge from the crisis a mere shadow of its former self, both in terms of business scope and that elusive, but vital, ingredient for a successful securities firm - group morale. 'Buffett has gone too far,' opines a top executive at another leading Wall Street house. 'He's talked down the company to the point where many of its young people, who were just doing their job, have got the impression he doesn't value what they have accomplished.' But the doom-mongering involves a degree of wishful thinking. For one thing, Salomon retains enormous clout in global capital markets, with one of the leading positions in debt and equity underwriting. For another, the reforms now being put in place could allow the firm to emerge from the crisis a better managed and possibly more profitable business. Nevertheless, the firm still has to pay the price for its misdeeds. It is in negotiations with the government over a settlement, will at least be fined heavily, and has taken a Dollars 200m charge against earnings to cover this and a host of private lawsuits. Less certain is the scope of any government sanctions. It seems unlikely that Salomon will be barred completely from Treasury auctions. However, a ban imposed in August on it bidding at auction for its customers (it can still bid for itself) could be extended. The key questions facing the firm now are how quickly the government will decide on its punishment; whether this, coupled with the management upheavals, will sap staff morale much further; and whether it will win back lost clients and improve its earnings. Despite Wall Street's recruiting efforts, Salomon has not lost too many big names so far. But it recently had to hand over large payments to senior executives in a special deferred compensation programme devised by Mr Gutfreund. This has loosened the 'golden handcuffs' tieing many to the firm, and is already adding to the outflow. Another uncertainty is whether the new, squeaky-clean Salomon will be quite as willing to take the aggressive risks with positions in the bond and derivatives markets that were the life-blood of the old firm. Senior executives insist it will, pointing out that its capital base is still the biggest on Wall Street. Outsiders remain dubious. Mr Buffett, echoing the great banker J P Morgan, declares that Salomon's goal is to do 'first-class business . . . in a first-class way'. But might this lead the firm to pull its punches? After all, Mr Buffett is also on record as saying that 'if you want to make money, go to Wall Street and hold your nose'. Striking the right balance may not be easy, though the installation of a modern plumbing system should at least keep more nasty odours at bay.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        CLEAN SWEEP AT SALOMON  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Common Stock  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          1991     1990       1991     1990                            dollars bn           Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldman Sachs            9.39     2.60         58       22 Alex Brown &amp; Son         7.47     2.79         63       30 Merril Lynch             7.28     2.05         61       32 First Boston             4.09     0.92         42       13 Morgan Stanley           4.06     0.88         35       13 Lehman Brothers          3.37     1.78         55       21 Salomon Brothers         3.26     1.66         31       21 Prudential Securities    1.67     0.30         16        6 PaineWebber              1.62     1.21         41       20 Donaldson, Lufkins       1.38     0.10         18        3 &amp; Jenrette  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment-grade debt  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          1991     1990       1991     1990                            dollars bn           Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Merril Lynch            48.59    29.18        327      242 Goldman Sachs           40.10    16.78        351      107 Lehman Brothers         30.67     7.11        361       48 Morgan Stanley          23.62    22.88        165      152 First Boston            20.99     9.57        193       65 Salomon Brothers        15.50    13.67         86       67 Kidder Peabody           5.66     2.40         90       16 JP Morgan                4.75     0.44         75        4 Bear Stearns             1.98     1.86         16       16 PaineWebber              1.87     1.05         11       15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IDD Information Services  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / People: John Richardson collects his ticket from Sketchley Sketchley, the dry cleaning and photo processing group, yesterday announced that John Richardson, joint executive deputy chairman, would leave the company when his contract expires at the end of October. Richardson, 51, and Tony Bloom, the other joint executive deputy chairman, joined Sketchley in 1990 when it was losing Pounds 800,000 a month and heavily overborrowed. The two are credited with bringing it back from the brink. Richardson says he is leaving because 'the job is done' and because he wants to return to Asia. Australian-born, he spent 18 years in Hong Kong with Hutchison Whampoa. He will be returning to Hong Kong to join BZW and Barclays Bank as chairman of their Asian operations. Richardson says he and Bloom worked in tandem, selling off businesses with no future, rationalising the company's structures and introducing stricter controls on working capital. But most important, he says, was that they introduced a strong management team. Through the successful management merger of dry cleaning and Supasnaps, which involved the closure of many unprofitable shops, they significantly reduced the groups's retail operating costs. Supasnaps, the photo processor, was acquired for a total cash payment of Pounds 6m in 1993. During the past financial year, Supasnaps offset a difficult year in the core dry cleaning business. In June Sketchley reported pre-tax profits up by 6 per cent before exceptionals to Pounds 5.1m in the year to April 1. The new division contributed Pounds 1.4m to operating profits of Pounds 6.6m. Excluding Supasnaps, sales fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 101.4m. Bloom will remain as an executive deputy chairman but will step into a non-executive role once a new chief executive has been found. He says he has no immediate plans to leave Sketchley.</p>

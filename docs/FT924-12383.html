			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: STC takes Dollars 370m sea cable order STC, the British telecommunications manufacturer bought two years ago by Canada's Northern Telecom, has won a Dollars 370m (Pounds 215m) contract to build the first fibre-optic cable linking Canada and Europe. The undersea cable, which is due to be completed in 1994, has been commissioned by a group of international telecommunications carriers led by Teleglobe of Canada. The other purchasers are British Telecommunications, Germany's Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Denmark and PTT of Iceland. The cable will land in each of their countries. It will enable Teleglobe to send voice, data and video traffic direct to Europe instead of routing much of it through the US as happens now. As a result, Teleglobe will be less dependent on the cable capacity owned by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the giant US telecommunications group. The new cable will carry the equivalent of 30,000 telephone calls simultaneously down each of two pairs of optical fibres, four times as much as is carried by the current generation of technology. Average cost to the telephone companies of a transatlantic circuit will be substantially lower than before. STC made clear yesterday that it was the only manufacturer able to supply this technology. It had been chosen by the purchasers on the basis of bids made by itself and competitors for a different cable which was to have linked the US and the UK but was eventually scrapped. The cable will be manufactured at STC's plants in Southampton, and Portland, Oregon. The electronics will be made in Greenwich, London.</p>

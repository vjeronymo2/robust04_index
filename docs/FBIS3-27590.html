			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Harbin, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Six old industrial  centers in China have restored their leading status in the  national economy through three years' efforts in upgrading their  production facilities.    The six cities are Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan,  Chongqing and Harbin.    According to the latest statistics from a symposium in  Harbin, these cities have completed more than 15,800 projects  since 1991, costing 57.71 billion yuan, of which some 8 billion  yuan were state loans.    Going into operation, they will bring in 95.36 billion yuan  in increased output value, 19.938 billion yuan in taxes and  profits and 4.313 billion U.S. dollars in exports.    The industrial modernization process in these cities has  seen  good results in many aspects.    Thanks to it, the cities' pillar industries have achieved a  rapid growth. At present, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang and Wuhan  are technically strong in the auto sector, regaining the leading  position in the country. And power facilities from Shanghai and  Harbin have obtained over two-thirds of the domestic market  share.    A batch of enterprises with high efficiency have become  honey  pots in these cities. During the 1991-1993 period, two-thirds  of the cities' output value and taxes and profits increment had  resulted from improved facilities. For example, taxes and  profits in Chongqing Steel and Iron Company jumped from 1991's  200 million yuan to 1993's 650 million yuan.    Also, the process has reinforced the competence of quite a  few large and medium-sized enterprises.    In Tianjin, about 45 percent of some 60 big enterprises  which  used 5.2 billion yuan in technological upgrading have  established a niche in the domestic and overseas market.    In Shanghai, many technological enhancement projects have  been undertaken, involving the sectors such as communications,  computers, bio-medicine and micro-electronics.    Experts hold that problems like capital shortage and rigid  management still hinder the process. This year's newly-issued  investment and tax policies may also bring about challenges as  well as chances.    These six cities, most of whose medium and large enterprises  were set up in the 1950s, had exerted an important impact on  China's development at that time.    Since the 1980s, their industrial strength has been weakened  owing to out-of-date facilities and products.    So the Chinese Government launched the campaign of  industrial  modernization in the cities in 1991.</p>

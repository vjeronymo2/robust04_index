			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DID FREEING OF TEEN KILLER GIVE BIRTH TO A BAD IDEA?  </P> <P> Prosecutors are distressed that a judge released a teen-ager convicted of  second-degree murder after his defense attorney argued that the youth deserved  to be with his girlfriend when she gave birth.  </P> <P> Carlos Armour, the deputy district attorney who supervises the juvenile  division, said he was "shocked and surprised" by Judge Sheridan Reed's decision  to release the 17-year-old from Juvenile Hall before his sentencing next  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I'm worried about the image this portrays to the community: that you can take  a human life and still have your freedom," Armour said.  </P> <P> Reed's decision involved a Vista youth convicted in the fatal stabbing of  another teen-ager during a brawl at a dance Feb. 21. He could be sentenced to  the California Youth Authority for eight years -- until age 25.  </P> <P> Reed said she was persuaded by testimony and a psychological evaluation that  the defendant is neither a flight risk nor a danger to commit further violence.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of testimony about his good behavior," Reed said. "Testimony  showed that the incident was not only situationally provoked but also out of  character for him."  </P> <P> Another factor, Reed said, was crowding at Juvenile Hall, which has a capacity  of 219 but houses more than 400.  </P> <P> Armour replied that he could have given Reed a list of people convicted of  lesser crimes than second-degree murder if she felt that crowding is critical.  </P> <P> Armour said he plans to talk to Reed "to make sure this isn't a trend." Reed  said she can't remember another case of having released a convicted murderer  before sentencing.  </P> <P> She conceded that her decision may be hard for the public to accept, but added:  "As a judge, you cannot be swayed in your decision-making by whether a decision  will be popular."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush Waffles on Cookies  </P> <P> Alert the media. President Bush is officially neutral on the question of  whether the chocolate chip or the Oreo should be the national cookie.  </P> <P> We know this because Rosemary Pinet Hartner, a fifth-grade teacher at Santa  </P> <P> Fe-California Elementary in Vista, sent Bush letters from 21 of her students re  Chip v. Oreo. Most were pro-chip.  </P> <P> Hartner asked Bush to decide. A return letter has now been received, on White  House stationery and signed by him:  </P> <P> "How thoughtful of you to send me your essays on the national cookie. It is  always a joy to see young citizens using their talents in a creative way. You  can be proud of your work."  </P> <P> The students' joy at receiving a reply is tempered by the fact it was  noncommittal.  </P> <P> Hartner explained to her charges that the President is a politician. That  seemed to satisfy them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Antisocial Hormones  </P> <P> It happened this week while the San Diego City Council was debating whether to  ban semiautomatic weapons inside the city limits.  </P> <P> Councilman Bruce Henderson, who opposes such a ban, said he would rather see  criminals who use guns locked up until they're no longer a danger to society,  regardless of how long it takes.  </P> <P> Henderson: "That may mean you're dead, that may mean your testosterone level is  down so far you can barely drag yourself out of bed."  </P> <P> Henderson's council colleagues commenced to giggle.  </P> <P> Henderson: "My colleagues are kidding me. That testosterone remark always gets  a response."  </P> <P> Colleagues: "Are you kidding?"  </P> <P> Henderson: "The truth is that it's the testosterone level in a lot of males  that causes all this criminal activity. It's not the guns, except as a  substitute, maybe."  </P> <P> Deputy Mayor Judy McCarty, fumbling on her pronunciation: "Do you propose to  regulate testosterone activity, Mr. Henderson?"  </P> <P> Councilman Wes Pratt: "Let's see him propose that legislation."  </P> <P> Henderson: "The concern that I have is that once again we're focusing society's  energy in the wrong direction."  </P> <P> There you have have it: Use a hormone, go to jail. Call it Henderson's Law.  </P></p>

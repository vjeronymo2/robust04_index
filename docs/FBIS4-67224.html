			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Palmer: "Britain Is Key in Somali Drug </F> Ring"]    [Text] A former Special Branch detective has been  providing couriers to smuggle drugs around the world. Police  suspect profits from the booming international trade are  ultimately financing Somali warlords.    Bill Hamilton, who was sacked from the Metropolitan police  four years ago because of business links with a convicted IRA  terrorist, has become embroiled in the international trade in  qat, a highly addictive drug cultivated in the Horn of Africa.    Britain has become the world's biggest clearing house for  the  drug, which is banned in many western countries but remains  legal here. The Home Office, which monitors the drug, maintains  it does not constitute a serious threat to British society  because its use is restricted to a few thousand refugees from  Africa.    However, drug abuse workers in areas of London populated by  Somalis have become concerned at the harm that misuse of qat is  causing to the refugees. They claim it is turning many of them  into zombies and creating serious social problems.    Police and customs officers have also become concerned that  the trade is helping to finance the clan leaders running the  civil war in Somalia. They control some of the main areas where  qat is grown and are thought to be behind the booming business  in supplying the drug to Somali, Ethiopian and other refugee  communities in countries where it is illegal.    The National Criminal Intelligence Service and customs  officers in Britain estimate that at least 80 different  syndicates are importing qat from Africa and then re-exporting  it illegally to countries where it is banned.    Hamilton, a former Special Branch sergeant who worked at  Heathrow, has used his knowledge of the system to fly British  couriers into North America with suitcases full of qat plants,  which are chewed to obtain an amphetamine-like high. He was  sacked by Scotland Yard after an inquiry into a double-glazing  business he had set up in Northern Ireland with a convicted IRA  man. He now operates from west London, recruiting couriers in  local pubs.    Many couriers have failed to consider the possible  consequences of being caught. Some have been banned from further  entry into the United States and one man is currently serving a  six-month jail sentence in Finland, according to Peter Coutts, a  courier recruited by Hamilton.    Coutts, 41, an ex-Reuter journalist from Isleworth, west  London, was arrested last month with another Briton at  Philadelphia after they flew in with four suitcases crammed with  the drugs. "We were isolated, handcuffed and grilled. It was a  pretty horrible experience," he said.    In the past year more than 1.5 tonnes of the drug smuggled  from Britain has been confiscated in Scandinavia alone. Yet  Hamilton, who was detained at Toronto airport 18 months ago for  possessing the drug, remains unrepentant. Last week, he admitted  involvement but insisted he had now severed his ties with the  syndicate. "My involvement was largely on a casual self-employed  basis. I never had an executive role and no financial stake in  the courier business," he said.</p>

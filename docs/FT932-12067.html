			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Craxi faces up to his accusers MR Bettino Craxi, a former Italian prime minister, yesterday conducted a lengthy self-defence of his role as ex-Socialist party chief during a parliamentary debate over whether to waive hisimmunity to face corruption charges. The eventual vote to reject most of the requests by Milan magistrates to waive Mr Craxi's immunity prompted a decision by the Party of the Democratic Left, the former communists, to withdraw backing from the new government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Mr Craxi, who has vigorously maintained his innocence, claimed there was a plot to discredit him. He is the first major political figure for whom magistrates have asked parliament to waive immunity. The request was submitted on January 12, subsequently forcing him to quit as party leader. The requests yesterday concerned the least significant allegations of corruption in Rome and for violating laws on the financing of political parties. On the more serious allegations of corruption and receiving illicit funds in his political base of Milan, a majority of the Chamber of Deputies backed his immunity - effectively snubbing the main line of inquiry pursued by the most industrious investigative magistrates in the Italian corruption scandals. He still faces the prospect of magistrates submitting further requests relating to other allegations of corruption.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / The Property Market: When values diverge - The Queens Moat Houses case has called surveyors' methods into question The widely divergent valuations produced recently by two firms of surveyors on the assets of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, have triggered questions about both the regulatory processes of surveyors and the very nature of their profession. The answers may be a long time in coming. The Queens Moat Houses accounts for the year to December 31 1991 show a valuation of the company's property portfolio by surveyors Weatherall Green &amp; Smith of Pounds 2bn. The delayed 1992 accounts - released at the end of October - show a revised figure from Jones Lang Wootton of just Pounds 861m. It appears that Weatherall had produced a draft valuation for 1992 presented to QMH's banks of Pounds 1.86bn, before recommending a final figure of Pounds 1.35bn. JLW produced a draft figure as low as Pounds 640m, before settling on the Pounds 861m accepted by the board. While the full details have yet to emerge - and may never be made public - it appears that both firms of surveyors delivered their 1992 estimates within months of each other, were asked to prepare their valuations on the same open market basis, had the same information from which to work, and were asked to base their analysis on the state of the market at the same date: the end of 1992. In other words, two large firms of surveyors had come up with such widely different values on the same properties that QMH had to settle on values in its accounts that fell by Pounds 1.14bn between 1991 and 1992. The notes to the accounts state: 'The current directors consider that they do not have a sufficient understanding of the 1991 property valuation to enable them to provide a full explanation for the decline in the property values.' The auditors qualified the accounts on the same grounds. Rather stronger language has come from others - not least from some shareholders in QMH, who have threatened legal action and attempted, unsuccessfully, to reject the 1992 accounts. Mr Jerry Acher, head of audit and accounting at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, says: 'It calls into question the whole approach to valuations.' Mr Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, is even more strident. 'The valuations were an enormous banana skin,' he says. 'The very size and measure makes it hard to get your mind around, and makes it such a public interest. I do not believe the profession can sit idly by when you get a QMH (situation).' Many agree with these views, and welcomed Mr Lewis's statement shortly after the QMH accounts were published that the institution would investigate swiftly to consider whether there was a case for disciplinary action. But when the Department of Trade and Industry announced that it would be appointing inspectors to conduct an investigation, the institution delayed its own examination indefinitely. There appears to be no legal requirement for it to do so, although, traditionally, most professional bodies have withdrawn once the DTI has become involved. The result is to defer scrutiny of the conduct of the two firms and of the far wider question of the methodology of surveyors when making property valuations. The DTI's conclusions are unlikely to emerge within less than two years, and the institution will probably not intervene in the QMH case in the meantime. This example is one of a handful of high-profile cases considered by the surveyors' own body, none of which appears to have led to public reprimand or clarification of the usefulness of valuations. For example, during the takeover of Scott's Restaurant of London by BS Group, a Bristol-based stadium group, in 1990, Baker Lorenz valued the Scott's properties at Pounds 6.43m. De Morgan &amp; Co, which was commissioned by minority shareholders in BS, arrived at a figure of Pounds 2.3m. The institution concluded: 'The difference between the amounts of the two valuations is wholly attributable to a difference in valuation opinion.' Mr Lewis says that, in the past, the assets valuation standards committee has been able to rap knuckles on occasions, but it is only since a change to the bylaws in 1991 that valuation matters can be referred to the institution's disciplinary committee. This process has yet to be tested. Assuming there is no misconduct in the QMH case, that leaves open the question of whether surveyors' valuations have any meaning, particularly during a recession. Mr Len Baker, head of the valuation department at Erdman Lewis, the surveyors, says: 'I have been valuing for 30 years. I have never found it as difficult as in the last two. There is so little by way of reliable transactions. It is much more into the realm of pure opinion.' Mr Ron Paterson, technical partner at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'Valuations depend on there being a market which you can use. In the last two years it has all been more hypothetical than real (because of the recession). In the absence of transactions I don't know how the surveying profession deals with the issues. Accounts should be about recording what you have done. You're wasting your time if you put in valuations.' Mr Lewis set up a working party on valuations, which will examine methodology and is due to report by early March next year. But he says: 'There are lots of different ways you can go about valuing. There is no way of satisfactorily putting them into words.' At the start of this week, the British Association of Hotel Accountants made its own contribution to the debate with a statement of recommended practice on valuations, which strongly advises the use of discounted cash flow based on future income. But this already represents best practice in the profession, and the association's officers admit that it leaves considerable scope for professional judgment. It is this judgment that KPMG's Mr Acher questions. He argues that, when surveyors examine investment properties and similar assets with a steady, predictable income, their figures are credible. The problems begin when they attempt to examine future cash flow, capital expenditure and profit figures, which are vital for properties such as hotels. 'Surveyors don't necessarily possess all the right skills,' he says. 'The valuer ought to receive these figures signed off by an accountant. We don't see that happening. The accountants and the surveyors ought to get together to issue guidance.'</p>

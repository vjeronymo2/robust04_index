			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / New York victory puts Clinton within reach of nomination as Brown falters MR BILL Clinton left New York yesterday, after two gruelling weeks of campaigning, with the Democratic party's presidential nomination firmly in his reach, reports George Graham in Washington. By winning the New York primary on Tuesday with 41 per cent of the vote, the Arkansas governor vaulted the biggest hurdle of his campaign for the nomination. Victories in Wisconsin and Kansas on the same day added to his commanding lead over both Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California and the only major candidate still in the Democratic race, and Mr Paul Tsongas, former senator from Massachusetts, who continues to win votes although he has formally withdrawn from the race. President George Bush, meanwhile, continued to record comfortable victories in Republican party primaries. Mr Clinton acknowledged yesterday that many voters still felt uncomfortable with him because of the series of allegations about adultery, marijuana smoking and draft dodging that have beset his campaign. 'I'm not interested in whether they love me or not. I want them to respect me and want me to be their president,' he said. Although Mr Tsongas caused a surprise by winning 29 per cent of the New York vote, he said he would take several days to decide whether to re-enter the race. Most politicians in Washington believe that, even if Mr Tsongas decides to relaunch his candidacy, he will do so with a severely limited campaigning schedule, more in the hope of influencing his party's policies than of winning the nomination. Mr Brown, however, vowed to soldier on, despite having been largely repudiated by voters in New York, where he won only 25 per cent of the vote. He fared better in Wisconsin, with 35 per cent. Clinton supporters were working intensely yesterday to win over the 772 Democratic party committee members and Congress members who will take part in the nominating convention in July as unelected super-delegates. Mr Clinton is estimated to have the backing of 213 of them already, as well as that of 50 per cent of the 2,197 delegates so far committed by primaries and caucuses. Although Mr Clinton is unlikely to be able to clinch the nomination mathematically until the last round of state primaries on June 2, his supporters believe Congressional leaders will now quickly fall in behind his candidacy. 'We just got through the biggest obstacle which was New York. From here on, Jerry Brown is a mathematical impossibility and Paul Tsongas is mathematically improbable,' said Mr Charles Dolan, co-ordinator for the Clinton campaign in Virginia, which is the next state to vote.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          US PRIMARY RESULTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         DEMOCRAT                             Jerry         Bill         Paul                             Brown       Clinton       Tsongas  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- New York                   26 percent   41 percent   29 percent Winconsin                  35 percent   38 percent   22 percent Minnesota                 *32 percent  *33 percent  *23 percent Kansas                     13 percent   51 percent   15 percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Out of total of 4,288 Delegates won Tuesday      98          163          100 Total delegates           264        1,264          539  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-binding  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           US PRIMARY RESULTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   REPUBLICAN                           Pat      George        Un-                        Buchanan     Bush      committed  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- New York             No Republican primary in New York Winconsin             17 percent  77 percent  2 percent Minnesota             25 percent  68 percent  3 percent Kansas                15 percent  62 percent 16 percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Out of total of 2,209 Delegates won Tuesday  8         187          1 Total delegates       54         963          7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-binding  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

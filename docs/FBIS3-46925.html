"It means Japan is at last fully convinced that not only is  it geographically right in the midst of East Asia, but it  belongs to East Asia," said International Trade and Industry  Minister Rafidah Aziz.    "It's good if the report is true that Japan has now decided  to recognize the EAEC," she said, commenting on a report  Wednesday in a Japanese daily that quoted government sources as  saying that Tokyo has reversed its cautious EAEC stance.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN report said the new position hopes to  create a "diplomatic balance" in the Pacific region following  implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) among the United States, Canada and Mexico at the  weekend, and to curb U.S. dominance in the 17-member  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which held its  first summit in Seattle in November.    The news report was carried on the front pages of all major  Malaysian newspapers Thursday. The Japanese Foreign Ministry  declined to comment on it.    Rafidah added that Japan joining the EAEC should not detract  Tokyo's network with groupings in other parts of the world.  [sentence as received]    The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN)  hopes to lure Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan  into forming the EAEC hopefully by this year, but only China has  so far publicly welcomed the grouping. ASEAN groups Brunei,  Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.    Japan and South Korea have been noncommittal over their  participation after the previous U.S. Administration of  President George Bush strongly opposed the exclusive Asian  grouping, saying it is a potential trading bloc.    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed proposed the EAEC  in late 1990 when the recently concluded Uruguay Round of talks  to free the global trading system was bogged down mainly by  disputes between the U.S. and the European Community.    The ASAHI report said the conclusion of the talks allows  Japan to reverse its stance on the EAEC which it feared would  have hampered the round that was held under the General  Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    It added the change was also due to Japan's concern that  NAFTA is evolving into an exclusive bloc, especially since  president Bill Clinton used the threat of Japan edging out the  U.S in Mexico to garner support for NAFTA from the U.S. Congress.</p>

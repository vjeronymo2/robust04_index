			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Leading Article: In office, but not in power NORMAN LAMONT lacks the political credibility to mount a devastating attack on the prime minister. But the prime minister lacks strength to brush off even a weak one. Mr Lamont was right to charge this government with being in office, but not in power. Mr Major must respond. Otherwise, as the former chancellor also argued, the government will not survive and will not deserve to. Understandably, Mr Lamont resents having been made the scapegoat. Why, he asks, should he have resigned when no other European finance minister did so? Why should he have suffered for the collapse of the government's policy? Why should he be dismissed now when it was the prime minister who insisted he stay on? It is a funny old world. The collapse of the ERM policy destroyed the credibility of the minister who probably believed in it least. But it did destroy his credibility, which was why he had to go. The question is whether the government will make itself stronger by his absence. If it is to do so, it must heed what Mr Lamont had to say both about its style and about economic policy. Mr Lamont made three principal policy recommendations: that the budget deficit - 'the greatest threat to our long-term position' - must not be tackled by further tax increases; that there could be no question of rejoining the ERM during this parliament; and that the Bank of England should be made independent. On the first, the former chancellor is only partly right. Higher taxation looks inevitable. On the ERM, he is closer to the truth. There can be neither political nor economic benefit in returning to an unreformed ERM. It is on the last recommendation that he was wisest of all. Two out of the last three chancellors concluded that untrammelled discretion makes sound monetary policy more difficult to implement. The reason is, as Mr Lamont said, that 'interest rate changes should never be used to offset some unfavourable political event. To do so undermines the credibility of policy and the credibility of the chancellor.' But the suspicion that policy is so motivated will always be there, whatever the government's true intentions. Unfortunately, it is the third of these recent chancellors who is now prime minister. He opposes a policy of central bank independence, because he wants the central bank to be 'accountable'. But, in fact, only under an independent central bank with a clear mandate can monetary policy be made accountable. Right now it is unaccountable to anybody, except, every four or five years, to the electorate. Mr Major does, indeed, need to take strategic decisions. He should decide that for him to insist on responsibility for monetary policy awakens suspicions that are bound to make exercise of the policy more costly and less effective. To govern is to choose. But sometimes it is best to choose to let others choose.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP NOTES;  </P> <P> LOCAL TALENT TO PLAY BENEFIT MAY 19 FOR CHILD ABUSE VICTIMS  </P> <P> The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano will host a benefit May 19 for Stop the  Pain Inc., a Santa Ana-based organization devoted to helping victims of child  abuse.  </P> <P> The lineup for the 6 p.m. show features an array of strong local talent.  Performers include Kerry Getz, Ann De Jarnett and Jim Bemis, Naked Soul, Don't  Mean Maybe, 3D Picnic, Wood &amp; Smoke and the Beat Pests.  </P> <P> Advance tickets, priced at $6, are available at the Coach House and through  Moby Disc in Westminster, Music Mart and London Exchange in Costa Mesa and Pier  Records at UC Irvine. Tickets cost $10 at the door. Information: (714)  496-8930.  </P> <P> Other newly booked shows at the Coach House include Venice on May 25; Beat  Farmers and Food For Feet, June 1; Shawn Colvin, June 12; Pato Banton, June 18;  Dennis Quaid and the Swamp Tones, June 22; Albert King, June 29; and Natalie  Cole, Aug. 24.  </P> <P> BYRDS WON'T ROOST: The May 16 Byrds show advertised at Hamptons will not take  place. The booking was not solidified with a deposit, according to the band's  agent, and the group has accepted an offer to play in Tulsa, Okla., instead.  </P> <P> The version of the Byrds that had been scheduled to play at Hamptons includes  only one original Byrd, drummer Michael Clarke. A Florida judge last year  awarded Clarke the right to continue touring under the Byrds name, throwing out  a legal challenge that had been mounted by Clarke's better-known former band  mates, David Crosby, Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman.  </P> <P> In January, 1989, Crosby, McGuinn and Hillman played a series of Southern  California dates, including a show at the Coach House, as part of their failed  attempt to wrest legal control of the Byrds name away from Clarke.  </P> <P> NEW SHOWS AT IRVINE, PACIFIC: Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre puts tickets on sale  this weekend for three shows: L.A.

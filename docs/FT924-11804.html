			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Paradoxical profit promised by US disasters - Nikki Tait examines how insurers could reap gold from the whirlwind THE television pictures were horrific. Flattened trailer homes stretched as far the camera could see; sweating, distraught individuals fought over ice trucks and food supplies; children played amid rubble and overturned vehicles. But, if Hurricane Andrew left a trail of human devastation across southern Florida in late-August, did it at least do US property-casualty insurers a good turn? The industry could use some help. It has been stuck in a 'downswing' of the insurance cycle for five years, an uncomfortably extended stretch. Under conventional insurance theory, this is the period when pricing is 'soft', and insurers cannot push through meaningful premium increases. As a result, they make a loss on their underwriting activities, although they may still be profitable overall thanks to income on their investment holdings. For much of the Sixties and Seventies, these 'downswings' lasted for about three or four years. The cycle would then 'turn', as underwriting capacity - for a variety of reasons - withdrew from the marketplace. Remaining insurers duly increased their rates; their underwriting losses dwindled; and eventually they made money on insurance activ-ities. In more recent years, however, the industry has found the downswings becoming more pronounced, and the upswings less so. The last cycle, for example, began with a downswing in 1977, which lasted for seven years. It 'turned' in 1984, and insurers did enjoy three years of improving conditions. But, before the industry overall could move to an underwriting profit, the cycle turned down again in 1987. The current downswing has continued ever since. The question, then, is whether Hurricane Andrew is the catalyst which will push capacity out of the market, allow remaining insurers to raise rates, and move property-casualty (P-C) insurers in the direction of an underwriting profit. Some Wall Street analysts certainly think so, and Wednesday's revised estimate of the hurricane losses - up from Dollars 7.8bn to a staggering Dollars 10.7bn - adds weight to their case. 'Disastrous damage inflicted by Hurricane Andrew should be large enough to cause a turn in the P-C pricing cycle,' suggest analysts at Kidder, Peabody, for example. 'The improvement in pricing should start to be evident with January 1993 renewals.' Such thoughts have prompted a rally in the shares of P-C insurers - with the result that the Dow Jones index for the P-C insurance industry group has advanced by almost 10 per cent since late-August, compared with a slightly weaker equity market overall. A similar trend has been evident recently in the reinsurance sector. Proponents of this bullish scenario have a handful of arguments to bolster their case. First, they point out that Hurricane Andrew came after a series of costly disasters earlier in the year. These included the Los Angeles riots and some less-publicised but extremely violent storms which hit the grain belt. Ahead of Hurricane Andrew, therefore, 1992's insured losses from US catastrophes totalled almost Dollars 4bn - only slightly below the Dollars 4.2bn cost of Hurricane Hugo, previously the most expensive insured disaster. Secondly, US P-C insurers are generally thought to hold less catastrophe reinsurance that they did a few years ago, and hence will have to bear a larger part of the losses themselves. In the past, reinsurers - often non-US organisations, like Lloyds of London  -have picked up 30 to 40 per cent of a catastrophe's losses. Today, most analysts put the figure at nearer 20-30 per cent - a reduction which, in turn, reflects increased caution on the part of the hard-hit reinsurance industry. Finally, there is the sheer size of the Hurricane Andrew insurance bill. In early-September, the property claims division for the American Insurance Services Group, an industry trade organisation, estimated the insured losses to be around Dollars 7.3bn in Florida and perhaps another Dollars 500m in Louisiana, the second state affected by the storm. This week, it raised the figure for the two states to Dollars 10.7bn. It blamed this 37 per cent increase, at least in part, on jacked-up construction costs in Florida, and heavy rain which followed the hurricane and prevented some immediate repair work, compounding the long-term damage. Even so, a few industry executives and analysts, who have seen hopes of a turn in the cycle dashed before, still urge caution. For a start, the property-casualty industry is thought to be well capitalised at present  - a sharp contrast to the life sector, where more substantial exposure to property-related investments is taking its toll. P-C insurers generally have very low exposures to property-related holdings and high-yield bonds - the types of investment which have caused problems for life companies. On the plus side, this should allow the industry to absorb the losses without too much anguish. Moody's, the large Wall Street rating agency, notes that the sector's aggregate capital at end-1991 was Dollars 158bn, or 'plenty to cover this year's storm costs'. But, conversely, the pressure to push up rates may be mitigated. Secondly, there are some concerns that political considerations will weigh in. Much play has already been made of an internal memo from Mr Maurice Greenberg, head of the large American Insurance Group (AIG), to executives on August 24. Mr Greenberg, writing just after the hurricane struck, suggested that the storm presented an opportunity to 'get prices increases now'. That, in turn, prompted the state insurance commissioners in Florida and Louisiana to freeze AIG's rates for 60 days while they examined the company's practices. To date, there have been no indications that repercussions from the leaked memo will more widespread. Nevertheless, consumer groups have leapt on the bandwagon, with the result that rate increases - always a touchy subject - have become doubly-sensitive. Finally, it is worth remembering that the impact of the hurricane has not been spread evenly - either between individual insurance companies, or between the various elements within the P-C market. How the storm will affect different insurance lines is still a hotly-debated subject. Some pundits believe the economic structure of Florida's Dade County - a large number of poor and probably under-insured residential properties but some big retail malls which were effectively flattened - means that pricing in the difficult commercial multi-peril market stands a good chance of firming. Others claim that other external factors will keep commercial lines 'soft', and the impact will be confined to personal lines. Still, the proof of the pudding in the eating - and some signs of discomfort are already becoming evident in individual situations. Only this week American Reliance Group, a New Jersey-based property-casualty insurer, said it had reached the limits of its catastrophe reinsurance coverage, and needed to raise capital in the wake of rising losses from the hurricane. The fourth-quarter dividend was axed, and management did not rule out a sale of the company. And American Reliance, one suspects, may not be alone in its misery.</p>

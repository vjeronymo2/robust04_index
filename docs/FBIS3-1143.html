Nino Vieira revoked the decree providing for the elections to  be held on 27 March. In a communique issued by the presidency  of the Council of State, the Guinean president says that his  decision to postpone the elections again is linked to the note  from the National Election Commission which states that it is  not technically possible to hold the elections. Fernando  Pereira reports from Guinea-Bissau.    [Pereira] At this rate, Guinea-Bissau will enter the  Guinness  Book of Records as the African country with the longest  transition process to democracy. In effect, the process started  in 1991, and this is the third time that the pluralist elections  have been postponed. This measure has not come as a surprise.  Since last month, it has been known that it was practically  impossible to hold elections on the set date, 27 March. The  delay in the registration process, the main electoral task, is  one of the reasons for the postponenent. Another reason, given  recently, was the inadequate functioning of the regional  election commissions and irregularities in the selection of  candidates for drawing up the electoral lists. Finally, this  latest postponment has much to do with the serious economic  crisis in the country, which could be further aggravated by this  postponement.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Labour poll boost The popularity of Tony Blair's Labour party has risen still further following his conference triumph, giving his party a 17 point lead over the Tories, according to a poll in today's Guardian. In the monthly ICM poll 49 per cent said they would support Labour, 32 per cent Conservative and 15 per cent the Liberal Democrats. October's survey results match those for Labour in August, shortly after Mr Blair was elected party leader. In July they registered 44 per cent and 45 per cent in September.</p>

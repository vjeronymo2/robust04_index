			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Nabi 'Abd-al-Sattar] </F>   [Excerpts] The general commissioner of the Damascus main  branch of the Arab Bureau on the Boycott of Israel is making  contacts with Arab governments to set a date for the bureau's  67th session, which has been postponed since October 1993.    Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo affirm that Syria is  currently leading a large-scale diplomatic effort to persuade  Arab states to hold on to the boycott weapon until all occupied  Arab territories are liberated. The sources revealed that seven  Arab states in Asia and Africa have ended their second- and  third-level economic boycotts of Israel.    At its last meeting in late March, the Arab League  Ministerial Council reiterated the Arab states' firm concurence  with the provisions of the boycott and their resistance to  foreign legislation opposing the boycott. The reason the  council gave was the continued Israeli occupation of Palestine,  the Golan Heights, and South Lebanon.    The United States and other Western states have recently  sought to persuade Arab states to shrink their boycott of Israel  gradually and eventually end it. [passage omitted]    The latest report the Boycott Bureau issued includes a list  of 60 companies, firms, and foreign banks that have violated the  terms of the boycott. The bureau called for including these on  the black list. The companies are British, American, Spanish,  and Bulgarian.    The bureau recommended that the ban be lifted on certain  Dutch, British, Swedish, Australian, American, Swiss, Greek,  French, Canadian, Singaporean, and Danish firms. These firms  submitted documents proving the integrity of their position.    The report demanded the addition of 6 ships belonging to  Panama, the Bahamas, Honduras, and Malaysia to the black list.</p>

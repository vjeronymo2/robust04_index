			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (13): A tale of two funerals - Reviving Islam challenges Ataturk's legacy of secularism UGUR MUMCU (pronounced 'Oo-oor Moomjoo') was Turkey's best known investigative journalist, delving into the murky waters of terrorism, drug-running, intelligence services and the connections between them. He became known internationally for his work on 'the Bulgarian connection' behind the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II by a young right-wing Turkish fanatic. But in Turkey he was known also as an outspoken political columnist in the main left-wing newspaper Cumhuriyet ('Republic'), an upholder of democratic socialism and personal and political freedom, and an untiring scourge of corruption, oppression, intimidation and censorship, whether exercised by the state or by militant Islamic agitators. Such a man makes many friends, and quite a few dangerous enemies. But when Mumcu was killed by a car-bomb on January 24 most people assumed he was the latest victim of Islamic fundamentalism. (Other similar murders have been linked to groups trained in Iran, though in this one the police have yet to make an arrest, or even name a suspect.) Overnight, Mumcu became a symbol of Turkey's secular tradition, established by the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. At his funeral in Ankara, 'nearly 500,000 people walked for five hours in the rain', according to his friend and colleague Ozgen Acar, the editor of Cumhuriyet. 'The slogans were for secularism and the principles of Ataturk. Since then about 25m people have demonstrated in all the cities of Turkey, even though not more than 200,000 could have read his articles.' Even allowing for exaggeration, Mumcu's death clearly mobilised a broad swathe of Turkish public opinion which values the 'Kemalist' legacy very highly, and believes it is under threat. Three months later, at President Turgut Ozal's funeral in Istanbul, the following slogans were shouted: 'Islamic Turkey cannot be secular.' 'Stop this music, obey his will.'# 'We want a Moslem leader for a Moslem people.' 'This is Turkey, not Israel.' 'Santa Sofia## must be open for Moslems.' 'Turkey is Islamic, Cankaya (the presidential palace) must be Islamic.' This was clearly an organised demonstration, possibly planned by the Naqshbandi fraternity to which Ozal belonged, with other religious groups and some unorganised bystanders joining in. It may even have been intended as a direct response to the Mumcu funeral and the movement which it unleashed. Turgut Ozal himself would certainly not have approved of all the slogans. Nor is his quasi-canonisation accepted by all Islamic activists. For instance, Ismet Ozel, a leading Islamic thinker who writes for Milli Gazetti, the newspaper of the Islamic 'Refah', or 'welfare', party, says: 'I never considered Ozal a positive figure. Islam had no function in his government. If he was a good Moslem it means there is no need to realise Islam in practice, that we can accept our Moslem identity without it influencing our daily decisions.' From this perspective, Ozal's pro-western policies and his integration of Turkey into the world economic system were contrary to Islam. But other Islamic activists feel grateful to Ozal for at least making no bones about the fact that he was a believing and practising Moslem, whereas previous presidents had considered that any public religious gesture on their part would infringe the secular nature of the state. Ozal challenged the Kemalist legacy in other ways, too. He gently debunked the orthodox Kemalist version of history, with its near-deification of Ataturk and denigration of the Ottoman regime which he brought to an end. He once remarked that, when at school, he had believed the text books which depicted Abdulhamit, the Sultan deposed by the 'Young Turk' revolutionaries in 1909 as a bloodthirsty tyrant, and disbelieved his grandfather who told him it was not true. Only later, when he travelled abroad and was able to read more widely, did he come to the conclusion that his grandfather had been right. Prof Nur Bilge Criss, a historian of the period in question, says that, as so often in history, the truth lies somewhere between the two. But for her, as a feminist married to a non-Moslem, Ataturk's secular legacy remains vitally important. 'It means I am free to have dinner with you, without my husband, and without covering my head,' she says. To which most Turkish Islamic activists reply that they have no desire to introduce compulsion into matters of personal morality: in their state, it would be up to her, as a Moslem woman, to decide in her own conscience what rules she should obey. Indignantly disclaiming any connection with Mumcu's murder (which they suggest was a 'provocation', probably staged by some Turkish or foreign intelligence service), they claim that all they want is full freedom of expression and association, plus some reflection in public life of the religion nominally professed by 98 per cent of Turkish citizens. Some say they would even be happy with a genuine western-style secularism, in which mosques and religious education would no longer be state-controlled (though perhaps, when it came to the point, they would be less willing to give up the large share of taxpayers' money now spent on such institutions). On this ground some modern-minded Kemalists, such as Ismail Cem, of the left-wing Republican People's Party, would be prepared to meet them. 'Secularism,' he says, 'should be a guarantee for believers as well - for the girl who wants to wear a veil as well as the one who doesn't. The state should hand over religion to civil society. It might be too early to discuss this in Turkey, but we should start to tell each other that the final goal of secularism is the 'withering away of the state' from all matters of religion.' To western ears, that sounds a good idea; and anyone familiar with Islamic activists in other Moslem countries can only be struck by the moderation, and attachment to democracy, of most of those who pass for 'fundamentalists' in Turkish politics. If their statements could be taken at face value, one would have to conclude that Ataturk's revolution has succeeded, and that the Turkish state could now afford to dismantle what is left of the iron cage in which its founder sought to imprison the monster of Islamic obscurantism. But most Turkish secularists, looking uneasily at the 'Islamic' states to the east and south, do not take those statements at face value, and feel the need to keep the beast in its cage a while yet. The battle for the Turkish soul is far from over. #This referred to a rumour which ran round Turkey in the days after Ozal's death, that he had left a will directing that he be buried 'according to my religion', and that Chopin's funeral march should not be played. Had he really done so, it seems most unlikely that his widow would have allowed his wishes to be ignored. ##The famous mosque in Istanbul, originally a Byzantine cathedral, was made a secular museum on Ataturk's orders in the 1930s.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUSTING SEIDMAN  </P> <P> With the S&amp;L scandal growing daily, the Bush Administration now wants to  get rid of the messenger, bailout chief Seidman (Part A, May 2).  </P> <P> They are apparently angry with Seidman who has shown great independence in  giving the public a true picture of this mess. Seidman says that the bailout,  first estimated to have a price tag to the taxpayers of $100 billion, now looks  like $500 billion or more. The public has a right to know that the politicians  in both parties let this thing happen to us.  </P> <P> HARMON FELLOWS  </P> <P> Joshua Tree  </P></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Gas supremo prepares to put competition proposals into effect Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the director-general of gas supply, will be the chief figure in shaping the new gas market after the government's decision this week to abolish British Gas' monopoly by 1998. She will have to draw up the rules for the new market and then ensure that it delivers the promised benefits. It is a daunting task after only two months in the job. She professes, however, to be wholly in tune with the proposals set out by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. She said his decision 'mirrors exactly the ideas I put to the Department of Trade and Industry. Millions of gas users will reap the rewards of greater choice and lower prices flowing from the introduction of full-scale competition.' Her immediate task will be to put together a consultation paper on the new arrangements in February. Central issues will be how to encourage new suppliers to enter the market while at the same time safeguarding consumers' rights to a gas supply. This will involve preparing terms for a gas supply licence and drawing up a code of conduct for gas companies. She will have to set a new level for price controls on gas supplied to the tariff market. At present prices may rise only by the retail prices index minus 5 percentage points. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended that this be raised to RPI minus 4 percentage points to compensate British Gas for the costs of restructuring the market. Ms Spottiswoode pledged that once she had set the new formula she would not tinker with it, so as to provide a certain framework for the market. In 1996, Ms Spottiswoode will have to launch the two-year transition to a fully competitive market in domestic supplies by deciding how large a market share new entrants can have at the initial stage. The indication given by Mr Heseltine was that this would start at 5 per cent. After 1998 the market will be completely liberalised. What is not yet clear is whether price controls will persist after that date. That will depend on whether Ms Spottiswoode is satisfied that competitive forces are strong enough to shape prices by themselves. She will also have to decide whether the internal separation of the various parts of British Gas' business, as required by Mr Heseltine, is working properly. Ms Spottiswoode comes to the job with a strong belief in the virtues of competition. She believes Mr Heseltine was right to put a priority on abolishing British Gas' monopoly rather than trying to break it up which would have meant postponing the free market for several years. She does not think that the issue of British Gas' structure will be a long-term problem. She said: 'The changes being put in place by the company are so fundamental it won't be a long-term issue. It will all be relatively quick.' Although the MMC was keen to see British Gas split up, she said the company was changing so fast that the commission would probably have come to a different conclusion if it was conducting its investigation now. She is also convinced that the de-regulated market will attract sufficient competitors to make it work, and that fears that parts of the country might be left without a gas supply are groundless. She said: 'I see a lot of potential competition. There is no reason why suppliers should not want to supply.' Ms Spottiswoode made clear that she was not seeking the confrontational approach of Sir James McKinnon, her combative predecessor. 'I see no conflict in having a good professional relationship with British Gas and being a tough regulator,' she said.</p>

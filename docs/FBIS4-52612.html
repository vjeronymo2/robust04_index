			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Thursday [12 May] he wants to see Japanese and U.S. trade  officials return to the negotiating table for the deadlocked  framework trade talks before the July summit meeting of the  Group of Seven major industrial countries.    Hata said at a plenary session of the House of  Representatives that negotiations in specific areas should be  resumed before the summit, adding his government will seize  every opportunity to reopen the bilateral talks, foundered in  February. But Hata reiterated Japan cannot accept numerical  targets to measure market access improvement, saying setting  such targets runs counter to Japan's basic stance on trade.    Bilateral trade relations soured after former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed at  their meeting in February to reach a trade pact under a  bilateral framework agreement in July 1993.    The talks broke down after Japan rejected a U.S. demand for  numerical targets to gauge progress in such areas as the auto,  insurance, medical equipment and telecommunications markets.    Hata said his government plans to pursue bold economic  reforms, focused on deregulations and domestic demand-led growth  to solve the bilateral dispute over Japan's huge trade surplus  with the United States.    On current economic conditions, Hata said the domestic  economy remains by and large in a slump despite some bright  signs.    While pointing to a brisk housing sector and a slight  recovery in consumer spending, he admitted corporate capital  investments continue to decline, and the labor market is weak  with prospects for corporate earnings still bleak. He said the  government will make every effort to put the economy back on a  firm footing "as early as possible in fiscal 1994."    The government will place a high priority on securing a  stable labor market and on sustainable economic growth propelled  by expansion of domestic demand, he said.</p>

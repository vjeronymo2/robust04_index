			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Economists call for floating franc A GROUP of private-sector French economists has called for the currency to be allowed to float against the D-mark, opening up another crack in the establishment's consensus on the need for a strong franc. At this week's Franco-German treaty anniversary celebrations, President Francois Mitterrand was firmly against any de-coupling of the franc from the D-Mark. Most proponents of a more flexible exchange rate have been identifiable anti-Europeans. But members of France's National Association of Doctoral Graduates in Economics have concluded in their latest bulletin that although it has lower inflation than Germany, France will not succeed in bringing its interest rates below those of Germany. These economists are impressed with the three-point fall in UK short-term rates since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism. Only a narrowing of the gap between France's low inflation rate and high nominal interest rates will make it worthwhile for French companies to resume investing and creating jobs, they argue: if a floating franc means a franc sinking against the D-Mark, 'it would be better to accept it, as the price of stopping the asphyxiation of the French economy.' In fact, the economy does not seem to be choking, according to figures published yesterday showing a 5.4 per cent rise in manufactured sales in December. The requirement for higher environmental standards from this month on led to a surge in car sales at the end of 1992.</p>

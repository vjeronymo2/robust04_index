			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Syria's View of Peace,"  AL-BA'TH says: During his meeting the day before yesterday with  the 1948 Palestinians delegation, President Hafiz al-Asad  reaffirmed Syria's view of a just and comprehensive peace. He  also stressed that it was Syria which opened the doors to peace  by accepting the U.S. initiative, on the basis of which the  peace process started in Madrid.    The paper explains that Syria accepted the U.S. initiative  because it was very clear and stipulated the implementation of  UN resolutions, particularly 242 and 338, and the land-for-peace  formula.    The paper says that in his speech the day before yesterday,  President Hafiz al-Asad explained that Syria seriously wants  peace, while Israel only speaks about peace without making one  step in that direction.    The paper notes that the Washington talks have confirmed  Syria's serious desire to achieve the just and comprehensive  peace in the region. This was confirmed by the questions which  Syria raises for discussion. Syria emphasizes the substance,  while Israel avoids it. Israel always raises questions that are  very far from the peace process and that run contrary to the  endeavor to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria will accept nothing short of  implementing the UN resolutions, on which the peace process is  based. It also notes what President al-Asad has stressed; that  world developments will not force us to relinquish any of our  rights.    The paper says the world is now fully aware of the details  of  the Arab-Israeli conflict. Consequently, this world now knows  very well who wants and works for the genuine peace and those  who work against it.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH urges the world  community  to play its presumed role and compel Israel to implement UN  resolutions out of concern for the world's peace and security  and in order to entrench the principle of international  legitimacy.    On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says: As he does every time  he speaks about peace, the peace process, and the obstacles  blocking the realization of the objectives of that process,  President Hafiz al-Asad explained that the peace which the Arabs  and Syria want is the just peace that is based on the UN  Security Council resolutions stipulating complete withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories and the return of the  Palestinian Arab people's rights.    AL-THAWRAH says: This explanation, which President Hafiz  al-Asad adds at this phase as a new confirmation of the firmness  and clarity of Syria's position on the peace process, entails a  specific message; the peace which Syria seeks is so clear that  it does not need any explanation, as claimed by Israel, and that  the obstacle facing the achievement of peace in the region lies  in Israel's policy and positions.    The paper notes that despite the fact that the UN  resolutions  clearly stipulate that peace can be achieved through complete  withdrawal, and despite the fact that the U.S. initiative was  founded on this clear and logical explanation of the peace  formula when it based the peace process and the achievement of  its goals on the land-for-peace formula, the Israeli rulers  still insist on specifying the meaning of the peace which Syria  wants, although the world unanimously agrees that Syria's view  of peace is fully compatible with the view of the international  legitimacy.    AL-THAWRAH notes the innumerable pieces of evidence of  Israel's rejection of peace, the most important of which can be  seen in Israel's extortionist and impossible requests, in the  studied aggressive escalation against Lebanon and its southern  part, and in the programmed mass murders against the Palestinian  Arab people.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that the peace which the Arabs want and  agree on is, as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, a  comprehensive and complete peace. Unless peace is  comprehensive, there can be no peace.    In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: When he states the  Syrian position on the peace process and stresses that the kind  of peace we want is the complete and comprehensive peace, the  peace of the brave that would return the land and the  Palestinian people's rights and guarantee that each party gets  what is rightfully his without humiliating the other party,  Leader al-Asad is stressing the constants, the principles, and  the firmness that govern the Syrian policy, which cannot --  under any circumstance -- bargain over or relinquish a grain of  soil or national right.    AL-THAWRAH says: He who thinks that we are fighting the  battle for peace from a weak position is mistaken. Syria is  strong enough and it still holds the reins of the initiative.  Our position, as stressed by President Hafiz al-Asad, is very  strong and gives us confidence and assurance. We are advocating  our rights and the world developments will not force us to  retreat.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: When the nation puts its  weight behind Syria, it is because it realizes that the Syrian  position, under the leadership of President al-Asad, expresses  the Arab dignity and consciousness and is the only guarantee for  the return of pan-Arab rights.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LAGOMARSINO ON CHILD CARE  </P> <P> Iam outraged that Rep. Bob Lagomarsino plans to vote against his own child-care  bill, as he stated in an article in The Times on April 13.  </P> <P> If he is indeed concerned about the cost, then he should vote against the B-2  bomber and save enough money to fund many child-care programs. Children, our  most precious possessions, are relegated to the lowest priorities of our  budget.  </P> <P> Mr. Lagomarsino, I challenge you to rethink your values and your vote.  </P> <P> VIRGINIA L. UNRUHE  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

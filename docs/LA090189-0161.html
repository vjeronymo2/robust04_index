			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPANESE FIRM TO BUY LYPHOMED  </P> <P> Lyphomed Inc. said today it has agreed to be bought by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical  Co. Ltd., a Japanese firm that already owns 30% of the drug manufacturer, for  about $670 million.  </P> <P> Lyphomed, based in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, enjoyed explosive growth in  the mid-1980s, largely through its sales of pentamidine, a drug used to treat  AIDS-related pneumonia. Overall sales soared from $4 million to $172 million  from 1981 through 1987.  </P> <P> Lyphomed makes primarily injectable pharmaceutical products used by critically  ill people.  </P> <P> The company ran into hard times last year after the federal Food and Drug  Administration uncovered quality control problems at several Lyphomed plants.  It lost $21.1 million in 1988. Lyphomed has since shuffled top management and  posted a profit of $105,000 on revenues of $71.7 million in the first six  months of 1989.  </P></p>

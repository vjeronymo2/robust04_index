			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: DRUG, BLOOD CANCER RISK LINKED  </P> <P> Treatment of heart transplant patients with a powerful immune suppressing drug  appears to sharply increase their risk of a lethal form of blood cell cancer, a  study concludes.  </P> <P> Researchers found that 11% of patients at one hospital who were treated this  way quickly developed lymphoma, and most of those people died.  </P> <P> The treatment is called OKT3, an antibody that attacks a variety of white blood  cells that play a key role in making the body reject the transplanted organ.  The new study shows that even if OKT3 prevents rejection -- and this is in  doubt -- the benefit comes at a high price of cancer risk.  </P></p>

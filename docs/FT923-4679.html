			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Treaty makes best-seller FRANCE'S bookshops have experienced a sudden surge of sales lately as people have flocked to buy books on the whys and wherefores of European union, to help make up their minds on how to vote in the Maastricht referendum on September 20. 'We've been amazed,' said Mr Jerome Castelot, manager of the bookshop at the Virgin Megastore on the Champs Elysees in Paris. 'Some Maastricht books are selling so quickly that we can't get keep up with demand.' The best-seller is the treaty itself, Traite de Maastricht, Mode D'Emploi (How to Use It), a 600-page tome that has already sold more than 55,000 copies. The more accessible Mieux Comprendre le Traite de Maastricht (A Better Understanding of the Maastricht Treaty), a 39-page pocket guide, is also going well. The government has recorded the treaty on cassettes for France's 100,000 blind voters. These carry a notice on European union in Braille and were made available at the state secretariat for the handicapped, where the switchboard operator said: 'The phone has not stopped ringing.' Then there is the plethora of books trying to persuade the French to vote Yes or No on September 20. Le Nouvel Observateur magazine this week counted seven tracts from the No camp, four from the Yes, and six were uncommitted. The titles of the No and Yes tracts are self-explanatory: Notre Europe Sans Maastricht (Our Europe Without Maastricht) by Mr Philippe de Villiers, the centre-right UDF party politician who is one of the most active anti-Maastricht campaigners, paints a rosy picture of Europe in general and France in particular if the treaty were rejected. Trans-Europe Express by Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, social affairs minister, also predicts a rosy scenario, if the treat is ratified. The aesthetics of the books are predictable too. The No camp favours the red, white and blue of the French tricolor flag; the Yes faction prefers the blue of the EC flag. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, socialist president of the National Assembly, has sprinkled his book jacket with yellow EC stars and a red Oui (Yes). Most of the Maastricht publishers have spent as little as possible on design, having sensibly concluded that any book about the treaty will probably be unsellable once the polls have closed on September 20. The big type and generous white space used in some books suggest that they were written in a hurry. The most successful of the political tracts is De L'Europe et de la France (On Europe and France) by Ms Marie-France Garaud, a prominent conservative, and Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist politician selected to represent the No camp in the television debate with President Francois Mitterrand on Thursday. Their publishers claim the book has sold 50,000 copies.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Accountancy board divided on changes to handling of goodwill The Accounting Standards Board will today unveil two alternative proposals for the treatment of goodwill in companies' accounts after its own members were unable to agree a common line on one of the most controversial issues in accounting. Goodwill is the difference between what a company pays to acquire another business and the value of the net assets of the company acquired. It measures intangible assets, such as customers' goodwill, which are being acquired. But some companies have used goodwill in an attempt to disguise the high price they have paid for an acquisition. The board's eight members were equally divided between allowing companies to put goodwill into a special reserve, or hold it on the balance sheet and write it off as its value diminishes over time. Mr David Tweedie, the board's chairman, said yesterday that if no agreement emerged he planned to hold open hearings to resolve the issue. This approach would mark a significant shift from the way the board usually makes decisions, through consensus and behind closed doors. When the board debates the topic again next year, two members will have changed. The selection of their replacements will be influential in determining the outcome. The board acknowledges that goodwill is an accounting anomaly and that there is no complete solution for the way it can be treated. Current practice in the UK is out of line with the rest of the world, which requires goodwill to be written off over a number of years. The board proposes six options, but will recommend two: Goodwill should be capitalised on a company's balance sheet and amortised over a fixed period of probably 20 years. If the goodwill has a longer economic life, it should be amortised in accordance with an annually reviewed procedure. Goodwill could be transferred to a separate reserve immediately a company is acquired and its value assessed annually. The paper says that intangible assets, such as brands and patents, should be subsumed within purchased goodwill and not treated separately. Comments on the paper are due before April 30. This should lead to more detailed proposals in the autumn. Accounting for Goodwill. Discussion Paper. Accountancy Books, PO Box 620, Central Milton Keynes. MK9 2JX.

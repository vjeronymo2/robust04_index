			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover gains a hopeful platform for the future Sir, The points raised by Messrs Wiltshire and de Looze (Letters, February 2) about the sale of Rover Group to BMW seem based more on emotional patriotism than fact. I find it surprising that Mr Wiltshire should consider it a sad conclusion of the deal that the Rover 800 replacement will be based on a BMW platform. What is so terrible about using a platform from a motor company recognised as building the finest chassis in the world? Moreover, he believes that, as a consequence, the R&amp;D work on this model will be concentrated in Germany. He overlooks the fact that no fewer than three of Rover's model ranges (200/400,600 and 800) are based on Honda platforms, yet the Rover versions were not developed in Japan. And it is wrong to suggest BMW is interested only in Land Rover. BMW is buying Rover for its expertise in smaller, front-wheel-drive vehicles - an example of how technology will flow both ways in this deal. Mr de Looze asserts three Rover models are 'overdue for replacement' (800, 200/400, and the Metro). While few would dispute this in the case of the Metro, sales of the 200/400 and 800 suggest car buyers disagree. It is regrettable Rover is to pass out of British ownership. But it would have been sadder had it continued to suffer the indifference, incompatibility and restricted investment offered by BAe. Mr Wiltshire threatens to stop buying Rover cars. Is this the best way to help Rover's 33,000 British employees? Simon Bates, Cathedral Court, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH</p>

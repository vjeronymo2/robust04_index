			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Trading warning hits Instem shares Instem's share price fell by 19p to 81p yesterday after the USM-quoted company said the trading position of its electronics arm had worsened and as a result group pre-tax profit for the year might be significantly lower than last time's Pounds 1.01m. The board said receivers had recently been appointed to two of the division's customers. The precise impact upon the company would depend on the outcome of the receiverships. However, it was likely that an exceptional charge would be incurred, which could hit profits for the year to January 1. It intended to maintain the final dividend at last year's 3p.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (2): Crackdown on banks welcomed - Reputation as a bolt hole persists There is a story in Monegasque banking circles that an Italian recently appeared in one of the local banks bearing a cardboard box containing L7bn in used notes which, he told the manager, was the profit from the sale of his business back in Italy. Such stories crop up from time to time in Monaco, although not as often as they did in the past. The principality still has the reputation of being a secure and discreet bolt hole for large quantities of cash. But the introduction last year of tough new laws to crack down on money laundering and to compel local banks to exercise tighter scrutiny over the source of their clients' funds, gave a very clear indication of the way the government plans to encourage the banking industry to develop. 'Monaco has established itself as a financial centre in a very short time,' says Michel de Robillard, chairman of Credit Foncier de Monaco, the subsidiary of Suez, the French financial group, which is one of the biggest banks in the principality. 'The government realises that if Monaco is to fulfil its full potential in the financial sphere, the banking industry must be strong and clean.' There has always been a small banking business in Monaco but it was only after 1987, when the French government abolished exchange controls thereby enabling foreign clients to move money quickly and discreetly in and out of the country, that the local financial industry really took off. The number of banks operating in the principality has since doubled to around 40. The old independent Monegasque banks have all disappeared. The banking market is dominated by the big French financial groups such as Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale, Paribas and Suez. Yet the other leading names in European banking are also represented. Most Monaco banks concentrate on providing private banking services for the wealthy private clients - or 'high net worth individuals', as they prefer to call them - who want to take advantage of the country's tax advantages. Any foreigner, apart from the French, does not have to pay tax on money deposited or invested in the principality. The private banking sector has expanded dramatically since 1987 with the total value of client deposits almost quadrupling from around FFr22bn (Dollars 3.95bn) eight years ago to an estimated FFr80bn today. The deposit market grew by between 20 and 25 per cent a year during the late 1980s and has continued to expand (albeit at a slower rate) since the start of the economic recession. 'It's true to say that life is more difficult in private banking than it was at the height of the boom three or four years ago,' says Martin Peake, head of the Monegasque branch of Lloyds, the UK banking group. 'But we've had a far easier time than private bankers in other places. The market here in Monaco is still growing. It's just growing more slowly.' The consensus among local financiers is that the value of private client deposits rose by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent last year and has increased by about 5 per cent in the opening months of this year. However, these figures conceal a trend for clients to counter lower interest rates by switching their money from deposits into more efficient vehicles such as mutual or managed funds. As a result the local banks benefited last year from an estimated 20 per cent increase in the value of the assets placed in Monaco. This expansion helped to counter the effects of the economic recession, which has posed problems for the dozen or so local banks that are still involved with commercial banking activities such as loans to local companies and property finance. Monaco has not been as badly affected by the economic downturn as nearby Nice or Cannes. However, some sectors of the economy, notably the tourist industry and property development, have been depressed with a knock-on effect on their banks. The continued growth in private banking has also persuaded some new international banks to sustain the financial sector's expansion by setting up subsidiaries in Monaco. The latest arrivals include the ABN of the Netherlands. Local financiers suspect that one of the main reasons for the buoyancy of the banking market is psychological. 'Monaco is an attractive place, but it's also clean and peaceful,' says Mr de Robillard of Credit Foncier de Monaco. 'There's virtually no crime, which means that our clients can feel calm and comfortable when they come here. All that is very appealing at a time of uncertainty.' He is also convinced that the banking industry has benefited from becoming more professional in recent years due to the restructuring efforts of the banks themselves and the expansion in related areas such as the arrival of international legal firms. The new banking legislation has been welcomed as part of this process particularly by those who remember the collapse of Banque Industrielle de Monaco in 1989. The bank was closed by the French banking authorities after an official investigation discovered that it had built a substantial business by accepting 'cat's paw' bearer deposit notes in Monegasque names for tax-evading French residents. 'None of us wants to see a repetition of the BIM debacle,' says one local banker. 'It would be bad for Monaco's image and bad for business. Nor would it be in anyone's interest for Monaco to become a haven for money launderers.' Monaco has always been subject to French banking regulations but most local financiers believe that the new laws give them a necessary layer of extra protection. 'This legislation won't actually alter the way that we operate,' says Mr Peake of Lloyds Bank. 'But it should help us by sending out the right signals. It might make our international clients feel more confident about investing their money here.'</p>

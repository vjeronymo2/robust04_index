			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: A policy in disarray - Robert Rice on the UK government's attitude to competition and deregulation Two weeks ago, UK competition policy looked in total disarray. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of the Office of Fair Trading, had just announced that he was to step down early as head of the UK's competition watchdog. The known preference of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for industrial policy over competition policy had driven away the last advocate of a strong consumerist approach to competition policy. At the same time, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which, under the chairmanship of Mr Graeme Odgers, a former industrialist, stands 'four square' with Mr Heseltine's views on privatisation, competitiveness and deregulation, had little to do. Suddenly, however, a flurry of activity has led some observers to suggest that reports of the death of competition policy are greatly exaggerated. Both the GEC and British Aerospace bids for VSEL, the UK submarine maker, have been referred to the MMC, as has the Performing Rights Society over its handling of royalties for composers and song writers. The proposed Halifax and Leeds building societies merger may also be referred. Mr Bill Bishop of Lexecon, the economic consultancy, says: 'Two weeks ago you could have said 'Heseltinisation' resulted in non-statutory abolition of competition policy - but you can't say that now.' Others argue it is too early to talk about a revival of competition policy. They feel the VSEL case could be a one-off. At first sight, the decision to refer the bids sits oddly with Mr Heseltine's relaxation of policy to help create strong UK champions capable of competing globally. The City was certainly taken by surprise and VSEL's share price fell sharply on the news from Pounds 15.35 to Pounds 13.35. His decision was also unusual. The GEC bid was referred on competition grounds, because GEC already owns the other large warship yard at Yarrow on the Clyde. But the BAe bid raised no competition issues. It was referred because of issues of 'public interest involving national security'. Since the introduction in 1984 of the so-called 'Tebbit doctrine', which made competition the primary criterion of merger reference policy, no other bid by a British company has been referred to the MMC on non-competition grounds. If it had not been for Treasury pressure on Mr Heseltine to preserve an element of competition in this area of defence procurement, he would almost certainly have cleared both bids, despite the OFT recommendation that the GEC bid be referred on competition grounds. Having bowed to Treasury pressure on the GEC bid, however, the BAe referral can only have been for political expediency, particularly as it contradicts stated DTI policy of not referring just to level the playing field between rival bidders. The most recent example of that policy at work was the 1992 battle for Midland Bank where Lloyds Bank's bid was referred but Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's was not. The uniqueness of the VSEL case - in terms of industry and political considerations - makes it difficult to conclude the DTI is showing sudden renewed interest in competition policy. Most signs still point to Mr Heseltine's continuing lack of interest in competition policy. Sir Bryan appears to accept he failed to nudge the DTI or MMC towards a more consumerist approach. His belief that markets should be free of anti-competitive restraints unless patently of benefit to the consumer has been rejected by a succession of MMC reports on fine fragrances, ice-cream and recorded music. Since the MMC cleared the record industry in the summer of acting together to keep the price of compact discs in Britain artificially high, he has not recommended the referral of any cases involving vertical restraints to the MMC. The government has also been relaxed to the point of indifference about acting on competition concerns raised C reports. In August, Mr Neil Hamilton, then corporate affairs minister, announced after long delays that the government was implementing three MMC reports. The report on London exhibition halls would be implemented after the failure, after eight months of negotiations, to secure satisfactory undertakings from five electrical companies which enjoyed a complex monopoly giving exhibitors no say in buying electrical services. He also announced that he had accepted statutory undertakings from Mainline Group, formerly South Yorkshire Transport, to remedy the anti-competitive effects of its 1989 acquisitions of four rival Sheffield bus companies. Both MMC reports were published in 1990. Although the subject of court challenges, these had been dealt with by the end of 1992. The government has also finally accepted undertakings from Stagecoach Holdings, the bus company, which followed the MMC's 1990 report on its acquisition of Formia, an East Sussex bus company. Other MMC reports remain unimplemented more than a year after publication. Satisfactory undertakings have still not been negotiated with Prosper de Mulder, the leading UK animal waste rendering company, more than a year after the MMC suggested measures to prevent further breaches of undertakings given by the company in 1986 and to curb discriminatory pricing. The apparent inability of the OFT to tackle abuses of market power when confronted with red-blooded monopolists sends the wrong signals about anti-competitive behaviour to UK companies, competition lawyers argue. It also suggests British competition law badly needs reform. The government's decision last year to retreat from radical changes to the rules on abuses of market power may have pleased the industry lobby which opposed the prospect of heavy fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods too cheaply, but it is looking indefensible, these lawyers add. . Reform of restrictive trade practices legislation - which would bring the UK more closely into line with Europe by prohibiting anti-competitive agreements, such as price fixing cartels, and make companies liable to heavy fines for breaches of the law - was first promised in 1987. In January Sir Bryan criticised the government for not including the reforms in this year's DereguLation Act. Welcoming articles to reduce the burdens on industry of competition law, he said reform of the law on anti-competitive agreements would have 'reduced the burdens on business generally while also creating a more effective protection of competition'. The government's failure to include the reforms in this year's Queen's Speech is thought to have been decisive in Sir Bryan's decision to resign from the OFT. By failing to take action on competition law reform the UK is also becoming isolated in Europe, many competition lawyers believe. A project is under way in Brussels to see how decision-making under EU competition laws - article 85 of the Rome treaty on anti-competitive agreements and article 86 on abuse of market power - can be shared with member states. Articles 85 and 86 are already directly applicable in the UK when inter-state trade is affected, so British industry cannot ignore the EU regime. But with the exception of the Dutch, who are moving towards a system based on articles 85 and 86, Britain is now the only EU member state without a regime based on prohibition of anti-competitive practices backed by a system of fines. Decentralisation of decision-making requires convergence of competition rules in Europe. Mr Christopher Bright, a partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines, the international law firm, says: 'There is no doubt Brussels is very uneasy about UK case handling.' But European competition law is also in a state of flux. Mr Bright says there is controversy over the expansive nature of article 85, which prohibits many agreements with no significant anti-competitive effect unless the Commission grants a specific exemption. Some European Commission officials indicate the case-by-case approach of the US under the Sherman Act might be preferable. These issues are important to UK businesses. But by remaining on the fringes there is a danger Britain will be unable to influence the outcome of these deliberations. Whitehall rumours say the issue of restrictive trade practices law reform may not be dead after all. Whether the government was shocked by Sir Bryan's resignation into reviving the idea is not clear. But what is apparent is that UK competition policy remains in disarray.</p>

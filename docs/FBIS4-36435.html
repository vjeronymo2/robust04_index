			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Government affirmed once more its flagrant  interference in the internal affairs of sisterly Algeria and is  poking its nose into matters which do not concern it.    The U.S. President called on the Algerian Government to  hold,  what he called, a dialogue with the Islamic Salvation Front  [FIS].    The U.S. revealed in a press conference held in Paris  yesterday that there were contacts between the U.S. Government  and a number of FIS elements who are described as terrorists in  Algeria.    This is not the first time that such statements have been  issued by U.S. officials on the internal situation in Algeria in  an attempt to dictate specific policies to this Arab country.</p>

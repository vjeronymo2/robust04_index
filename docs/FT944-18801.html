			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead MONDAY: First-half pre-tax profits from Bilton, the property investment, construction and house-building group, are expected to come in at around Pounds 9m, broadly the the same as last year. TUESDAY: Ibstock, the building materials group, is expected to report a return to the black for the first half of its year. Profits between Pounds 2m and Pounds 2.75m are forecast. This result will compare with losses of Pounds 17.1m at the interim stage last time. The dividend is forecast to be maintained at 0.5p. TUESDAY: Final results from Raine, the construction group, are likely to produce pre-tax profits in a range between Pounds 13m and Pounds 13.5m, compared with Pounds 10.8 last year. A maintained dividend of 3p is forecast. WEDNESDAY: Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman of Hewden Stuart, can be relied on to give an insight into the state of the construction industry when he reports the group's interim results. The Glasgow-based company is the UK's biggest independent plant hire group and is involved in every sector, from housebuilding to roads and industrial projects. Analysts expect a sharp increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31, from Pounds 9.1m to about Pounds 13.5m. Interest will focus on the trading outlook and what returns have been made from the Hireplant assets of BET - 24,000 items of plant and 29 freehold properties which Hewden Stuart snapped up for a mere Pounds 11m last year. WEDNESDAY: The stock market expects Bank of Scotland to show a strong rise in pre-tax profits when it reports its interim results. Analysts' forecasts are clustered closely around the Pounds 200m mark, up from Pounds 117.6m a year earlier. Earnings per share are expected to be about 10p. The market reckons on an interim dividend of 2.1p, up from 1.87p a year ago but still giving one of the lowest dividend yields in the banking sector. THURSDAY: Etam, the fashion retailer, is expected to deliver an increase of more than 50 per cent in profits to Pounds 3.7m for the first half of its year. The company's strategy of defending margins in the face of heavy discounting by rival fashion retailers is thought to be paying off. Shares in the group, which is weighted heavily towards the second half, have risen from the year's low of 217p in April to well over 300p.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Capital Industries makes Pounds 1.2m Capital Industries, the financial services and industrial group which came to the market in July, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m for 1991. When the group was part of Rutland Trust, the financial services and property surveyor which retains a 37.4 per cent stake, it did not publish separate accounts, making profit comparisons meaningless. Most of the profit was generated from Capital Ventures, the financial services division, which Mr Peter Underhill, chief executive, described as a 'cash cow' which he expects to generate annual profits of Pounds 1m. Since the year-end, borrowings of Pounds 900,000 have been eliminated. Net assets per share are 46.2p, with basic earnings per share of 9.2p and 10.9p fully diluted. The final dividend is 2p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed BELAPAN report: "On Some Results of a Poll"] </F>   [Text] A group of sociologists, headed by Academician  Babosaw, included a question on presidential elections in a poll  that was conducted among the workers of 15 largest industrial  enterprises of Belarus. Some 53 percent assured that they will  participate in the elections. Around 28 percent considered that  the elections of a president authorized with wide powers will  have no impact on the improvement of the economic situation in  Belarus. Over 10 percent of the industrial workers stated  categorically that they will not participate in presidential  elections. Only 12 percent of the respondents pin their hopes  for improvement of living standards on the presidential  elections.</p>

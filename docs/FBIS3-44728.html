Since its establishment as a province more than five years  ago, Hainan, once a remote and backward region, has gained  momentum for a sound economic development and improvement of its  economic structure.    The total industrial output of the province in 1993 reached  9.3 billion yuan-worth, with a growth of about 28.9 percent over  the previous year. The agricultural output value was 8.4  billion, an increase of 6.2 percent.    Industrial enterprises around the whole province flourished  last year. The automobile and motorcycle industries recorded  production increases of 446.7 percent and 460.5 percent,  respectively.    Remarkable growth was also achieved in the beverage, pig  iron  and cement industries.    Last year the provincial government earmarked 1.5 billion  yuan for major industrial construction projects in order to lay  a firm foundation for further development.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Student loan 'success' hailed Mr Tim Boswell, the higher-education minister, said yesterday that government loans were a success with students after figures showed that more than 1m loans had been taken out. Students, lecturers and university vice-chancellors attacked his assessment, saying that the loans scheme had led to increased levels of poverty. The proportion of students taking a loan rose to 40 per cent in 1992-93. Among these, 5 per cent of their income came from paid work compared with 6 per cent for those who did not apply for a loan. The average value of loans taken out increased from Pounds 388 in 1990-91 to Pounds 656 in 1992-93. During the next three years grants will be cut 10 per cent each year, and loans will be increased to compensate. Mr Boswell said: 'Student loans are now an accepted part of the higher-education landscape. It is clear that the student loans scheme is a success.' Mr David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, said: 'If you are starved for a week you will do anything for food. If these are the current indices of success then we are in deep trouble.' The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said the loans scheme would have been much more popular if the government had decided to use a flexible system of repayments, possibly linked to the tax system, rather than a mortgage-style loan scheme with fixed repayments. It suggested that students, who were young and afraid of debt, were instead being forced to take on part-time employment during term-time. Lord Russell, a history professor at King's College, London, last month raised fears that student poverty had affected academic standards when he told the House of Lords that paid jobs had done 'a great deal of harm' to the quality of higher education. He said at least a quarter of his students were working in paid employment for more than 12 hours each week. The National Union of Students said that last year's default figures from the Student Loans Company, which gained county court judgments against 636 graduates, were 'just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg' because at that stage graduates could only have borrowed for one year. Students graduating later this year may have taken three loans, and could face much higher levels of debt, the union added. The NUS also attacked the administration of the company. Debts can be deferred if students are unemployed, but the company will not grant deferment unless the graduate can produce a P60 form. The NUS said this was difficult to obtain in the middle of the financial year.</p>

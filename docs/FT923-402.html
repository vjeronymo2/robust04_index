			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Russian oil fields out for tender THE Russian government is putting out for tender oil and gas fields off the far eastern island of Sakhalin, according to the Itar-Tass official news agency. The announcement appears to mean that at least some of the remaining eight fields off the island are to be offered for tenders for feasibility studies, following the award in March of a feasibility study for two of the fields to a Japanese-American consortium composed of Mitsui, Marathon Oil and McDermott. The political infighting surrounding the award of the contracts has been intense, with the local administration and Moscow disagreeing on the companies to be awarded the contract, and the powerful Russian oil lobby pressing the government not to award tenders to foreign companies. To counter this latter pressure, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, has specified in the order he signed on Friday authorising the tender process that foreign companies 'would be required to make maximum use of Russian labour and resources'. The order also asks the relevant Russian ministries to specify the areas open to tender within the next two weeks - which suggests that the political struggle may still be going on as to how much to allocate to foreign investment. Mr Gaidar has also asked the ministries to set up a commission to regulate the tender process. Russian oil production is now in a crisis, with production falling rapidly because of lack of investment and as yet only limited foreign involvement in the fields.</p>

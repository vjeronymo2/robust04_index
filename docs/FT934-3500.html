			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Rare equity-linked warrant offering from Dresdner Bank Dresdner Bank raised DM475m through a five-year issue of equity-linked warrant Eurobonds yesterday, a form of financing which has become virtually extinct in Germany due to shareholder opposition to waiving pre-emptive rights. Only two such issues have been launched this year, by companies which still had authorisation from their shareholders to raise equity-linked financing without offering pre-emptive rights. In March, Allianz, the insurance group, raised DM950m through a five-year issue of equity-linked warrant Eurobonds while Veba, the utility, raised Dollars 300m through a seven-year Eurobond issue with equity warrants. An official at Dresdner Bank said the bank had been keen to launch the deal before its authorisation from shareholders expired in the spring. In recent years, German companies have been discouraged from seeking further authorisations at annual meetings because of shareholder opposition. Bankers said that in the future, raising equity-linked financing would be a far more complicated process because the bonds would have to be offered to shareholders first. The rarity value of these issues contributed to the success of Dresdner's offering. The bonds, which were priced at 115, traded at 116.70 bid late in the afternoon. The warrants were quoted at 18.50, compared with their theoretical value of 17.40, thereby increasing the conversion premium to 18 per cent from 16 per cent at the launch. Elsewhere, the Province of New Brunswick made its annual outing to the Eurobond market when it raised CDollars 200m through an issue of 20-year Eurobonds, the first offering with this maturity in the Canadian dollar sector. The borrower last tapped the Eurobond market in March 1992. Lead manager Wood Gundy is donating the commissions and trading profits from this deal to Children in Crisis, a charity currently concentrating its aid efforts on children in the former Yugoslavia. Around CDollars 150,000 was raised yesterday but Wood Gundy hopes to raise a total of CDollars 2m. The bonds were priced to yield 100 basis points over 10-year Canadian Treasuries but were not freed to trade late yesterday. Syndicate managers expect the Republic of Argentina to launch its first issue of global bonds today. The 10-year offering, via Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers, is likely to raise Dollars 750m, up from an original amount of Dollars 500m. The bonds are likely to be priced to yield around 280 basis points over US Treasuries. There were also rumours that a Scandinavian sovereign borrower was interested in taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities which are currently available in the 10-year area of the Euro-yen sector.</p>

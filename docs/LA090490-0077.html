			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> FIRE STATION WORK PLANS MOVE AHEAD  </P> <P> Plans to renovate two fire stations will move forward this month after a  postponement due to the February oil spill and a bureaucratic snag, Fire Chief  Raymond C. Picard said.  </P> <P> Expansions of the Bushard Street and Gothard Street stations will mark the  city's first efforts to accommodate its burgeoning firefighting staff since the  construction of the city's seventh station in 1978, Picard said.  </P> <P> The expansions will cost $193,000.  </P> <P> At the Gothard Street station, south of Talbert Avenue, a battalion chief's  office will be added, along with additional garage space for a yet-to-be  purchased ladder truck.  </P> <P> If enough money is left over after the Gothard station renovation, the city  will expand the sleeping and bathroom quarters at the 25-year-old Bushard  Street station near Yorktown Avenue.  </P> <P> The renovations, which had been in the works for years, were delayed further  following the Feb. 7 offshore oil spill. Money that had been earmarked for the  station expansions was redirected for the Fire Department's emergency-response  and cleanup effort, Picard said. The city has since recovered a portion of the  money it spent in the wake of the disaster from British Petroleum, owner of the  spilled oil.  </P> <P> Picard says he has a lengthy menu of renovations that have been indefinitely  shelved due to lack of funding.  </P> <P> Topping the list, he said, is the long-delayed Heil Avenue station relocation.  </P></p>

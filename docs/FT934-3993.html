			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Petrochemicals criteria listed The conditions required for Europe's troubled petrochemicals industry to restructure were set out yesterday by Mr Carol van Miert, European competition commissioner. The Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe (APPE) is due to meet on December 17 to discuss possible rationalisation of Europe's production of ethylene, the basic building block of plastics. Mr van Miert said facts rather than arguments would be the key to the Commission's assessment. Writing in European Chemical News, he listed five criteria that needed to be met before the Commission would approve the plan. The participating companies would have to convince the Commission that: the situation facing the industry was not merely a dip in the business cycle, but rather a true structural crisis. there was no reasonable hope for recovery as long as outmoded structures had not been adapted to prevailing new requirements of the business. the crisis affected the entire sector and the proposed solution involved all players. This would avoid allowing some to secure competitive advantage to the detriment of others. the scheme would not have the effect of putting off required rationalisation; and the crisis was not being used by less competitive companies to avoid doing something about their own inefficiency. Mr van Miert also warned: 'I should be very glad to believe the era of major (anti-competitive) arrangements is now over; but if that is not the case, the Commission will not hesitate to take appropriate action.' The APPE is proposing to set up an industry fund worth about DM550m to help close capacity.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Caterpillar does better than expected CATERPILLAR, the world's biggest construction equipment maker, yesterday unveiled better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, thanks to growth in new business, record revenues and an improving economy. In the three months to June 30, it earned Dollars 67m, or 66 cents a share. A year earlier, the US recession and a bitter employee strike pushed the company into the red with a loss of Dollars 64m, or 63 cents. Sales and revenues rose 12 per cent to Dollars 2.91bn in the latest quarter from Dollars 2.6bn, largely due to a 24 per cent rise in US sales, to Dollars 1.44bn. Outside the US, sales edged 1 per cent higher to Dollars 1.37bn from Dollars 1.35bn. Physical sales volume of machinery and engines rose 7 per cent. Higher prices helped lift sales by 12 per cent, to Dollars 2.81bn, while pre-tax profits climbed to Dollars 74m, against a loss of Dollars 100m a year earlier. The company said its overall earnings projections for the rest of the year had not changed significantly. However it warned the outlook for Europe continued to deteriorate in the second quarter. Caterpillar hopes higher US sales will offset the shortfall. Caterpillar's labour conditions remain uncertain. Although the United Auto Workers' strike ended last April, the company has not resumed negotiations with the union and a new contract has yet to be signed. The company said its results would depend on the strength of the recovery in the US, the severity of recession in Europe, and economic and political conditions in Brazil, where the company has large operations. Caterpillar's first-half profits were Dollars 101m, or Dollars 1, against a restated loss of Dollars 221m a year earlier. Sales and revenues rose 17 per cent to Dollars 5.6bn.</p>

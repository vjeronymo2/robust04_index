			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WOMEN AND HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> SUBSTITUTE FOR ACTION MOVIES  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Dutka's article on the shameful status of female stars is too  true.  </P> <P> For starters, I would give Rachel Ward a swift kick to the head in the hope  that it might knock some sense into her. I would love to be the "fly on the  wall" when she steps up to Sylvester Stallone and tells him he doesn't need  $11-million-plus per picture.  </P> <P> I propose women boycott films by Stallone, etc., especially non-actors Eddie  Murphy and Arnold Schwarzenegger. If your under-25 boyfriend tries to talk you  into seeing a male "action" film, drag him into bed instead.  </P> <P> BURTON REES, Las Vegas  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> SYMPOSIUM TARGETS VIOLENCE BY GANGS  </P> <P> The groundwork for a citywide task force to combat gang violence by providing  incentives for teen-agers to stay out of gangs was established at a symposium  sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce on Friday.  </P> <P> A wide spectrum of about 20 community members, including youth counselors,  former gang members, school district representatives, local residents and the  police, met to discuss their concerns about the increasing amount of gang  activity and possible solutions.  </P> <P> "When kids are bored, with nothing to do, they conjure up something exciting,"  said Phil Aguilar, a former gang member and current pastor of Set Free  Christian Fellowship.  </P> <P> The group discussed the changing scope of gang activity in the city. It has  expanded from a few specific areas in the past to its now widespread  involvement in a number of neighborhoods. Police Department reports presented  at the meeting estimated a 50% increase in gang involvement from 1988 to 1989.  </P> <P> Virtually all members of the group said that offering young people alternatives  to gang activity was the best way to prevent gang involvement. Most also agreed  to meetings between the youths and former imprisoned gangsters who have now  shunned gang life style.  </P> <P> "They tell me they're in a gang because that's all they know," said Veronica  Chavez, a counselor at Turning Point, about many of the youths with whom she  works. "It takes someone else to come in and teach them alternatives."  </P> <P> The group established an informal network with plans to convene again when  members are ready to put the ideas into concrete projects.

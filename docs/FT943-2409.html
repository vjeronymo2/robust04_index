			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / GrandMet acts to cut costs and sells US group for Dollars 510m Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, sold its US petfood business to Nestle yesterday for Dollars 510m (Pounds 323m) and launched a restructuring programme for its world drinks and European food businesses. The restructuring, which will carry a Pounds 280m charge, will involve the loss of up to 4,000 jobs, City analysts estimate. Lord Sheppard, chairman, said the moves would enable the group to concentrate on 'our winning brands and businesses. We remain confident about GrandMet's long-term approach and cash generation potential'. Shares in the group closed at 409p, down 3 1/2 p, after recovering from an earlier fall to 405p. Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said its purchase of Alpo Petfoods could make it market leader in the US canned dogfood market. Nestle is already believed to be among the top three in the US with its Mighty Dog and Come'N Get It brands which compete against brands produced by rival foods giants Mars, HJ Heinz and Quaker Oats. The deal is subject to approval by US antitrust regulators. According to a recent study of Nestle by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, the group had a 39 per cent share of the US canned catfood market and 10 per cent in the European Union. In canned dogfood, its share was 14 per cent in the US and 4 per cent in the EU. Mr George Bull, GrandMet's chief executive, said the group was selling Alpo because it was only the seventh biggest supplier in a highly competitive market. GrandMet's other north American brands occupied top slots in their sectors. GrandMet will report an exceptional profit of just over Pounds 200m on the sale in its 1994-95 accounts. The Pounds 280m restructuring charge will be taken as an exceptional operating cost in the results for the year to the end of this month, to be announced on December 1. About half the money will be spent at International Distillers and Vintners, the group's worldwide drinks business whose brands include J&amp;B Scotch whisky and Smirnoff vodka. The group plans plant closures and rationalisations. Of the remaining Pounds 140m, Pounds 55m will go towards similar measures in the European foods division. Last year the group took a charge of Pounds 175m for restructuring Pillsbury, the food manufacturer, and Pearle, the US eyewear chain, in north America. That restructuring involved the loss of 3,000 jobs, some of them part-time. The rationalisation measures enabled the group to lift by Pounds 50m its marketing and advertising outlay. The latest restructuring programme is expected to yield savings of Pounds 90m a year over the next two years.

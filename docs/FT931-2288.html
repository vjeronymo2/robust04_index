			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Week Ahead Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports half-year results on Thursday with analysts forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 295m and Pounds 325m against Pounds 244m a year earlier on sales of about Pounds 1bn. Retrovir, the HIV-treatment, is expected to generate between Pounds 120m and Pounds 140m, while estimates for sales of Zovirax, the herpes and chickenpox medicine, range from Pounds 345m to Pounds 385m. Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, announces its 1992 results on Tuesday. It released estimated results, showing an unaudited pre-tax profit of Pounds 147m, a 48.5 per cent increase on 1991, last month when it announced the Dollars 434m acquisition of Specialty Coatings international, the US coatings company. Full-year results on Tuesday from Invergordon Distillers, the independent Scotch whisky producer, are likely to reflect the increased pressure on margins in the bulk whisky market. After five years of strong growth, pre-tax profits are expected to be virtually flat at Pounds 32.4m against Pounds 32.2m in 1991.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Clarke firm against early ERM re-entry MR Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday dismissed the prospect of early British re-entry to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The British and German economies 'are so far out of line that the conditions are not remotely there for Britain to rejoin the ERM', Mr Clarke said. The chancellor's forthright remarks came during a day of negotiations in Brussels with other EC finance ministers. Making his first statements on policy since taking over from Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor, Mr Clarke also said that tackling the British budget deficit was 'one of the most important items on the agenda'. He voiced concern at the depth of the German recession and the effect on its European partners. Underlining the point, the EC commission delivered a grim warning to ministers that economic recovery in the EC as whole was unlikely before the second half of 1994. The commission forecast that the UK economy would outperform its main competitors, with growth of 1.7 per cent this year. Mr Clarke put up a roadblock against Community plans for two controversial taxes - the carbon energy tax and a tax on imports of works of art. Further negotiations are expected on both taxes.

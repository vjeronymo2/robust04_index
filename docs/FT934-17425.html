			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Switch to grammar school planned PLANS to convert a comprehensive school into a selective grammar school have been announced by the south London borough of Wandsworth, the Conservative 'flagship' authority. The boys-only Ernest Bevin School in Tooting is requesting the right to select 90 of its annual intake of 180 on academic criteria. For equal-opportunities reasons, Wandsworth is asking the neighbouring girls school, Burntwood, which has opted out of local-authority control, to consider making a similar number of places selective. If Burntwood does not agree, Wandsworth intends to open a new 540-place girls' grammar school. Mr Edward Lister, Wandsworth council leader, said yesterday: 'Grammar schools are at the top of every league table and I am delighted that Wandsworth is able to make this choice available to parents.' Mr Tony Belton, leader of the Labour group, vowed to oppose the proposals. This is the first attempt by a local education authority to introduce academic selection to comprehensive schools, although a number of schools which have opted out of local-authority control have applied to make the same change. Wandsworth has established a record for pioneering education policies, and the final decision on the plan will be made by Mr John Patten, education secretary, after the borough has consulted locally.</p>

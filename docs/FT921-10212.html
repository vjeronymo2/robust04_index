			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: BCP to seek Es50bn BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of Portugal's top three commercial banks, is planning to raise around Es50bn (Dollars 370m) on the international markets and domestically to build up its international position and shareholding base, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. The plan, which will be presented for approval at the bank's annual shareholders' meeting in March, envisages the launch of an international bond issue on the Euromarkets for up to Es30bn, part of which will be in convertible Ecus, and the launch of a separate issue of 7.5m American depositary receipts representing BCP shares, and specifically aimed at US investors. The third component of the plan involves a capital increase with incorporation of reserves and a rights issue. The bank's capital is to be increased by Es11bn through the incorporation of reserves, and by attributing one free bonus share for every six currently held by shareholders and through a 6.6m shares rights issue on the basis of one new share for every 10 held.</p>

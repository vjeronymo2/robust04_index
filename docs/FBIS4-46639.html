			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya under the </F> rubric "Aviator Training": "Learn From Others, but Do Not  Disregard Your Own"]    [Text] How can aviation be employed most effectively in  conjunction with the ground forces in defensive battles? This  question, very topical today, is arising more and more often for  the commanders of flight units and formations. The young armed  forces of our nation, after all, still do not have enough  experience of their own. What was accumulated during the times  of the former Soviet Union is not very useful--the army  structures have changed and the Military Doctrine is completely  different, as are views of the possible nature of combat  operations and the employment of armed formations in general. It  is thus necessary to gather, summarize and analyze, bit by bit,  everything that we are able to get during flights and training.  A whole series of measures have thus been carried out in the Air  Forces of Ukraine for this purpose--practical-science  conferences, seminars, operational-tactical training etc. The  corresponding work in this area is being carried out by the  lower echelons as well.    The 14th Air Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Viktor  Lyashenko, has conducted an operational-mobilization training  session of the command personnel of the larger units and  formations. It was held for five days at the Lviv training area.    Here is what Colonel Leonid Podnosov, acting chief of staff  of the army, had to say about this session: "First, we  studied--or rather, devised--new views on the utilization of  frontal and army aviation in defensive combat operations," he  said. "The participants in the session diligently studied the  experience of combat operations during armed conflicts in recent  years, and first and foremost the employment of aviation in  them. A considerable role, by the way, was assigned to it. The  combat operations in the Persian Gulf testify to that. The  combined armed forces of the NATO countries carried out a quite  prolonged bombing of the battle positions and military  facilities of Iraq before the ground forces entered into battle."    "Aviation was used quite recently on the part of some  Western  powers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in order to  halt the combat operations of the warring sides. Other examples  could also be cited.    "All of these were cases in which aviation was employed in  order to carry out preemptive strikes. We need primarily skills  in the utilization of air power in defensive combat operations,  since Ukraine has no intention of being the first to attack  anyone. We are thus trying to perceive the experience of the  cases cited above in a different way. We are selecting only what  we need. That was emphasized both in the lectures given by the  chiefs of directorates and services, and in the speeches of  participants in the session during the group seminar.    "However rich other peoples' experience may be, however,"  emphasized Colonel Podnosov, "you cannot get by without your own  as well. And we do have some of our own, even if it is not all  that rich. Tactical exercises were conducted recently, as is  well known, by a motorized-rifle regiment with live firing at  the Lviv training area. Aviation took an active part in it, with  the delivery of on-board weaponry. The leaders of our army  intentionally saw to it that more aircraft and helicopters were  allotted to this exercise than were stipulated by tactical  norms. This was done, first of all, so as to give as many of the  fliers as possible, from all branches of aviation, the  opportunity to gain some skills. They had one task--know the  capabilities of your aircraft during the performance of combat  operations, so as to defend the territory of our nation. And  they were able to do so."    Almost all of the unit commanders whose aviation subunits  were assigned to the exercises--the experienced pilots Colonels  Anatoliy Baranov, Oleksiy Kotov and Volodymyr Tsymbal, among  others--expressed their ideas during the session with regard to  new forms of combat employment of aircraft and helicopters. All  of this provided grounds to conclude that the assigned tasks  were achieved by the session. All participants gained a certain  amount of the experience that they need in their everyday combat  training.    It would be worthwhile to add to the story of Colonel Leonid  Podnosov that the assembly was conducted in quite interesting  and intensive fashion. The most diverse types of instruction  were employed in it. They included, aside from the lectures,  tactical drills and seminars during which each of the officers  was able to express his opinion or point of view, make a  suggestion or share his own experience. Staff gaming was also  conducted here, during which the operation of  command-and-control structures was practiced.    A number of demonstration classes, including on the troop  services, were also held for the participants in the assembly. A  visit was organized to a tank regiment of the Zaliznyy Division,  where the commanders of aviation units were shown how the  soldiers of that model military garrison live, serve, train and  relax.    It would also be worthwhile to point out that the assembly  did not require a great deal of material funding.</p>

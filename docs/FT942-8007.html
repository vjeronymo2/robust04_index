			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Architecture: London has its priorities wrong - Colin Amery says emphasis should be put on transport and housing Democracy has its dangers when it comes to development. We learned two weeks ago that the entire future of the London CrossRail project (a joint British Rail/London Transport plan for a tunnel from Paddington in the west to Liverpool Street in the east) was put in jeopardy, perhaps permanently, by MP's voting against it in an arcane committee. In this case Parliament has not represented the views of those who live and work in the capital. Michael Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources committee of the Corporation of London, wrote last week that the views of the City was not sought by the Commons' committee. The City sees CrossRail as a key component in plans for continued improvement of the area as a centre of European wealth generation. More evidence that both government is out of touch over the kind of planning, building and investment that the majority want to see in the capital came in a Gallup poll, commissioned by property consultants Richard Ellis. It disclosed that more than half the world's largest investors believe the government is not doing enough to support London as a financial centre. About 81 per cent of those interviewed felt 'the efficiency of London as a city has been impaired because of the UK government's unwillingness to invest public money in its transport system.' London is more than its transport system. It is its architecture and its town planning and its social ambience. Yet key decisions, taken in mysterious ways, decide major aspects of the city's future. As a guide to the significance of decisions as fundamental as CrossRail, it is worth looking backwards to see how important decisions have been made in the past. The post-war rebuilding in the city in the 1950s and 1960s was in a similar style to that in bomb damaged German cities - the glass and concrete style of the Bauhaus was the architectural victor of the war. It inflicted equal pain on both sides. The City of London had a second major wave of building in the 1980s with an office boom which bequeathed the curious post modern style - a kind of decorated Bauhaus with more marble and granite. Barclays Bank's recently completed head office probably represents its apotheosis. This wave had a partially hidden agenda. The City was bothered by the sudden growth of London Docklands and so in response gave developers almost free rein to build inside the City's boundaries. It was something of a panic reaction, which demonstrated the lack of much needed collaboration between the City and Docklands. London was already much too big and badly serviced. The Docklands development was largely unnecessary and largely happened because businesses going to the enterprise zone on the Isle of Dogs were tempted large tax breaks. Docklands is living proof that laissez-faire planning does little for a city. If a total London view had been taken of the area's role there was a strong argument for making it a large water and landscaped river park for the East End, surrounded by new houses to replace the tower blocks of Tower Hamlets. Controlled commercial and industrial development should have been balanced with residential, leisure and infrastructure uses. The devotion of planners, developers and the rating system to the zoning whole areas solely for offices, combined with a refusal to improve transport leads to a grim life in working London. Why is it so rare for people to live where they and others work, in the City or the West End? Why is it so hard to find in London the kind of cultural street life you find in New York or Paris? Why are architects so frustrated? Because they are being asked to design endless offices and very little public architecture or private housing. Once a city is agreeable and efficient to live in it will attract employment. London has for some time had its priorities wrong. Nobody needed the bankrupt Canary Wharf; no one needs the empty offices in the City; no one (except Peter Palumbo) needs the proposed offices at No. 1 Poultry. Many of us in London need better public transport and want better housing.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 9 April  1994 on page 8 reports that Edmundo Castillo has been expelled  from the National Conservative Party, PNC, for one year because  he does not follow the party line. The article explains that  Castillo, who is renowned for his oratory skills in the National  Assembly, has a reputation for being "very independent."  Castillo explained that he was expelled because he supported  constitutional reforms and because he criticized the party for  practicing nepotism and for only representing a single class of  society.</p>

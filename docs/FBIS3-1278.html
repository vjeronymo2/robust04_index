Gqozo on the line from his residence in Bisho to tell us the  reasons behind his decision, but unfortunately he can't be  reached by telephone. Meanwhile, however, the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] has appointed two joint administrators in  Ciskei. One of these administrators is South African Ambassador  Pieter Goosen, who joins us now on the line from Ciskei. Good  evening Mr. Goosen, and welcome to Newsline.    [Goosen] Good evening.    [Ascar] The obvious question to start off with: Do you think  the situation in Ciskei was such that it warranted the brigadier  stepping down?    [Goosen] Brig. Gqozo must have decided that the situation  warranted that request because this is not a takeover by the  South African Government or the Transitional Executive Council  of an existing administration. It is a request from Brig Gqozo  to the South African Government and the Transitional Executive  Council to place his administration with that of his own.  [sentence as heard]    [Ascar] What do you think would have happened had the  brigadier not stepped down?    [Goosen] It would be speculation. What we've had in Ciskei  was a protest by the Ciskeian civil servants on matters  affecting their conditions of service, primarily pension, but  also matters concerning their conditions of employment, which I  think is not only restricted to the Ciskeian civil servants but  could be described as of a universal interest to civil servants  throughout South Africa.    [Ascar] Will you, as the TEC-appointed administrator, be  able  to address these concerns of civil servants?    [Goosen] Well, we will certainly address them. Whether or  not we will be able to effectively solve them is another matter,  but we will certainly try to do exactly that. I am encouraged  by a meeting which was held this afternoon by the task force on  the public service, consisting of Minister Sam de Beer and  Philip Dexter, who were appointed by the TEC, who met  representatives of Ciskei today, and my impression is very  positive that there is a willingness on the side of the Ciskeian  civil servants to cooperate in rendering services to the  citizens and people of Ciskei.    [Ascar] Should the civil servants continue to strike, what  action would be taken, or do you think it will affect the  situation?    [Goosen] I'm not aware. We discussed....[pauses] We were  informed that there were certain groups of civil servants who  intended striking or had intended striking some time ago, and we  have obviously appealed to them to give the new administration a  chance to look into their grievances, and my distinct impression  there also is that they will do so.    [Ascar] Mr. Goosen, there have been reports that the  brigadier is indeed under house arrest. Are you able to clarify  that situation at all?    [Goosen] As far as I know, he is not under house arrest.  There is not, as far as I can gather, a feeling of kicking  anybody out or fighting with anybody. I think we all would like  to see a smooth transition, including dealing with the presence  of Brig. Gqozo.    [Ascar] It's said that about 5,000 Ciskeians gathered at a  stadium today and waited for Brig. Gqozo to address them. The  brigadier did not arrive. Do you know of any reason why he did  not arrive?    [Goosen] Well, the obvious reason would be that the  brigadier  as from yesterday has stepped down, and when the new  administration effectively took over as from this morning, he  must have felt that there was nothing really he could tell them  as he had relinquished all powers.    [Ascar] Did the new administration, as you refer to it,  address the 5,000 Ciskeians at the stadium?    [Goosen] Not the administration, because at that time we  were  not formally appointed, but members of the TEC did address the  civil servants.    [Ascar] Would you say that the members of the TEC have been  welcomed to Ciskei?    [Goosen] I think their presence and the visit here has been  a  great success.    [Ascar] And what lies ahead, what will the next step be?    [Goosen] The next step will be for me and my  coadministrator,  Reverend Finka, to get together in the morning with a member or  more of the TEC to formulate our plan of action. Certainly high  on the agenda would be to address these grievances from the  civil servants as they were put to us today.    [Ascar] Mr. Goosen, we are hoping to have an interview with  Rev. Finka on the line from Ciskei. We thank you for your  participation.    [Goosen] Thank you.</p>

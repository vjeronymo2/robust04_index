			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: German stores reveal link-up plans KARSTADT and Hertie, respectively the largest and third-largest department store groups in Germany, yesterday announced their intention to merge. In a brief statement, the Essen-based Karstadt said its supervisory board had reached agreement with the trusts which control the privately-owned Hertie to buy all parts of the smaller company's business. The deal, details of which will be revealed today by Hertie, has been widely expected in Germany for several days. It will create a group with turnover of DM28bn (Dollars 16.6m). With sales of DM7bn last year, Hertie is about one-third the size of Karstadt, which had sales of nearly DM21bn in 1992. The transaction is likely to value Hertie at DM1.5bn or more. The rationale will probably be the need to combine forces, given the depressed state of the department store market. The federal cartel office in Berlin has already hinted it will order the merged companies to sell stores in a number of cities including Berlin, where the two are well-represented. However, the deal as a whole seems unlikely to be blocked.</p>

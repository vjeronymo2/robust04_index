			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Last Days -- This is the final week for the Natural History Museum of Orange  County at its current site in a closed elementary school in Newport Beach. When  the doors close to the public on Friday, museum staff and volunteers will start  packing up for the move to a new interim site in Aliso Viejo.  </P> <P> "We're shooting for a mid-November reopening," said Dudley Varner, executive  director of the museum. The new location in the Kohl Corporate Center offers  almost 32,000 total square feet, with about 14,000 to be set aside for  exhibits. Plans for future exhibits include a robotic dinosaur display from  Orange County-based Dinamation and an exhibit of space equipment mock-ups.  </P> <P> The new building "is basically a shell," Varner said. That means some  construction will be needed before opening, but also that the facility can be  molded to meet the museum's needs.  </P> <P> Announcement of the new interim site comes after a lengthy search that  originally focused on the area around John Wayne Airport. The Aliso Viejo  location is within a mile of the museum's planned permanent location, a 25-acre  site in the new Aliso-Woods Canyon Regional Park. The museum's permanent home  is probably at least five years away from construction.  </P> <P> The museum may begin some outdoor programs in Aliso-Woods Canyon as soon as the  interim site is open, concentrating on the ecology of Aliso Creek and on the  Pectin Reef fossil area. All that is needed is a parking area for school buses.  </P> <P> Varner said the museum hopes to open satellite sites in other areas of the  county and may maintain a small presence in the present Newport Beach location  -- at least until the county opens a planned nature center in the new Upper  Newport Bay Regional Park. Previously scheduled summer programs will continue.  </P> <P> But meanwhile, the main emphasis will be on getting the new interim site open.  "We're hitting the ground running, so to speak," Varner said.  </P></p>

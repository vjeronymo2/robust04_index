The Ecological Aspect"]    [Text] Yuriy Kostenko, minister of environmental  protection of Ukraine, answers questions put by a NARODNA ARMIYA  correspondent.    We will introduce our interlocutor.    He was born in 1951 in the Vinnitsa area. He graduated  from the Zaporozhye Institute of Machine Building, worked at the  imeni E.O. Paton Institute of Electrical Welding, and also  completed graduate study there. He defended his Candidate of  Sciences dissertation in the area of plasma technologies.  Kostenko has more than 30 certificates of authorship and  scientific publications.    He has been people's deputy of Ukraine since 1990.  Kostenko has been elected deputy chairman of the parliamentary  commission for issues of ecology and the rational use of natural  resources.    Kostenko has been the minister of environmental  protection of Ukraine since October 1992. He is a member of the  National Security Council of Ukraine.  <H3>  `The Scope of the Ecological Threat May Be Greater Than That  of Any Aggression....' </H3>   NARODNA ARMIYA: Yuriy Ivanovych, recently the  Supreme Council of Ukraine discussed a package of the national  security issues of our young state. To your mind, how  significant has the ecological aspect of the system of national  security guarantees become?    Kostenko: The economic development of society has  reached such heights toward the end of the 20th century that the  threat of losing a favorable environment for the residence of  people has become a reality. Our own bitter experience can be a  case in point. The degree of unfavorable influence on the  natural environment in many regions of Ukraine has now surpassed  the consequences of the most devastating military aggression.    At present, nobody can say with certainty whether at some  point children will be able to take walks in the city of  Pripyat, whether it will be possible to drink water from the  Dnieper without worrying, to swim safely at the sunny beaches of  Mariupol, Odessa, and Yalta, or eat mushrooms from the forests  in the area of Lugansk without risking one's life.    Under existing conditions, the ecological aspect of the  system of national security of our state should be virtually the  main one. However, we should state that in Ukraine, all levels  of society lack the understanding that ecological threats in  terms of their scope and the extent of unfavorable influences  may surpass the consequences of any aggression.  <H3>  `A Perpetual-Motion Machine for Processing Natural Resources  Into Waste' </H3>   NARODNA ARMIYA: What caused, to the greatest  degree, and continues to cause the dangerous condition of the  environment in Ukraine?    Kostenko: Within the system of national security  of the state, ecological threats are due to both domestic and  external reasons. That is to say that they are regional or  global in nature. Our conviction is that, all the weight of the  external aspects of ecological security notwithstanding, the  critical condition of the natural environment that has emerged  in Ukraine is due mostly to domestic reasons.    The nonecological development of industry, the power sector,  and transportation; erroneous land-use practices; large-scale  land reclamation efforts; infective activities aimed at  preserving natural landscapes and their components--forests,  lakes, rivers, steppes, and so on--are among the main reasons.    Ukraine's industry is one of the most dangerous in the world  from the ecological point of view. Think about this: In the late  1980's, two times more iron ore than in the United States was  produced in Ukraine, and only somewhat less coal than in Great  Britain, France, and the FRG combined. As much steel was smelted  annually as in the FRG and France combined. Ukraine's industry  manufactured 7 million tonnes of pipes, which exceeded the  combined output of Great Britain, Italy, and France.    What did we get in return? Did our standard of living rise  to  the level of the countries mentioned? Has a single social  problem been solved in the Donbass or the Dnieper area? We may  say "no" with confidence. Instead, we have had a rapid depletion  of natural resources, man-made mountains of rock, poisoned air,  and dead rivers.    A similar situation has developed in power generation. The  proportion of the discharge of harmful compounds into the  atmosphere of Ukraine by power generation comes to 30 percent of  the total discharge. Coal dressing produces 35 million tonnes of  barren rock annually. The reservoirs of hydropower stations  occupy almost 800,000 hectares of fertile land; approximately  the same area is underflooded.    As far as nuclear energy is concerned, the great probability  of accidents with grave consequences forces us to classify  nuclear power stations as the greatest ecological threat. The  Chernobyl catastrophe alone has exhausted, for hundreds of years  to come, the ecological reserve of all accidents of  technological origin in Ukraine. Besides, the further operation  of nuclear-energy facilities will be unavoidably accompanied by  the accumulation of a large amount of radioactive waste. They do  not just pollute the environment, but also pose the threat of  irreversible changes both to the population of Ukraine and to  all living organisms.    In addition to dangerous waste, the Ukrainian economy is one  of the largest consumers of natural resources in the world.  Land, minerals, water, air, and energy resources are devoured by  enterprises in ever greater amounts. It is characteristic that,  for example, we continuously have a shortage of  electricity--even now that the overall level of production has  declined by 30-40 percent--although our power generation per  capita is at the level of the developed countries of Europe. Yet  this is not surprising if we take into account the fact that the  energy intensiveness of our production exceeds that of similar  indicators in countries such as the United States, Germany, or  Great Britain by factors ranging from six to eight.    Thus, the national economy of Ukraine even now functions  mostly in keeping with the principle, "Production for  production's sake." This is why instead of an economy that would  primarily meet the needs of the people, we have something of a  perpetual-motion machine for processing natural resources into  waste. Without breaking this vicious cycle, a solution to the  ecological problems of Ukraine, and consequently guarantees of  its national security, are out of the question.    NARODNA ARMIYA: What is the ecological status of  the agro-industrial complex?    Kostenko: Not the best. The share of plowed land  in the territory of Ukraine has reached 57 percent (in the  United States, it is 17 percent). One-third of these areas have  been depleted and are subjected to intensive erosion. If we do  not reduce the percentage of plowed land by way of both  environmental protection measures and changes in the tax system,  Ukraine may be left without its famous Chernozem soils.    Unjustified and incompetent land reclamation has caused a  great deal of trouble! I will give you only a few numbers, which  are based on data from scientific establishments. During the  years of land reclamation, the area of drained land in Polesye  has doubled, and the danger of deflation and soil erosion has  increased by a factor of 27. In the southern regions, changes in  irrigation technology are needed on 18 percent of the irrigated  land. As little as just over one-third of the irrigated land  remains in good condition there.    The intake of water to meet economic needs has been growing  continuously. The runoff of many rivers is taken in full in  years with low, and even average, water availability. The  inclusion of small rivers into land reclamation systems and the  thoughtless draining of marshlands have resulted in disruptions  of their hydrological regimen; the quality of natural water and  its self-purification capacity have deteriorated.    The current condition of our forests is critical. They  occupy  one-half of the area that they do in adjacent states--Poland,  Slovakia, and Belarus. Only 6 percent of our forests are mature,  whereas 15-20 percent should be.  <H3>  `We Will Not Accomplish Anything in the Absence of a Strong  Policy of Environmental Protection' </H3>   NARODNA ARMIYA: Yuriy Ivanovych, what major  shortcomings do you see in the organization of efforts to  protect the environment in our country? What should be done  specifically in the context of guaranteeing our national  security?    Kostenko: First of all, it should be grasped at  all levels of state government that improvements in the natural  environment are impossible in the absence of a clear-cut  program, continuous attention and, certainly, considerable  material and financial outlays.    What do we have at present? Our own state budget is the most  instructive in this regard. It allocates only 0.2 percent of the  gross national product (GNP) for all environmental protection  measures in 1993. For comparison, Scandinavian countries spend  close to 1 percent of their GNP just to help other states. The  fact that economic losses reach one-tenth of the entire gross  national product in Ukraine as a result of deterioration in the  quality of the environment testifies to our short-sightedness.    Moreover, the Ministry of Natural Resources, which in  keeping  with legislation in effect is supposed to ensure compliance with  the norms of ecological safety in Ukraine, controls as little as  one-tenth of these funds, of these purely symbolic budget  outlays for the protection of natural resources, or 0.02 percent  of the GNP. This does not happen in any other country in the  world! Our ministry has an extremely broad scope of  responsibilities, but the main levers of influence, financial  levers, are virtually absent. Therefore, degradation of the  environment with all of its terrible consequences will not be  stopped without fundamental changes in the system of  guaranteeing ecological safety, and without a strong  environmental-protection policy for the state.    NARODNA ARMIYA: Nonetheless, what has already been  specifically done by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in  order to stop, or at least, to begin with, slow down the slide  of Ukraine into the ecological abyss?    Kostenko: Fundamental principles for this work  have been developed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection  of Ukraine with the participation of a broad circle of  scientists and specialists from the national economy in the  concept of the National Program for Protecting the Natural  Environment, which we plan to submit for consideration to the  Supreme Council of Ukraine in November-December of this year.    The experience of developed countries testifies that for the  most part, two levers exist that stimulate ecologically friendly  production and energy savings. These are the use of natural  resources at a fee and the active implementation of  environmental protection measures.    Proceeding from this, the ministry wants to devise a  mechanism for assessing the cost of natural resources and fees  for their use, to introduce tax relief for resource-effective  and ecologically pure technologies, and to impose economic  sanctions for the above-the-norm use of natural resources and  pollution of the environment, so that it will become  economically disadvantageous for enterprises to operate to the  detriment of nature.    It is precisely to this end that a special section,  "Ecological-Economic Policy," was included in our proposal for  the plan of actions of the Government of Ukraine to implement  and develop the Foundations of the National Economic Policy in  1993. A government decree issued in September introduced norms  for the size of ecological losses associated with environmental  pollution and the use of resources. Proposals have been prepared  concerning the establishment of a fixed proportion of state  budget expenditures for environmental protection measures and  mechanisms for their implementation. The Source ecological bank  has been established.    Let us not forget that there are types of environmental  protection projects that do not require considerable funds, in  particular appropriations from the state budget, and are found  within the jurisdiction of the local organs of power. The issue  is that the plowing of the bank zones of small rivers should  finally stop; straightening their courses and siting cattle  farms and complexes and fertilizer and pesticide warehouses in  their water-protection zones should be forbidden, and efforts to  develop meadows on the banks of small rivers should be made. In  this instance, a favorable environmental protection effect may  be secured as soon as within a few years. It was precisely to  invigorate such efforts that the Green Spring campaign was held  in Ukraine on the initiative of the Ministry of Environmental  Protection.  <H3>  `If We Do Not Put Up a Barrier to the Illegal Imports of  Toxic Substances From Abroad, Ukraine Will Turn Into a European  Trash Dump Rather Than a European State' </H3>   NARODNA ARMIYA: You said that the issues of  ecological security have an international aspect, as well....    Kostenko: Yes, and a quite weighty one, too.  External ecological threats may be either intentional, i.e.,  ecological aggression, or unintentional in nature--most  frequently, these are global changes in the environment and  crossborder pollution.    We want to mitigate the unfavorable influence of global  ecological changes primarily by making and executing  international agreements that regulate the planetary stress of  technical origin and by developing national measures for the  adaptation of the national economy of the country to these  changes.    Ukraine has already joined most conventions regulating  global  ecological security. Nonetheless, it should be said openly that  we are still not ready to implement some of them. Thus, Ukraine  still does not have a national program to carry out the Montreal  Protocol on the Ozone Layer. Meanwhile, its conditions call for  abandoning the use of substances that destroy this layer by 1999.    Ukraine still has not ratified a number of important  international agreements. The Ministry of Environmental  Protection proposes to ratify them shortly. At issue are, in  particular, the convention on climatic changes, which restricts  the discharge of gases producing the greenhouse effect, the  biodiversity convention, the Ramsar convention on the protection  of wetlands on our planet, and the convention on international  trade in the species of wild fauna and flora that are threatened  with extinction.    As far as measures to adapt the economy of Ukraine to global  ecological changes are concerned, their development is  envisioned by the aforementioned concept of the National Program  for Protecting the Natural Environment.    NARODNA ARMIYA: In the last two years, the  uncontrolled importation of various types of waste to the  territory of Ukraine has become particularly notorious.    Kostenko: Indeed, this ecologically dangerous dirt  is brought in under the guise of a raw material, products of the  chemical industry, fertilizer, and so on. Importation of  dangerous substances to seven oblasts of Ukraine was registered  in the first half of this year alone. Some 700 tonnes of these  substances fall into the highest class of toxicity--they are  poison to anything that lives.    However, it is perhaps the most terrifying thing that what  has been registered constitutes, so to say, the tip of an  iceberg, merely a fraction of what is brought in and illegally  dumped by the roads, in the forests, in the fields, and in  ravines. This is the consequence of an absence in our country of  an effective system for the regulation and monitoring of the  importation of waste. If we do not put up an effective barrier  to the illegal imports of toxic substances from abroad, very  soon Ukraine will turn into a European trash dump rather than  the European state that all of us wish for.    For this reason, the Ministry of Environmental Protection  has  developed Temporary Procedures for the Issuance of Permits to  Import to Ukraine Recyclable Raw Materials and the Waste That  Replaces Them, which, in particular, prohibits the importation  of waste to Ukraine for the purpose of storing and burying it.  Appropriate instructions have been given to the local  subdivisions of the ministry. A proposal has been submitted to  the government to establish an ecological control service at the  border.  <H3>  `The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Environmental  Protection Carry a Weighty Proportion of Responsibility for the  National Security of Ukraine. We Should Work Hand in Hand....' </H3>   NARODNA ARMIYA: There is no concealing the fact  that units of the Army and the Navy have contributed  considerably to the processes of deterioration if not the direct  destruction of the environment....    Kostenko: Yes, until recently, the activities of  the military involving the use of natural resources fell beyond  the limits of the jurisdiction of our ministry. The actual  absence of control did not result in anything good. The examples  of it are without number.    Favorable changes in relations between the Ministry of  Defense and the Ministry of Environmental Protection have  emerged only over the last 1-1.5 years, after the adoption of  the new legislation on environmental protection. Efforts have  been made to establish special ecological subdivisions of the  Ministry of Defense, ecological inspections have begun to  operate jointly. It is gratifying that the recently introduced  provisional Internal Service Manual includes a specific  provision that binds all commanders to work out and implement  environmental protection measures.    Thus, the first specific results have been attained at the  level of ministries, which is not the case directly with most  units and garrisons.    The Ministry of Environmental Protection is aware of the  facts of violations of environmental protection legislation,  especially at the Yavor training grounds in Lvov Oblast, which  occupy 20,000 hectares. Meanwhile, these training grounds are  located in a unique natural zone of the Ukrainian Roztochchya,  where the main European watershed passes and runoff to the  basins of the Black and Baltic Seas is generated. Considerable  harm is done to valuable natural complexes at the "Free Port"  training grounds of the Black Sea Fleet aviation, which is  located in the center of the Black Sea Biospheric Preserve. In  general, it is hard to find a military unit or garrison that is  not violating legislation on environmental protection in one way  or another.    In general, both our ministries carry their proportion of  responsibility for the national security of Ukraine. Therefore,  we should work hand in hand.    Efforts to create a system of national security for Ukraine  are under way. The ecological aspect of this problem that is the  most significant for our young state should be properly codified  by legislation. Only by taking an extensive set of ecological  security measures will Ukraine be able to overcome the critical  condition of the environment and become one of the economically  developed and prosperous countries of Europe.</p>

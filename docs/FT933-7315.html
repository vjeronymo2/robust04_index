			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Moscow to break Lithuania pact THE Russian government yesterday told Lithuania it would break an agreement to withdraw former Soviet troops from the Baltic republic by the end of the month. Lithuania, which has granted citizenship and the right to vote to most Russians living on its territory, would have become the first former Soviet republic to be free of Russian military forces. A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry claimed the Lithuanians had obstructed the deal, without giving details. It also warned of retaliation against Lithuania for any 'provocations' against Russian servicemen. The quarrel stems from Lithuanian demands for Dollars 143bn (Pounds 96bn) to cover damages for 50 years of Soviet rule - unrecoverable financially but, for the Lithuanians, an important admission of occupation by Russia. Russia refuses to be held responsible, financially or historically, for the Soviet era. But the arbitrary and harsh tone of the statement suggested the usually liberal Russian Foreign Ministry was trying to pander to more conservative sentiments inside Russia.</p>

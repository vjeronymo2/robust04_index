			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party committee recently decided to  entrust the provincial discipline inspection commission with the  task of forming and deploying to some 10 prefectures and cities,  as well as some 30 key provincial departments and bureaus, a  total of 12 inspection groups comprising nearly 100 cadres from  the provincial people's congress, Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference committee, as well as the leading group  in charge of building party style and clean government.    The 12 inspection groups will mainly inspect the province's  anticorruption work since the start of this year. The  provincial party committee has decided that the 12 inspection  groups should try to focus on the following developments: 1)  Whether or not the party and government cadres at county or  provincial department section level have met all five  self-examination and self-rectification requirements; 2) Whether  or not all exposed corruption cases have been thoroughly  investigated and handled; 3) Whether or not various malpractices  have been straightened out; and 4) Whether or not the  province-wide anticorruption struggle has attained the desired  results.    The provincial party committee stressed: The upcoming  province-wide anticorruption check-up is an important measure in  deepening and prolonging the province's on-going anticorruption  struggle, summing up the province's achievements and progress in  the anticorruption struggle since 1993, popularizing the  province's successful anticorruption experiences, investigating  and tackling each and every existing problem in this connection,  strictly implementing this year's three anticorruption tasks,  and striving for more tangible achievements in the  anticorruption struggle before the end of this year.</p>

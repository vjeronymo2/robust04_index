			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rosita Regalado] </F>   [Text] Antonio Rios was ready to modernize upon returning  to his job as CTV [Venezuelan Workers Confederation] president.  He was prepared to take part in a great debate with business  aimed at solving the problem of retroactive entitlements. This  is the foundation for the national consensus urged by  President-elect Rafael Caldera. In exchange, Rios promises the  country an end to labor and social strife.    Yesterday morning the executive committee room at CTV  headquarters was the scene of an emotional event. Angel Zerpa  Mirabal, the confederation's acting president, handed over his  post to Antonio Rios, the man who served 14 months in jail on an  influence peddling conviction. Upon his arrival, Rio got a warm  reception from fellow committee members and others close to the  Venezuelan labor movement. The one exception was Carlos  Magdaleno, the executive committee's foremost member. Holding a  copy of the body's statutes, he insisted that Rios could not  assume its presidency. As a sign of protest, Magdaleno walked  out of the press conference given by Rios.    The labor leader reiterated what he said to his labor  colleagues minutes earlier. He repeated his belief that he was  the victim of a national and international conspiracy to weaken  the CTV. He denied that the attack could have been aimed at him  personally because he had committed no offense.    "Since the case remains open and my prosecutors, rather than  act on good faith, have conducted themselves as accusers, I will  continue to demonstrate that I have committed no offense. There  are many facts that deserve prompt prosecutorial attention. They  include the disclosures of Dr. Esperanza Martino concerning the  three financial groups that embezzled over a billion bolivars  without a single arrest.    "Today," Rios said, "I assume my duties, not with any sense  of arrogance, but in the same spirit of service and teamwork  that I have always had when seeking to improve the plight of  labor. Venezuela is in a period that demands commitment and  responsibility from the CTV. It must be ready to talk with the  president-elect, his administration, and all other sectors about  the accord that will show the way though the serious crisis now  afflicting the country. I am convinced of the need for a broad  national agreement on how to overcome these difficulties."    Rios also emphasized his belief that labor has a pressing  need for modernization in order to meet workers' current needs.  These needs are different from those of the past, he said, and  they require reforms that give labor the power to negotiate new  working conditions.    "The time has come to warn public employees that they are in  danger of falling victim to the sort of crime that I have been  accused of. This is why the best that can come of what happened  to me is for solidarity to become synonymous with the Venezuelan  labor movement. I must tell you of my reflections during my 14  months in prison. I submit that the CTV and all unions must  become independent of political parties and their economic  resources without delay. This is the way to eliminate once and  for all any reliance on partisan politics in the making of  decisions that are strictly labor-related."    In handing over the CTV presidency, Angel Zerpa Mirabal  noted  that the International Labor Organization sees the Rios case as  a clear human rights violation and will take up the matter at  its December meeting.    [Regalado] Would you be willing to discuss retroactivity and  lower demands for wage hikes as part of a national accord while  the country solves its fiscal deficit?    [Rios] That is possible and necessary, but it must be done  as  part of a broad agreement with both wages and prices on the same  table. It is not fair to freeze wages and let prices go free.  The need is for a broad agreement covering an ample basket of  goods and agreed-upon wages. This gives wages room to move if  prices rise so long as the country remains in crisis. Willpower  on the part of government and business is the key.    [Regalado] What do you think of the position MAS [Movement  Toward Socialism] has taken on the executive committee against  your taking over the CTV presidency?    [Rios] I have no knowledge of this. I would ask them to  modify their position since everyone knows I am innocent. I  would refer them to Eloy Torres, who is sure of my innocence.    [Regalado] Would the national accord include elimination of  retroactive entitlements?    [Rios] I have always said that laws are made to be improved  through revision except in the area of social entitlements. Talk  of their elimination came up when I was under attack, and I took  it as a maneuver against me. But I still regard the entitlement  law as no different from others that are susceptible to  modification. This is something that can be debated. The fact is  that entitlements are all workers have. This is why there is so  much resistance to changing them.    But I do understand that modifications are necessary because  today retroactivity is a drain on public and private resources  that could lead to insolvency. Big business has something set  aside for such a contingency. This is what makes modification  necessary. But it cannot be just a way to meet needs or solve  problems for business. It must also improve the lot of workers.  I am sure my colleagues on the CTV executive committee would be  open to discussion.</p>

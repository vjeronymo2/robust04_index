			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> HOW SAFE IS LAX?  </P> <P> Burton's piece failed to address the primordial problem we have and one that  would be the easiest to deal with -- reducing the frequencies of flights on  certain routes. The first obvious one is the LAX/San Francisco service.  </P> <P> In one given day, we now have: United Airlines, one flight every half hour in  each direction; US Air, 14 or more every hour -- plus Delta, Pan Am and other  carriers serving that same route on their way to and from other destinations.  Why shouldn't business people -- who represent the bulk of those passengers  using the L.A. Basin/Bay Area route -- organize their appointments according to  an airline schedule, rather than the other way around? Sounds to me, once  again, like big business versus public safety.  </P> <P> DANIELLE AVIDAN  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY A PRESCRIPTION?  </P> <P> Question: It seems that there are more and more drugs that I can buy off the  shelf that I used to need a prescription for. One is a pill for seasickness.  </P> <P> If I know that I have a problem, and I know the drugstore carries medicine that  I can buy without a prescription, what would be the point in going to my doctor  to get a prescription?  </P> <P> Answer: The danger in treating yourself with over-the-counter medications is  that you are not equipped to diagnose your condition. Are you treating yourself  for the underlying problem or just for a symptom? If you feel some pain, is it  just a case of heartburn that will soon pass, or is it a symptom of something  serious that requires medical attention?  </P> <P> I'm not suggesting that you bring every headache to the attention of your  physician; in most cases, aspirin will be the most effective treatment. But  don't fall into the habit of treating symptoms with over-the-counter  medications while possibly ignoring a serious underlying problem.  </P></p>

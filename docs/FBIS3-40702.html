			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SHALL Report Criticizes Kuwaiti </F> Government Attempt To Justify Investments in Failed Banks"]    [Text] The weekly AL-SHALL economic report criticized the  government's attempt to justify investments in failed banks,  such as the Tunis International Bank, the Bahrain Middle East  Bank, and the French-Kuwaiti Bank. The report stated: "Kuwait's  financial reputation should not be linked with those  institutions' situation."    The following is the text of the report:  <H5>  Foreign Investments </H5>   The Kuwaiti press has published a government report  concerning the progress of action to prosecute the foreign  investments case. This is the case that has caused, and  continues to cause, debate. It affects considerably the  credibility of all authorities in the country in regard to  facing up to other issues. The report contains what would  theoretically be expected. The first part lists a number of  measures that the government has taken to try or prosecute  principals accused of embezzlement over a long period of time,  including the occupation period. There is no doubt that there  are those in the government who sincerely want to bring the case  to its natural conclusion, using all judicial and political  means to finish the case by prosecuting the accused. However,  the feeling that this is not the position of the entire  government raises certain violent, negative reactions. The scope  of the incident, the timing of its occurrence, the profuse  evidence regarding violations, and the list of the accused names  require zealous political pursuit. At the least, we would like  to see certain positions change for the positive.    In the second part, the report explains the changes that  have  occurred in the General Investments Board--administrative,  functional, and in future strategy. The London office has been  incorporated under the board's umbrella, and its powers limited.  There is also a pledge to prepare a detailed internal program to  regulate the powers and responsibilities of the three offices  (London, Kuwait, and the support office) scheduled to be  established. Moreover, the board intends to prepare its ideas  concerning its investments and directions, with the assistance  of specialists from among the directors of its portfolios and  its investment specialists, and will periodically change course  if the situation requires. This would have been the most  complete and strongest part of the report, if there had also  been the slightest hint or reference to the board's intent to  study the effect of the pressures or tight restrictions that the  general financial deficit is exerting, over time, on the size of  the investments and on the board's organization and strategy in  general.    Perhaps the report's weakest part is the attempt to justify  the government's deposits in the Tunis International Bank and  the Bahrain Middle East Bank among the large group of banks and  financial companies in which Kuwait participates. This, of  course, also applies to the French-Kuwaiti Bank, since it is  unacceptable to link Kuwait's reputation to these institutions'  situations. Because of the volume of investments in these banks,  one cannot justify intervening in the manner that was done and  under the financial circumstances that existed in the country.  Despite that, the intervention did not save most of these  institutions, as was our case with Spain during the same period.    Certain circles are raising fears about a collapse that  might  occur in the prices of certain assets, as a result of some  civilians offering their assets in order to have sufficient  liquidity to meet their obligations. We do not agree with this,  neither in terms of principle nor in terms of the situation's  possibilities. With respect to principle, there should be no  case of intervention to adjust prices, because market forces are  sufficient to modify prices at their true level, even if  downturns occur that go below that value in the short term.  Perhaps our experiences in intervention, all of which failed  after the "climate," are the best evidence of the program's  faults. Perhaps Japan's recent experience in not intervening  when its share indicator dropped from 38,000 to under 116,000  points [figures as published], including companies whose  products we deal with in all aspects of our lives, is additional  evidence from the experiences of the world around us.    In terms of the situation, despite the country's passing  through the disaster of a destructive occupation, the value of  the companies registered in the market is still, as of 15  December 1993, slightly higher than their value on the day  before the occupation. A reading of the AL-SHALL indicator for  15 December 1993 shows 101.6 points. This is an indicator of  value, which means that the value of the investors' shares is  higher than it was before the occupation. It is assumed,  theoretically at least, that less value would be acceptable.    The situation is that the indicator's reading on 7 July  1993,  i.e., before talk about being close to agreement on the  difficult debt program, was 92.7 points and was within the  bounds of acceptability. The indicator rose rapidly and  illogically to 111.5 points on 15 September 1993, i.e., after  publication of Law No. 41/93. This was a 20 percent rise. The  indicators of certain companies rose, due to the possibility of  their benefitting from the program, to 2.9 times what they had  been before the occupation, while others rose 2.5 times. These  increases were illogical or unjustifiable. It was inevitable  that the prices that had risen without justification would fall,  because of their probable financial performance. The object of  pushing their prices to the highest was to achieve profits over  the short term. This must have surely affected the possibilities  of increase of supply because of the program, or even because of  the possibility of a psychological effect that it could leave  behind. Despite that, the reading of the indicator last week was  higher by 8.9 points than it was on 7 July 1993, i.e., 9.6  percent.</p>

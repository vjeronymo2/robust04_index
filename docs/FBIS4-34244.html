			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Dominican President  Joaquin Balaguer today criticized a request issued by the U.S.  State Department to hold elections in those areas of the country  in which irregularities were detected during the 19 May voting  process.    Although Balaguer acknowledged the existence of anomalies  during the elections, he stressed that it will be up to the  Central Electoral Board (JCE) to decide the issue. He stated  that no authority, whether domestic or foreign, is entitled to  interfere with the JCE's announcement of election results, as  the U.S. State Department did this past Wednesday.    Balaguer's statements drew an immediate response from the  U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, which reiterated the U.S.  commitment to democracy in America.    Despite his criticism of the request, Balaguer agreed to  stage complementary elections in those communities in which  voters were excluded from voting lists. The United States  praised Balaguer's decision to repeat the elections, leaving the  final decision to the JCE, adding that "such a decision will  pave the way toward resolving the controversial results."    Balaguer explained he supports some of the recommendations  made by the United States, but he added that he opposes any  domestic or foreign interference in the JCE's decisions. He  also reiterated that the JCE is the organization that will  decide which measures will be adopted to resolve the issue.    On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Michael McCurry  released a document sent to the Dominican Government which  called for an investigation and clarification into charges of  irregularities reported by international observers. The  document notes: "The United States strongly urges the release of  the actual documents that were used at the voting tables on  Election Day."    The balloting is being protested by the Dominican  Revolutionary Party (PRD), which contends that at least 200,000  voters were excluded, mainly supporters of this party's  presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez.    Balaguer stated that the past elections were the cleanest  and  most transparent ever staged in the Dominican Republic, as well  as in Latin America. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that  following the elections, the Dominican economy has been  paralyzed by the JCE's delay in announcing the winner, although  he pointed out that the economy will recover once the election  process has concluded.    Balaguer also blamed the opposition for the electoral  tribunal's delay in announcing the winner because the number of  challenges that have been filed, particularly by the PRD, are  preventing the JCE from proclaiming a winner without first  concluding investigations into the charges.</p>

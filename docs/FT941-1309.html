			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: MJ Gleeson flat at Pounds 4.1m MJ Gleeson Group, the Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property concern, yesterday reported flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m for the six months to December 31, compared with Pounds 4.06m. Turnover slipped to Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 80.2m), but operating profits increased by 6.6 per cent to Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 3.55m). This improvement was partly offset by a decline in interest receipts to Pounds 336,000 (Pounds 564,000) while interest costs fell from Pounds 48,000 to Pounds 22,000. Earnings per share were very slightly lower at 27.06p (27.09p) partly reflecting a marginally higher Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.35m) tax charge, and the interim dividend is maintained at 3.35p. Despite a small increase in UK contracting turnover, the directors said the profits contribution from the construction operations was very modest and added that, 'trading conditions in this sector seem likely to remain difficult for some time.' However, the group said the upturn in the housebuilding market, which became apparent last year, has been sustained and the turnover of Gleeson Homes was significantly higher during the latest period than a year earlier. Provided that house buyers' confidence is not adversely affected by the forthcoming increases in personal taxation or other factors, the directors said they expected to sell a record number of homes this year. As a result they were 'cautiously optimistic' that overall trading profits for the year would be satisfactory.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Sun rises higher over Silicon Glen: James Buxton assesses the rewards for the UK economy from NEC's Pounds 530m outlay The decision by NEC to locate its next-generation semiconductor plant in Scotland was rightly described yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, as a 'tremendous vote of confidence by NEC, not only in its existing Livingston facility but in Scotland and the UK.' Even those in the Scottish electronics industry who believe inward investment sometimes receives too much uncritical publicity and does little to foster an indigenous electronics industry capable of spontaneous growth were impressed. 'This is an extremely good investment for Scotland,' one figure in the Scottish electronics industry said. 'These semiconductor plants have to invest to survive. 'If NEC didn't invest here the Livingston plant would eventually run down. Meanwhile the Japanese would have built their new plant somewhere else.' Even so, the scale of the investment needs to be kept in proportion. Of the Pounds 530m total cost of the investment - Japan's largest in Scotland - three-quarters will be spent on equipment to manufacture the memory chips, and almost all of this will come from Japan. That part which is actually spent in the UK will go mainly on the construction of the high-specification buildings on the 100-acre site. The impact of the investment on local manufacturing may be less great than that of electronics assembly plants which involve smaller capital outlays. Semiconductor plants have only one principal input, crystalline silicon, which NEC at Livingston obtains mostly from its fellow Japanese company Shin-Etsu, which also has a plant in Livingston. Unlike, for example, the assembly of personal computers, the making of semiconductors does not involve collating inputs from a wide range of suppliers, many of which could in theory be local. Thus the 'upstream linkages' from a chip plant to the local economy are limited, and probably involve mainly suppliers of gases, chemicals, clean-room services and garments. The new NEC plant will make an important contribution to the Scottish economy by employing 430 staff in addition to the 900 it already employs. 'These are high-quality jobs,' said Mr Peter Timms, managing director of Flexible Technology, a printed circuit board assembler. NEC says the high productivity of its Scottish workforce was an important factor in its decision to locate its new plant at Livingston. Earlier this year an official at NEC said the Livingston workforce had produced better yield figures than NEC's plants in Japan. 'The performance of the local labour force has surprised us; they have won international inter-company awards and training awards,' he said. The Japanese company's investment not only confirms Scotland as a prime location for multinational electronics manufacturers, but strengthens the array of companies operating there. As Mr Timms says, 'It's a box builder's (a personal computer assembler) dream to have an advanced chip manufacturer located on their doorstep, even if the output initially goes somewhere else to be assembled.' Mr Lang pointed out yesterday that Scotland produces 11 per cent of Europe's semiconductors, 35 per cent of its personal computers, over 50 per cent of its automated banking machines and 60 per cent of its workstations. Silicon Glen, as the Scottish electronics industry is often called, includes many of the leading US and Japanese electronics companies and employs about 45,000. After a pause in growth between 1989 and 1991, output from Scottish electronics plants has expanded rapidly, with a crucial impact on the Scottish economy. The Scottish Office's Economic Bulletin said recently that growth in Scottish manufacturing output between 1987 and 1993 'may be entirely attributed' to increased production from electronics plants. Yet the plants are largely producing items designed in the US or Japan. And though it is tricky to identify the exact source of material inputs, the most recent survey suggested that only 10 per cent came from Scotland in 1993-94 in spite of a 16 per cent rise in the industry's turnover to Pounds 9bn. Only a tiny number of Scottish-based companies is engaged in the large scale supply of components and sub-assemblies to the multinationals.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The jobs belt: source of recent manufacturing growth  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Motorola                              Hewlett Packard East Kilbride, Bathgate               South Queensferry  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Digital                               IBM South Queensferry                     Greenock  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NEC                                   Mitsubishi Livingston                            Haddington  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- National Semiconductors               Compaq Greenock                              Erskine  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

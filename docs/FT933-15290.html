			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Arts: Ado, a joy, a triumph - Theatre Shakespeare has returned to Shaftesbury Avenue for the first time since nobody seems quite sure when. He may even stay there for a while if this production of Much Ado About Nothing is anything to go by. For a start, it is extremely funny. Here is a West End audience laughing out loud and frequently at Shakespearean jokes. Matthew Warchus's direction is also very clever: a new interpretation without fundamentally deviating from the text. It could, for a time, become definitive, for it stands the old conventional assumptions about the play upside down. One of the keys is Mark Rylance's Benedick. This is not an urbane, self-confident figure, admired by all women yet determined to keep a certain distance. On the contrary, Rylance is physically small and not obviously attractive. He speaks with a heavy Northern Ireland accent and seems self-condemned to bachelorhood because he cannot believe that anyone would marry him, let alone Beatrice. Everyone else in the play speaks fairly normal English. Janet McTeer's Beatrice is physically very large beside him, almost gawky. She enters to summon Benedick to dinner eating a banana in a none-too-elegant fashion. She does not dress well either, and nor do any of the other women: sort of 1920-ish costumes picked up from Oxfam many years later. Ms McTeer's hair is nearly always a mess. On the other hand, this Beatrice is plainly a dominating personality, more interested in her intellect than her appearance. Presumably she admires Benedick for his defensive wit and because, like her, he is slightly outside the physical norm. The interpretation helps to make sense of the one jarring note in an otherwise amiable play: her sudden command to Benedick to kill Claudio. It comes close to being in character, as if she is initiating a coup by the most intelligent people in the play. Beatrice and Benedick apart, the chief wonder of Much Ado is the sheer Englishness of the justice scenes. Here are officers of the watch thoroughly out of their depth both with the law and the language: clearly the underdogs in the social hierarchy. The appropriately named Dogberry uses malapropisms long before Sheridan invented them. Yet what do these incompetent, bumbling officers do? They apprehend the villains in a way that their superiors could never attain to. A great deal of the mythology about English justice and the English character is contained in these sections. They were the forerunners of the Bobby on the beat. Dogberry is admirably played by Gerard Kelly, but if you want the additional pleasure of a tiny vignette, watch Brian Shelley as Verges, the junior officer who is hardly allowed a word. He longs to be allowed at least to shake hands with Leonato, the Governor of Messina, at the end, but the officious Dogberry pushes him aside. Along with Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, here is Shakespeare as the quintessential Englishman who probably liked cricket. The reason, I suppose, why the Bard is now so seldom played in the West End is that he is so expensive. Even Much Ado About Nothing contains 18 characters, and there is of course a diet of Shakespeare at the Barbican and the RNT. Yet this production, mounted by Thelma Holt, shows that it can be done. The direction is as fresh and inventive as you are likely to find at the established institutions, and on the second night the audience loved it.

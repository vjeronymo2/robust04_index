			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-san: "Nothing Can Be Gained from </F> Slanderous Smear Propaganda"]    [Text] The U.S. ideological and cultural offensive to  destroy from within the socialist countries and independent  countries in Asia has reached a more grave stage. According to  a report, the U.S. Senate on 25 January passed the bill for  starting the so-called Radio Free Asia broadcast with Asia as  its target.    According to a report by Voice of America, this radio  station  will begin broadcast by placing the focus on our country, China,  Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and Cambodia.    The U.S. plan is to instill the sense of value on U.S.-style  democracy and poisonous bourgeois ideological elements in  socialist countries and independent nations in Asia in a bid to  totally crush socialism and to destroy independent governments  in this area, thus pursuing insidious purpose.    Therefore, the U.S. Senate's passage of the bill for  starting  the Radio Free Asia is brazen-faced interference in domestic  affairs of the Asian countries and an intolerable crime. This is  why many nations in Asia raised voices of protest and  denunciation against such maneuvers by the United States.    In a weekly briefing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  stressed that the genuine purpose of passing the bill in the  U.S. Senate for starting Radio Free Asia is to interfere in the  domestic affairs of Asian countries and to create confusion by  means of mass media.    Besides, the Vietnamese newspaper, THE PEOPLE, denounced and  rejected the U.S. Senate's resolution as brazen-faced  interference in the domestic affairs of the Asian countries, and  a Lao Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the U.S. decision to  set up a Radio Free Asia broadcasting station goes counter to  cooperation, peace and development in Asia, and that the Radio  Free Europe had been used as a tool for opposing the former  Soviet Union and socialist countries in East Europe.    It is quite natural, therefore, that the Asian countries  show  strong resistance to the United States' movement to start Radio  Free Asia. There are plenty reasons that many Asian countries,  including China, Vietnam, and Laos, expressed their strong  opposition to the U.S. Senate's step.    Radio Free Asia is another version of the former Voice of  Freedom and Radio Free Europe broadcasts.    As has been widely known, the Voice of Freedom and Radio  Free  Europe were put into operation when the imperialists, frightened  by expanded and strengthened socialist forces on a worldwide  scale, declared the Cold War policy and ran amok with  antisocialist maneuvers.    As for Radio Free Europe, it was inaugurated in the United  States, and served as a bugler for frustrating the people's  faith in socialism and for destroying socialist countries from  within under the financial support of the U.S. Central  Intelligence Agency.    The Voice of Freedom and Radio Free Europe broadcasts, which  were operating in Munich, Germany, disseminated various  slanderous and smear rumors in an attempt to create discord and  social confusion in the former Soviet Union and socialist  countries in East Europe, and persistently infiltrated bourgeois  ideology and culture into these countries.    In this way, the United States is also maneuvering to  destroy  socialist countries and independent nations in Asia  ideologically, culturally, and mentally. The United States  regards our country as its important target. If those who are  going to begin the broadcast of Radio Free Asia think that they  can do something against our people with false, deceitful, and  slanderous propaganda, it is indeed a foolish miscalculation.  They should precisely realize this.    We have the chuche idea--the great guiding ideology--and our  own-style unique way of life. The broadcast of Radio Free Asia  may send disorderly electric waves out into space, but it can  never make our people's spiritual world turbid. This is also  applied to other countries in Asia. There is an Asian-style  tradition which has been solidified through a long history and a  sense of Asian-style culture in Asia.    The spirit of independence that the masters of Asia are the  Asian people has been further enhanced among the people in many  Asian countries and based on this spirit, the people are dealing  with the infiltration of reactionary ideas and culture from  outside with heightened vigilance.    The United States is scheming to destroy the Asian-style  tradition and spoil the sense of culture with yellow propaganda.  But its attempt will never be successful. Our people and all  Asians will resolutely smash all maneuvers to block the fierce  trend of time toward socialism and independence. The United  States should immediately discard its maneuvers to begin  broadcasting Radio Free Asia.</p>

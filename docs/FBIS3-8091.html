			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Branko Podgornik: "Will the Left Soon Recover?"] </F>   [Text] The first obvious sign of recovery of the Croatian  left has recently emerged. Four years after the beginning of  the collapse of the former Communist Party, something new is  trying to grow out of its ruins. Ivica Racan's Social Democratic  Party of Croatia (SDP), created from a reformist faction in the  former regime party, has united with Antun Vujic's Social  Democratic Party (SDH), which was established in 1989 in  opposition to the former regime.    The long-announced gathering of leftist social democrats is  nevertheless starting to get under way, and some 10 days ago,  leaders of both parties publicly confirmed that. They present  themselves as two factions on the left of center Croatian  political scene: social democrats from the former ruling party  and social democrats from the opposition, and they advocate an  independent and democratic Croatia.  <H5>  Without the Third Side </H5>   However, with the appearance of a third movement on the  left,  which primarily includes Branko Horvat's Social Democratic Union  (SDU), they will not and cannot unite. They think the third is  continuing the work of conservative forces from the former  regime, regarding the idea of a form of Yugoslav community,  which see the creation of the Croatian state as a necessary  evil. The Socialist Party of Croatia (SSH), headed by Silvije  Degen, is a fourth leftist party, but Croatian social democrats  have noticed that the Socialists wander between them and the  SDU, and that they do not want to take sides.    It is impossible to unite all the leftist parties because,  even since 1990, the deepest polarization in Croatia is situated  exactly to the left of the political center. Those who advocate  Croatia are on one side of this front line and those who  advocate Yugoslavia or invoke its spirits are on the other.    Observers say that the attempt to unite everything that  exists left of center would look like an attempt to glue  together the former Croatian League of Communists: As though it  were being attempted to shut a cat and a dog in the same cage  and put the well- known curse on the left: May you have to deal  with yourself! People say that that would continue to prevent  the left from developing into a force that could mean something  on the Croatian political scene.    But many still insist on uniting the ununitable. Some  members of the SDP claim that some do it naively wishing for the  left to get stronger, but the road to hell is often paved with  the best of intentions. Some think that uniting all the leftist  parties is being encouraged by some circles in the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] and outside it -- those who want to weaken  the left fearing it could get back to power in Croatia as well,  as has already happened in many Eastern European countries. If  the advocates of compromised ideas were to belong to one party,  people say that the ruling party would find it easier to deal  with the left, while the existing Racan's and especially Vujic's  social democrats are a bit harder to control now.  <H5>  Identity Crisis </H5>   Furthermore, people say that insisting on merging all the  leftist parties is beneficial for some circles in the SDU and  the SSH, as that part of the left is undergoing an identity  crisis. A new identity can easily be found if they come closer  to the social democrats, who acquire and want to continue to  acquire an identity and legitimacy first of all with the  Croatian nation. At former state and local elections, the SDP  got the biggest share of the 9 percent of votes for the left.    Ivica Racan is claiming these days that "the attempt to  unite  everything leftist in one party would marginalize the left and  then also marginalize and eliminate the SDP. I will not agree  to that, and I believe that I am supported by most people in the  party."    Some observers explain why it would be good for, for example  "the far left" headed by Branko Horvat, which Stipe Suvar likes  as well, to suppress the SDP, and especially to suppress Ivica  Racan. In 1990, when he was a member of the SDP, Horvat  criticized Racan for intending to give the SDP the name of  social democrats but a couple of years later he changed his mind  and started advocating social democratic concepts himself. "Far  left" circles reproached Racan for having a poor strategy, with  being "the grave-digger of the party," with "betraying the  Serbs" after the first democratic elections, and the like.    Indeed, after getting almost 30 percent of the votes at the  elections in 1990, the SDP got only some 5 percent at the  elections in 1992. It became evident that the party had reached  an all time low, but it survived, recovered, and is now  preparing to move slowly upward. These days one often hears the  old anti- communists complimenting former communist Ivica Racin  on his way of leading the party; they appreciate his political  experience, and sometimes refer to the SDP as "polite civic  party, which has contributed to democracy and inter-Croatian  reconciliation."    An observer has remarked that Racan's adversaries from the  left could now be forced to admit that Racan was right in some  things and that he "has not become history like some of his  critics who were tied up by history."  <H5>  Racan or Tripalo </H5>   The same observer continues that it is difficult to admit  that owing to personal vanity, and some are quietly trying to  push Racan away from the leading position in the SDP, including  members of his own party. Lately, they have welcomed references  to Mika Tripalo as a possible president of the united left, for  that would make it easier to do away with Racan and the SDP.  Still, our source claims that Racan and Tripalo are not in  conflict, they recently had a long talk behind closed doors and  cleared up matters, and they are also publicly praising each  other.    Indeed, in the last couple of months, Racan himself has  considered withdrawing from the leading position into the party  shadows. However, VJESNIK's source continues, "now Racan, too,  is displaying a kind of vanity. He does not want to be written  off but wants to prove that he can not only preserve the party  but also stimulate its growth, and that has lately become  evident. In that, he is supported by most members of the SDP;  he is even being pushed by them."    All in all, after the successful party reform, which Racan  carried out by relying on the so-called youth line, the SDP is  now trying to make a step forward on the Croatian political  scene. With a refreshed and rejuvenated leadership, the SDP  wants to be the center of the Croatian democratic left, which  will spread toward the center. As a sign of that, members of  the party claim, they decided to unite with the SDH, whose  members did not hide their political inclinations toward the  reformists in the SDP. Antun Vujic claims he finds it easier to  talk to members of earlier factions of the SDP than with Racan  himself.    Circles close to the SDP and the SDH claim it is soon to be  expected that many prominent men will publicly support the  unification of social democrats in order to help them develop  politically. Observers say that Racan is counting on young  people in his party in particular to carry forward social  democratic ideas, and that there are such people in the SDH as  well, for the unburdened generation can suppress conflicts in  the party that mostly originated in the past and that are  directed toward the past instead of the present.    A young member of the SDP, now in the party leadership, says  it was most difficult for him in the election campaign of 1990.  At that time, new Croatian parties were setting up their stalls  on Jelacic Square and selling party materials and symbols. "I  was standing behind the SDP stand, and the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] stands were to the left and to the right  of me and people were fighting to get to them while no one came  to me except for old ladies and stool pigeons. One of them  shouted: `And where is your famous equipment -- the hammer and  sickle?' I replied sadly they had been stolen by some people  from the HDZ. When the war begin, I volunteered. Of course, it  was difficult for me at the front lines as well, but easier than  on Jelacic Square in 1990."</p>

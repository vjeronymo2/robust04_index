			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ROMANIA-BOUND: The Panama intervention hasn't boosted local military  recruiting, said an Army spokesman in Santa Ana, but some Orange County youths  said they'd go overseas to fight if needed. . . . At least eight young  Romanian-Americans put their names on a Southern California list of those  willing to fight in Bucharest. . . . Local residents phoned relatives in  Romania, said Pastor Daniel Branzai of the Romanian Baptist Church in Anaheim,  who "told them about the tremendous need that they had for guns and manpower.  That's why they were ready to go." Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Legendary guns go under the hammer A PAIR OF guns that helped build the legend of the wild west went unsold when they came under the hammer at an auction in Lewes, East Sussex yesterday. Neither the Colt .45 used to murder 'Wild Bill' Hickok nor the Colt .36 wielded by outlaw Jesse James - from the collection of US Colonel Carl Breihan - reached their reserve price. It had been expected that they could fetch about Pounds 50,000 each. Hickok was shot during a card game on August 2 1876, by 'Cross Eyed' Jack McCall in the Mann Saloon at Deadwood, South Dakota.</p>

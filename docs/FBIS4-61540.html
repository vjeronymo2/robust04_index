			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed ADS report in the "Incident" column: "Illegal </F> Border Crossing by Chinese Warships Has Been Prevented.  Khabarovsk Residents Are Not Going To Cede the Bolshoy  Ussuriyskiy Island to the Chinese"]    [Text] Border guards of the Far Eastern Border District  have prevented a penetration by five Chinese military vessels.  As Khabarovsk Kray administration chief Viktor Ishayev told  SEGODNYA's correspondent, on the afternoon of 1 May Chinese  vessels, in line formation, were moving in to breach the  Russian-Chinese border in the area of the Kazakevich outpost, 40  km from Khabarovsk.    Mr. Ishayev demanded that the border district command use  all  legitimate means to curb this attempt. As a result of decisive  actions by patrol boats and vessels of the Amur Flotilla, the  Chinese military vessels were not allowed across the border. No  casualties, fighting, or damage are reported. Viktor Ishayev  said that "these actions by the Chinese side are a provocation  aimed at infringing the Russian Far East." He related these  actions directly to the upcoming visit to the PRC by Russian  Federation Government head Viktor Chernomyrdin scheduled for the  end of this May.    Mr. Ishayev expressed the supposition that the actions by  Chinese military vessels came as a result of a still unrenounced  agreement, little known to the wide public, which was signed by  Mikhail Gorbachev and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh on 14 May 1991.  Article 8 of this agreement says, "Chinese vessels of all  types, including military, may navigate the Amur freely. The  rules of navigation will be elaborated by the competent bodies  of the two countries additionally." Because the rules of  navigation have not as yet been worked out, military vessels as  well as civilian steamships from China will not be allowed into  Khabarovsk at the Kazakevich checkpoint.    Touching on the evolution of Russian-Chinese relations at  the  local level, the head of the kray administration believes that  "at present China is undertaking latent expansion to the Russian  Far East, infringing and humiliating the Russian people." If  the treaty signed by the former USSR leaders "is not renounced,  the administrations of adjacent Far Eastern krays and oblasts  will take their own measures," he said. According to Mr.  Ishayev, "the provocation by the military vessels was also a  demonstration, timed to coincide with the start of work by a  joint Russian-Chinese demarcation commission on 6 May."    As is known, in the process of border revision between  Russia  and the PRC the latter has acquired more than 2,000 islands with  more than 1,000 hectares of arable land. The stumbling block in  the commission's work is the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy island with an  area of 350 sq km, located close to Khabarovsk. On its maps  published in China the southern neighbor stubbornly marks this  fertile island as Chinese territory and has an eye to seizing it  from Russia. According to Viktor Ishayev, however, "the  residents of Khabarovsk Kray intend to maintain their island by  any methods."</p>

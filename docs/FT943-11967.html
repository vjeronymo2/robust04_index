			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (5): Affability with a hint of steel / Profile of Eddie George Once upon a time, governors of the Bank of England were haughty, aristocratic figures. The pink-tailed footmen who roam the halls of the Bank seemed appropriate guardians of one of the crown's most mighty subjects. Nowadays, central banking is more a matter of understanding the difference between the implied GDP deflator and the producer prices index, than knowing the right direction in which to pass the port. Eddie George is one of the new breed. A technician, who has worked at the Bank (with occasional outside secondments) for 32 years, he is fully equipped to debate the minutiae of monetary policy with his expert underlings. As to aristocratic hauteur, he is sufficiently aware of the demands of a democratic age to submit to the indignity of a television interview with Brian Walden. Indeed, if the Bank wishes to gain public acceptance for an independent role, Eddie George is an ideal front man. As his nickname 'steady Eddie' attests, he exudes an air of reliability, the old-fashioned bank branch manager writ large. A more intellectually, or socially, arrogant man might provoke a backlash against the loss of democratic sovereignty inherent in granting the Bank independence. Behind the public air of affability, however, there is more than a hint of steel. His management style has been described as autocratic and his economic opinions are firmly held. He genuinely believes that 'inflation is theft' and he took the unusual action of agreeing to a five-year pay freeze when he was appointed in 1993. Before he became deputy-governor in 1990, George was executive director of home finance, heading a small team in charge of policy-making and the day-to-day management of financial markets. Ironically, it is in this area of handling financial markets where he has received some criticism as governor. The timing of the interest rate cut in February, responsibility for which was in the Bank's hands, was perceived by the markets as political, coinciding as it did with a difficult period for the Conservative party. It then gradually emerged that Eddie George had opposed the cut and, indeed, speculation on the issue was one of the reasons the Chancellor agreed to publication of the minutes of the monthly monetary meeting. Those minutes showed that the Bank was consistently more optimistic about growth, and more pessimistic about inflation, than the Treasury. George has been criticised in the press, and by some brokers' analysts, for his caution about inflation which, some feel, has prevented interest rates from falling fast enough to give the UK a buoyant recovery. Certainly, the Bank of England's short-term forecasts, contained in its quarterly inflation reports, have proved consistently over-pessimistic. When the next upturn in inflation arrives, George can expect more jibes on the grounds that he was too dilatory in raising rates. The price of greater Bank freedom is eternal criticism.</p>

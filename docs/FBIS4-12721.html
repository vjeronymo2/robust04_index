			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chief Editor Walid Abu-Zahr: "Secrets of Salzburg </F> Meeting Between Qusayy Saddam Husayn and the Russian Mafia"]    [Text] As I sat waiting for an "important source" I had  known for many years, my memory was hard pressed, recalling the  latest events in Iraq. A telephone call from a mutual friend  had me rushing to this Western capital. My friend said that Mr.  X, the highly placed Western diplomat whom I had known as an  expert on Iraq, and who had many connections in pre-Gulf war  Baghdad and is still responsible for Iraqi affairs in his  country, was on his way to this capital before returning home  after attending both secret and open UN discussions on lifting  the sanctions against Baghdad.    Now I am waiting for this "source" and whiling away the time  by recalling the latest developments. Baghdad now seems to have  lost hope that the international stand against it will be  reevaluated. Two days ago, 'Udayy Saddam Husayn criticized Iraqi  diplomacy, accusing it of failure in effecting a diplomatic  breakthrough in the international embargo, and threatening to  resort to other methods that had nothing to do with diplomacy.  Saddam Husayn himself threatened and vowed to take revenge.  Information is almost certain that Iraq is preparing to launch  a comprehensive offensive in the north to reopen its strategic  artery with Turkey. All these events, coming simultaneously,  indicate that something different is being prepared. Therefore,  the questions in my mind concentrated on Saddam's new  calculations and the new plan behind his threats. I am certain  that the satisfactory answer will come from this "friendly  source," who I am waiting for in this Western capital after a  previous appointment. As usual, I now record the verbatim  dialogue that was conducted between us.    There was no time for many courtesies and greetings. So when  the "friend" took his seat, the question of Iraq sprang to the  lips and I began by asking him: Where has Iraq obtained such  sudden strength to be brave enough and issue such threats?    And with the air of one who has a sensational story to  relate, the "friend" began his answer:    "Snow was falling on this mountainous village near Salzburg,  one of the most beautiful towns in Austria, famous for its  annual music festival to commemorate its son, Mozart, when four  elegant cars pulled up at the entrance to a chalet. Men of  Middle Eastern features alighted. They drew the attention of  the European tourists who did not give them much consideration  since they are used to seeing tourists from all over the world.  However, the Middle Eastern tourists were not tourists or  ordinary visitors but Iraqi officials who came on a special and  secret mission to hold an important meeting with other  'tourists' who had arrived at the chalet from the former Soviet  Union only minutes before the Iraqis."    The man went on and I did not interrupt:    "The meeting was not kept secret for long, however, because  elements of the Austrian security forces, in addition to one  representative of a West European and one representative of an  East European security service concerned with the Middle East  and with Iraq, were tasked with monitoring the movements of the  Iraqi officials. These elements reached the meeting after  monitoring the officials movements for two days, starting in  Vienna. They were operating in accordance with information  received in advance from Moscow and an Arab capital stating that  a secret high-level Iraqi delegation would arrive, led by Qusayy  Saddam Husayn, head of Saddam's special security apparatus and  executor of special tasks, such as this Austrian one.    "Qusayy was the first official to enter the meeting place,  preceded by his bodyguard. He was followed by Abu-Ahmad, one of  the men in charge of external operations in the Iraqi  intelligence service, and three high-ranking Iraqi Army officers  who were participating in such political-military talks for the  first time. They were graduates of Soviet military academies and  had important connections in Moscow. Those recognized among the  Russian team were certain veteran Russian politicians, former  generals in the Soviet army, and leaders of the Russian mafia  connected with certain military and political wings in the  Kremlin. The Iraqi side was not eager to maintain secrecy  because Baghdad wanted to exploit the appearance of its  delegation in front of the intelligence services as message to  scare the Western world."    My diplomat friend appeared confident that Iraq will  witness serious developments in the coming weeks or months as a  consequence of Saddam Husayn's threats. When I reminded him  that the recent threat is not the first of its kind, that the  Iraqi president has threatened the world with dire consequences  several times in the past, only to retrack his threats and  submit, the diplomat said:    "This time it is different. I believe you know Saddam Husayn  better than I do. You no doubt recall that in the past, he used  to ask one of his close associate to issue threats and to avoid  committing himself to carrying them out, thus paving the way for  a retreat. This time he initiated the threat. You will be  convinced of the true dimensions of Saddam's threat if you allow  me to reveal the secrets of the Salzburg meeting that took place  two months ago, and the information acquired by prominent world  security and political agencies on Iraq's secret movements."    I said that I would ask my questions later and he continued:    "Reliable security reports, some of which were submitted by  participants in that meeting, emphasize that Qusayy Saddam  Husayn was eager to go a long way in promoting Iraqi relations  with the pro-Iraq Russian parties that have maintained relations  with the Iraqi regime since the Soviet days of close military,  security, and political cooperation. Those attending the  meeting from the Russians generally represented the Iraqi lobby,  which now has a great deal of weight in the Russian political  and military arenas. These not only represent the Zhirinovskiy  group, but a large spectrum of Russian military and political  figures who yearn for the days of the Soviet empire and would  like to restore their superpower status and influence,  especially in the Third World and in the Arab world in  particular. They are calling for a return to the region in a  big way and for an end to submission to the United States, the  only world superpower."    The diplomat paused for a while and added:    "Reports say that in his speech, Qusayy concentrated on this  chord, which is so sensitive to his interlocutors, pointing out  that the road to the return of Soviet influence to the world  must pass through the Middle East. He said that the Arab  region, which has suffered because of the absence of this  superpower and its great ally, and the state of confusion among  the Arabs now in view of the tottering peace process and U.S.  arbitrariness and its extremist support for Israel, paves the  way for Russia's return to the arena with the support of the  Arab people who are seeking a means to avenge their wounded  self-esteem. Qusayy said that Iraq continues to regard itself  as an ally on which Russia could depend in its political  comeback and in ending the U.S. hegemony, through Iraq's  contribution toward solving Russia's economic crisis. If you  help us lift the blockade, he said, we will be able to repay  billions of dollars in debts and sign military contracts that  will be the beginning of a powerful Russian breakthrough in the  Arab world."    The diplomat added:    "The principle of restoring Iraqi-Russian cooperation did  not  take a long because the two sides were in agreement on this  point and because it was not the main subject of discussion."    And what was the main subject?    "This meeting was preceded by several preparatory meetings.  It had been agreed to hold the meeting to draw up a joint plan  for action that would the focal point in the 'new course'  [al-sabil al- jadid] Saddam Husayn talked about when he issued  his threat to the world."    And what is the Russian mafia's role in the meeting?    "A big one. According to available security reports, the  plan is very serious and has world-wide dimensions that require  cooperation with the Russian mafia, which has wide-scale  connections in the fields of terrorism, gun smuggling and drug  running, and which is now connected with a world network  specialized in terrorist operations in most world countries."    I said, obviously aghast, what is this serious plan then?    The diplomat answered, fully confident of himself and his  information:    "Saddam Husayn has recently reconsidered all his  calculations  and made a serious decision based on the principle that the  attack is the best means of defense. The man is now convinced  that the efforts to corner him and keep him in isolation by  continuing the embargo will ultimately lead to his political and  popular suicide and that he will not be able to withstand this  for many years. The world, and the United States in particular,  treat him as if he does not exist and have established formulas  for the region without taking him into account, except to weaken  him further and further. While not working seriously to topple  him, the United States is refusing to make any move to give him  any future role. This has begun to tell on his future political  and popular assets inside Iraq and in the Arab world, even among  those who admired his challenge to the United States, Israel,  and the West. Even these admirers have completely forsaken and  forgotten Saddam Husayn. The man feels that he has truly been  quarantined from the world for a long period of time and that he  cannot take any more."    I said: But, what has changed for him to be able to  confront this isolation while the internal popular indignation  against him is increasing, and the political, economic, and  military blockade gives him no room for maneuvering?    He said: "In his new calculations, Saddam Husayn believes  that the regional and international stand toward him has  changed, and that facts are no longer the same as those that  existed during the invasion of Kuwait or directly after its  liberation. He also believes that the international alliance,  in its current form, is no longer as cohesive as it used to be.  In his view, it is impossible to obtain an international  consensus to deal military blows to him if he violates the UN  Security Council resolutions, especially since this council has  begun to suffer seriously from the policy of double standards  and impotence, which becomes clear when dealing with Israel, and  which became clear toward the Muslims in former Yugoslavia and  in Somalia. We cannot deny that through economic and other  temptations, Iraq succeeded in creating a rift among the UN  Security Council's permanent member states. These member states  were divided into two teams -- the United States and Britain on  the one hand, and France, Russia, and China on the other. He  wagered on the second team's support for lifting the blockade.  However, the renewal of sanctions has forced him to resort to  his plan to return to the arena strongly. This time, he aims at  reshuffling the cards in this sensitive region at this sensitive  stage, at disrupting stability, and fomenting disturbances and  riots through a hellish internal, regional, and international  plan."    Finally, we have arrived at the plan.    "Yes, and I am not revealing a secret if I say that several  big powers are taking this plan very seriously, and fear that  the implementation of this scenario has already begun on the  internal level."    What will Saddam do this time?    "Information indicates that the Iraqi president's plan  includes several parts, all aimed at creating an explosion in  the current situation and creating new facts to force world  states to give him some kind of a role. The first part is  internal; Saddam will seek to once again raise the issue of the  dangers of fragmenting and partitioning Iraq in order to make  others recognize his role in safeguarding the country's unity,  and to threaten the region's states with the dangers and  repercussions of partitioning Iraq on them. Actually, Saddam  has begun to mass his troops in the north to exacerbate the  security situation with the Kurds. At the same time, he is  preparing for similar operations in the south to defy the  Western alliance and to put it face to face with a serious  attempt to fragment it and to create difference among its  members. In this regard, you can see the policy of flirtation  which now exists between Turkey and Iraq. Turkey is counting on  this to help it find a way out of the impasse of war with the  Kurds. In return, Iraq relies on this to reinforce its  penetration of the blockade and to pave the way for trade on a  larger scale than what is currently taking place. In the  Iraqis' opinion, Turkey and the Western states cannot ignore the  Iraqi markets and their economic resources during this world  crisis. Consequently, they should have a thousand apprehensions  before adopting a new international stand toward Iraq."    What about the second part?    "The second part is aimed at the Gulf and the region. In  addition to threatening the region with the dangers of  partitioning Iraq, the regime in Baghdad will seek to foment  disturbances on the border with Kuwait and in some Arab states.  It seems that Saddam Husayn is aware of the sensitivity of the  international stand toward him regarding the Kuwait issue. So,  he will try to implement his plan with a new method in which the  regime and its forces will have no role, and without any direct  military threat. Information shows that the Iraqis intend to  escalate the situation with Kuwait, one time by creating  problems on the border with ordinary people, and another under  the cover of smuggling drugs and alcohol, which will lead to  armed clashes, or by carrying out bombing inside Kuwait, which  will contribute to spreading horror, anxiety, and disturbances."    The diplomat continued to say: "You know very well that  Iraq's interference in the serious conflict in Yemen is part of  a scheme to cause tension in the region. However, Iraq will not  stop at this point. Perhaps the more important card Saddam  Husayn is trying to play, proceeding from his new international  calculations, is that of foiling the peace process in the Middle  East, which is going on without him. Information confirms that,  after the failure of his secret contacts with the Americans and  following progress he achieved in his contacts with the  Russians, Saddam Husayn will try to use the foundering peace  negotiations and the Arabs' increasing feeling that they are  being deceived and humiliated by a hostile Israeli-American  alliance that forces them to make concessions and remain silent  over Israeli intransigence and repression to deliver the coup de  grace to the peace process.    "Security sources indicate that Saddam Husayn recently  reestablished contacts with Palestinian groups opposed to the  peace accord and known for their support for the Iraqi regime  and for their distinguished relations with it during their long  stay in Iraq. He also opened up to Islamic fundamentalist  groups that recently visited Baghdad, especially the Palestinian  opposition groups.    "Furthermore, it has been learned that Palestinian leaders  well known for their Iraqi links recently received the green  light to visit certain Arab countries to hold contacts with  Palestinian opposition factions and to coordinate stands with  them to broaden the scope of pressure on the negotiations.  These Palestinian leaders also formed plans to carry out armed  operations inside and outside the occupied territories in order  to destroy the peace process."    The diplomat went on to say: "What is more serious is that  big security sources collected confirmed information indicating  that Saddam Husayn decided to bring his confrontation to the  point of threatening the world with terrorist operations and of  delegating terrorist, extremist, fundamentalist, Palestinian,  and international groups to plant bombs and explosives in Europe.    "Information confirms that plans were formulated to carry  out  operations against Israeli and non-Israeli targets in countries  that still adopt stands hostile to Iraq and are waging a  campaign of continuing sanctions against it."    I interjected by asking: Does Saddam Husayn have an  international terrorist network to implement these operations?    He said: "All the information indicates that the Russian  mafia attended a meeting in Salzburg to study capabilities for  carrying out these operations. These capabilities are very big  due to the current link between mafia smuggling and terrorist  networks and also due to the relations among mafia leaders,  intelligence elements, and security bodies from many East  European countries, which had broad relations with international  terrorism during the days of the communist bloc.    "I forgot to tell you that one day after the Salzburg  meeting, Qusayy Saddam Husayn and an accompanying delegation  went to Bulgaria and held secret meetings with Palestinian  opposition leaders who chose asylum in that country. They had  previously received military training there along with elements  from (former) liberation and extreme left movements from all  over the world under Russian experts. All of them maintained  their old relations. Indeed, contacts resumed about a year ago  and coordination was reestablished under former KGB officials."    He added: "We must not forget that Saddam Husayn previously  won over Palestinian and international leaders known for  terrorism. Many of them gathered in Baghdad during the Gulf  crisis and were joined by numerous Islamic fundamentalists.  You are well aware that the CIA accused Baghdad of the blast  at the World Trade Center in New York and that one of the  suspects escaped to Iraq and is still residing there."    I interrupted him once again and said: We can easily  understand the Russian Mafia's role, but what exactly is the  Russian role, and why did generals and politicians attend the  Salzburg meeting?    He replied with a brief smile, and continued:    "Saddam Husayn does not want to repeat the experience of the  Mother of Battles in his new plan, and he is concerned to avoid  involvement in a suicidal project. He built his calculations on  protecting his back by the important regional and international  changes that, to him, seem to be in his favor and can be  exploited.    "The most prominent of these changes, which in fact are mere  ambiguous signs, is that Russia is looking for a way to return  to the international arena and restore some of its past  influence. What Qusayy offered the Russians who are enthusiastic  about this theory was a deal with, and a service to Russia. In  other words, the more the crisis worsens and the situation in  the Arab world deteriorates to reach the point of explosion, the  more the road becomes open for the Russians to emphasize the  importance of their return as a balancing and stabilizing factor  and mediator, if not a full partner that is able to play a role  in safeguarding regional and international stability as the  situation used to be during the days of the Soviet Union. There  is nothing better than confusion and conflicts for Russia's  return to the arena, especially when Yeltsin is surrounded by  strong political and military opposition that pushes him in that  direction."    I said: From what you say, it is understood that Saddam  Husayn is now prepared to sabotage the region and the world to  prove that he is still able to disrupt things and pose a threat  to the stability of the region and the world order counting only  on dividing the Western alliance and Russian support. However,  nothing indicates that Russia, which is economically and  politically ruined, and Yeltsin, who is threatened with being  removed from office, and who is unable to feed his people, is  able to carry the heritage of the Soviet Union. Don't you think  that Saddam Husayn's new adventure is destined to failure and  is, once again, based on miscalculations?    The diplomat quickly answered: "There should be a  distinction between security information and political analysis.  The Iraqi movements, activities, and plans I revealed to you  are based on information from very reliable sources, and the  evidence is that we have begun to see the beginning of  implementing this plan on the ground. On the other hand, you  have the right to ask about the seriousness of depending on  Russia in its current situation and Saddam Husayn's  miscalculations. In my view, the Iraqi president is still  unable to grasp the utmost strategic importance the United  States attaches to the region, and it is impossible for  Washington to allow Russia to share it. The most that  Washington can accept is Russia's restoration of its influence  in the independent republics that formed the Soviet Union, and  assuming the role of policeman in these republics. At present,  Russia's utmost ambition is to impose its hegemony on that area  in order to prevent the conflicts, confusion, and civil wars in  these republics from spreading to Moscow, unless Yeltsin finds  himself in Saddam Husayn's shoes and becomes in need of avoiding  the problem through venting the pressure of his opponents. This  can be done through exploiting distant crises. Nevertheless, I  do not think that he has the capabilities to do so, and, in the  first place, I do not think that Washington is prepared to  relinquish the title of the world's sole superpower.    "As for the possibility of splitting the Western alliance, I  fear that the Iraqi plan may contribute to the restoration of  the alliance's integration because Iraq and the region are not  Bosnia- Herzegovina and Somalia. The question is how far Saddam  Husayn will go in his game of 'I am drowning, so why fear  getting wet?' This is what the next weeks will reveal."</p>

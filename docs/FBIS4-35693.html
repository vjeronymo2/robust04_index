			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Bari al-Hariri] </F>   [Text] A special symposium on the Arab bread loaf,  organized by the Arab Federation for Food Industries in  coordination with the Ministries of Trade and Agriculture, has  called upon all Arab states to exert their efforts to lift the  unjust blockade on the Iraqi people.    The symposium also called for exploiting all means in order  to increase the production of wheat and grains and to build  strategic storage for these crops. It also called for the  formation of joint working teams to help coordinate Arab  positions on the purchase of wheat and grain, and for the  establishment of an authoritative Arab center for scientific  research and technological development concerned with making  bread and setting unified Arab specifications for a standard  Arab loaf.    Dr. Falah Sa'id Jabr, secretary general of the Arab  Federation of Food Industries, told AL-THAWRAH that the  symposium proposed the establishment of an operations room to  follow world wheat and grain prices in light of the new world  changes that are expected to follow the application of the  integrated "quality" and new "GATT": agreements.    Dr. Jabr pointed out that the symposium also proposed  revising the existing law on grain publicity, improving the  competence of those in charge of laboratory tests, and setting  up new standards for evaluating the performance of governorates  in grain production.    The symposium called on the peasants productive cooperative  movement, investors, and farmers to build silos according to  proper engineering designs in order to store produced grain  close to the production areas, where it will be at the disposal  of the Ministry of Trade.    The symposium's recommendations also proposed improving  current milling methods, examining methods of refining flour in  all mills, limiting use of very fine sieves in the first sieving  and grinding stages, deploying mobile maintenance workshops to  serve mills and bakeries in all parts of Iraq, paying greater  attention to the question of producing home-made bread,  encouraging the use of home gas ovens, and reducing waste as a  result of sieving flour at home.</p>

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Two checkouts for the price of one Supermarkets which want to speed up the movement of customers through the checkouts, and cut costs into the bargain, are being offered an automatic scanning system which enables one operator to serve two customers simultaneously without an increase in shoplifting. The systems, developed by Potrafke, of Hattingen, Germany, consist of two parallel conveyor lanes with a cashier seated in between. The customer places the goods on the belt and they pass through a perspex covered tunnel where they are scanned. A carousel, synchronised to the conveyor, then carries away the goods so that the shopper can pack them while the next customer is using the conveyor. Potrafke: Germany, 232421003; UK, 0532 323794.</p>

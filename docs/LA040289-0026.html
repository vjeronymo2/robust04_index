			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> ARTS AND CRAFTS FURNITURE  </P> <P> IN THE 1890's and into the first decades of the 20th Century, most American  furniture makers favored European models of the most elaborate kind. John Henry  Belter's laminated imitations of French Second Empire were wildly popular. But  from the vantage point of the 1980s, they're completely tasteless.  </P> <P> Far more appealing to the modern idea of spare and simple design is American  arts and crafts furniture (also known as Mission or Craftsman furniture). While  elaborate Victorian and imitation European furniture continued to be  manufactured in quantity during the last years of the 19th Century, arts and  crafts furniture began to achieve acceptance by the time of World War I. Its  simple design and craftsmanship, of course, was influenced by the European arts  and crafts movement.  </P> <P> In both Europe and the United States, this movement was a reaction against the  Industrial Revolution and everything it represented. In England, painters such  as William Morris and art critics such as John Ruskin encouraged handmade  products as a replacement for mass-produced fabrics, wallpaper and ceramics.  </P> <P> One talented American furniture designer who welcomed these theories was Gustav  Stickley of Syracuse, N.Y. The furniture he made was linear and unpretentious,  constructed by hand with local materials, usually oak: simple dining-room  sideboards, unadorned chairs, functional desks, all quite different from the  usual fussy Victorian furniture. Stickley's furniture imitated nothing, though  it turned out that he was much imitated by the big Grand Rapids manufacturers.  </P> <P> By 1901, Stickley's designs had come to the attention of two California  architects, the brothers Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene. In the  years to come they provided both the architecture and the interior design for  137 houses, of which 75 remain. Their work, though it had its own individual  genius, was heavily influenced by Stickley and the arts and crafts movement.  Their furniture was reserved for their architectural clients, but the  principles were the same: elegant form, exquisite craftsmanship, handwork and,  above all, simplicity of design.  </P> <P> Today authentic Stickley furniture is expensive and is likely to be found  mostly in the East and the Midwest, while Greene &amp; Greene furniture, made  primarily for specific houses and individual clients, is rare and even more  expensive. However, some pieces are available from time to time, and furniture  of the same general type was made by Peter and John Hall (who built most of the  Greene &amp; Greene furniture) and by Louis B. Easton and Harold Doolittle.  Such furniture is wonderfully evocative of early California and is rich with  the flavor of turn-of-the-century Pasadena and Berkeley.  </P> <P>  A good introduction to the arts and crafts movement, particularly as it  appeared in California, is to visit the Gamble House, designed inside and out  by Greene &amp; Greene. It is now a museum, located at 4 Westmoreland Place,  Pasadena. Some shops that specialize in arts and crafts furniture are Couturier  Gallery and Buddy's, both in Los Angeles, and Jack Moore Arts and Crafts,  James/Randell (reproductions), El Adobe (by appointment only), all in Pasadena.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPROVAL FOR COLLEGE PLAN SEEN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION APPEARS LIKELY TO LET A BAPTIST  BIBLE COLLEGE SELL LAND FOR A HOUSING PROJECT.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission appears ready to support a  Christian college's plan to rebuild its campus in San Dimas and sell much of  its land to a developer for construction of 114 homes.  </P> <P> The commission's four members indicated at a public hearing Thursday that they  will not heed the calls of neighboring residents to reduce the scope of a joint  venture by Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College and Century American Corp.  </P> <P> While the commissioners did not explicitly say how they will vote when the  matter returns to them Dec. 13, all four asked the college to return with only  one concession -- granting 9.5 acres of land for the county to add to the  adjoining Walnut Creek wilderness area.  </P> <P> The college had already promised to dedicate 70 acres of open space next to the  campus and proposed housing tract.  </P> <P> The Regional Planning Commission has discretion over the project because the  college's 150-acre campus is part of an island of unincorporated county  territory, although surrounded on all sides by the city of San Dimas.  </P> <P> The commission's recommendation will be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Construction plans call for a new Bible college campus on about 20 acres that  would replace the run-down buildings currently at the same location. Another 53  acres would be sold to Century American for construction of luxury homes, with  the college's remaining property granted to the county for open space.  </P> <P> The college plans to sell the land to the home builder to pay for construction  of the new campus.  </P> <P> The plan presented to the Regional Planning Commission last week was  essentially the same as the one neighbors protested at a hearing in late  September. The developer made one change -- reducing grading for an entry road  at the north end of the campus so that 75 fewer oak trees would be uprooted.  The original plan proposed removing 361 oaks, compared to 286 in the revision.  </P> <P> Several San Dimas residents told the commission Thursday that the new campus  and houses would destroy a wooded canyon area that is home to a variety of  wildlife. They asked the commission to recommend a reduction in the number of  homes or in the size of the campus, which will have a maximum enrollment of 500  students.  </P> <P> One neighbor suggested that Century American be allowed to build just 75 homes.  </P> <P> The homeowners received support from Jack L. Bath, a biology professor from Cal  Poly Pomona, who said county planners were guilty of "biological negligence"  because an environmental impact report did not consider potential damage to a  number of animals, including two bird species -- the burrowing owl and the  black-tailed gnatcatcher.  </P> <P> He also said the environmental report also did not assess the extent of "road  kill" -- the number of mammals that would be run over by the increased traffic  in Walnut Creek canyon. Nor was the impact of grading and removal of some  native plants on animals measured, Bath said.  </P> <P> Barry Cottle, a Century American executive, said the company has made an  extensive assessment of environmental impacts of construction and that the  dedication of nearly 80 acres of open space will be a significant contribution  to the ecology of the area.  </P> <P> He said the developer has already compromised, reducing earlier plans to build  as many as 182 homes.  </P> <P> Besides dedication of additional open space, Commissioner Clinton C. Ternstrom  said he will ask for assurances that sporting events, concerts and other  activities at the college will not disturb neighboring homeowners.  </P></p>

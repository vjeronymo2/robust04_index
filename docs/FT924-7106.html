			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Observer: Safe as houses The man from the Halifax has come up trumps. Congratulations to Gary Styles, senior economist at Britain's biggest building society, for winning Observer's 'forecasting the forecast' competition. Styles was the only entrant correctly to predict the Treasury's forecast of the two most important economic indicators: GDP growth for 1993 at 1 per cent and RPI at 3.25 per cent. He was not far off in predicting the current account deficit forecast at Pounds 13bn (actual forecast Pounds 15.5bn) - especially considering some Treasury watchers had the figure at Pounds 6.5bn. On consumer spending: Styles 0.5 per cent, Treasury guess 1.25 per cent. Nor were we concerned that Styles predicted a 1 per cent contraction in fixed investment (answers up to plus 5.2 per cent but correct number 0.25 per cent) and a slightly too toppy manufacturing output increase of 1.75 per cent (Treasury on 1 per cent). 'I've got to get something right this year,' chuckled Styles - whose own forecasts are 1.25 per cent for GDP and 4.5 per cent for RPI - on being told that he had won. The bad news is that he thinks the mortgage rate will be unchanged - at about 8.5 per cent - a year from now.</p>

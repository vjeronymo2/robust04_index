			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' CHOICE: SHOW YOUR TONGUE BY GUNTER GRASS (HARCOURT BRACE JOVANOVICH:  $34.95; 214 PP., ILLUSTRATE)  </P> <P> "The work startles both in its density of detail and in its overarching  anticipation of its own self-chosen task. The spectacle of Third World Poverty  -- its gaudy declaration of need -- is by now surely too familiar a Western  stereotype to generate any sense of novelty, but Grass' powerful meditation  explodes the stereotypical in order to address the nature of the cliches in  which he may be complicit."

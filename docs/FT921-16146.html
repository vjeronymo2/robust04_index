			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Association of International Bond Dealers officially changes it name On January 1, the Association of International Bond Dealers, which regulates secondary market activity in international securities, officially changed its name to the International Securities Market Association, writes Tracy Corrigan. The new name, chosen at the association's annual general meeting in Hong Kong last May, reflects the broadening of the group's membership in recent years. Established in 1969 as a Eurobond market trade association, the organisation now represents 900 institutions, including fund managers, brokers and dealers.</p>

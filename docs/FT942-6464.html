			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bond yields continued to ease last week, and are expected to fall further this week, ignoring the turbulence that has dominated US and European bond markets. Some observers are looking for Japanese 10-year bond yields to reach 3.5 per cent during the summer, compared with the current 3.73 per cent level, as domestic conditions remain favourable. Amid strong rumours in Japan that some short-term interest rates may soon be cut, economists say there is increasingly strong pressure being put on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy. They point to the favourable inflation outlook, sluggish monetary growth and non-existent bank lending. DKB International, part of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, said the authorities 'may wish to lower rates in order to divert funds from cash into the equity market as a recovery in the Nikkei could provide an important boost to confidence'. Bonds should be helped by a stable currency in the near term following the decision of the US and Japan to resume bilateral trade talks. Underlying confidence in the dollar appears fragile. Official data released last week indicated continuing weak consumer demand, with department store and supermarket sales down 3.5 per cent year on year.</p>

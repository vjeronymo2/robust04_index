			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata said Thursday [6 December] he has not yet been fully  informed of an agreement between the United States and North  Korea on the latter's acceptance of international inspections of  all seven of its declared nuclear facilities.    Hata was speaking to reporters after a morning cabinet  meeting in the wake of a senior U.S. official's remarks  Wednesday that North Korea has agreed to accept inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The foreign minister said he nevertheless hopes that the  U.S.-North Korean talks will result in Pyongyang's staying in  the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and accepting  inspections. Asked if progress on that score would lead to a  resumption of talks between Japan and North Korea on  normalization of diplomatic relations, Hata said he hopes that  will be the case.    U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis told reporters in  Washington on Wednesday of the agreement with North Korea.  Davis said the IAEA will be holding talks shortly with North  Korea to work out procedures to carry out inspections of the  seven declared nuclear sites.    The announcement capped seven months of secret negotiations  between Washington and Pyongyang over the nuclear inspection  issue.</p>

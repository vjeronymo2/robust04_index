			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERTILIZER COST FEELING EFFECT OF GULF CRISIS;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: SUPPLIERS ARE PASSING ALONG TO FARMERS THE HIGHER PRICES THEY MUST  PAY FOR NATURAL GAS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE PRODUCTION PROCESS.  </P> <P> The Persian Gulf crisis is inflating the cost of fertilizers farmers use to  help their crops grow, industry officials say.  </P> <P> Fertilizer costs are moving up because the Middle East provides much of the  natural gas that produces ammonia and urea, says Steven R. Beckley, general  manager of the California Fertilizer Assn.  </P> <P> Ammonia and urea are vital components of fertilizer because they are "the  building blocks for nitrogen products," Beckley explains.  </P> <P> So, with some Middle East sources of nitrogen-based fertilizers shut off and  others unstable at the moment, suppliers around the world have raised their  prices, Beckley adds. That includes ammonia fertilizers from Alaska and British  Columbia, where California dealers get their supplies.  </P> <P> Prices vary, but nitrogen fertilizers generally are up about 10%, says Bob  Krauter of the California Farm Bureau Federation.  </P> <P> Beckley says prices of phosphate fertilizers have also inched up because some  Middle East countries provide sulfuric acid used in phosphate rock, the  building block for those compounds.  </P> <P> Ammonia-based or nitrogen fertilizers keep plants green and make them grow  rapidly while phosphates give the roots strength, Beckley says.  </P> <P> California's fertilizer industry is tiny because the state doesn't have large  reserves of natural gas, Beckley adds. The only producer he knows of in the  state is a potash plant in the Trona area of San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Even though the state doesn't have the basic resources, Beckley thinks that its  sources of fertilizer are secure because they're largely domestic: phosphates  from Wyoming and Idaho, in addition to ammonia from Alaska.  </P> <P> California farmers haven't been hit too hard by higher fertilizer prices yet  because most crops have been in harvest the past few months.  </P> <P> "The concern will be what will happen now," the Farm Bureau's Krauter said. "If  the crisis does extend into next year, we'll be into the spring planting  season."  </P></p>

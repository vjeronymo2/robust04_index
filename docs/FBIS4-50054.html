			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Fang (0719 2397); Beijing XINHUA Domestic </F> Service in Chinese at 1513 GMT on 6 April transmits a new report  published in the 9 May China Daily Report on pages 61-62  entitled "Zou Jiahua Praises Jilin's Automobile Project"  replacing the following item]    [Text] Changchun, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- The 150,000-sedan  production line project of the Volkswagen company under the  First Automobile Group I/E Corporation -- China's largest modern  sedan manufacturing base -- has entered the last stage of  construction. The Jilin provincial party committee and the  provincial government recently held a mobilization meeting at  the corporation at which they declared the project has been  listed as the province's "priority project," and they pledged to  have it completed and put into operation by the end of this year.    The project, the construction of which started in 1991, is a  major project listed in the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan and is  currently the largest joint venture in the country's machinery  industry. Requiring an area of 218,000 square meters, the  project will have internationally first-class equipment. When  the first phase of the project is completed, the production line  will turn out 150,000 sedans a year. The total investment for  this project is 1.26 billion yuan. When the second phase of the  project is completed, the company will be able to turn out  300,000 sedans a year. When the entire project is completed,  the company will become China's largest modern sedan  manufacturing base turning out Jetta and Golf sedans.    After three years of hard work by 30 domestic and foreign  design and construction units which carried out design,  construction, installation, and production debugging  simultaneously, about 80 percent of the planned total investment  has been completed. A modern sedan production base with four  large buildings has taken shape. Adhering to the principle of  carrying out construction and production simultaneously while  striving to increase the rate of self-sufficiency in the  automobile industry, the Volkswagen company under the First  Automobile Group I/E Corporation organized the production of  sedans in 1992 by putting up a temporary production line. By  the end of last year, it had manufactured more than 20,000 Jetta  sedans for sale on the market. It also set up more than 100  special service facilities throughout the country.</p>

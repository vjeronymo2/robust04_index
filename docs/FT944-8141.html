			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Rolls-Royce pays Dollars 525m for US military engine maker Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday announced its largest ever acquisition, which aims to bolster its competitive position against stronger US rivals. The Dollars 525m (Pounds 336m) purchase of Allison Engine Company, a military engine supplier, will give Rolls-Royce a US manufacturing presence and expand its product range to cover half the western military market. The company said the deal, contingent on US regulatory approval, will be funded by a share issue. Analysts expect Rolls-Royce to make a rights issue raising more than Pounds 300m when the deal is completed next spring. Allison has a range of heavy military transport and small helicopter engines, creating almost no overlap with Rolls-Royce. In addition, the US company has just completed a Dollars 1.8bn product development programme, leaving Rolls-Royce in a position to use its global sales and marketing network to boost sales for four new Allison engines. The acquisition was seen by City observers as evidence that Rolls-Royce aims to expand independently, rather than through co-operation with its larger US competitors - General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney - as has been speculated. Allison, a General Motors subsidiary for 64 years, was sold to a Dollars 370m management buy-out in 1993, when an offer from Rolls-Royce was turned down. The workforce has since shrunk to 4,300, from 7,000 employees in 1991. Rolls-Royce employs about 4,200 people in North America, and there is some overlap in sales and marketing, and in research and development, where a restructuring could further cut costs. After spending Dollars 1.8bn to develop the new engines, Allison is expected to halve R&amp;D expenditure from Dollars 113m in 1993. This should bring it back to operating profits in 1994, after three years of heavy losses. Some analysts believe that the link with Rolls-Royce should increase the chances of a substantial order from the Royal Air Force for Lockheed's new generation Hercules. The C130J military transport aircraft is powered by Allison's new turboprop engine. About 30 per cent of Allison's revenues comes from its spares business, with 29,000 engines in service - more than Rolls-Royce. The company has tangible net assets of Dollars 210m, and is being acquired on a debt-free basis. Lex, Page 24 Base for long haul, Page 26 BAe may lose out in Hercules battle, Page 9</p>

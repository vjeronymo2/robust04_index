			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OAK PARK;  </P> <P> AUTHORITIES UNABLE TO IDENTIFY SKULL  </P> <P> Reconstruction art done by the Ventura County Sheriff Department's crime  laboratory of a skull found in Oak Park in July cannot give a positive  identification of the body, Assistant Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran  said.  </P> <P> The work was done in an attempt to reconstruct the appearance of the skull and  possibly link it to Jeanetta LaBelle, who is believed to have drowned in San  Antonio Creek during a flood in 1969.  </P> <P> "A drawing can't be good enough," O'Halloran said. "You can't just draw general  features of a skull and expect to positively identify the body." SCOTT LAWRENCE  </P></p>

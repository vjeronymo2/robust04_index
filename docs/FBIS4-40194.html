			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA-ITAR-TASS column: </F> "Beneficial to Foreign Companies"]    [Text] The question of the possible closure of the  Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Station has been discussed  increasingly often recently by the world community, not only at  an environmental and social level but also at a political level.    Circles close to the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic  Energy have stated that if such a step is taken it will have  primarily political overtones. In the opinion of the experts,  this will be beneficial first and foremost to the leading  foreign nuclear power generation companies.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic wins court ruling on cable TV service BELL ATLANTIC, the large east-coast telecommunications company, yesterday won an important legal victory which could make it the first US local telephone company offering cable television in its telephone service area. It said a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, had declared unconstitutional a provision in the 1984 Cable Act blocking telephone companies from providing cable programming in areas where they also provide a telephone service. US local telephone companies, which are keen to enter the potentially lucrative cable business, have lobbied Congress for years to have the ban removed. The cable industry, meanwhile, has insisted the provision was necessary to protect it from the monopolistic local telephone companies. The case, which seems likely to go to appeal, sets a significant legal precedent and may prompt other local telephone companies to mount cases in their parts of the country. Bell Atlantic, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bell' telephone companies spun off in the mid-1980s from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, filed suit last December in Alexandria against the US government agencies responsible for overseeing the 1984 Act. It wants initially to offer a cable television service to 60,000 customers in Alexandria, just across the Potomac River from Washington DC, using modern fibre optic technology. It would be in competition with existing cable operator, Jones Intercable. Bell Atlantic said the Alexandria court ruled the 1984 Act violated its rights to free speech under the First Amendment to the US constitution. The court had removed the ban in all seven states where the company provides a telephone service. The cable industry seems certain to appeal the ruling. The federal government could also object, although the executive branch has, in recent years, generally favoured breaking down the regulatory barriers separating various parts of the communications industry. Bell Atlantic also needs the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency overseeing the industry, for its specific plans to upgrade its network in Alexandria. It said it could be serving its first customers in the town some six to 12 months after FCC approval. Bell Atlantic has been one of the most aggressive local telephone companies in seeking to enter the cable television field.</p>

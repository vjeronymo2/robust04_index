			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TWO WHO WERE SAVED;  </P> <P> 'HERE IS SOMEONE WHO SURVIVED . . . '  </P> <P> Carol Goldmark has no memory of the early morning rush-hour traffic accident  five years ago that almost ended her life.  </P> <P> Goldmark, 46, a Buena Park painter, had been southbound on the Santa Ana  Freeway near the Magnolia off-ramp when she slammed into the car in front of  her.  </P> <P> She was airlifted to UCI Medical Center, where a team of trauma specialists  waited. She suffered eight broken ribs, a ruptured spleen and a collapsed lung,  and required nearly 50 pints of blood. She was told that twice she almost died.  </P> <P> What is vivid to Goldmark is the care and treatment she received and the  knowledge that had such treatment not been immediately available, she might not  have survived.  </P> <P> "The surgeon saved my kidney, my lung and my life several times over," she  said. "I had treatment around the clock and every specialist that was needed  was available."  </P> <P> Goldmark said she was "terribly upset" at news of the planned closing of the  trauma center at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.  </P> <P> "I called the hospital and asked if there was anyway I could speak out to let  people know that here is someone who survived, is healthy and here on this  earth today because of a trauma center."  </P></p>

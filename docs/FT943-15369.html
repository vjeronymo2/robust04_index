			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Fight to save Rosyth wins all-party support: Thatcher joins offensive against defence cuts Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, yesterday cautioned against further cuts in Britain's armed forces as unions joined MPs of all parties in pledging to fight moves to close the Rosyth naval base in Scotland. As fears mounted that Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will sound the base's death-knell next Thursday as part of a package of cuts, unions representing its 1,800 civilian employees promised a 'national outcry'. Meanwhile, Lord Younger, the Conservative former defence secretary, was among a group of prominent figures who published an open letter to Mr John Major, prime minister, in The Scotsman newspaper pleading for the base to be kept open. As Labour said it was still unconvinced of the need to close the base, the breadth of dismay at the expected move was underlined by Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North, who warned that the government's credibility was 'on the line'. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, in whose Dunfermline East constituency Rosyth lies, called for an urgent meeting with Mr Rifkind and Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. Lady Thatcher told an audience of top naval officers that Britain's armed forces were its greatest asset. 'May they continue to have the leadership, numbers and equipment so that they can serve with equal distinction in future,' she said. With the international scene 'increasingly uncertain', it was important to have not only what was immediately required in defence terms but also the reserves that could be called into action to meet the unexpected. Officials from the six unions representing Rosyth's workforce will today hold a 'council of war' to try to stave off the closure. Their plan includes a lobby of parliament by workers from the UK's naval bases and naval support establishments next Tuesday and publication on the following day of an open letter to Mr Major reminding him of government promises on both Rosyth and Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the TGWU general workers union, yesterday said Scottish Tory MPs 'should put constituents before career'. The Rosyth base is already being scaled down following a previous review in July 1991. It currently employs 1,800 civilian workers and about 4,000 naval personnel on land and sea, many of whom are accompanied by their families. The base overlaps but is distinct from the Rosyth naval dockyard whose future was guaranteed by the government last June until 2005.</p>

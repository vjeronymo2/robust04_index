			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / People: Arriving before the milk float Dairy Crest, the food-processing arm of the Milk Marketing Board, has appointed a new finance director to steer the company through its flotation next February and its new role in a free milk market. David Harding joins the company's board on October 11 from his current position as deputy finance director of the TI engineering group. A former civil servant at the Treasury, the 46-year-old Harding has worked for TI Group for the past 13 years; he has held a number of positions including head of corporate development and managing director of the company's smaller business division. He joins the cut-throat dairy industry at a time of rapid change which has seen the abolition of the government's compulsory purchasing scheme for milk and the introduction of a free market next April - in which Dairy Crest will have to compete for milk supplies. It is implementing widespread changes in corporate culture before flotation. The company's careful selection of Harding reflects the fact that he has experienced a similar change in corporate culture at TI - the group has undergone a huge re-organisation in the past 10 years. Indeed, Harding wrote an analysis of the process of corporate change which has since become a discussion paper at Harvard Business School in the US. Harding is an economics graduate and also worked for IMI before joining TI in 1980. He replaces David Lewis at Dairy Crest who will retire in a few months.</p>

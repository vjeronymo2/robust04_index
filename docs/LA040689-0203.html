			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BIG RETAILERS REPORT MIXED MARCH SALES; SEARS POSTS 11.9% INCREASE  </P> <P> The nation's big retailers today reported mixed March sales, with giant Sears,  which introduced a new competitive pricing policy during the month, posting an  11.9% increase from the same period a year ago.  </P> <P> March sales suffered somewhat because Easter occurred earlier this year than in  1988. The holiday meant that doors were closed at general merchandisers and  clothing retailers.  </P> <P> Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears Merchandise Group,  said March sales surpassed expectations and benefited from the aggressive  promotion of the pricing program. Sales totaled $2.97 billion, up from $2.66  billion.  </P> <P> K mart, the second-largest U.S. retailer, said sales in the five weeks ended  March 29 totaled $2.42 billion, up 2.5% from $2.36 billion a year earlier. J.  C. Penney Co. Inc. said sales amounted to $1.233 billion in the five weeks to  April 1, up 0.7% from $1.225 billion a year earlier.  </P></p>

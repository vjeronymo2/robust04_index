			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Lupynis, head of the political </F> department of the Ukrainian National Assembly, by Lyubomyra  Blazhko; place and date not given: "If Only They Were Held..."]    [Excerpts] Our interlocutor is Anatoliy Lupynis, poet from  Kiev. Some time ago, for his nationalist convictions, he had  the good fortune to be imprisoned by our democratic authorities;  he was also subject to repression by the communists. Today, he  is head of the political department of the Ukrainian National  Assembly [UNA]. He has never put forward his candidacy for a  people's deputy seat, because he thinks the soviets are still  soviets.    [Blazhko] Mr. Lupynis, how can you explain the present  government's repressions against the Ukrainian National  Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense [UNA-UNSO]?    [Lupynis] It happened due to the fact that Ukraine has  already lost 99 percent of its gains in the referendum held on 1  December 1992.    The attack on UNA develops at the time when nuclear weapons  are being transferred, our territory is being given up, and our  highest state leadership has testified to its full incapability  of opposing pressure from world imperial circles. In such a  situation, all political organizations involved in ruling  structures are participating in the process of Ukraine's  surrender. All of them are engaged in sucking Ukraine's blood;  during the past two years, a significant part of our national  wealth has been transferred abroad, while not a cent has been  received in return. Under such circumstances, the only force  capable of resisting this is the UNA-UNSO. It is the only  organization which has a mechanism for combating profiteering,  firmly opposes the surrendering of our state, and is ready to  stand to the last to prevent such developments.    I say "the only organization" not because of my alignment to  it. Today, power is exercised jointly by traitors and thieves;  today's power is an association of these two categories of  criminals.    The UNA, which emerged as a nationalist organization and  adheres to the principles of Ukrainian revolutionary  nationalism, has come to the conclusion that, given the current  circumstances, it would have been wrong to neglect social  problems and break away with real processes in Ukraine.  Therefore, UNA works for both forming national forces and  uniting all social groups which are interested in true nation  building, production, and the creation of normal living  conditions for our people.    Today, Ukrainian society is divided into two groups uneven  in  both number and profit. The former is a group in power, which  knows that its time will soon be over; therefore, it tries to  sell abroad everything and reap as much as possible,  transferring profits to accounts abroad. If a catastrophe were  to happen in Ukraine, they would be cozily reading Ukrainian  news somewhere in Miami. The latter includes all those who are  interested in producing goods, establishing order, and building  a real state. The Assembly aims at uniting all forces that are  interested in producing goods, building the state, and creating  a real defensive capacity, that is, at uniting all productive  forces to abolish the power of profiteers. [passage omitted]    [Blazhko] The people do not believe anybody by now. Can you  guarantee that the UNA will not betray the people?    [Lupynis] The UNA will not betray the people, because we are  not democrats -- we are not playing this hypocritical game. We  assess reality soberly and adequately. We are not going to fool  the people with any law-governed states. I think that only an  infantile man or a deliberate political charlatan can discuss  democracy in this Mongolian and Bolshevik country. By all  appearances, it will take several generations to install  democracy here. Nobody has ever built a democratic society and  law-governed state. Democracy is a state of society, which is  attained as a result of the long-term establishment of moral,  religious, ethical, and legal norms. [passage omitted]</p>

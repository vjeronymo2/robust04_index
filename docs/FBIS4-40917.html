			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius June 20 TASS -- Speaker of the Lithuanian  parliament Ceslovas Jursenas called attempts by the right-wing  party "Union of Fatherland" (Lithuanian Conservatives) to  organise a referendum on economic issues as "efforts to  undermine the state's foundations".    The party led by Vytautas Landsbergis and Giadiminos  Vagnorius demands that the main item of the poll should be a  100-time indexation of people's deposits at savings banks, the  speaker said at a news conference on Monday which was broadcast  by national radio.    He did not accept last Friday signatures of 413,110  Lithuanians in support of a referendum, which were collected by  a sponsoring group of conservatives.    Explaining reasons for his move, Jursenas said that "the old  law is still in force. It lays down that such signatures should  be handed over to the presidium of the Lithuanian parliament, an  institution which is not provided for in the new constitution".    Besides, sheets with signatures, hence the will of people,  were not formalised with the final act, as it is provided for by  the previous law. Therefore, he had no powers from parliament  to receive 43 volumes of signatures.    On the other hand, amendments to the law on referendum,  which  were adopted by parliament recently, were not approved by the  Lithuanian president, which was well known to the sponsoring  group. The legislature is to solve this "legal problem" on  Tuesday.    Leader of Lithuanian Conservatives Vytautas Landsbergis who  also held a news conference on Monday, described the speaker's  actions as "a demonstration of disrespect for the will of nearly  500,000 Lithuanian voters and a desire to win time".</p>

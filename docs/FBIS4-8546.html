			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Plawnicki, general secretary of the </F> Christian Social Union, by Wieslaw Marnic; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Marnic] Christians in alliance with communists?  We have not had that before. So what does it mean?    [Plawnicki] I have always believed that GAZETA ROBOTNICZA is  a trustworthy and credible newspaper that does not yield easily  to fashion or public mood shifts. But you seem to want to make  me change this opinion.    [Marnic] Not at all.    [Plawnicki] So why do you use terms that are surely closer  to the outlook taken by GAZETA POLSKA rather than GAZETA  ROBOTNICZA? After all, to define the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] as postcommunist is to engage in a blatant falsehood. In  addition, our alliance involves mostly Social Democracy of the  Polish Republic [SdRP]. Let us then move away from using  derogatory terms--although there are some who will not like the  idea of an accord between Christians and Social Democrats--and  toward specific facts.    On 7 March, we signed an interparty agreement between the  Wroclaw SdRP office and our division of the Christian Social  Union [UChS] here. Similar agreements were also signed in Lodz  and Bialystok.    [Marnic] What are the provisions of these agreements?    [Plawnicki] As regards organizational issues, they will  involve mutual contacts, exchange of information, and support.  As far as practical operations are concerned, we intend to give  support to each other's candidates in the forthcoming local  self-government elections.    [Marnic] Does this mean that the UChS will enter the  structure of the Democratic Left Alliance?    [Plawnicki] It does. The present left-wing group is  different from the previous one in that it is not oriented  toward orthodoxy. This change in its nature enables us to find  a place for ourselves within the SLD. This is because,  fortunately, the left-wing camp is made up of people with a  fairly wide spectrum of political outlooks who are brought  together by their propublic interest orientation.    [Marnic] I understand that the UChS will take advantage of  relying on the highly organized SLD structures, but how will the  Left benefit in its turn?    [Plawnicki] It will expand its sphere of influence to  include a whole range of people associated with the UChS. You  cannot fail to notice that even Pope John Paul II spoke of the  grain of good present in the system of real socialism. We do  not engage in wholesale condemnations of everything and anything  whose roots reach back to the Polish People's Republic. We also  have a group of people who enjoy a high degree of authority in  the eyes of the public. They can turn out to meet the needs of  our society.    [Marnic] I understand that you are referring to the  forthcoming local self-government elections?    [Plawnicki] We will run in them within the SLD bloc. We  intend to nominate four candidates in Wroclaw and one each in  Trzebnica, Olesnica, and Olawa. Our candidates will be such  people as Jerzy Janoszka, chairman of the Well-Wishers' Club,  and Tadeusz Pluzinski, director of the Value Energy Fund.    [Marnic] Under what election slogans will they fight for  their nominations?    [Plawnicki] Tolerance, respect for differences, and  antinationalism. We want to fashion a climate of tolerance and  acceptance of people who have different views, backgrounds, or  traditions. Our fundamental motto is respect for every human  person.    [Marnic] And what will your candidates oppose?    [Plawnicki] They will stand against the misuse of Christian  ideas for the purpose of sowing hatred and xenophobia, and  against selective interpretation of the Holy Father's words.  Christianity entails the concept of serving others, not  fighting them. Our candidates want to make use of their talents  to serve society, and the choice of the SLD as allies is a  natural consequence of the fact that, of all political groups,  it was the SLD whose program is most society-oriented.    [Marnic] Thank you for talking with us.</p>

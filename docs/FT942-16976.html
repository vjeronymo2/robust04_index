			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: City Centre up 15% as customers increase An increase in customers helped City Centre Restaurants, which owns the Deep Pan Pizza and Garfunkels chains, lift profits for 1993 by almost 15 per cent. The pre-tax line rose from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12.6m on the back of a 6 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 95.2m (Pounds 89.6m). Mr Bruce Johnston, chairman, said that covers had risen by 5 per cent in the final quarter, with the week between Christmas and the new year particularly strong. However, the average spend per customer remained flat. London had been buoyant in the first part of this year, he said. More than 40 per cent of the group's 165 restaurants are within the M25 motorway. Mr Johnston said he hoped that this week's tax increases would not dampen the improvement once people opened their pay packets at the end of the month. The group opened eight new branches during the year, and now has 99 Deep Pan Pizza restaurants and 47 Garfunkels. It is planning to open at least 10 more this year. The main focus would continue to be the pizza chain, where the average spend is Pounds 5 a head. Outlets were now being sought at out-of-town cinema and leisure complexes where people could park without being clamped, Mr Johnston said. In order to benefit from the growing consumer interest in ethnic foods, the group is aiming to increase the rate of openings at its 10-strong chain of Chiquito Mexican restaurants. It is also planning further Caffe Uno pasta restaurants after successfully converting two of its outlets last year. Capital expenditure for 1993 totalled Pounds 8.2m. The group ended the year with net cash up from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 14m; net interest receivable was Pounds 672,000 (Pounds 574,000). Earnings per share rose from 3.99p to 4.52p. A final dividend of 1.33p is proposed, lifting the total for the year from 1.57p to 1.78p. Mr Phillip Kaye, the founder of the group who retired as chief executive last October, is retiring as an executive director on June 30, but will continue as a non-executive director.</p>

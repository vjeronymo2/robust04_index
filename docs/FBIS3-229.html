			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Durao Barroso is in South Africa.  He will meet the Portuguese community at a time of great  uncertainty in the country. The Portuguese are concerned about  the political changes. Maria de Lurdes Torcato was at the  airport when the minister arrived.    [Begin recording] [Torcato] Durao Barroso is going to Cape  Town where he is to meet President de Klerk. Tomorrow he is  expected to meet Nelson Mandela at home in Johannesburg at 0730.  He is also to meet the President of PAC, the leader of the  Conservative Party, and General Viljoen of the Afrikaner  National Front. Durao Barroso's arrival coincided with the  registration of the Luso African Party, Lusap, which hopes to  obtain the votes of the Portuguese community and to elect at  least one MP, at the national or regional level, who will  represent the interests of this important linguistic minority in  South Africa. Durao Barroso spoke about the new party.    [Barroso] Obviously, I cannot and will not, as a  representative of the Portuguese people, comment on matters of a  party political nature. It is up to the Portuguese residing  here, those who have he right to vote -- many can now vote  because they have been here for over five years -- to make their  choice conscienciously and freely. I will not in any way say  what they should do. They are adults with the ability to  discern, with full use of their rights, to make the choices  which they believe to be the best for themselves and their  families. However, I can make a general recommendation, in the  name of the Portuguese government, and that is that they  participate, participate in the transition process, that they do  not exclude themselves, and that they never set up a ghetto.  This would be in my opinion very negative. For the Portuguese  set themselves up in a, shall we say, ghetto of the political  system, or to decline to participate...[pauses] it is important  for them to be associated to the transition at the moment. It  is important to feel really integrated and that the South  African society recognizes them also as active members in this  transition and in this society. But as for their political  choices, it is not up to me to comment.    [Torcato] Tomorrow Durao Barroso will open the conference on  the transition to democracy and regional cooperation, organized  by the South African Institute for External Relations.

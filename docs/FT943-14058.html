			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Tories improve party finances The Conservative party achieved an operating surplus of more than Pounds 2m  -the largest in its history - according to the party's report and accounts published yesterday. But the balance sheet shows the Tories still have a bank overdraft of Pounds 15.82m. Sir Norman Fowler, the party's out-going chairman, was upbeat about the turnaround of a net operating deficit last year of Pounds 2.19m to a surplus of Pounds 2.06m. He said: 'The most encouraging feature of the year has been the recovery in the finances of the party. After three successive years of deficits of around Pounds 5m, the position was improved in 1992-93 when losses were more than halved. Now in 1993-94 we have achieved a surplus of more than Pounds 2m. 'This represents the largest surplus in the party's history - a vital and encouraging first step towards the elimination of the still substantial overall deficit.'</p>

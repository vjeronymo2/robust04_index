			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the single market: Europe Today - AC Milan AC Milan, seen in the stripes entering the San Siro stadium with opponents Ancona, is an international team.  It has signed six foreigners - from the Netherlands, France, Croatia and Serbia - even though it is allowed to field only three in competitive fixtures. According to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who controls the club: 'Restrictions affecting the hiring of talent outside home nations are outdated and should be dropped.  More should be done to organise Europe-wide tournaments in which the best teams would compete against one another regularly.' This would help Milan to exploit its far-flung fan club, which has 1,460 branches all over the world: six in Belgium, five in Australia and four each in Russia and Venezuela.  The network extends to Iraq, Indonesia and the US.</p>

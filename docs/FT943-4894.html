			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Spain seeks liberal moves by Cubans The Spanish government hopes that Mr Roberto Robana, Cuba's foreign minister, will announce a set of deregulation measures for the domestic economy during a six-day visit to Spain from today. Officials are hoping that, in what would be a significant shift towards a market economy in Cuba, the minister will give a timetable for the removal of curbs on self-employment in Cuba, with an undertaking to close state-owned industries which are no longer viable. Failure by Mr Robana to do so could prompt Madrid to rethink its open-door policy towards Cuba. Employment deregulation is one of several policies that has been pressed on the Cuban government by Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spanish former finance minister, who has visited Havana twice in the past year after an agreement by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, to provide President Fidel Castro with a senior economic counsellor. Mr Solchaga, whose representatives have held working sessions in Havana between his trips, has consistently told the Cubans that their critical financial troubles owe far more to their state-controlled economy than to the US economic embargo, which Spain has always opposed. When it set up Mr Solchaga's mission, Madrid believed a comprehensive package of economic reforms in Cuba would lead to a transition to political pluralism. Cuba is the main recipient of Spanish aid in Latin America, in direct subsidies and export credits. Recent Spanish investment, chiefly in tourism, is estimated at some Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m). Even so, the former minister's recommendations have been largely ignored and the Spanish government, wary of accusations that it is legitimising Mr Castro's government, now wants to relinquish its advisory role in favour of a panel of experts from the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, who met Mr Castro in early August and will hold talks with Mr Robana today, has hardened Spain's diplomatic language, saying that economic liberalisation alone is insufficient and the Cuban government must take 'urgent' and 'rapid' steps towards democracy. Reuter adds in London: The UK government, welcoming recent changes in the Cuban economy, said yesterday it was sending a minister to Havana for the first time in 19 years. Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, will make a three-day visit to the island from Monday, with a group of British businessmen, in an attempt to increase UK-Cuban trade.</p>

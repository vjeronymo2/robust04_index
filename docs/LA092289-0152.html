			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trading places: The presidents of Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino  Bank in Anaheim have switched jobs. Robert Ucciferri moved to Citizens after  about nine months as head of El Camino, while Richard Helstrom, recently hired  as president of Citizens, moved to El Camino. Ucciferri, who had been an  executive at Citizens for 10 years, said he left late last year to take over at  El Camino because he wanted to run a bank. When the president's post opened in  July, Ucciferri asked to return. Helstrom was hired at Citizens but was willing  to go instead to El Camino, Simpson said. Both banks are owned by Citizens  Holdings.  </P></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Bonn accepts return of its toxic waste GERMANY has agreed to re-import some 420 tonnes of toxic waste, including leaking barrels of chemicals, pesticides, paints and varnishes, illegally exported to Romania from both east and west Germany in recent years, writes Quentin Peel. The plan follows a campaign by Greenpeace, the environmental action group, which threatened to bring the waste back to Bonn itself and dump it in the German capital. The operation, which involves decanting the waste into new containers and shipping it back to Germany in a special goods train, will start this week, Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, announced yesterday. It will cost DM3.3m (Dollars 1.98m) of taxpayers' money, the minister said. However he promised to pursue the illegal exporters to pay compensation. The waste is dumped in and near the town of Sibiu, in central Romania, where many of the containers have corroded, or broken open in the frost, and started leaking their contents, according to Greenpeace. Mr Topfer yesterday praised the action group for its campaign, and promised that the waste would now be disposed of inside Germany. He said that most of it came from the former East Germany, mainly from the Bitterfeld chemical industry complex in Saxony-Anhalt, but some also came from western enterprises.</p>

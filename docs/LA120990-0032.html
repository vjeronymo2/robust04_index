			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'STRETCHING' ON FILM  </P> <P> If all actors let their "star" persona limit them, we would have missed out on  great performances such as Harrison Ford's in "Witness" and Mary Tyler Moore's  in "Ordinary People."  </P> <P> When star actors are discouraged from taking risks, many unfortunately resort  to roles that are far beneath them.  </P> <P> What if all artists' careers were controlled by their fame? Picasso would have  stayed in his blue period and the Beatles would have been fun-lovin' mop-tops  who never gave us "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."  </P> <P> Incidentally, I'm sorry I never got to see Bogie as Macbeth.  </P> <P> MOLLY RINGWALD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

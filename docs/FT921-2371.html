			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / More buyers of PCs avoid dealer networks PERSONAL computers are being sold increasingly through 'direct' channels rather than distributors, dealers or other third parties. The trend in the UK mirrors developments in the US where mail order, catalogue selling and telesales are playing an increasing part in the distribution of PCs. According to Romtec, a Berkshire-based marketing consultancy, direct sales of PCs in the UK have almost doubled from 12 per cent of sales in 1990 to 23 per cent last year. Sales through the indirect route are static. Romtec expects the direct-sales boom to continue, with direct channels accounting for 34 per cent of PC sales this year and 42 per cent in 1994. Direct channels include the traditional sales technique involving manufacturers' sales forces as well as mail order and telesales methods not usually associated with high-technology products. Two thirds of customers contacted by Romtec cited price as the reason for buying direct. With prices of personal computers falling each year, manufacturers are seeking more efficient methods of distribution as profit margins narrow. The leading manufacturers selling directly last year were Elonex, Opus Technology, ICL and Dell Computer, which pioneered mail-order sales in the US. The total UK PC market is expected to grow by 12 per cent in volume this year, but indirect sales are expected to fall by 4 per cent. Computer superstores, Page 16</p>

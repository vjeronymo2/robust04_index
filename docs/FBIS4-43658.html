			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe's Unchosen One"] </F>   [Text] The top job in the world's greatest democratic  grouping is up for grabs this week. It matters who gets it. It  matters what they think and how they all lead. But -- save for  some prospective lathering by Norman Lamont and the Tory Right  -- there is no discussion of the contenders and no hint of  democracy in the process of selection. This time next week,  after the Corfu summit, Europe will probably have a new  Commission President, the heir to Jacques Delors. That ought to  be important. Mr Delors is a deeply significant figure --  departing, with luck, to add a drama to the French presidential  race. But though the disillusioned voters may choose the MEPs  [members of European Parliament], if they can be bothered, they  have no say over the Commission or its president. A stitch-up as  usual, to baroque conventions. Delors was a Socialist from a  big country: custom and practice demand that he is succeeded by  a sort of conservative from a small country.    Two men are first out of the frame: Ruud Lubbers, lately  prime minister of the Netherlands, and Jean-Luc Dehaene, present  prime minister of Belgium. A year ago, all the betting was on  Lubbers, but he has fallen out with Chancellor Kohl, up whose  capacious waistcoat most of the wheeling and dealing takes  place. Kohl and soon departing Francois Mitterrand have thus  settled for Dehaene, a capable, rather grey political operator.  This can all be portrayed -- see those Tory latherings -- in  terms of manic or less manic attachment to the European federal  project. That's probably unfair to Dehaene, an expert on  integration rather than a zealot. But it does not begin to  address the fears and hopes of the people of Europe, as  expressed seven days ago through the ballot box.    Corfu will be horse-trading as usual. The British and the  Greeks will back Sir Leon Brittan for a while; and so probably  will the Italians, until gradually the offers of other jobs --  like the Secretary Generalship of Nato -- and sundry favours  gradually dissolve the blocs. (Sir Leon is a heavyweight in  line for the big foreign affairs portfolio next time; his  trouble is that he's John Major's candidate.) So only if the  council is irredeemably split between Lubbers and Dehaene will  the ranks of the undeclared but available begin to be talked  about. We hope that happens, because the best second choice may  actually be the best first choice: Peter Sutherland from  Ireland, whose mastery of the Gatt free trade ship steered it  safely into port. Sutherland is more international civil  servant than politician to be sure -- but he has the grasp and  the personality to give the Commission an identity which  explains and persuades rather than retreats behind closed doors.    But how can a voter -- or a newspaper -- affect any of these  developments? The bargaining will be secret and frenetic. No  leader in Corfu will have a remotely democratic mandate. The  old pie, with plums for the taking, is being cooked up as usual.  And, shortly thereafter, we'll be treated to all the usual  stuff about unelected Brussels bureaucrats. So be clear as the  storm starts to break. The bureaucrats are unelected because  that's the way national governments want it. Even the chief  bureaucrat -- who is much more than that -- emerges in ways that  would make the next Pope weep in shame. Jacques Delors, a  testimony to his reign, has made the presidency too crucial to  be carved around in this fashion any longer. If the European  project is losing touch with the people of Europe, who on earth  can wonder at that?</p>

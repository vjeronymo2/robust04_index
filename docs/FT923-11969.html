			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Personal View: Snare of the Hunter Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, has gained massive press attention by opposing the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) on the grounds that it is too expensive and complex for Germany's future needs. Germany has refused to commit funds for the production stage and Mr Ruhe has called for a lighter and cheaper aircraft to be developed. He has seemingly calculated that his personal popularity and ambitions to be chancellor will be boosted. However, he has also shown signs either of understanding little of the complexities, realities and inflexibilities of defence procurement, or of having a hidden agenda involving a political preference for a French or US aircraft. Significantly, some considerations indicate that his initiative could backfire and that EFA could seriously damage his career. The worst thing for Mr Ruhe would be for the three other partners (Britain, Italy and Spain) to press on with the project, complete development and go into production. Germany would be obliged to complete its share of development at a cost of at least a further Pounds 1bn. Although the German obligation is technically not legal, since it is based on a memorandum of understanding rather than a treaty, it is almost unthinkable that Germany could abandon its commitment unilaterally. German credibility in all fields would be damaged. In addition, Germany would be obliged to hand over, without payment, the technology involved so the remaining partners could manufacture the aircraft themselves. The partners could decide to contract some production to German companies, if price gains could be won, but there would be no guarantees of work for Germany which would then have spent more than Pounds 2bn to subsidise someone else's aircraft while leaving its own combat aircraft industry, built up since the 1950s, in disarray. Could any politician survive such an abuse of his country's resources and interests? By 1997, as Mr Ruhe accepts, Germany will need to order a replacement for its F-4 Phantoms and, given the aircraft available from the US, France and Russia, EFA seems likely to offer the best value for money. Both the Luftwaffe and a German parliamentary committee have compared EFA with its potential rivals: the Luftwaffe has always found in EFA's favour and the parliamentary committee has not recommended an alternative. Crucial elements in all this are the agreements in the 1980s establishing the EFA programme. They were meant to give the four governments collectively the opportunity to stop the programme at any of a series of stages if they felt it was going out of control, particularly in financial terms. But they were also designed to discourage a country from damaging the project by withdrawing unilaterally in the middle of a stage, as Mr Ruhe would like to do. This is why Mr Ruhe has not said firmly that Germany is withdrawing and he has argued for an alternative collaborative project to replace EFA. However, it is almost impossible to see how a new aircraft could be cheaper since Pounds 4bn or so has already been committed. While Mr Ruhe may argue politically for a lighter, cheaper aircraft, few in the German air force or industry agree with him. Thus he will find it hard to produce hard technical arguments to reinforce his case. For instance, a lighter aircraft would not need the two EJ200 engines developed for EFA while a single EJ200 would not be adequate for other than a very light combat aircraft. A new, larger engine would therefore be needed. A new airframe would require a different fly-by-wire control system as well as further expensive tests. Moreover, the controlled technological ambitions of EFA have helped its development costs to stay within budget. In contrast, the latest US fighter development programme, the F-22, incorporates expensive 'stealth' and supersonic cruise technologies. Of course, EFA is far from safe because both Italy and Spain have financial problems and the UK chancellor is believed to have some reservations about this project. In this situation, there is merit in the UK's approach of continuing to talk to Germany and pressing industry to bring down further the acquisition price and life cycle maintenance costs. Further savings would be possible by cutting the number of planned assembly lines from four to two. As such considerations are brought home in the coming months, Mr Ruhe may appreciate a chance to pretend he has negotiated a new aircraft. Technically, given that the airframe, engine and fly-by-wire controls cannot be easily changed, a lower specification for the avionics would be the obvious way to symbolise that Germany was going to buy a less capable aircraft than it had planned during the cold war. Mr Ruhe will also want a new name for the Jager 90, as EFA is called in Germany. Something less aggressive than Hunter 90 would be helpful.

The two finally gave themselves  up to the Djibouti authorities after releasing the 113 people on  board the plane, it was learned from airport sources.    The plane, which was operating a flight between Bahr Dar  (western Ethiopia) and Addis Ababa, landed at Djibouti  International Airport around 1545, where after nearly four hours  of negotiations the 105 passengers and eight crew members were  released. The hijackers, who are said to be Ethiopians of  Amhara origin, agreed to release their hostages and surrender  after they were assured of being given political asylum, it was  learned from reliable sources.    The negotiations were led on the Djibouti side by Interior  Minister Harbi Farah Idris and Transport Minister Ahmed Waberi  in the presence of the Red Cross representative in Djibouti.  The Ethiopian ambassador to Djibouti also closely followed the  negotiations at the airport, the same sources said. The media  was kept out of the meeting and the Djibouti authorities  maintained a total blackout on the affair until it ended. The  plane was expected to leave the Djibouti airport around 2100 for  Addis Ababa with all the 113 passengers and crew members.</p>

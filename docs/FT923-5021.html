			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Nothing will come of nothing, think again: The British government's target of zero inflation within the ERM is undesirable and unattainable Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism at a sterling parity of DM2.95 looks increasingly threatened. The prime minster's commitment to a target of zero inflation is supposed to make this policy more secure. In fact, it makes it look less credible. Mr John Major has rightly identified Britain's inflationary psychology as a root cause of the current economic malaise. The government's priority is to avoid a repeat of the boom-bust cycles that have plagued the UK for decades. Yet the new policy of pursuing zero inflation to break this cycle through high interest rates within the ERM will not solve the underlying inflationary problem. It is merely compounding the damage caused by the current recession. The failure of the economy to grow results in large part from a series of errors in monetary management since the 1960s. As a result, repeated periods of high inflation have encouraged consumers to borrow excessively to buy houses and consumer durables. The subsequent collapse in house prices has left them burdened with debts which they are struggling to service at current high interest rates. Even if consumers were not burdened by debt, the case for pursuing zero inflation through persistently high interest rates would be weak. Even the most successful low inflation countries such as Germany target an inflation rate of 2-3 per cent. Those countries which have attempted to achieve that target, most recently New Zealand and Canada, have paid a high price in lost output in pursuit of a goal which has remained elusive. Now is a particularly bad time for the UK to pursue zero inflation. Britain needs a period of low or even negative real interest rates to ease the pressure on indebted consumers. But the fall in underlying inflation over the past year, combined with high nominal interest rates, has already pushed short-term real interest rates to their highest level at this point in the economic cycle since the 1930s. The nearer the rate of inflation comes to zero, the higher real interest rates will become. This can only compound the pain in the housing market and delay a consumer-led recovery. Merely sticking to the current exchange rate target within the ERM and announcing a target of zero inflation is the wrong way to secure the low and stable inflation that Britain needs. The costs are prohibitively high and the gains may well prove illusory. First the pain. The cost of reaching zero inflation in the UK would be enormous. Despite the government's labour market reforms in the 1980s there has been no reduction in the amount of unemployment required to reduce inflation. Estimates from 1980-81 suggest that every 1 percentage point fall in inflation required 2.3 percentage points more unemployment over one year, much higher than in most other OECD countries. Reducing the annual rate of underlying price inflation from its current 4.4 per cent to zero would, according to this relationship, require an extra 10 percentage points of unemployment - either 3m more unemployed in 1993 or an extra 1m more unemployed a year from now until the middle of 1995. Yet, unless this inflation rate could be secured once it had been attained, such sacrifices would have been in vain. The government's last attempt to conquer inflation in the early 1980s, and the subsequent failure of employers and workers to control Britain's problem of excessive real wage growth, bequeathed a manufacturing sector that is leaner and more competitive, but too small to finance Britain's desire for imported goods. It also bequeathed a large and growing pool of unskilled, unemployed and increasingly unemployable people. Are the mistakes of the 1980s about to be repeated? The structural problems which underlie inflationary tendencies - inefficiencies in the housing and labour markets and the flawed way in which UK monetary policy has been made  -may currently be suppressed. But they still exist. The government's failure to tackle the underlying causes of the inflation of the past two decades means that any recovery risks being derailed by inflation once more. The government says it wants low inflation, but it also wants house prices to start rising and has been unwilling to eliminate the main tax incentives that favour housing investment. The labour market also remains as inflation-prone as 10 years ago. In the late-1980s, despite record unemployment rates, price inflation was once again fuelled by an acceleration of wage increases. Earnings inflation has started to fall only after two years of recession and rising job losses. Despite the fall in pay settlements, it may take a decade of slow growth and high unemployment to work off the lost competitiveness of the past 10 years, at least at the current exchange rate within the ERM. Real wage growth in the 1980s outstripped that in all of the UK's main competitors, despite the government's labour market reforms. The signs of an overvalued real exchange rate are clear: manufacturing profitability, even after the productivity gains of the past decade, remains low by international standards. Britain is left with a trade deficit at the bottom of the recession. Most worrying, politicians remain in control of Britain's monetary policy. This is still so despite the international evidence that independent central banks have delivered lower inflation rates over the past 40 years. The link running from low inflation to higher or more stable economic growth does not exist, as the chart shows. But if a government is serious about delivering low inflation, it will cede monetary policy autonomy to an independent institution. Yet Mr Major, like his predecessors, has been unwilling to give up the levers of monetary power to the Bank of England. He has been willing to allow the independent Bundesbank to set UK interest rates on his behalf. But the credibility of this policy rests solely on the government's willingness to remain in the ERM and resist a devaluation. History suggests that devaluation is the most likely escape route from slow growth and rising trade and fiscal deficits. There is no good reason why the markets should trust Mr Major more than any other politician of the postwar period. Indeed, the costs of attaining zero inflation make the policy even less credible than in the past. The markets know that the government will not be able to endure high interest rates, sluggish growth and rising unemployment for years rather than months. But that is the implication of the government's current policy. The markets also know that the result of a devaluation, without deeper structural reform, is likely to be renewed inflation. The commitment to zero inflation is either disingenuous or will prove so destabilising as to be unsustainable.</p>

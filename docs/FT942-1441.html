			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / SFO wins test case on silence clause The Serious Fraud Office yesterday won a test case over its powers to remove a suspect's right to silence, John Mason writes. Giving judgment after a judicial review, two High Court judges ruled that Mr Larry Trachtenberg, one of six men charged over the Maxwell affair, had no reasonable excuse when he refused to answer the SFO's questions during a 'section 2' interview. Under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 suspects are obliged to answer questions put to them by SFO investigators unless they have a reasonable excuse. After his arrest in June 1992 Mr Trachtenberg, a former adviser to Robert Maxwell, refused to answer questions and was charged with a breach of section 2. In February last year a stipendiary magistrate at Clerkenwell magistrates court, London, ordered Mr Trachten-berg's acquittal, accepting his argument that he had a reasonable excuse not to answer questions because he had already been arrested and charged. The High Court judges yesterday overturned the magistrate's ruling, saying his approach to the case had been 'fundamentally flawed'.</p>

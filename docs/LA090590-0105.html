			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SPECIAL BUS OFFERED FOR COMMUTE HOURS  </P> <P> In a bid to reduce traffic congestion caused by construction on the Santa Ana  Freeway, the Orange County Transport District on Tuesday started a special bus  route for commute-hour travelers between San Juan Capistrano and Anaheim.  </P> <P> The first 19-seat passenger van left the Junipero Serra Road Park-and-Ride  station in San Juan Capistrano at 5:31 a.m. It arrived in Anaheim 80 minutes  later, after making scheduled stops in Laguna Hills, Irvine, Tustin and Orange.  </P> <P> The number of commuters using the service Tuesday was not immediately  available, but OCTD officials are optimistic.  </P> <P> "We hope some motorists will seize this opportunity and leave their cars at  home," OCTD spokeswoman Mona Ziada said. "Everyone benefits -- they don't have  to drive through the congestion, and they help to free up traffic."  </P> <P> To encourage commuters to use the new route, OCTD is offering free rides during  the first two weeks of service. From Sept. 17, commuters will pay $1.80 for the  Anaheim-San Juan Capistrano run and $1.30 for either Anaheim-Laguna Hills or  Anaheim-Irvine. Transfers to connecting OCTD routes are free.  </P> <P> Ziada said the district had signed a $82,746 contract for the Yellow Cab Co. to  operate the new route.  </P> <P> The service includes four morning trips leaving the South County station at  30-minute intervals. The first of four return trips leave the Anaheim station  at Katella Avenue and State College Boulevard at 4:10 p.m.  </P> <P> Caltrans has agreed to pay 50% of the costs as part of an agreement between the  state agency and OCTD. The agreement calls for the district to provide  ride-sharing programs during the freeway reconstruction, the spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Ziada said the district is almost certain to make the route permanent, even  after construction work on the freeway is completed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Bus Route  </P> <P> The first express bus linking San Juan Capistrano to Anaheim will run, with  stops in Laguna Hills, Irvine, Tustin and Orange. The buses will leave every 30  minutes.  </P></p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Minister quits over funds allegations Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, has lost his second senior minister in as many months. Mr Alan Griffiths, minister for industry, technology and regional development, resigned at the weekend amid allegations that party funds and electoral office facilities had been misused in a private business interest. Mr Keating said in a statement that Mr Griffiths had informed him of 'serious concerns' about the possible misuse of funds, but added: 'He told me that he had no involvement at all in any of these matters and that his lawyers are satisfied that on the material presented to them. . . in their opinion he is not guilty of any wrongdoing or impropriety.' The departure of Mr Griffiths comes only a month after Mr Dawkins, the treasurer, announced his intention to resign - and ultimately to leave politics - for personal reasons. While Mr Dawkins was a more senior politician and a member of Mr Keating's 'inner' circle, Mr Griffiths, aged 41, has been viewed as one of the Labor party's rising stars.</p>

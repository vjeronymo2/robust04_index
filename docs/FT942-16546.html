			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: The rules and regulations of the AGM Shareholders are entitled to: Receive 21 days advance notice in writing of the annual general meeting and a copy of the annual report and accounts. Inspect each director's contract at the company's registered office during normal business hours from the date of the notice of the meeting to its close. The contracts must also be available for 15 minutes before the meeting. But they need not be displayed if they have less than 12 months to run or can be terminated without compensation. Attend the meeting in person or appoint a proxy who can attend and vote on their behalf but not speak, move resolutions or propose amendments. Speak and ask questions. Call for a poll of proxy votes if supported by four other shareholders or members with 10 per cent of the voting rights. Move or second an amendment to an ordinary resolution (requiring a simple majority) but not to a special resolution (requiring a 75 per cent majority). The amendment must not be beyond the scope of the original resolution. The Articles of the company may specify certain rules regarding the proposal of an amendment. Require the directors to put forward a resolution at a general meeting if they represent either 5 per cent of the total voting shares or 100 members holding a combined total of Pounds 10,000 of nominal share capital. But the company is not bound to circulate the resolution unless it is deposited at least six weeks before the meeting (that is, before shareholders have received the annual report) and the sharehold-ers meet the company's expenses. Propose a director to the board and remove a director by ordinary resolution. Propose the removal of auditors by ordinary resolution though special notice must be given of the meeting at which this will be put forward. Details may vary according to a particular company's Articles of Association.</p>

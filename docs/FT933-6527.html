			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Eyes on Argentina's presidency: The ambitions - much denied  -of Domingo Cavallo, the popular economy minister who lacks a politician's touch ARGENTINA'S economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, is one of the most popular men in the country, rightfully credited with having transformed it from economic basket-case to free market showcase. Although he denies harbouring any political ambitions, stressing that he is merely an economist who lacks the politician's common touch, the tireless rumour mills of Buenos Aires consider Mr Cavallo more and more presidenciable (made of presidential timber) with every passing day. President Carlos Menem's six-year term is to end in July 1995, but he wants to be re-elected. He is campaigning hard for an amendment to the constitution, which allows no Argentine president a second successive terms. However, most observers doubt he will be successful - hence the speculation over Mr Cavallo's future. Conjecture that he is planning to launch himself fully into politics grew stronger when, this month, he practically took over the campaign of Mr Juan Schiaretti, an old friend and until recently his trade and industry secretary, who won a narrow victory in Peronist party primary elections for a Chamber of Deputies seat in Cordoba province. The Congressional elections are scheduled to be held on October 3. But one of his close aides said: 'No, Cavallo is not interested in the presidency. He is not going to risk throwing overboard everything he has achieved as economy minister. 'The aim is to get Schiaretti into Congress, where he can exercise his leadership abilities to move legislation stuck there.' Mr Menem has made the re-election of his government its overriding political objective. He spends an increasing amount of time campaigning throughout the country, handing out land deeds, kissing babies and pressing flesh. Mr Cavallo is only too aware of the dangers of crossing Mr Menem and rarely misses an opportunity to proclaim his allegiance to the president. On Monday, the latter sacked his interior minister, Mr Gustavo Beliz, for having raised doubts about the re-election campaign. In his resignation letter, Mr Beliz wrote that he objected to the 'methods and proposals (used) to attain the objective of the reform of our (constitution), which are generating inadmissible suspicion'. Mr Beliz is believed to have been alluding to intimidation and attacks on journalists thought to oppose Mr Menem's re-election. Two newspaper reporters - one from the mass-circulation Clarn and another from the opposition Pagina/12 - have been beaten up by thugs thought to belong to shadowy Peronist groups. Nearly all Argentina's civilian presidents over the last 50 years have tried to lift the re-election ban. Only the late Juan Peron himself was able to do so. He was re-elected in 1951, but was toppled in a coup four years later. It is not easy to amend the Argentine constitution, and time is running against Mr Menem. First, two-thirds of both chambers of Congress must agree the 'necessity' to reform the constitution. But Mr Menem lacks sufficient votes and is unlikely to win much more support after the elections in October. He is thinking of calling a plebiscite on the issue before Christmas. Plebiscites are not binding on Congress but a strong showing in one could press wavering members to vote for reform. Even if Mr Menem were to win over Congress, he would then have to win elections for a constituent assembly. If all went well there, he would then need to win the Peronist party's nomination as presidential candidate - probably no great problem. The presidential election must be held by December 1994, although the winner will not take office for six months. Close aides to Mr Cavallo say his main aim is to ensure that economic policy does not fall victim to political infighting. This concern is shared by business and by overseas investors. They would react immediately - and negatively - to any serious relaxation of rigour in policy for political reasons. If Mr Menem's re-election bid were to fail, Mr Cavallo would not seek the nomination for himself, one aide said. Instead, 'you can be certain that Cavallo will be one of the half-dozen people who will decide who the Peronist candidate will be, and therefore who the next president will be'. Mr Cavallo can afford to wait. He will be only 55 in 2001, when the presidential election after next would be held. Analysts say the argumentative Mr Cavallo should use the time to hone his political skills. 'Cavallo is not a politician,' commented one western diplomat. 'He needs to learn to control his temper, learn how to handle people and crowds. He needs to learn to be a politician.' He owes his high standing in opinion polls - in which he usually outstrips Mr Menem - to a reputation for unblemished honesty and successful economic policies which delivered the lowest Argentine inflation rate in 24 years and 9 per cent growth last year. Mr Rosendo Fraga, a prominent political analyst, suspects that, if the Peronists win the next presidential election, Mr Cavallo would like to stay on as economy minister, at least for the first two years of the next administration, to ensure a smooth transition to the new economic team. These arguments do not convince everyone. Most observers insist that Mr Cavallo is patiently biding his time, awaiting the inevitably negative outcome of Mr Menem's re-election bid before making his move.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mogadishu, March 31 (AFP) - An American aid worker  in Somalia was kidnapped by gunmen on Thursday [31 March],  Somali sources said.    The American, working for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF),  was kidnapped in the Somali capital Mogadishu, the sources said,  but without giving further details.    The kidnap of the American comes barely a week after the  release of a New Zealander and a Kenyan who were held hostage  for 16 days by gunmen demanding a one million dollar ransom.    But David Morris, the owner of Morris Catering which is  contracted by the UN to supply its troops with food and water,  said he secured the release of his employees after protracted  negotiations by giving the gunmen a few bags of rice and sugar,  and a tin of cooking oil.    Armed bandits are on the increase here after the withdrawal  last week of American and other western forces.    Wayne Hargreaves, the New Zealander released last week, said  his kidnappers "were a well equipped terrorist group".    Meanwhile, five bandits were killed by newly-trained Somali  police in the northwestern town of Baidoa on Wednesday, UN  military spokesman Chris Budge said on Thursday.    The killing occurred after the leader of the bandits tried  to  coerce aid workers into employing some of his men.</p>

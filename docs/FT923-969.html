			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Ashdown blames Tories for 'vacuum of leadership' WITHDRAWAL from the exchange rate mechanism had put the UK on the periphery of Europe and in danger of becoming part of a 'second tier' in the European Community, said Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader. He complained that Mr John Major had given no indication in his speech to MPs about the future direction of UK economic policy. There was also a 'vacuum of leadership' in the UK over ratification of the Maastricht treaty which would only strengthen the hands of Euro-sceptics. Mr Ashdown argued that sterling's difficulties last week could have been avoided if measures had been taken earlier to tackle weaknesses in Britain's economy. It was 'nonsense' to suggest that a peculiar bout of speculation meant that 'in a single day, the central planks of the government's economic policy and of its foreign policy were obliterated'. Mr Major had wanted Britain at the heart of Europe, 'but last week he put this country at the periphery of Europe', the Liberal Democrat leader said. It had been a tactical mistake for the government to blame Germany for the crisis, 'for which we will pay a very heavy price in the future'. Britain was now in danger of being condemned to 'a second tier' within the EC. Responding to Tory jibes that Liberal Democrat policy had been to put sterling in the narrow bands of the ERM in order to boost the currency's credibility, Mr Ashdown insisted that such a move would have increased the financial markets' confidence in the UK's commitment to Europe. Confidence in the pound could now be boosted by a move to an independent central bank, investment in infrastructure and by Britain spurning its 'opt-out' from a single currency in the Maastricht treaty, Mr Ashdown said. The lesson of last week was that moves towards a single currency would help European countries co-operate in exchange rate management.</p>

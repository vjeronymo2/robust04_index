			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Global warming threat reaches council agendas PLANNERS will have to consider the threat of global warming at local level for the first time under planning guidelines to be announced today by Sir George Young, minister for planning. The guidelines would oblige councils to take account of the rising sea level as a result of global warming when giving permission to build in low-lying areas. Sir George will also announce proposals that will encourage planners to take account of public transport and to site housing so as to minimise car use for journeys to work or school. The government guidance will incorporate into local planning for the first time the concept of protecting the environment through sustainable development. The intention is not to hold back economic growth, but to strike a balance between growth and the environment. The proposals involve greater use of public transport and improved energy conservation as a means of curbinggreenhouse gases which cause global warming. Mr Tony Burton, senior planning officer for the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said that the move was the most significant step to incorporate wider environmental concerns into the UK planning system. The proposals are in government guidance which has to be observed by county councils in their strategic plans and by district councils in making local development plans. It would also have to be taken into consideration when hearing appeals by developers against planning decisions. Patterns of travel influence emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, and would have to be changed, the guidelines say. To reduce emissions, new development should take place in locations which reduce the need for car journeys and distances driven. Policies should be designed to control pollution and limit nuisances such as noise, smell and dirt, the guidelines add.</p>

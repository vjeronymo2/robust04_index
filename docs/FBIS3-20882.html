"The defense  industry is of strategic importance to national security and  sovereignty, and, hence, the state should take charge of it and  be responsible for it to a greater extent than in the case of  remaining branches of the economy."    After two years of preparations and one year of actual work,  the restructuring of the defense industry is being focused on  resolving four principal problems: defining the sector;  conversion--i.e., retooling from military to civilian  production; changes in ownership; and financial restructuring.    Initially, the problem was the marked shrinkage of markets  in  the East owing to the disintegration of the USSR, the biggest  customer for Polish arms (e.g., for 80 percent of the output of  the aviation industry) and the general recession in this country  and in the world, extending also to this industry. An additional  constraint was the marked expansion of the list of UN-embargoed  arms shipments by the previous governments, in accordance with  the expectations of Western political and economic partners,  which necessitated markedly reducing output down to the level  merely meeting the needs of national security and defense and  the forecast export possibilities. These objectives are being  met, both quantitatively and in terms of range of output, by 31  arms-manufacturing enterprises. Previously, as many as 82  enterprises operated in that branch, even though most of them  were suppliers manufacturing, in addition to civilian products,  components ordered by makers of finished arms products. On the  recommendation of the minister of industry and trade, the  Council of Ministers has classified only 31 enterprises as  belonging in the defense industry.    Safeguarding national security requires maintaining in  peacetime, as well, the arms-manufacturing capacity needed in  times of war. But every unutilized machine or production bay  means an added expense to the plant. Attempts to solve this  problem in peacetime indicate that the best solution is  conversion--that is, retooling from military to civilian  production. The restructuring program, which encompasses such  conversion, envisages that special [defense] production should  account for not more than 30-40 percent of the output of each  plant belonging in the defense industry.    The general market principles of free--that is,  public--privatization [of state enterprises] that the Ministry  of Ownership Transformations is following normally restrict the  state's ability to control it, and this conflicts with the  strategic importance of the defense industry to national  security and sovereignty. Therefore, the Council of Ministers  has decided to expand the list of enterprises affected by the  Law on the Ownership Transformations of Certain State  Enterprises of Special Importance to the State Sector by adding  to that list defense-industry enterprises. This means that  responsibility for ownership transformations in the defense  industry will be assumed by the minister of industry and trade.    The need for financial restructuring is due to the so-called  nonculpable, in many cases, arrears in payments owed by arms  enterprises. Their financial restructuring is to be carried out  so as to exploit the opportunities afforded by the Law on the  Financial Restructuring of Enterprises and Banks and the  Commercial Law Code, with bank agreement proceedings to be  followed in the former case and composition agreement  proceedings in the latter. At present, the economic situation of  defense-industry plants is, according to Deputy Minister  Czerwinski, on the whole satisfactory compared with that of  other industries. Some 15 or so defense enterprises have  achieved full financial liquidity, and, at 10 others, gross  earnings already are beginning to exceed expenses. All  defense-industry enterprises will be operating in the black by  the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996. Bank-agreement  proceedings will greatly contribute to that outcome.    The present situation of the enterprises is burdened by the  mistakes made not only by the government but also by their  management. Minister Czerwinski cited the example of an  enterprise that, on the order of its director, dispatched an  entire trainload of equipment to Russia on 31 December 1992--  that is, in a year when everybody already knew by April that the  Russians were welshing--and not a hair on the director's head  was touched. Of the $260 million owed by the Russians, so far  one-half could be recovered from them in the form of so-called  financial clearing. Last year we did not pay for equipment  shipments and repair work done by Russians, and the related  negotiations are still in progress, though this conflicts with  the principle of placing all orders with Polish enterprises. Of  the 4 trillion zlotys [Z] allocated for purchases by the  Ministry of National Defense, Z500 billion was earmarked for the  acquisition of armaments precisely from Russia. The minister of  industry and trade selected from among the directors of the 31  Polish defense-industry enterprises four persons, whom he  appointed as his representatives commissioned to establish four  holding companies and, subsequently, a consortium, with the  object of coordinating promotional and growth policies in the  defense industry. Instead of formalizing mutual cooperation, the  group of aviation enterprises resolved to appoint a council of  directors from that branch, along with commissions and working  groups for marketing, R&amp;D work, coproduction, etc.    The sole bank to support restructuring programs in the arms  industry is Polska Kasa Opieki (PKO), Inc. To this day, the  principal problem facing any enterprise is how to finance its  operations in the event that it receives a big contract, a big  order. Considerations of national security and the like dictated  authorizing only one bank to be involved. An additional problem  is the need to finance so-called export credits, and the PKO,  Inc. is ready to handle this matter.    Responding to many questions of reporters, Minister  Czerwinski expatiated upon, for example, the problem of  privatizing arms plants. The method is very simple. At Nowa  Deba, Radom, and Lucznik plants, separate departments were set  up for so-called joint ventures, with the participation of  foreign investors, in isolation from other departments of these  plants. In speaking of restructuring at enterprises, Minister  Czerwinski explained that accomplishing it hinges on their  management; the Ministry of Industry and Trade merely oversees  these operations as the parent agency. He, the minister, would  like to bring about a situation in which the enterprise  directors would know what they want and ask of the ministry  merely permission to invite a foreign partner to a joint venture  concerning a discrete plant department. The ministry is  incapable of handling the restructuring of discrete plants; that  is a task that was entrusted to the plant directors. The problem  is only the proper selection of executive personnel.</p>

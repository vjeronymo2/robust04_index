It happened on 26 January, that is mid-December in the lunar  calendar. Premier Li Peng's residence in Zhongnanhai was filled  with a warm and joyous atmosphere.    "We express our thanks for the premier's concern, and extend  our New Year's greetings to the premier on behalf of Sanhe's  400,000 people!" "Thank you! You're welcome. I extend my New  Year's greetings to Sanhe's people, too!"    That was an unforgettable moment. At the invitation of  Premier Li Peng, Li Fucheng [2621 4395 2052], manager of Fucheng  Ox Farm Group Company, who has the reputation of being the  "Commander of the Ox Farm Business in Eastern Beijing," and  Sanhe Mayor Liu Xueku [0491 1331 1655] arrived at the premier's  house as his guests at 1030 that day.    A year before, on 22 January 1993, that is New Year's Eve on  the lunar calendar, Premier Li Peng braved the bitter cold and  made a special trip to Sanhe's Li Fucheng Ox Farm on an  inspection tour to extend New Year's greetings to the peasants,  and wrote an inscription calling for "developing the ox farm  business in a big way, utilizing crop stalks as fodder, with cow  dung returned to the field to promote a sound cycle of  agriculture." Now, a year had passed. How had Sanhe developed?  The premier showed great concern about that.    Thrilled, Li Fucheng and Liu Xueku reported to the premier:  Over the past year, 30 million yuan had been invested, and the  semi-mechanization transformation of the ox farm, a  slaughterhouse with a processing capacity of 70,000 head per  year, a fodder-processing factory with an annual output of  40,000 tonnes, and a winery with an annual output of 2,000  tonnes of liquor and 10,000 tonnes of distillers' grains had  been completed one after another. At the same time, a  beef-marketing department had been set up in Beijing. The  Fucheng Ox Farm had already expanded into the Fucheng Ox Farm  Group Company; its fixed assets had grown from the original 12  million to 40 million yuan, and it had became an ox farm group  company of the largest scale across China. At the same time,  five branches of the ox farm had been newly built in Chengde and  other places. The number of oxen on hand and the number  slaughtered had increased from 2,000 and 5,000 head respectively  in 1992 to 4,500 and 12,000 head respectively, both doubling.  In addition, the group company had brought along l50 peasant  households to go in for ox farming, and their output had also  increased by 50 percent over 1992.    In accordance with the premier's instruction, Sanhe regarded  the Fucheng Group as the locomotive and developed ox farming in  a big way. In 1993, the number of oxen bred was 68,000 head,  and 170,000 tonnes of crop stalks were consumed, accounting for  90 percent of the volume of stalks of the whole city; 476,000  tonnes of cow dung were produced, with the area of farmland thus  fertilized expanded; and consequently the annual grain output  increased by some 10,000 tonnes, a record high....    Hearing this, the premier was very happy, and said: "The  peasants will become well-off on the strength of agriculture,  and Li Fucheng is precisely a typical example of a peasant  becoming rich through agriculture."    The topic now centered on intensive processing in ox  farming.  The premier said: "With greater numbers of oxen, it is  imperative to keep an eye on the market. To develop the  economy, nothing can be separated from the market. In  slaughtering oxen, our beef may enter Beijing's large hotels and  restaurants as a substitute for imports; cowhide involves  intensive processing to turn out leather, which can be  manufactured into leather coats, luggage and other things."    Comrade Zhu Lin threw in a few words when she heard that the  Fucheng Group had already drawn up a plan to start a tannery in  the following year, saying: "Should you start a tannery, it  must turn out high grade leather; advanced equipment must be  imported for that purpose."    Upon hearing that Sanhe had already changed from a county to  a city, and entered the ranks of the 100 most advanced cities in  China, the premier said: "I knew it; my congratulations. What  is your position in the list?"    "Seventy-eighth," Liu Xueku answered.    "You should work harder. I hope that you will mount a higher  plane in the new year." The premier encouraged them and pinned  high hopes on them with deep feeling.    The premier also asked about the conditions of Sanhe's  industry, township and town enterprises, and development zone,  and cordially said: "You are very close to Beijing, and the  city enjoys very special geographical advantages. You should do  a very good job of running the development zone. You should  grow a variety of vegetables to enrich Beijing's marketplace!"    Time flew; soon an hour or so had passed. Li Fucheng and Liu  Xueku could hardly tear themselves away when they said goodbye  to Premier Li Peng and Comrade Zhu Lin, and they hoped the  premier would take care. The premier was in very good spirits;  he stood up and said: "I'm in pretty good shape! Thank you!  Come, let's have a picture taken together." The premier held  Li Fucheng with one hand, and Liu Xueku with the other. Thus a  staff member aimed his camera and recorded this precious  moment...</p>

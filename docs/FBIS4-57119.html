			<p>BFN     [Text] With a decision that caught most government  officials by surprise, President Carlos Menem yesterday decided  to group the Federal Police, the Coast Guard, and the Border  Police, that is, the entire state security apparatus, under a  future Secretariat for State Security. Menem chose Julian  Licastro, a retired Army lieutenant with a long career within  the Peronist party, to head this supersecretariat (it might also  include management of the Secretariat for State Intelligence,  SIDE).    In designing the new secretariat's structure Menem did not  seem to realize some details: The future secretariat undermines  the powers of the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry.    When the news had already spread outside the presidential  office, the government was forced to issue a press communique in  an attempt to calm the debate prompted by the proposal.    Some government officials attributed this initiative to  [Economics Minister] Domingo Cavallo's team. One of Cavallo's  team members even told CLARIN that on 8 May Licastro met the  economics minister. In an attempt to explain Cavallo's alleged  meddling in this issue, the source noted: "The management of  roughly $2.6 billion that is spent on security is involved."    The official communique was issued late after the reports  had  already astonished SIDE, Defense Ministry, and Interior Ministry  officials. SIDE, the Defense Ministry, and the Interior  Ministry had been dealing with pieces of rumors, prompting an  atmosphere of bewilderment and irritation. This atmosphere  spread to the security forces involved.    To soothe the uproar, but raising more questions, the press  communique's first paragraph notes: "As it is necessary to  achieve an effective coordination among the various security  forces involved in the protection of public property and in the  struggle against crime and drug trafficking, the president of  the nation has given instructions to the interior and defense  ministers to study the formation of a State Secretariat for  Interior Security.  <H5>  Social Violence </H5>   Nevertheless, the communique did not manage to clear other  doubts: Would the Drug Enforcement Secretariat, headed by  Alberto Lestelle, also be included in the same package? Will  SIDE, as had initially been indicated, be included or not? Will  this be the organization to command the rapid deployment units  that are being planned to repress social disorders that  overwhelm the provincial police? It seemed that no one at  Government House last night had any response to these issues.    The official communique's belated caution, with  announcements  such as "to study the formation of" or "to plan the new  organization's operational structure," was prompted after those  covered by the Interior Security Law at their fingertips went to  the Government House to caution about the legal and political  challenges that will undoubtedly be raised by various circles,  including the security forces themselves.    This issue will be discussed during a cabinet meeting at the  Olivos presidential residence. Menem's proposal seeks to group  military units, intelligence activities, and drug enforcement  forces under a single head. This disagrees with the spirit and  provisions of a law agreed upon between Peronists and Radicals,  who also make up a bicameral monitoring committee that was also  not consulted before taking this step.    Nevertheless, an official involved in drawing up legal  standards and decrees assured CLARIN that a presidential decree  alone would be required to establish the new secretariat. This  official, however, emphasized that such a presidential decree  has not yet been drawn up, and that Licastro has not yet been  appointed as secretary.    The source actually noted that in order to establish a  secretariat of such characteristics, the Interior Ministry's  Undersecretariat, headed by Hugo Franco would be dissolved and  at least the status of SIDE would be changed.</p>

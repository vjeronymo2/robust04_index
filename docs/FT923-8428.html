			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Signs of life stir in the loans market: Hopes are being raised of a return by blue chip borrowers Bankers in the international syndicated loans market have a tendency to note details of individual loans with the keenness of train-spotters or ornithological twitchers. Recently, they have had good reason to watch the market like hawks. Over the past few years, pricing on syndicated loans has risen steadily, reflecting the banks' concern about meeting capital adequacy requirements and their desire to improve margins on lending. While companies are under pressure to raise funds as cheaply as possible, bankers found that loans which were too tightly priced were often difficult to syndicate as other banks were unwilling to participate in the deals. However, conditions appear to be changing. Some better-rated corporate names are finding it easier to obtain more tightly priced loans. These signs that loan pricing may be starting to fall have raised hopes that more blue-chip companies may be encouraged to return to the international syndicated loans market, leading to improved activity. Bankers have watched three loans with interest: an Ecu499m (Pounds 359.3m) loan to the European Community; a Pounds 150m loan for Argyll, the UK food retailer; and a Pounds 290m financing for AMP (UK), the UK subsidiary of Australia's biggest insurance group. The EC's three-year loan carries a margin of 3.125 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) with a participation fee of 10 basis points. The pricing is particularly tight on this loan because the EC is a Triple-A rated borrower which is Zero-risk weighted for capital adequacy purposes. Also, the participating banks hope to win more business as a result. Argyll's 5-year Pounds 150m facility is intended to help finance the group's store developments. Argyll is borrowing at a margin of 37.5 basis points over Libor - which bankers describe as extremely favourable for the company. Mr Colin Smith, finance director at Argyll, said the money was raised 'very smoothly . . . we were delighted with the response from our relationship banks'. This week, bankers will watch the response to another finely priced deal - from AMP (UK). Fuji Bank, which competed fiercely for the mandate, is arranging and underwriting the deal, consisting of a revolving credit facility and a commercial paper backstop facility. While the margin on the loan is considered small, banks will be rewarded with fairly generous fees. The funds will be used to help refinance a Pounds 525m 3-year facility (of which only Pounds 250m is outstanding) which matures in September 1992: the old loan has a margin of 25 basis points over Libor, and a 12.5 commitment fee. The new facility has a margin of 20 basis points with a commitment fee of 10 basis points on the undrawn part of the standby. Companies such as Argyll and AMP can command tight terms because they are considered top-quality borrowers. The question remains whether these indications of lower pricing will encourage companies to return to the syndicated loans market, which has bordered on comatose for 18 months, in sharp contrast to the late 1980s when banks fell over each other to lend, and takeovers and mergers stimulated demand for loans. Competition among banks to lend was tough, allowing companies to borrow cheaply. However, conditions in the loans market have deteriorated. The recession in the Anglo-Saxon economies has depressed takeover activity and reduced investment in capital equipment. Many banks have been hit by company failures resulting from injudicious lending practices and difficult economic conditions. The need to follow the Basle guidelines on capital adequacy has made many banks, especially Japanese (an important source of finance in the late 1980s) more selective about their lending. Average spreads on new loans have risen from about 50-60 basis points in 1989-1990 (with prime corporate borrowers often obtaining funds at all-in costs below 40 basis points) to around 80 basis points this year, according to the recent OECD report Financial Market Trends, June 1992. Meanwhile, volumes have dropped sharply. Activity in the international syndicated loans market plummeted in the first half of 1992 as borrowers scaled back their bank financing and switched to the international bond and equity markets for funds. 'There's been so little activity in the market that banks are now hungry for assets. They are ringing each other up trying to get in on deals to the top names,' says one banker. A Swiss banker says: 'Pricing is more aggressive for top quality names.' However, the news may be a mixed blessing. Bankers, anxious about low volumes in the loans market, want borrowers to return to the market to refinance outstanding facilities or raise new funds. Yet few bankers want margins to fall, reducing profit margins. 'Very few banks are making good profits on their syndicated loans business,' warns one UK banker. Instead, banks are prepared to participate in such syndicated loans in the hope that they will lead to more lucrative business  -for example in foreign exchange or letters of credit. Few bankers believe pricing will return to the levels of a few years ago - but the more optimistic hope that if top-quality names are encouraged back to the loans market by better borrowing terms, the phones on the loans desks might ring again.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Pakistani Senate rejects curbs on central bank Pakistan's upper house of parliament yesterday rejected a government-backed bill aimed at curtailing the autonomy of the central bank and reducing powers of its governor. The victory of an opposition resolution by 28 votes to 11 in the Senate was a setback for the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto,the prime minister. Mr Sartaj Aziz, an opposition senator and former finance minister, later called on the government 'to show their goodwill now and move towards giving autonomy to the bank'. Senior officials said the government could still sponsor a new bill in the lower house of parliament, but warned that a long controversy would hurt Islamabad's image in the domestic and international financial community. The government's bill was intended to replace laws enacted in October by a caretaker government, giving the central bank freedom to set monetary policy. Mr Mohammed Yaqub, a former IMF economist with a reputation as a strict financial disciplinarian, is the bank's governor. Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister, regarded the changes in the central bank as crucial to his programme of economic reforms. But the ordinance proposed by Ms Bhutto's government aimed to reduce the governor's term of office while requiring the bank to establish monetary policy in consultation with the government. Western economists had voiced reservationson the Bhutto government's move, arguing that an independent central bank wouldbe the only solution to excessive government borrowing and uncontrolled monetary expansion. The government denies its proposed changes would prevent it from improving fiscal discipline. Ms Bhutto yesterday urged the United Nations Human Rights Commission to investigate human rights abuses by Indian security forces in Kashmir, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. She told the commission's 50th session; 'The situation in Kashmir is intolerable, as is the world's silence.' Denying that Pakistan was instigating or assisting the 'freedom struggle' in Kashmir, Ms Bhutto said peaceful resolutionof the Kashmir issue would pave the way for normalisation of relations between Pakistan and India. She called on India to implement UN Security Council resolutions calling for a UN-supervised plebiscite and to accept UN military observers along the border with Pakistan.</p>

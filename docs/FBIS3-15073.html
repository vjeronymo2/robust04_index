Responsible for the main guidelines of foreign  policy, he spoke to EXPRESSO by telephone.    [Meireles] Following a period of apparent self-effacement  with respect to the Balkans, Russia has taken up active  involvement. Why?    [Adamishin] Russia has not begun to act just now. We have  been seeking for months a political agreement for Bosnia and for  other conflict areas in the former Yugoslavia. At the last UN  session we proposed the demilitarization of Sarajevo, and  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev suggested 24 January a  ministerial meeting with the Security Council members in order  to examine the city's problems, demilitarization, and placement  under UN administration. The NATO ultimatum prevented the  completion of the process. The political and diplomatic actions  were the culmination of many months of efforts by Russian  diplomacy.    [Meireles] But it was the credible threat of the use of  force which produced the first positive results....    [Adamishin] I would say that it was the nonuse of force  which made possible this result. I am not certain that the  Serbs would have withdrawn their weapons if Russia had not asked  them to do so in accordance with the UN secretary general's  plan, without our resorting to ultimatums or threats. The  important thing is the results, not the laurels, but if anybody  says that the decisive role was played by NATO, I disagree, and  if NATO had shelled the Serb positions, I do not know what the  consequences would have been.    [Meireles] Did the West try to sideline Russia in resolving  the conflict?    [Adamishin] We did not like this ultimatum. In the first  place, because it is not for NATO to deliver ultimatums and  threaten the use of force in international relations, which is  exclusively the Security Council's responsibility. Second, we  agree with the West on the demilitarization of Sarajevo and its  administration by the United Nations, and the overall political  agreement, but the method chosen by the West would place Russia  outside the decisionmaking framework, and here we disagree.  Third, we believe that it prevented -- or at least did not  facilitate -- the continuation of the negotiations which were  already taking place in Sarajevo between Serbs and Muslims and  which were suspended by the latter in anticipation of an  intervention. The Muslims are the greatest obstacle to an  agreement right now because they still hope to achieve on the  battlefield what they could secure at the negotiating table, and  when they learned that somebody was prepared to wage war for  them, they lost interest in the talks.    [Meireles] When you said that Russia had carried out its  task and that it is now for the West to perform its own, were  you referring to the exertion of pressure on the Muslims?    [Adamishin] What I mean is that we used a powerful argument  -- our influence on the Serbs. Nobody else would have it. It  stems from our balanced policy with respect to the crisis, not  from our belonging to the same ethnic and religious group. We  do not seek to vindicate the Serbs, but we do not regard them as  the sole culprits. It is known that the United States or some  other countries have greater prospects of influencing the  Muslims and making them see that it is time to sit down at the  negotiating table and achieve peace by accepting the plan for a  political agreement which was virtually approved by the three  sides and was withdrawn from the negotiating table.    [Meireles] In the talks with the United States, did Moscow  inform it of that viewpoint?    [Adamishin] We must all work together to influence the three  sides, using everybody's assets. The Americans told us not to  pressure the Muslims yet deemed themselves to be in a position  to tell us to pressure the Serbs. They did not wish to impose  conditions on the Muslims for an agreement -- only on the Serbs.  This is not a fair stance.    [Meireles] In Moscow, all the political forces have  supported the initiative in Bosnia. Does the Slav-Orthodox  alliance remain valid?    [Adamishin] Our historical ties with the Serbs are one of  the factors, but it is very dangerous to see the conflict in  ethnic and religious terms: If the Slav countries supported the  Serbs, the Islamic countries would have to support the Muslims,  and the Catholics would have to support the Croats. It is not  correct to say that only the Serbs are to blame, because it is  untrue and politically incorrect.    [Meireles] Do you believe that the West has made that  mistake?    [Adamishin] That is not what I mean. It is not possible to  be unaware that Islamic countries are intervening for religious  reasons. The important thing is to end the conflict, but an  external act of force does not facilitate an agreement. We do  not reject the possibility of its being necessary to use force  -- such as, for instance, the UN forces having the right to  defend themselves in the event of an attack -- but these are  very specific and limited cases.    [Meireles] Could the model applied in Sarajevo be used in  other Bosnian cities?    [Adamishin] Another ultimatum? Let them try it, and maybe  they will reach the conclusion that it does not work! If one of  the sides believes that it is possible the other will be  attacked, there ceases to be a need to negotiate.    [Meireles] What are Russia's means for resolving the  conflict?    [Adamishin] In the first place, we have political influence;  second, we are prepared to work with all the Western countries;  third, we have our troops there. They are under UN command,  integrated into the peacekeeping forces, and this participation  gives us greater ability to influence decisions.    [Meireles] Are you in favor of U.S. troops' participation in  the UN Protection Force?    [Adamishin] Why not? We are inviting them!    [Meireles] Have you asked President Clinton?    [Adamishin] President Clinton has always said that he does  not wish to send U.S. troops to Bosnia. It is not for us to  tell him to send them. It is the United Nations which should  say which troops it needs in Bosnia. When Butrus-Ghali said  that he needed more forces in Sarajevo, we responded to his  request.    [Meireles] If the ultimatum were carried out, could a grave  conflict develop between East and West?    [Adamishin] That is a hypothetical question. Let us keep  our fingers crossed and be thankful that this has not happened,  and let us all be more sensible in the future in order to avert  that possibility.</p>

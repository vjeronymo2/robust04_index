			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Biogen halts work on blood-clot drug Biogen, the US genetic-engineering concern, said it was stopping development of one of its two most promising experimental drugs. The decision represents a blow to the company's efforts to become a fully integrated drug manufacturer. The company said it had decided it would no longer pursue efforts to market an anticoagulant known as Hirulog, which is made from a chemical produced by leeches. Biogen, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said it would take a Dollars 25m pre-tax charge in the third quarter to cover expenses related to the move.</p>

In particular, he pointed out that the removal of nuclear  warheads from Ukraine to Russia for their subsequent dismantling  and utilization is being carried out as scheduled and in  accordance with a defence capacity of enterprises which will  carry out processing. The expert said that during transportation  and storage of nuclear warheads at enterprises serious attention  is paid to ensuring their safety. At the same time, there is no  point in closely watching the movement of each convoy since  secrecy during the transportation and storage of nuclear  warheads will be fully observed.    The first convoy with nuclear warheads from "Ukrainian  missiles" is bound to arrive at its destination in the near  future. The destination is not disclosed for reasons of  secrecy, but it was announced that in accordance with tripartite  Russo-American-U.S. agreements signed in Moscow on January 14,  1994, the warheads will be dismantled for being subsequently  processed at one of Russia's enterprises.    Under the agreement, in exchange for the warheads Russia has  pledged to supply fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations, but  not in the form of processed nuclear material obtained from  withdrawn missiles. The processing of this nuclear material  will take from several months to one year, experts said. The  supplies of nuclear fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations  will be carried out from Russia's fuel reserves.    According to the Russian Defence Ministry, on the Ukrainian  territory there are about 1,300 warheads for intercontinental  ballistic missiles an over 600 - for cruise land-based missiles.  The condition of part of nuclear ammunition causes special  concern of nuclear experts which might promote the speediest  removal of nuclear ammunition from Ukraine.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / BAT confident on insurance inquiry BAT Industries said yesterday it was confident that its US Farmers Insurance subsidiary would pass with flying colours a review into its procedures launched by Mr John Garamendi, California's in-surance commissioner, agencies report. The review follows a court award of Dollars 57.8m (Pounds 38.7m) in punitive damages last month against one of Farmers' insurance exchanges in a suit launched by a client. Farmers intends to contest the judgment, which would not hit profits, because of the way its business is structured, it said. But the uncertainty, plus profit-taking, meant BAT shares slipped 13p to 503p in London trading yesterday. The case goes back to 1989, when Surgin Surgical was sued by a competitor for patent infringement. When Surgin sought to have Farmers' subsidiary Truck Insurance pay for its defence it was denied coverage. After Surgin filed suit against Truck for bad faith, the insurer allegedly destroyed documents that would have been used in the discovery stage of the case, Mr Garamendi said. Mr Garamendi noted in launching his inquiry that the case judge had referred to Truck Insurance's behaviour as 'despicable, vile, malici-ous, fraudulent and oppressive.' However, a BAT Industries spokesman said yesterday: 'Farmers' customer service ranks among the best in the insurance industry. The company is confident the review of its procedures by the state department of insurance will affirm this.' He added that the award had not yet been formally entered into court, but when it was, Farmers would appeal on the grounds that the judge exceeded his powers.</p>

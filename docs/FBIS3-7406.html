At a press conference here,  Hosokawa said he would like to take enough time to consider  whether it could be possible to incorporate objective criteria  into a package of measures to cut Japan's 60 billion dollar  trade surplus with the U.S.    Washington has been pressuring Tokyo to whittle down the  lopsided trade surplus by setting up objective criteria, such as  numerical targets to gauge foreign access to the Japanese  market. Japan, however, is opposed to the idea, saying it would  lead to managed trade.    The bilateral "framework" talks in Washington in February  broke down due to differences over the matter.    As for domestic politics, Hosokawa said he wants to promote  his plan to establish a study group within the coalition, saying  it is important for coalition partners to fine-tune common ideas  to fight elections.    Hosokawa's plan to form a study group involving all seven  coalition parties is believed to be a preliminary stage before  establishing a new party to fight off the leading opposition  Liberal Democratic Party in the next general election. The  coming election is likely to be held under a new system mixing  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation.</p>

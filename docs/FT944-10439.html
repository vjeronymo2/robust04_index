			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: A Dollars 1.7bn marriage that faces a bumpy ride - Investors have doubts over Quaker Oats' purchase of Snapple They make an odd couple. On the one hand is Quaker Oats, a 103-year-old US cereal manufacturer whose name is synonymous with porridge. On the other is Snapple Beverage, a trendy soft drinks company that has shot to prominence in the US through the phenomenal success of its 'new age' iced tea and juice drinks. Will the marriage work? Last week Quaker Oats announced it was paying Dollars 1.7bn in cash to buy Snapple. The acquisition, it said, would turn Quaker Oats into the biggest soft drinks company in the US after Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and accelerate future profits growth. But if it had hoped for a favourable reaction from the stock market, it was to be disappointed: its shares tumbled Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 on the day, a fall of nearly 10 per cent. The Snapple acquisition may be the biggest in Quaker's history, but it is not the first. Since the 1960s, the company has diversified into other business areas, including fast-food restaurants, specialty retailing and toy manufacturing, only to get out again. But in 1983 it struck lucky when it bought Stokely-Van Camp, a US food company that made Gatorade, a sports drink. Thanks to a combination of changing tastes among increasingly health-conscious US consumers and heavy investment in the brand by Quaker Oats, sales of Gatorade shot up. In 1983 they were barely Dollars 90m; in the current financial year, they are expected to be Dollars 1.2bn. But Gatorade's meteoric performance has not been matched by that of the group's other products, mainly cereals and pet foods. Here, Quaker Oats has been doing little better than holding its own in the face of tough competition from bigger rivals, and overall profits growth has been flaccid. The business logic for the Snapple acquisition looks straightforward enough. With Gatorade, Quaker Oats is already the US market leader in sports drinks. With Snapple's trendy Mango Iced Tea, Amazin' Grape Juice and the like, Quaker Oats will also become market leader in ready-to-drink iced teas and juice drinks. So Quaker Oats becomes market leader in the three fastest-growing beverage segments in the US. Further, Quaker Oats believes it can gain by feeding Snapple through Gatorade's distribution channels. Snapple sells mainly through corner stores and delicatessens, and has barely 1 per cent of its sales outside the US. Gatorade, in contrast, sells through convenience stores and supermarkets, and sells in more than 25 countries. Quaker Oats also announced it would offset part of the cost of buying Snapple by selling its European pet food and Mexican chocolate businesses. (Analysts think they may fetch around Dollars 700m.) Mr William Smithburg, chairman and chief executive of Quaker Oats, said this was in keeping with the company's policy of improving the profitability of lower-return businesses, or divesting them. 'Our goal is to deliver above-average returns over time with a high-growth, high-margin portfolio of leading consumer brands that fuel health-conscious consumers around the world,' Mr Smithburg said. So why the fall in the share price? Partly, it was because Quaker Oats will look a good deal less vulnerable to a takeover bid than before - but for the worst of reasons. Perhaps the biggest is the fact that news of the deal coincided with the publication of Snapple's latest financial results showing that net profits had slumped from Dollars 26.9m to Dollars 7.1m in the quarter to September. Quaker Oats tried to play down concern over the figures. Snapple's annual sales had grown from Dollars 40m to Dollars 600m in four years, it said, and it was not unusual for a company growing that quickly to hit a few bumps along the road. In this case, inventory build-ups had slowed factory shipments, merchandising costs were up, and competition caused iced tea sales to be lower than expected. Yet Snapple's potential difficulties cannot be ignored. One danger is that 'good-for-you' beverages could be just a fad; but much the larger threat is that the mighty Coca-Cola and PepsiCo - acutely aware of the fact that their colas are losing market share to alternative drinks - will plunder the market for 'new age' beverages and squeeze Snapple till the pips squeak. The warning signs are already there. PepsiCo, in a joint venture with Unilever's Thomas J. Lipton tea company, has launched Lipton iced tea, and Coca-Cola, in a joint venture with Nestle of Switzerland, has launched Nestea. In March this year Coca-Cola introduced its own range of 'new age' fruit drinks, such as Raspberry Psychic Lemonade and Grape Beyond, and PepsiCo has launched a range of lemonade drinks called Ocean Spray. Meanwhile, Gatorade is also under siege. Coca-Cola is attacking its market with a sports drink called Powerade and PepsiCo with All Sport. Ominously, Quaker Oats suffered a slump in net profits to Dollars 61.4m from Dollars 91.4m in the quarter to September, partly because it had to spend more on marketing to defend Gatorade from competition. Quaker Oats has acknowledged that the Snapple acquisition would dilute earnings per share by 45 cents to 55 cents in the year to June 1996. It has also said the deal would not begin to benefit the bottom line until the year to June 1998. If the share price is down, it is because some investors wonder whether even that could turn out to be too rosy a prognosis.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National sets Pounds 650m record ABBEY National, the UK banking group, raised Pounds 650m worth of 10-year Eurobonds yesterday, setting a new record for a single Eurosterling transaction in the international bond market. The previous record holder was the Kingdom of Sweden which raised Pounds 600m in a five-year issue last November. The issue was increased by Pounds 200m in early January. Abbey National is the latest UK borrower to lock into the country's lowest interest rates since the 1970s. Last week, British Gas raised Pounds 400m in the international bond market at an average fixed interest rate of just under 8 per cent and an average maturity of 8 1/2 years. Demand for longer-dated sterling paper enabled Abbey National to raise the size of its issue from an original Pounds 500m. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 8 per cent, were priced to yield 8.16 per cent or 50 basis points over the 8 per cent UK gilt due 2003. There was a view in the market that the bonds were generously priced and that Abbey National could have sold the bonds with a yield spread in the mid-40s. However, an official at S. G. Warburg, which arranged the deal with Goldman Sachs, said that the spread took into consideration the sheer size of the issue. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened to 48 basis points in mid-afternoon, but this reflected a slightly weaker gilt price. Mr Jonathan Nicholls, director of corporate finance and capital markets at Abbey National, said that he did not intend to swap the proceeds from yesterday's issue since he was happy with the fixed rate on the bonds. Yesterday's issue, which brings Abbey National's borrowings in the international bond market since the start of the year to just over Pounds 1bn, considerably lengthened the bank's debt maturity profile. At the end of 1992, only Pounds 386m out of its bonds and notes totalling Pounds 7.15bn were repayable in more than five years. The proceeds of the issue will be used for the bank's general funding purposes. Some analysts said that its 10-year maturity gave the bank leeway to supply mortgages at a time when retail deposits were falling as a result of the drop in interest rates. Mr Nicholls said Abbey's decision to raise such a large sum in one go reflected an awareness among borrowers that investors increasingly prefer bonds which are highly liquid. 'It does appear that investors like large issues,' he said. Size was also a feature in the D-Mark sector as the European Investment Bank doubled the amount of its seven-year Eurobonds, launched on Tuesday, to DM1bn. The terms remained the same. An official at the lead manager WestLB said that the issuer had been encouraged by the demand shown from the Far East overnight. The yield spread on the bonds was unchanged yesterday, at eight basis points over comparable German government bonds. The Eurodollar sector attracted more borrowers, as LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance raised Dollars 500m through a five-year issue priced to yield 18 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged. An official at the lead manager CSFB said that LKB's new issue offered slight pick-up over LKB's five-year Eurodollar bonds launched last December. The European Coal and Steel Community also tapped the Eurodollar sector for Dollars 100m. An official at the lead manager Salomon Brothers said that it would take some time to fully place the issue due to its limited liquidity and its unusual maturity of 15 years. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has assigned an investment grade rating of Baa3 to the Czech National Bank's Dollars 300m three-year Eurobond issue, which was launched last week.</p>

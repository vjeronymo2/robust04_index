			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Issues the campaign forgot The temptation to vote green today is almost overwhelming. We learned yesterday that the atmosphere over Europe lost about a fifth of its protective ozone layer during the winter. This does not quite amount to an ozone hole, but the figures square with the scientists' expectation that winter losses in the northern hemisphere will double over the next decade. A threat of such a magnitude is of greater importance than a prolonged debate about whether it would be right for the Labour party to tax away an extra fifth of the marginal incomes of individuals earning more than Pounds 40,000 a year. In the former case, we are talking about, at the least, a general addition to the incidence of skin cancer. The most serious effect of Labour's tax increases would be to squeeze middle-income earners. Likewise, the prospect that the earth summit in Rio this summer will be a fiasco matters a lot. The perverse correlation between the Conservatives' protestations that they are tough on crime and the steep rise in reported misdemeanours matters only a little. The first has to do with the long-term health of the planet; the second is largely about breaking into parked cars. Unfortunately, Britain's leaderless Green party comes across as such a weird collection of disorganised dreamers that even the deepest sympathiser with the environmental movement must hesitate before deciding whether to support it. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats would protest that there is no need to do so. Oh yes? It is true that protestations of good intent on the environment appear in the manifestos of all three national parties, but beyond that the subject has been ignored. Come to think of it, several of the other serious issues that governments will have to face in the 1990s have not arisen in the campaign. For example, no big party has chosen to educate the public about the demographic projections for the next 10 to 20 years. Yet during that time, Britain, in common with continental western Europe and North America, will have to find the funds to keep an increasingly elderly population alive, housed and fed. Labour has bid for the grey vote with a shameless dispersal of higher pensions to every retired person regardless of how wealthy she or he may be. The Conservatives are seducing present-day earners into private pensions. The Lib Dems have plans that I would take the trouble to look up if I thought they had any chance of forming a government. But there has been no proper exposition of the underlying actuarial forecasts. Growth itself is another more immediately pressing concern that has not received the attention it deserves. For neither the nature nor the pace of economic development can be taken for granted. This is true of both the medium-term and the immediate future. Whoever walks into the Treasury to take the chancellorship tomorrow may find apologetic officials wringing their hands and confessing that, sorry, the forecasts presented in Mr Norman Lamont's budget last month are not exactly right. The government may have to borrow, not Pounds 28bn as then hazarded, but thirtysomething billion. If the recession is made abroad, as the Conservatives say it is, the new administration will have to wait for the foreigners to take us out of it. How, then are the growth rates assumed in the Red Book accompanying Mr Lamont's statement to be achieved? The figure of Pounds 28bn looks like an underestimate. This theme has been explored during the campaign, but not sufficiently. What the election debate has taught us is that the contemporary democratic process is perverted by the need to work in sound-bites. The big set-piece press conferences - on recession, recovery, health, education, foreign affairs, crime, and housing - have all begun with the reading out of short, easily digestible statements and concluded with the TV cameras watching journalists ask limited questions. In these circumstances, there is little prospect of presenting even the outlines of an argument about such complicated matters as the environment, the aging population, or long-term growth rates. This is not what the voter is thought to want to know about. The Scots can understand talk of the end of the English ascendancy, but very few people will listen to, let alone consider, wider propositions on constitutional reform. None of the leading politicians has been able to give a second's thought to such genuine problems. Over the past few weeks, Labour shadow ministers have been bemused when asked about a possible re-alignment of the Left; they had that day's homework to do and could hardly get through it. The Conservatives spent their time trying to get coherence into their daily tactics. The Liberal Democrat leader demonstrated his skill at being in three places at once. The ozone layer and the advancing hordes of frail, poverty-stricken old ladies looking for income support could go hang. Growth was something not to think about, but to promise, for that may win votes. Thank heavens we are back to the real world next week.</p>

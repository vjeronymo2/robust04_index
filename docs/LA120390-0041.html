			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: HANDICAP NOT LEST YE BE HANDICAPPED  </P> <P> It frequently amuses me (well, make that amazes me) how Hollywood enjoys  picking the nit off the bones of upcoming films before they are confirmed  casualties. There is a gleeful advance body count of every film on the horizon  except for the consensus can't-misses, some of which eventually do miss.  </P> <P> This Hollywood necrophilia all came racing to mind as I read "Hollywood Holiday  Derby" (Nov. 14) in which anonymous experts raced to the gates to be the first  in line to get in a doomsday stab at some unsuspecting new movie.  </P> <P> And there, low and behold, in the very last paragraph is a first on-the-block  requiem for a holiday film to which I make my own small contribution and which  I had, until I read this obviously knowledgeable sad tiding, thought was a very  good little film. Who am I to argue with these funeral directors who must see  all new films in special screenings at Forest Lawn, although most don't even  pretend to have seen them?  </P> <P> The deck on Elaine Dutka's article began "Handicappers Set Early Line." And I  realized that in a town not known for apt titles, someone had finally hit the  nail on the head. These experts, these "handicappers," are the real handicap  for new films. If any art form ever required an open mind and a closed mouth  until the work had a chance to prove or disprove itself, it is the motion  picture . . . a fragile concoction of fluff and passion in which the most  important element, as the "Ghost" ad campaign reminds us, is that "you will  believe."  </P> <P> In regard to our own film, "Mr. Johnson" (which was scheduled for a Christmas  release but will now open in February), I must admit that I did believe, and  still do (the dark prognosis of Dutka's expert handicapper notwithstanding). It  was, after all, directed by Bruce Beresford, who directed last year's  Oscar-winning best film, "Driving Miss Daisy" (with nary a nomination of his  own to show for the effort).  </P> <P> Bruce made a believer of me, and so did the script, a literate adaptation of  the Joyce Carey novel. It is a delicate exploration of the tidal zone between  two very different cultures and the pull the opposite culture has on two  dramatically different men. I hasten to add that my own role is very happily in  support of a brilliant young African actor, Maynard Eziashi. When I finally saw  "Mr. Johnson," his brave, insightful performance turned my belief into positive  conviction.  </P> <P> But what did Dutka's article conclude about "Mr. Johnson"?  </P> <P> "No word at all on Bruce Beresford's 'Mr. Johnson' . . . but referring to its  setting of road building in west Africa in the 1920s, one producer quipped:  'They ought to put speed bumps in the aisle . . . to prevent people from  leaving in droves.' "  </P> <P> No word -- just a quip. This anonymous producer (an Oscar-winning anonymous  producer, one might presume, if one were generous) was writing an obituary for  a film by a major filmmaker based on an eight-word capsulization of the film's  setting . . . capsulized by whom?  </P> <P> How might one have capsulized the setting of Beresford's "Miss Daisy," "Tender  Mercies" or "Breaker Morant"? And would the conclusions have been any less  ungenerous?  </P> <P> One might have fun with a Hollywood parlor game in which players have to  identify classic films by an eight-word deprecatory description of the film's  setting.  </P> <P> Actually, this one producer had it exactly wrong. Our problem with "Mr.  Johnson" will not be in keeping people in their seats, but rather in getting  them into those seats.  </P> <P> The intelligent audience, open to some new insights into the human spirit, will  be well satisfied once paired with "Mr. Johnson." But, as with many delicate  and different films, the challenge is to find a way to convey the movie's  specialness to them in advance, to convey to them that Beresford does it again,  which I believe he does.  </P> <P> This challenge, common to all distinctive films, is not made easier by  Hollywood's penchant for "handicapping" so many upcoming releases with glib  disregard. How many people went on record last year predicting that "Miss  Daisy" and "Look Who's Talking" would be among the year's giant winners?  </P> <P> Why are expectations of disaster considered so amusing? People in the industry  should be encouraging and be delighted when a movie maker dares to be  different. They should be cognizant that the accuracy of these filmic  death-wishes is probably substantially less than they might enjoy in calling  the flip of a coin.  </P> <P> And as they go off merrily to ring the bad-news bells, they might remember John  Donne's caution as to for whom the bell tolls.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The chairman of the  Japanese Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Keigo Ouchi, today  announced his resignation, assuming responsibility for the  formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group, which caused the  DSP to leave the ruling coalition and thus created Japan's first  minority government in 39 years.    He told an extraordinary session of the DSP's central  executive committee that he would quit his post at the party  convention next week, the local press reported.    Ouchi, 64, had been under pressure to step down and take  responsibility for helping to create Kaishin.    The DSP is likely to select its General Secretary Takashi  Yonezawa as Ouchi's successor, the local press quoted party  sources as saying.    Ouchi, who is health and welfare minister in the government,  has said he wants to concentrate on his duties in that post  after formally quitting as party chairman.    The DSP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and three other  parties formed Kaishin, an inter-party voting block, shortly  after Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata was elected prime minister  on April 25 in succession to Morihiro Hosokawa. Kaishin, the  brain-child of coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, was viewed as  the first step in a long-awaited political realignment in Japan.    But the DSP, angry that Kaishin had been formed without its  being consulted, quit the coalition and thus left Hata with a  minority government.</p>

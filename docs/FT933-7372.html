			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: The smallest tax haven - A look at an under-exploited source of exemptions: children LOOKING FOR a tax haven? Thinking of an exotic faraway location like the Caymans or Bermuda? Think again. The most economical tax shelter of all could be sitting across the table from you eating Sugar Puffs. Children are still an under-exploited source of tax exemptions, even though the opportunities for financial family planning have been cut back in recent years. From the moment of birth, every child is entitled to the same income and capital gains tax allowances as an adult. Hence, in this tax year, a child can receive income of Pounds 3,445 and make gains of Pounds 5,800 without paying tax. If a 40 per cent taxpayer can divert income and gains of that magnitude to his child, the family will save a total of Pounds 3,698 (40 per cent of Pounds 3,445 plus Pounds 5,800). This would be a beautifully simple way of being generous to your kids and cocking a snook at the taxman simultaneously - were it not for one big snag. The Inland Revenue anticipated the scope for tax avoidance and decreed, years ago, that income transferred by a parent to an unmarried child under 18 would continue to be taxed as the parent's. A small concession is that this rule is not invoked where the income arising in a financial year does not exceed Pounds 100. So, if a child's allowance is to be utilised, somebody other than mum and dad will have to provide the cash. The prime candidates will usually be grandparents, although donations from members of the extended family will no doubt be equally welcome. The ideal solution is for grandpa to transfer income-producing assets into a trust for the benefit of his grandchildren. Provided the trust is structured properly, the income can be applied to paying school fees or meeting other living expenses, and the children's personal allowances can be utilised fully. If grandpa wants to hold on to his capital, though, the tax-saving opportunity will be lost. It used to be possible to enter into a seven-year deed of covenant, the effect of which was to transfer gross income to the recipient, but the loophole was closed in 1988. Another piece of tax legislation has made it a great deal more difficult to take advantage of a child's CGT exemption. The usual rule is that a person who gives away an asset is taxed as if he had sold it at market value. But if both donor and donee agreed, the CGT liability could be 'held over.' Basically, this means the donor pays no tax and the donee inherits the donor's CGT base value. Unfortunately, the categories of assets which can be held over have been curtailed severely. Only shares or interests in private companies now qualify - quoted shares and real estate do not. Hence, the old trick of giving a child an asset which was 'pregnant' with capital gains, and sheltering the gain inside the child's annual exemption, no longer works - unless the parent owns some unquoted shares. How else can the CGT exemption be utilised? One way would be to 'stag' new issues on the child's behalf. Even if the funds are provided by a parent, the gains will still be taxed as the child's: there is no CGT equivalent of the rule nullifying the transfer of income. If sufficient monies are available, investments can be made on the child's behalf. The emphasis should be on low-cost products rather than more expensive, tax-driven alternatives. There is no point in paying for tax efficiency if the likely returns will be sheltered by the youngster's exemptions, anyway. Logic points in favour of something as straightforward as an investment trust savings scheme rather than one of the more complex insurance-related products. Since all these arrangements involve making gifts, the inheritance tax implications will need to be considered. But IHT rarely will be a reason for not proceeding with an otherwise tax-effective gift. Most gifts will be potentially-exempt transfers, and those which are not should be covered by annual and other exemptions or, as a last resort, the Pounds 150,000 nil rate band. Families planning to exploit their progeny's tax capacity must understand that children have to be allowed to retain any cash or assets given to them. Any attempt to set up a circular arrangement for the benefit of the parent would fall foul of anti-avoidance guidelines laid down by the courts.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Reporters Liu Lihua (0491 5461 5478) and Su Tong </F> (5685 1749): "When Shareholding Enterprises Distribute Stocks  and Dividends, Individuals and Legal Persons Gain Their Profits,  But Do State-Owned Stocks Gain Their Due Share?"]    [Text] Jilin has transformed some state-owned enterprises  in line with the shareholding system in a planned manner in  order to rationalize enterprises' property right relations.  This measure has enabled some enterprises to gradually  extricate themselves from their longstanding status as  subordinates to the government and to maintain and increase the  value of most of the state-owned assets. However, in the actual  process of operating such a mixed economy, loss of state-owned  assets resulting from the establishment of state-owned stocks  merely in name exists in some enterprises at varying degrees.  Pertinent persons asked: Who should represent the state-owned  stocks, which account for 50 percent of the capital stock? Who  should protect their interests?    The loss of state-owned assets in shareholding enterprises  is  reflected mainly in the evidently unfair distribution of  dividends in addition to the underestimation of the value of  state-owned assets in the process of the transformation in line  with the shareholding system. For instance, state-owned stocks  are excluded in enterprises' distribution of dividends; even if  dividends are distributed to state-owned stocks, different rates  are applied in violation of the principle of same rights and  same profits for same stocks, with the dividends to the stocks  owned by individuals and legal persons usually higher than those  to state-owned stocks; enterprises seldom open special accounts  of the dividends distributed to state-owned stocks or turn the  dividends over to the departments in charge of state-owned  asset, and most of the dividends are used by enterprises without  reimbursement; when distributing stocks, shareholding  enterprises apply different measures to state-owned stocks,  legal person stocks, and individual stocks, either demanding  abandonment of the right of state-owned stocks to be distributed  with stocks and transferring the right to individual stock  holders, or distributing cash dividends to state-owned stocks  and stock dividends to other stock holders according to the face  value of the stocks, or even distributing no stocks to  state-owned stocks.    The above-mentioned situation is common nationwide, but the  basic reason for enterprises' practice to disregard the rights  and interests of state-owned assets, infringe on state  interests, and cause the loss of state-owned assets lies in the  stagnation of the reform of the state-owned asset management  system. According to the analysis by pertinent persons, the  function of ownership of state-owned assets is divided by  various departments of the government, which take charge of  state-owned assets from different angles, but none of which hold  total and ultimate responsibility. This has led to a blend of  government functions and asset management function and a blend  of government functions and enterprise management, making the  government take charge of too much of the things they should not  have managed and fail to manage what they should have managed.  The direct influence of this problem on the enterprises  experimenting with the shareholding system is reflected in the  failure in personifying the representatives of the rights to  state-owned stocks. In form, representatives of the rights to  state-owned stocks are assigned by state-owned bureaus, but the  status, responsibility, and rights of these "representatives"  have not been personified because the state-owned asset  management system and responsibility system have yet to take  shape. In some enterprises, the chairmen of the boards of  directors are representatives of the state-owned assets, but  they often exercise their duties as the chairmen of the boards  of directors and forget about their duties as the  representatives of the rights to state-owned stocks. Because of  this, it is very difficult to appoint and appraise the chairmen  and directors of the boards of directors and to fine appropriate  persons to hold the responsibility for the management and  operation of assets. In addition, there is also the problem  that state-owned stocks and other stocks enjoy different rights.  Stocks owned by individuals and legal persons are permitted to  transfer and trade in the market, but state-owned stocks are  not. No doubt, this is an unfair treatment to state-owned  assets, and such a treatment is also harmful to maintaining and  increasing the value of state-owned assets.    Pertinent departments have given the "prescription" to  personify the representatives of state-owned stocks as soon as  possible and enable state-owned stocks to enjoy the same rights  and same profits as other stocks, namely to adjust the  relationship within and outside enterprises and establish a  brand-new standardized operating mechanism of enterprises.  First, we should separate the function of ownership of  state-owned assets from the administrative function as soon as  possible and establish special organs to operate state-owned  assets, which are authorized by the government to serve as  representatives of state-owned assets to take charge of the  operation, profit-making, and transfer of state-owned assets.  Large enterprise groups and extra large enterprises may be  directly authorized by the government to manage state-owned  assets. Second, we should further improve the internal  management system of shareholding enterprises so that their  rights and profits will conform to their responsibilities and  they are operated in line with the standardized requirements.  Decisions should be made in a democratic manner to ensure that  they are scientific. Meanwhile, we should step up efforts to  draw up necessary laws and regulations on the shareholding  system to make it more transparent and to enhance the  supervision over it by public opinion.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JESSIE MAE BEAVERS; HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONER, SENTINEL EDITOR, ACTIVIST  </P> <P> Jessie Mae Beavers, who as a girl spent her summers in segregated camps but  grew up to become a quiet yet forceful activist in one of the nation's most  integrated cities, died Wednesday of cancer.  </P> <P> The 16-year member of Los Angeles' Human Relations Commission who edited the  family section of the Los Angeles Sentinel, a black-oriented newspaper, for  many years was 68 when she died at Good Samaritan Hospital.  </P> <P> Mrs. Beavers, who wrote for the Sentinel under her maiden name of Brown, came  to maturity in this city when the YWCA scheduled separate weeks at camp for its  black members. When she enrolled at UCLA a few years later, blacks were not  allowed to live on campus.  </P> <P> Yet she said those experiences left her not bitter but determined.  </P> <P> "I was just glad I'd been accepted (at UCLA)," she said in an interview four  years ago. After UCLA, where she majored in sociology, she went to work for the  state's then premier black newspaper, the California Eagle, moving to the  Sentinel in 1948 where she remained until her death. She was an unsuccessful  candidate for the 10th District City Council seat in 1987.  </P> <P> She helped organize the local chapter of the National Assn. of Media Women and  the Black Women's Forum, worked for the Children's Home Society, the NAACP,  conducted workshops at the request of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, served in  Maureen Reagan's delegation to the International Conference of Women in Africa  and interviewed nearly all of the black and many of the white political leaders  of her day.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley named her to the city Human Relations Commission early in his  Administration, and on Thursday the mayor remembered her as "one of the  thousand points of light in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who had appointed her to the Los Angeles Music and  Performing Arts Commission, said Mrs. Beavers "not only cared about her  community, but she got involved in making Los Angeles a better place for all  people."  </P> <P> Survivors include her husband, Leroy Beavers Sr., a son and two daughters.  </P> <P> A funeral service is scheduled Monday at 10 a.m. at the Second Baptist Church,  2412 Griffith Ave.  </P> <P> * ADDITIONAL OBITUARIES: Other obituaries on Page 28.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Dalbah] </F>   [Text] Tunis -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn  Sulayman Abu-Salih has ruled out his country's participation in  the multilateral talks at the present time. In an interview  with AL-DUSTUR while attending the 30th Organization of African  Unity [OAU] summit, the Sudanese foreign minister said that  Israel is supplying the rebel movement in southern Sudan with  weapons. He said: We call for ending foreign interference.  He added: How can you ask me to hold negotiations with you  while you stab me in the back and harm me?    He said: If there is a genuine approach to peace and  noninterference in the affairs of others, and if there is to be  coexistence, then all causes for harm, war, and sedition must be  eliminated. Only then, can we hold dialogue within a political  body of scholars, intellectuals, and others. Until then, it is  impossible to think about that.    On the southern Sudanese problem and the rebellion led by  John Garang, he said that foreign assistance comes from across  the Sudanese-Ugandan border where he has a very narrow strip of  a few km long. There are contacts with Uganda on not having any  party carry out actions that harm the other party, or offering  any kind of services that facilitate the passage of weapons or  other things. This will help expedite the attainment of peace.    On the relationship with the United States in light of the  visit by U.S. Envoy Melissa Wells to Khartoum, Abu-Salih said  that at one time the West, in general, was prejudiced against  the present Sudanese government. He said: I believe that this  was the result of false information. He added: Our people  have never wished to antagonize the West and have never  boycotted it. Our people believe that there should be many  fields of cooperation with the West such as cooperaton in  development, economy, science and technology, and other fields.  We refuse any kind of high-handed approach, domination, or  interference in Sudan's domestic affairs. In view of the  misleading information, the West, at one time, adopted a  pressurizing stand toward Sudan by not holding any talks or  dialogue with the Sudanese government in order to remove it.  Abu-Salih accused the British government of giving the United  States an erroneous picture about Sudan. He said: The United  Kingdom did a lot to spread rumors and disseminate misleading  information that distorted Sudan's image and portrayed Sudan in  a bad light. That's why the dialogue with the Americans is  aimed at giving a true picture about Sudan in terms of its  cooperation with others.    Abu-Salih said that dialogue was initiated following the  visit by the U.S. UN Envoy Madeleine Albright to Khartoum  earlier this year. This means that there is someone who is now  willing to listen. The mere holding of a serious dialogue makes  us hopful of reaching some formula for cooperation with a major  country like the United States.    Abu-Salih said he believes the pressure the United States  and  the West used to put on Sudan had to do with Sudan's stand on  the Arab- Israeli conflict.    He said: I will speak frankly. The Americans used to  believe that we would lead the Arab and Islamic opposition, and  all those who oppose a settlement with the Israelis. That's why  they placed us on the terrorist list. Abu-Salih said that  Albright emerged from her visit with a good impression. He said  Albright discussed with Sudanese officials her belief that Sudan  harbors terrorism. We told her that all these accusations are  baseless. This impression can only be enhanced through further  dialogue, contacts, and visits. Abu-Salih said: The Sudanese,  by nature, are against terrorism. We can wage war against you,  but we will never harm innocent people.    Abu-Salih added: The Americans used to think that the  camps that we have for training the popular defense to support  the Sudanese Army were camps for training foreigners to  destabilize other countries.    Abu-Salih said his government challenges anyone to prove  that  a single foreigner was trained in Sudan. We are hurt when  others interfere in our affairs. Therefore, we do not interfere  in the affairs of others. He referred, in this context, to the  relationship with Iran. He said the United States and other  Western and non-Western nations speak about Sudan as if it were  under Iranian control or a base for Iran. This is not true.  Our relationship with Iran is similar to our relationship with  any Western country, and that is all. However, it is totally  untrue to say that Sudan is under the control of Iran or in the  grip of Iran. Perhaps, I would not be revealing a secret if I  said that our relationship with Iran was sometimes weaker than  our relationship with some Western nations and that our  cooperation with some Western nations was greater than that with  Iran.    Abu-Salih added: The visits of Albright and then Melissa  Wells represent the beginning of dialogue between us and the  Americans. The visits were made at a time when we asked the  neighboring states, such as Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia, to  observe the implementation of peace. Of course, we consult with  the U.S. ambassador in Khartoum and with the neighboring states  to achieve this purpose.    He added that he had asked the Americans about how to come  up  with a realistic formula for unity in Sudan that can be  protected and maintained and how to please all Sudanese within  the context of equality, sovereignty, justice, and no  discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, and tribal  affiliation. He said: In order to reach this formula, we have  made many concessions. This is why we asked for not using the  terms secular and nonsecular. We are about to prepare our  document on sharing of power and resources and providing  everything for the citizens to ensure success. Abu-Salih  explained that Sudan had asked the Americans to benefit from  their experts regarding the federal system and to give Sudan a  plan and a model to enable it to arrive at this formula in a  multilingual, multiracial Sudan. We want to maintain the  Sudanese identity and we want citizenship to be the basis of  participation. However, the movement that is led by Garang,  which is linked to foreign powers, does not wish to see a  solution through.    On the relationship with Egypt in light of the dispute over  the Hala'ib region, the Sudanese foreign minister said the  relationship should be distinguished and integral, even a  relationship of unity. However, this cannot be achieved without  removing the differences between the two countries. He said  there are three issues that should be addressed:    The first has to do with Egypt's occupation of Hala'ib. The  Egyptians do not like to talk about this issue. We are talking  about a triangle and this means a piece of land. However, the  Egyptians are talking about parallel 22, which is not an expanse  of land.    The area of Hala'ib amounts to 36,000 square km. According  to the Sudanese foreign minister, Hala'ib is Sudanese land  because there are Sudanese tribes in it that use a non-Arabic  language. No one in Egypt speaks any language other than  Arabic. Hala'ib is also considered a Sudanese electoral  constituency. They told us that they plan to have two  constituencies at Hala'ib. However, Egyptian legislators and  lawmen talk about the annexation of Hala'ib. This means Hala'ib  is a usurped piece of Sudan. Had it been Egyptian territory, it  would have been part of Egyptian constituencies a long time ago.  The question of Hala'ib was raised in 1958, but the late  Egyptian President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir froze the issue at the  time after showing understanding of the situation and  withdrawing the Egyptian troops.    Abu-Salih revealed that the Egyptian military presence in  Hala'ib had taken place with Sudan's approval as Sudan has given  Egypt 10 observation posts there, and that the Egyptians are now  occupying these 10 posts.    Abu-Salih stressed that Sudan accepts any Arab mediation or  arbitration, or the referral of the issue to the International  Court of Justice because we have a right to that area. Sudan is  not made up of Hala'ib only. Sudan's area is around 1 million  square miles. But what has pained us is that Hala'ib has been  taken by force. We are against such a method and this issue  must be settled. He said he changed his mind about submitting  the Hala'ib issue for discussion at the OAU summit after some  African countries advised him that it would be better if other  parties do not intervene between Sudan and Egypt. He said: We  withdrew the issue but insisted that there should be  negotiations and a solution, and that Hala'ib is Sudanese.    Abu-Salih said that following the meeting between Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak and his Sudanese counterpart 'Umar al-  Bashir, the two countries' foreign ministers were charged with  studying the issue and proposing a solution. He said that he  went to Egypt seven times to discuss the issue with Egyptian  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who, as yet, has not paid a single  visit to Sudan. He stressed that, for sure, this issue is one  of occupation. We do not want to exacerbate the situation. But,  like so many others, we do not want to keep Hala'ib under  occupation. The Hala'ib issue might lead to many things. It  may bring about war. However, he said that both parties act in a  calm manner although there are Egyptian and Sudanese troops in  the area.    Abu-Salih said: The second issue deals with the Sudanese  opposition. The Egyptians say that Egypt is the mother of all  and that they cannot refuse any demand. However, Abu-Salih said  that this does not mean that everyone should be given the right  to write in the opposition press, participate in its actvities,  or finance it. He said that this issue in Egyptian-Sudanese  relations is a secondary issue.    The Sudanese minister said that the third and very important  issue is that of trust between Egypt and Sudan. Abu-Salih  stressed that there is no trust between the two sides. Egypt  does not trust the ruling regime in Sudan and says that it is a  regime which represents the Islamic National Front. We also do  not trust them. Abu-Salih said that had it not been for the  Sudanese people's support for the ideas and concepts of the  present regime in Sudan, which have been discussed in more than  25 conferences on political, social, peace, and economic issues,  the present regime in Sudan would not have remained in power.    Abu-Salih sharply criticized they way in which Cairo deals  with the regime in Sudan. They say that this is al-Turabi's  government or the regime of Hasan al-Turabi, and speak only  about Egypt's interests, Egypt's history, and Egyptian  sacrifices. This means they do not trust us, and we also do not  trust them. Had they wanted relations to retun to normal, they  would have exchanged visits with us. They want us to hold  discussions and dialogue with them but they refuse to have such  discussions in Khartoum or in any other Arab or nonArab country?  They do not want to discuss things with us. He said: There  is no doubt that Egyptian officials are under the illusion that  the Sudanese government might collapse at any moment. They will  deal with the government on which they can impose their will.  But, we say that our government is there to stay and will  fight. This also means that there will be rivers of blood if  this government does not fall.</p>

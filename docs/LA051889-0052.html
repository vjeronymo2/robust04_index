			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A new California Poll has bad news for radio and television networks. About 61%  of the respondents are unhappy with radio and TV coverage of elections, and 68%  favor a ban on projecting winners before the polls have closed on the West  Coast. An even greater majority, 73%, favor a uniform closing time so that  everyone nationwide finishes voting at the same time. That figure slipped to  63%, however, if the plan meant that polls in California would close an hour  earlier, at 7 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. The survey of 1,018 California adults was  conducted April 13-22.

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Arts: Dance in 'Death in Venice' - Covent Garden Covent Garden's new staging of Death in Venice deserves its acclaim. Anyone interested in movement must particularly rejoice in Philip Langridge's Gustav von Aschenbach, even more full of beautifully expressive detail in stance and gesture than his recent Captain Vere and Peter Grimes. My brief, however, is to talk of the staging's new dances. Kim Brandstrup's choreography is unobtrusive, well-made and in no respect interesting. It fits tactfully into the overall scheme of things, but it makes Tadzio appear a creature of thoroughly finite variety. His dances are an array of half-a-dozen movement motifs that seldom coalesce into a phrase. As a result everyone can see that young Giacomo Ciriaci is very pretty, but no one can be sure how good a dancer he is. And he looks very real. Tadzio's music, inspired by the tintinabulations of the Javanese gamelan, is unmistakeably Other; it shows that he exists on a different plane. And in this respect Brandstrup's choreography is unmusical. The biggest disappointment occurs at the end. As Tadzio summons Aschenbach's soul into the horizon, the music evokes the end of Mahler's Lied von der Erde. This Tadzio, however, just swings his legs and strikes a static classic pose. It was just here that Frederick Ashton's choreography for the original production was most masterly. His Tadzio slowly swam through flowing classical poses, travelling as if in slow motion into the distance. Ashton's dances were generally the least admired feature of the original staging - partly because the first Tadzio, Robert Huguenin, with thighs too powerful to make sense of the role's boyishness, looked too knowing, and partly because, as Ashton remarked, Britten was not interested in writing dance music. Brandstrup has had the same problem with the pentathlon dances in Act I as Ashton had in 1973: the music asks for activity too literal to be interesting as dance. I saw the old staging in 1973, '75 and '78; the latter revival was when Ashton's dances came into their own. The Tadzio then, Douglas Howes, was not a classic pretty-boy type, and his serenely excellent dancing and exceptionally innocent manner made new sense of the choreography's classicism. Even the beach dances seemed to have doubled in substance. Ballet, said Balanchine, is Woman; and it is essentially a heterosexual art. The woman dances on pointe; the man does not. He partners her. She can do more than he. The positions may not be reversed without a diminution of the art's classical dimension. The danseur is human, the ballerina becomes an allegory. Ashton usually followed these principles. But in the ending of Death in Venice is a boy who summons the poet into eternity. This is really the gay equivalent of the end of Stravinsky's ballet Le Baiser de la Fee, in which the fairy (or muse) leads the hero (or poet) into her eternal kingdom. When Death in Venice was new, Nureyev and Dowell had won for the male dancer a status equal to the ballerina. One may not altogether enjoy that; 'The era of the ballerina is over,' remarked Fonteyn. But it gave a special significance to Ashton's finale to Death in Venice that is absent from Brandstrup's new choreography. Ashton's Tadzio was male and a ballerina.</p>

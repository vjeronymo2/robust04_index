			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japan offer on rice imports JAPAN took an important political step towards the opening of the rice market yesterday when Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa suggested it could allow rice imports without seriously damaging farm incomes, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. Mr Miyazawa did not clearly state the rice market would be opened, but indicated that tariffication, the replacement of the present ban with a tariff regime, seemed necessary to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round trade talks. Tokyo would consider ways to protect farmers' livelihoods if tariffication were accepted, he added, suggesting some farmers could switch to other crops.</p>

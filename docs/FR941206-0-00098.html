Proficiency Testing of Individuals Who Examine Gynecological Preparations (&sect;493.855)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 493.855 requires that a laboratory ensure that, as of January 1, 1994, each individual performing gynecologic cytology services is enrolled in a gynecologic cytology PT program approved by HCFA. A Request for Proposal was issued for a contractor to undertake procurement of glass slides necessary to operate the cytology PT program nationally. We received no responses. However, we did receive comments from the cytology societies and individuals indicating that the program was logistically and financially unworkable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cosponsored a cytology symposium in November 1993 to establish possible alternatives to providing a cytology PT program. In December 1993, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee (CLIAC) established under &sect;493.2001 of our regulations recommended that legislative and regulatory changes be pursued to provide for an alternative program for cytology PT, including encouraging private or State-administered programs to meet current regulations. To date, only two cytology PT programs have applied for HCFA approval. The two programs are State-operated and enrollment capacity is limited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One group of commenters believed that the PT requirements, as currently written, are impossible to implement. The commenters noted the limited availability of PT programs and believed that the timeframe for implementing cytology PT is unrealistic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We understand the commenters' concerns. Although a State program has been approved for calendar year 1995, it has not been possible to implement a national program within the timeframe specified in the regulations. Therefore, in this final rule, we are changing the effective date for individuals to enroll and participate in a HCFA-approved cytology PT program from January 1, 1994 to January 1, 1995. Enrollment by this date is required if an approved program is available in the State in which the individual is employed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For individuals engaged in the examination of gynecologic preparations who are employed in a State in which an approved cytology PT program is available, cytology PT enrollment and participation is required beginning January 1, 1995. For individuals engaged in the examination of gynecologic preparations who are employed in a State in which a HCFA-approved cytology PT program is not available beginning January 1, 1995, enrollment and participation in cytology PT is required when a HCFA-approved program becomes available. We recognize that additional time is needed for development and approval of cytology PT programs that will apply nationwide. Presently, the major impediment in making cytology PT available on a national basis is the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of properly referenced glass slides. It has been suggested, and we agree, that programs using facsimiles of glass slides (for example, transparencies, computer images, etc.) should be considered for PT purposes. We plan to revise the regulations to allow approval of programs that employ testing media other than glass slides. The CDC is undertaking studies to evaluate alternative cytology PT programs. If alternative programs are feasible, we will ensure that such programs are comparable to glass side programs. Implementation of PT using alternative media will be phased-in to familiarize cytology personnel and evaluate the programs. During the phase-in, we will ensure that individuals are not penalized due to performance in an alternative program. We believe that this approach will meet the statutory mandate that PT be available nationwide to evaluate the performance of all cytology personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Quality Control Requirements for Unmodified, Moderately Complex Tests (&sect;&sect;493.1202 and 493.1203)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 493.1202 and 493.1203 provide for a 2-year phase-in period during which manufacturers could submit QC instructions relevant to their products to FDA for review and clearance. Under the regulations, laboratories would be in compliance with the QC provisions of part 493 subpart K by meeting less stringent QC requirements and following the manufacturer's instructions, as long as the laboratory has not modified the instrument, kit, or test system's procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

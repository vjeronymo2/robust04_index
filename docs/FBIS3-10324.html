			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] Central Reserve Bank President Jose Roberto  Orellana Milla has denied the colon will be devalued after the  20 March elections, as has been speculated in the past days. He  said there is enough foreign currency in the market to make the  currency stable. Edwin Gongora filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Gongora] Orellana pointed out that, with  the exchange system currently in place, colon devaluations could  hardly occur because the system depends on foreign exchange  supply and demands in the market. In this respect, Orellana  emphasized that there are enough dollars available to prevent  currency devaluations.    [Orellana] I want to tell you that exports, remittance,  foreign aid, and loans generate enough dollars. In short, there  are enough dollars to meet all the country's needs. There is no  possibility of devaluations because the system prevents them.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

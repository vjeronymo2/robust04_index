Schwab  announced the sentence, the maximum allowable for the charge.  </P> <P> "In all my years as a judge this is the most aggravated case of amorality that  I have ever seen," Schwab said. "This case will haunt me for the rest of my  life."  </P> <P> Maas was arrested after the death of David Allen Duncan, on Jan. 8, 1988. Maas  testified that she "gently" shook the child two days earlier when she panicked  because he would not stop crying. The boy died from swelling in his brain.  </P> <P> Mass also was convicted of three counts of felony child abuse for mistreatment  of the Duncan infant and two others who suffered a bruised ear and broken leg  in 1987.  </P></p>

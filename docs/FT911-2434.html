			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Finland has second thoughts on EC entry FINLAND IS reassessing whether to apply to join the European Community, amid signs of a collapse in the negotiations between the EC and European Free Trade Association on the creation of a European Economic Area (EEA). The outgoing foreign minister, Mr Pertti Paasio, a Social Democrat, said at the weekend that Finland ought to be ready to seek EC membership. His party, which is now the country's main opposition following last month's general election, has not yet taken a view but is expected to line up behind the call for a Finnish application. The new coalition government between the Centre party and the Conservatives is being more cautious. But in its programme, announced at the weekend, it uses a form of words which suggests it is also ready to drop the old resistance to the idea of Finnish membership of the EC. It said the government would 'strive for a solution which in the best possible way protects our national interests.' Mr Ekso Aho, the new Centre party prime minister, said yesterday the government still hoped for a successful outcome to the EC-Efta talks. But, with Switzerland threatening to walk out and apply for EC membership alongside Sweden and Austria, Finland may change its mind.</p>

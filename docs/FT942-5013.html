			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: Happy Days What do we mean by stasis in drama? Winnie, the heroine of Samuel Beckett's Happy Days is visually almost as immobile as any protagonist since Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound: embedded in a mound of earth - in Act One up to her waist, in Act Two up to her neck. Nor does she progress psychologically. What one recalls most are the phrases on which she harps - 'That is what I find so wonderful'; 'Ah yes, great mercies'; 'Another happy day' - time and again. And yet this is not, for us, a static play. All Winnie's repetitions help us to know her better, and to lead us more intimately into the vast tragicomic situation which is larger than her. For Happy Days is a mortal's contemplations of the gradual diminuendo ending of life: 'loss of spirits, lack of keenness,' loss of memory, of sexuality, of energy, of hope. Against which Winnie's repeated little optimisms, staving off despair, become heroic. Beckett achieves this often by working on the most trivial scale. Winnie re-examines her toothbrush until, after whole minutes, she discerns all the legend 'Fully guaranteed genuine pure hog's setae.' Whereupon she remarks 'That is what I find so wonderful, that not a day goes by - to speak in the old style - hardly a day, without some addition to one's knowledge however trifling, the addition I mean, provided one takes the pains. And if for some strange reasons no further pains are possible, why then just close the eyes  -and wait for the day to come - the happy day when flesh melts at so many degrees and the night of the moon has so many hundred hours . . . That is what I find so comforting when I lose heart and envy the brute beast.' So many of these phrases we have already heard from her lips, and will hear again, that the full impact of these sentences hardly hits us at the time. Yet it is the repetitions that matter most, for they represent Winnie's Canute-like efforts to defy the incoming waves of oblivion. I am, mind you, speaking here of Happy Days itself, and not of the specific performance it is currently receiving at the French Institute. Angela Pleasance gives Winnie an accent so precisely filled with lower-middle-class English nuance, that it is as if she took a Jane Clark view of Winnie. Her voice and face condescend to impersonate Winnie, tiptoeing quaintly below stairs for every separate inflection. Her director, the French Simone Benmussa, may well be tone-deaf to the English class connotations of Pleasance's performance. But Benmussa must be aware of some of the extensive artifice employed by Pleasance, and by Peter Bayliss in the small role of Willie. No doubt it is Benmussa who has encouraged Pleasance to speak the whole play on a near-inaudible thread of voice. This sustained pianissimo would be daring and compelling were Pleasance suggesting a larger-souled Winnie. Not so, however. As Pleasance delivers it, Happy Days is simply the slow extinction of what used to be called the soul of a housemaid. The play, however, is so much larger and more enthralling that you can listen to its words and imagine, so to speak, the play beyond this meagre performance. Happy Days remains one of the great plays of the century. At the French Institute</p>

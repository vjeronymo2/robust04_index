			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOLDIERS STAGE NEW THREAT TO HAITI LEADER  </P> <P> Soldiers from Haiti's main military barracks attempted a coup that failed  during the night, military sources said today, and later began radio broadcasts  calling for President Prosper Avril to resign.  </P> <P> The soldiers were from the Dessalines battalion, whose barracks adjoin Avril's  presidential palace.  </P> <P> The move sent Port-au-Prince into turmoil.  </P> <P> Haitians were rushing home, and schools and shops in the Haitian capital closed  after the soldiers' message was broadcast about 10 a.m. on independent Radio  Metropole.  </P> <P> Four light tanks belonging to the Presidential Guard were wheeled into position  on the lawns in front of the palace following the soldiers' radio statement,  witnesses said.  </P> <P> Minutes earlier, according to Radio Haiti, 50 officers and soldiers met the  press and said they wanted Avril to resign, accusing him of trying to set up a  dictatorship.  </P> <P> The soldiers said they were not isolated and were counting on support from  other units.  </P> <P> Heavy shooting was heard near the presidential palace overnight, just three  days after Avril foiled a coup attempt by dissident members of the Leopards  battalion. The three leaders of that attempt were expelled to the Dominican  Republic on Monday night.  </P> <P> No details were immediately available on the apparent coup attempt during the  night, but one source close to the military said negotiations had been  continuing through the early hours of the day to work out a solution.  </P> <P> The sources said the rebels made it clear they wanted Avril, who took power in  a coup six months ago, to step down.  </P></p>

Gregory Shaun Cooks, 33, of Austin, Texas, was arrested as  he  was about leave for Taiwan. The official said 1.4 kilograms (3.1  pounds) of heroin were seized.    Convicted drug traffickers face the death penalty in  Thailand  but the sentence is usually commuted to a lengthy prison term.    About two-thirds of the 1,200 foreigners in Thai jails have  been jailed for drug offences.</p>

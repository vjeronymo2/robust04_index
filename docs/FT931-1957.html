			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Project sales advance Hopewell 20% - Hong Kong Results HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and infrastructure group controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, reported a 20 per cent rise in attributable profits to HKDollars 843.6m (USDollars 109m) in the first half to December, from HKDollars 700.2m a year earlier. The increase was almost entirely the result of non-recurrent earnings from the sale of two of the group's development projects, Wu Chung House and Hing Wai Industrial Centre. These accounted for 61 per cent of operating profits. The interim dividend is being increased to 16 cents a share from 14 cents. But investors continue to focus on the company's ambitious longer-term infrastructural projects. The company said phase one of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen super-highway would be in by the end of 1993, resulting in an early completion bonus payable in the 1993-1994 fiscal year. The company is also investing in a USDollars 3bn Bangkok elevated rail and road system, a section of the Guangzhou ring road and power stations in China and the Philippines. These projects have been funded through property sales, and new equity. In 1994, Hopewell will complete the Hongkong International Trade &amp; Exhibition centre, its Broadwood Road residential project and part of the Nova Taipa development in Macau, which will provide further substantial capital inflows.</p>

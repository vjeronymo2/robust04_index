Manuel Camacho Solis, peace commissioner for reconciliation  in Chiapas, announced today in San Cristobal de las Casas that  he had received the documents in which the EZLN agrees to  dialogue with the government and announces that it will state  its official response on 18 January.    In a series of documents sent by the EZLN to the press, the  rebels announced their acceptance and expressed congratulations  for the cease-fire ordered by Mexican President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari and for the appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis.    The EZLN declared war on the Mexican Government on 1 January  when it occupied four mayors' offices in the Chiapas State in  confrontations which it said left an unofficial toll of 200 dead  in the 11 days of clashes, after which Salinas de Gortari  announced the unilateral cease-fire.</p>

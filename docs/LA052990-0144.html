			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BRENNAN, 84, TO STAY ON COURT  </P> <P> One month after his 84th birthday, Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr.  says he has no plans to slow down.  </P> <P> "Retirement for me is no consideration," the 33-year veteran of the nation's  highest court says in the June issue of Irish America Magazine.  </P> <P> "I would not know what to do with myself that would give me what I get and the  satisfaction I get here staying on the court."  </P> <P> Acknowledging that he doesn't have "many more years left," Brennan said he's  trying to let the American people know exactly how the Supreme Court works. One  way of accomplishing that would be televising court sessions, he said.  </P> <P> "I would love it. I'm the only one presently of the nine who would allow  television broadcasts of our actual proceedings," said Brennan.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he thinks the day is inevitable that Supreme Court sessions will  be televised.  </P></p>

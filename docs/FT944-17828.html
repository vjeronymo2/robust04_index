			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share options debate confuses separate issues Sir, There is a danger in the current debate on executive share options of confusing three separate but distinct issues. First there is the 'value' of the option at the time it is granted. In theory this should be a measure which reflects how much a third party would be willing to pay for the option. Most valuation models rely on making certain assumptions about the company which, arguably, means at best they produce a theoretical value, there being no market in executive options. Second, there is the benefit which the executive obtains if and when he exercises his option. 'Headline' figures often overlook the fact that the executive will only benefit if shareholders also benefit. The raison d'etre of options is to enable the holder to benefit from an increase in share price without having, initially, to purchase shares. Provided the executive is granted an option over an 'appropriate' value of shares, then the real question is what performance target should be attained before the option can be exercised. Our survey of quoted companies, results of which will be published shortly, will provide insight into this area. The size of the gain should simply reflect how successful the executives are in creating value for shareholders. The third issue is the cost to the company and the shareholders. This is where the real confusion starts. If the option is never exercised, there will be no cost. Similarly, to assume the cost is the gain on exercise assumes that the marketplace accurately adjusts the price of shares to reflect the dilution. It also ignores any possibility that the very granting of the option might increase a company's value. The debate should be whether options are the most appropriate method of offering an incentive to executives to increase shareholder value. The increasing use of restricted share schemes suggests that options are not the only solution. David Tuch, tax partner, Peat Marwick, 8 Salisbury Square, London EC4Y 8BB</p>

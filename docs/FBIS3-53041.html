			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip has withdrawn its support for the  campaign to double the number of settlements in the territories  by adding mini-settlements next to existing ones. After a joint  meeting of the council and the campaign management, the council  sent a letter to settlement leaders in the territories saying  that after an in-depth review of the issue, it was decided not  to implement the campaign because of the many problems that have  cropped up. Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman  reports that settlement leaders are concerned that a campaign in  which dozens of outposts are set up in Judaea, Samaria, and the  Gaza Strip will not gain public support. At the same time,  settlement leaders are planning a campaign to locate and  demarcate state lands in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip  with the aid of authorized surveyors.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Earnings at US energy companies advance COST-CUTTING measures and higher natural gas prices helped Chevron and Amoco post better-than-expected fourth-quarter operating earnings yesterday. Chevron, one of the biggest US oil and gas companies, saw the quarter's earnings from operations soar to Dollars 542m, or Dollars 1.64 a share, from Dollars 283m, or 81 cents, last time. Reported net income was distorted by one-time gains of Dollars 546m in the 1992 quarter and charges of Dollars 244m in the 1991 quarter, bringing net earnings to Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.30, in the latest quarter against Dollars 39m, or 11 cents, the previous year. Revenues rose to Dollars 11.39bn from Dollars 10.39bn. For the full year, Chevron had net income of Dollars 1.57bn, or Dollars 4.63 a share, on revenues of Dollars 42.89bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 3.69, on revenues of Dollars 40.95bn in 1991. In 1992, Chevron took charges of Dollars 641m for accounting changes. Amoco, the Chicago-based integrated petroleum company had fourth-quarter income of Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.10 a share. A year earlier it earned Dollars 153m, or 31 cents, including one-time charges of Dollars 47m. Revenues rose slightly to Dollars 7.24bn from Dollars 7.18bn. For the full year, Amoco had a net loss of Dollars 74m, or 15 cents. Excluding new accounting standards, the company earned Dollars 850m, or Dollars 1.71. In 1991, Amoco reported profits of Dollars 1.48bn, or Dollars 2.98 a share. Stripping out accounting changes, last year's earnings stood at Dollars 1.17bn, or Dollars 2.36. Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based oil and gas company, turned in fourth-quarter net income of 372m, or Dollars 2.30, compared with Dollars 268m, or Dollars 1.67, last year. In the latest quarter, one-time gains of Dollars 75m were partially offset by environmental-related charges. For the year, Arco earned Dollars 801m, or Dollars 4.96, compared with Dollars 709m, or Dollars 4.39, in 1991. Stripping out accounting changes and other items, full-year earnings rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.05bn, or Dollars 6.52, from Dollars 1bn, or Dollars 6.21, in 1991. Unocal had fourth-quarter earnings from operations of Dollars 91m, or 34 cents a share, up from Dollars 21m, or 9 cents, a year ago. One-time items contributed to reported net earnings of Dollars 103m, or 39 cents, against a net loss of Dollars 16m, or 7 cents, last time.</p>

As far as the contents are concerned, Peres said the  Cairo understandings will serve as the basis for the  continuation of the Taba talks. Minister Peres told our  political correspondent Udi Segal that the Palestinians have  learned that Israel is serious when it says it will not  compromise on security issues and that this is not merely a  matter of tactics and bargaining. The foreign minister said  that the contacts between Nabil Sha'th and himself lasted for  several days because Israel wanted to make it clear to the  Palestinians that it is acting cautiously and is not pressed for  time. Our political correspondent notes that Israel wants the  Taba talks to go on continuously in order to attain quick  progress.    A short time ago, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin also  commented  on the resumption of the Taba talks next week. According to  Rabin the negotiations, which will be based on the Cairo  understandings, are aimed at attaining a detailed agreement on  Gaza and Jericho. This morning, Rabin visited the settlement of  Na'ama where he met the local residents. Our correspondent in  the territories Golan Yokhpaz brought this report from the  Allenby Bridge border crossing:    [Begin recording] [Yokhpaz] A short time ago, Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is visiting this crossing point,  said that the Taba talks will be based mainly on the  understandings reached by Israel and the Palestinians in Cairo.  The prime minister arrived here accompanied by Chief of Staff  Ehud Baraq and, together with other IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  officers, they visited the settlement of Na'ama in the Jordan  Valley. Local settlers have claimed that in the framework of  the Jericho autonomy plan, their settlement will turn into an  enclave within the Jericho area.    Rabin told the settlers that Israel considers the Jordan  Valley a security zone because of the area's importance for the  country's security. This is what Rabin said regarding the  resumption of the Taba talks next week:    [Rabin] In Taba we want to reach a detailed, clear, and  lucid agreement. In everything relating to Gaza-Jericho First,  the talks will be based on the Cairo understandings. If they  backtrack.... [pauses] Everything we said hinges on compliance  with all the components of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.  [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0900 GMT on 6 January  adds: "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that there is no  territorial controversy or security problems between Israel and  Jordan, but Amman is unwilling to be the first party to sign a  peace treaty with Israel. During his visit to Na'ama and the  Allenby Bridge, the prime minister also said he is opposed to  discussing the permanent agreement at this point, not only  because of our commitment to the Madrid conference but also  because he is opposed to uprooting settlements and to  negotiations on the issue of Jerusalem. Our settlement affairs  correspondent Gil Litman reports that the prime minister told  Na'ama settlers that he understands their grievances, but Israel  is interested in solving the conflict with the Palestinians."]</p>

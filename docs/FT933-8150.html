			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul rebounds as Pacific Rim sees more new highs WORRIES over last week's announcement of mounting Cosmo Securities debts, due to irregular transactions, had much less of an impact on Japanese equities in the broader Tokyo market yesterday than they did in London last Friday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. In fact, the 225-issue Nikkei average ignored Friday's after-hours' fall of nearly 1 per cent in the ISE/Nikkei 50 index in London; hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate prompted arbitrage-linked buying and the Nikkei gained 156.32 at 20,901.49. The Nikkei registered a day's low of 20,548.85 just after the opening, but selling ran its course during the morning session. A rise in the fut-ures market on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange triggered arbitrage buying, pushing the index forward to register a day's high of 20,904.69 in the late afternoon. Volume contracted to 230m shares from 482m. Aside from arbitrageurs, investment trusts and dealers were seen buying in small lots. Advances outnumbered declines by 550 to 396, with 209 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 4.96 ahead at a 1993 peak of 1,688.04, and London's ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 1.83 to 1,286.26. Investors were calm over the revelations of Cosmo Securities' losses of Y69.8bn resulting from its involvement in tobashi, the shuffling of investors' accounts in order to hide unrealised losses. Daiwa Bank said last Friday that it will rescue Cosmo by injecting Y70bn to Y80bn through a third party share allotment. The yen's rise to a further record high worried some investors as the dollar closed Y1.15 down at Y101.25. However, the Bank of Japan's money market operations fuelled speculation of an early discount rate cut. Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities, pointed out that five out of six discount rate cuts since 1991 were preceded by generous infusions of funds by the central bank into the money markets. Brokers were hit by the Cosmo debacle. Nomura Securities slipped Y20 to Y2,200, second tier brokers such as Sanyo Securities lost Y25 to Y720 and New Japan Securities declined Y19 to Y694. Trading in Cosmo Securities was suspended for the day. The higher yen supported oil refiners. Koa Oil jumped Y109 to Y1,030 and Mitsubishi Oil gained Y10 at Y1,080. However, export-oriented consumer electronics makers lost ground, with Matsushita Electric Industrial easing Y10 to Y1,360 and Sony Y10 to Y4,370. In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 27.19 to 22,772.20 in volume of 20.4m shares. Dealer buying supported retail and machinery shares. However, Nintendo, the video game maker, retreated Y190 to Y9,410 on the higher yen. Roundup MORE NEW highs were recorded on the Pacific Rim, while South Korean equities rebounded after last week's losses. SEOUL, which fell 4.5 per cent last Friday and another 3.9 per cent on Saturday after the government ban on trading under false or borrowed names, recovered 25 points, or 3.7 per cent, to 691.67. Turnover expanded to Won399m from the Won271.3m seen in Saturday's half-day session. There were rumours that the government would announce measures to revive the market. But a Finance Ministry official said later that a meeting of economic ministers to discuss a bail-out would make no announcement yesterday. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index rose 97.24, or 1.3 per cent, to a new high of 7,489.49, aided by selective buying from overseas. Turnover was HKDollars 4.66bn, up from Friday's HKDollars 4.49bn. There was more confidence about Chinese economic prospects, and buyers were also encouraged by the strong performance of Stone Electronic, the Hong Kong arm of a collectively owned Chinese company, which ended at HKDollars 2.625 in its trading debut, against its offer price of HKDollars 1.26. SINGAPORE saw strong gains in selected blue chips as the Straits Times Industrial index climbed 5.02 to a record 1,922.89. Singapore Press local shares rose 50 cents to SDollars 12.60 in volume of 204,000 shares. Total turnover was 115.4m shares, after Friday's 137.5m. KUALA LUMPUR balanced profit-taking against impressive results from Malayan Banking, up 20 cents at MDollars 14.70. The KLSE composite index closed just 0.85 higher at 772.76. AUSTRALIA held up well in advance of today's budget, the All Ordinaries index rising 14.8 to 1,870.7 in turnover of ADollars 293.1m on gains in some blue chips and a slight recovery in golds. News Corp forged ahead 23 cents to ADollars 9.13 and offset a heavy fall in CSR, which lost 36 cents to ADollars 3.82 in early trade on adverse newspaper reports about its US asbestos court case, but recovered slightly to close at ADollars 3.96. JAKARTA, closed today for Indonesia's Independence Day holiday, featured strong gains by several banks in active trading, speculating on the prospect of good half-year results as the JKSE index ended 2.07 firmer at 382.01. BII advanced Rp400 to Rp5,000 and Bank Duta Rp325 to Rp3,250, while Bank Danamon, Lippobank and Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia also strengthened. BANGKOK saw a sheaf of weak second-quarter corporate earnings reports. Investors sold near the end of the day and the SET index shed 10.33 to 954.29 in Bt6.27bn turnover.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Solh becomes Lebanon's new PM MR Rashid Solh, a 66-year-old Sunni Moslem parliamentary deputy and former prime minister, became Lebanon's new premier yesterday, a week after his predecessor resigned in the wake of nationwide anti-government riots. The Lebanese pound rose to LPounds 1,425 to the dollar on the strength of the news, compared with a record low of LPounds 2,100 last week. The formation of a proposed 24-member cabinet is still being negotiated by representataives of Lebanon's religious communities. The 1989 Taif peace accords said that political office should progressively be dissociated from religious affiliation, but the quarrel over cabinet seats shows how deeply rooted the sectarian system is. Maronite Phalangists who have split between the Lebanese Forces militia led by Dr Samir Geagea and the Phalangist party led by Mr George Saadeh are demanding more positions in the next government to enable them to block decisions by majority pro-Syrian ministers. The defence, interior and foreign affairs portfolios are likely to stay unchanged with former militia leaders again in government. Mr Solh is the fourth member of a prominent Beirut Sunni family to become prime minister. He has been a deputy since 1964 and served as prime minister for seven months from 1974, but his government fell when a brawl broke out in parliament at the beginning of the civil war in April 1975. His main task will be to oversee parliamentary elections scheduled for this summer.</p>

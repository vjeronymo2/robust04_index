			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Li Lanqing  said at a recent work meeting of the China Import Automobile  Trade Center: While China permits multichannel import of  automobiles, an important category of important goods, we should  have a main channel for the import. In this way, it will  benefit both our macroeconomic management and the healthy  development of the automobile industry.    Li Lanqing said: In our automobile industry, the development  of medium-sized cars is quite healthy and the production of  heavy vehicles has no big problem either. The production of  light cars has many problems. There are 125 light automobile  plants in China. They are too dispersed in production, using  only a small proportion of Chinese-made parts, and they are  disorderly in operation, low in technological level, and poor in  quality. They have taken a great deal of investment, but they  have not yet been able to engage in large-scale production. Had  the investment been made in a more concentrated way, we could  have built some very good large automobile production bases.    Li Lanqing said: Automobile industry is a pillar industry  and China attaches high priority to its development. Since the  departments concerned have already formulated the policy for the  development of the automobile industry, we should promote its  healthy development with the policy henceforth. Since imported  cars are just a supplementary to Chinese-made cars, we should  pay attention to import of technologies. The China Import  Automobile Trade Center, as the main channel of our country's  automobile import, should offer a good service. Its business  policy should be one of earning small profits, not big profits.  It should avoid bureaucratic ways in business operation and  should create the image of an honest and reliable enterprise.    The China Import Automobile Trade Center is an economic  entity with a legal person's status, set up with the approval of  the State Council. Its main tasks are to participate in market  regulation, stabilize automobile prices, import both technology  and automobiles, and promote the healthy development of  automobile industry. Since its establishment in June 1993, it  has handled the marketing of 14,000 automobiles which the  Chinese Government bought from the United States. It has helped  the government departments concerned in the sale and management  of confiscated smuggled automobiles and in formulating relevant  procedures for the sale and management. It also conducts  legitimate bonded car import and barter trade. Vice Premier Li  Lanqing affirmed its business achievements.</p>

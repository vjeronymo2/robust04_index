			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: British Helicopters completes Pounds 32.5m buy-out and refinancing BRITISH International Heli-copters, the helicopter operator which was owned by Mr Robert Maxwell and has been in administration since soon after his death in 1991, yesterday completed a Pounds 32.5m management buy-out and refinancing. The disposal to management was expected before Christ-mas but ran into regulatory delays. It is the last trading company in the Maxwell private group of companies to be sold by the administrators. The buy-out involved Pounds 12.5m of equity and Pounds 20m of bank debt. CHC Helicopter Corporation of Canada has taken a 40 per cent stake via a Pounds 6m equity investment. CHC, one of the largest helicopter operators in the world, wanted full control of BIH but was blocked by the Civil Aviation Authority. Two venture capital companies, Brown Shipley Venture Managers and Legal &amp; General Ventures, have each taken a 20 per cent stake. The companies' management and employees hold the remaining 20 per cent. BIH, which Mr Maxwell bought from British Airways just prior to its privatisation in 1986, operates 20 helicopters in the North Sea oil and gas industry as well as a scheduled service between Penzance and the Scilly Isles. It employs nearly 400 people. Mr Stewart Birt, managing director, said the company would now be able to seek new contracts in the North Sea as well as bid for contracts coming up for renewal. 'The company is much healthier now than it has been for a very long time,' he said.</p>

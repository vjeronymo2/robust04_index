			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: TWA staff join 're-make' task force The board of Trans World Airlines, the troubled US carrier that has seen five senior executives resign this year, yesterday said it had set up a company-wide task force to 're-make' the airline. Employees and management would work together to reorganise the company in an effort to cut its operating costs and improve its ability to compete, it said. The suggestion had come from the heads of the airline's three labour unions and its senior management. TWA emerged from bankruptcy last November with 45 per cent of its shares owned by employees. Yesterday Mr Jeffrey Erickson, who was brought in from Reno Air as chief operating officer in April, said the employees were committed to creating a successful airline. United Airlines, the US carrier bought out by its employees this week, yesterday named Mr John Edwardson, a former executive with Northwest Airlines, as president. Mr Edwardson, who is chief financial officer of Ameritech, the regional telephone company, will work with Mr Gerald Greenwald, United's new chairman and chief executive, who has no airline experience.</p>

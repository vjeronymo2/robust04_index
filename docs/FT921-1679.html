			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A mixture of uncertainty in west London BRENTFORD AND ISLEWORTH Conservative majority 7,953 Labour requires 7.8% swing to win. 59% of voters are middle class, 20% managerial/professional A BLOOD-curdling scream startles drinkers at the Barley Mow public house in Turnham Green, west London. 'Aaargh] We're surrounded by Tories,' exclaims Mr Mick Carroll, a chef, spying Mr Nirj Deva, Conservative candidate for Brentford and Isleworth, as he makes the sign of the crucifix. On the next bar-stool, Ms Vesna Novakovic, a financial consultant, says she will not vote Labour because of its tax plans. 'Labour have got a history of raising tax. They would discourage people from doing well.' On such anecdotal evidence, it is far from certain whether the tax and National Insurance plans outlined in Mr John Smith's shadow Budget will be the cornerstone of a Labour victory in London or a millstone around its neck. Brentford and Isleworth, held for the Tories by Sir Barney Hayhoe since 1974, is typical of the seats in the capital Labour must win if Mr Neil Kinnock is to secure the 20-seat majority he predicts on April 9. Requiring a swing of more than 7 per cent to change hands, this exceptionally mixed constituency lies about 20th on Labour's list of target seats in the capital. But Labour will have to persuade some of the seat's professionals and middle managers - a fifth of the electorate - to vote against their wallets. The focus on tax will certainly touch off a testy battle of statistics. Ms Ann Keen, the Labour candidate, recently received from campaign HQ figures purporting to show the effect of the shadow Budget proposals on London marginals. According to these, almost 88 per cent of the Brentford and Isleworth labour force would gain from the plans. Circulars bearing the imprint of Conservative Central Office tell a different story. They say Labour's tax plans would cost the average male full-time worker in London nearly Pounds 4 a week. Ms Keen does not expect to be significantly handicapped by Mr Smith's proposals, although she accepts 'there will always be some people who don't want to pay more.' Mr Deva intends couching his tax-related arguments in broader terms than just the effect on constituents' individual pay packets. 'Labour's tax plans would take money out of a consumer recovery,' he says. For the Liberal Democrats, Ms Janet Salmon hopes Mr Smith's tax plans will be unpalatable enough to prompt those voters who have decided it is time for a change of government to turn to her. In addition the constituency's swelling ranks of unemployed say they would 'love to be in a position to pay tax', she says.</p>

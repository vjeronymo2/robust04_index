			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Japan's banks rejoin Euro-loans market Japanese banks have started an aggressive push into the European syndicated loan market, helping to push down banks' margins on lending to large companies close to the levels of the late 1980s, according to bankers. Smaller Japanese banks pulled back from lending at fine margins to European companies after the 1988 Basle accord, which required banks to hold more capital against loans. But they re-entered the market this summer. 'They are back in the market in a big way,' said Mr Grant Johnson, a director at NatWest Markets. The renewed push by Japanese banks has led to margins on syndicated loans - where several banks share a large loan to a company - and has worried bankers because it has contributed to margins falling to half the level of a year ago. Bankers say that loans to 'investment grade' companies must have margins of at least 0.8 per cent above the cost of funds to cover fixed costs and make a return on capital. Such loans are now being made at margins of below 0.25 per cent. Many European and US banks are competing to lend to high credit quality companies because loan demand from other sectors of the economy is weak. Japanese banks have recovered from the worst effects of the recession in Japan. The recovery in the Tokyo stock market compared with the lows of two years ago and the strength of the yen has helped to shore up banks' balance sheets. Aggressive competition for business, in which the Japanese banks played a central role, led many banks to make loans at uneconomic margins in the late 1980s. One senior banker warned: 'Banks are starting to shoot themselves in the foot.' Although large Japanese banks such as Fuji and Sumitomo remained in the London market - the centre for European syndicated loans - many of the 130 smaller banks authorised to lend overseas withdrew at the turn of the decade. But European bankers say they believe that smaller banks were given a signal by the Japanese Ministry of Finance after the financial year-end in April that they could resume lending abroad. The treasurer of one company said it was hard a year ago to get banks to make five-year loans, but that had changed. Hard news on sports, Page 4 Ministers firm on Gatt, Page 5</p>

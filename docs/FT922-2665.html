			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Household Mortgage more than doubles to Pounds 5.16m HOUSEHOLD Mortgage Corporation, the privately-owned residential mortgage company, yesterday upstaged larger lenders by more than doubling its pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 despite the housing market recession. In one of the strongest performances in the housing finance industry in 1991, HMC's taxable profits for the 12 months surged from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 5.16m. Interest receivable rose from Pounds 228.43m to Pounds 258.66m, while other operating income was up from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 9.45m. Bad debt provisions remained relatively modest by the standards of other lenders at Pounds 4.16m, though sharply up from Pounds 2.2m last time. Operating expenses were up from Pounds 15.78m to Pounds 20.2m. Total assets of Pounds 2bn were unchanged from last year and the customer base was maintained at 40,000. During the year HMC increased its asset base by purchasing mortgage books from several other lenders, including Westpac and Boston Safe. Mr Maxwell Packe, finance director, said the increase in profits reflected a decision taken in the early stages of the recession by the company to concentrate on top quality customers. The 13 institutions which own HMC will be paid a dividend of 4.5 per cent, totalling Pounds 1.4m. A spokesman for the company said yesterday that HMC's long term plans included a possible stock market flotation when the housing market had recovered.</p>

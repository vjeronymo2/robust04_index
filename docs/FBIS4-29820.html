			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok dailies, NAEO NA and THAI  RAT, carry editorials discussing the current political crisis  initiated by Chalat Worachat's hunger strike and worsened by  rallies in support of Chalat's demands, a motion proposed by  Phalang Tham MP's seeking to draft a new Constitution, and the  controversy over the role of the Phalang Tham Party as a partner  in the coalition government.    NAEO NA of 21 June carries on page 3 a 600-word editorial  entitled: "The Government Should Make it Clear." It asks the  government to make uncertainties clear by telling the people  what it is going to do -- resign, dissolve the House of  Representatives, reshuffle the cabinet, or pursue the  administration without making any changes. The editorial says  "The government should make clear to the public what the option  is and provide reasons instead of leaving the people guessing."  If it does not want to resign, dissolve the House, or reshuffle  the cabinet the government must arrange for a discussion among  the coalition parties in order to determine the Phalang Tham  Party's role.    "If the majority wants the Phalang Tham Party to be left  out,  the government must then expel the party from the coalition as  soon as possible in order to end the ongoing confusion. But if  the government believes the Phalang Tham ministers are capable  and cannot afford to lose them, the government should be bold  enough to inform everyone. The current political confusion will  never end unless the government acts decisively," the editorial  says.    THAI RAT of 21 June carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial  entitled: "Let the Parliament Settle the Controversy." It  states that activists backing Chalat's cause are entitled, under  democratic freedom, to pursue the struggle to support the motion  of the Phalang Tham MP's. There are others, however, who think  differently. "In a democratic society, conflicts of opinion  should be settled through compromise. It is impossible for a  certain group to win without giving concessions. In the present  situation, we think there are still several options available.  Regarding the Constitution, the parliament has already set up a  special committee to scrutinize proposed amendments. The  committee is doing its duty now; MP's can propose whatever  amendments they deem appropriate," the paper says.    Besides, the president of the parliament has formed a  democracy development team comprising representatives of the  people from all walks of life to plan a more democratic  Constitution. This committee should be able to work with the  parliamentary committee. Meanwhile, the motion of 21 Phalang  Tham Party MP's could be tabled on the parliament agenda for  debate. "This is the best way to achieve a compromise to solve  the problem. The parliament is thus given the role of ruling on  the Phalang Tham motion. Its ruling should be final," the paper  says.</p>

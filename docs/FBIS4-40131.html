			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze on 25 May to </F> commemorate the anniversary of Georgian independence; place not  given: "Let Us Build a New Independent Democratic Georgia"]    [Text] The date 26 May has entered into 20th century  Georgian history as the anniversary of national independence.  For the Georgian people, this date represents the apogee of one  of the great historical stages of the centuries-old  national-liberation movement and, at the same time, is an  eternal symbol of the restoration of the Georgian sovereign  democratic republic and Georgian statehood.    On this day, Georgian statehood was restored.    Today, on this great anniversary, I congratulate all  Georgia's citizens.    The Georgian nation has created one of the oldest  civilizations in the world. The history of Georgian statehood  goes back to time immemorial. Therefore, it was wholly logical  that a new Georgian democratic state and a new Georgian  constitution should be born and the renaissance of the Georgian  soul firmly established at the end of the 20th century.    We are celebrating 26 May this year in a particular concrete  historical situation. Different forces assess this situation in  different ways. However, there is one truth that cannot be  disputed: Today, we are at the stage of a critical development  of a democratic state and society; more precisely, at the  transitional stage from crisis to stability.    In this situation, in spite of the difference of views, the  domestic and foreign policy of the Republic of Georgia,  Georgia's geopolitical location, and its role and significance  in the Transcaucasus and the Caucasus, Near Asia, the Black Sea  region, the CIS space, and throughout the whole world are being  increasingly strengthened and improved.    Georgia is today a full-fledged member of the community of  peoples of the world.    During the last two years, many historical trends have taken  shape that correspond to the impulse of 26 May. Today, I would  like to emphasize only some of these.    In the economic sphere, the process of dismantling  the totalitarian economic system of reforms and establishing a  market economy has become irreversible, a process that is being  steadfastly implemented by the state system -- the Cabinet of  Ministers, parliament, and local municipal bodies of power and  administration.    A fundamental governmental anti-crisis program and social  and  economic development programs up to the year 2000 have been  elaborated on the basis of an edict of the head of state.    Following the edict of the head of state and discussion on a  wide scale, the national program for overcoming the crisis was  approved by a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers.    This program was assessed positively by the IMF, the World  Bank, the European Bank [for Reconstruction and Development],  and many other international organizations that have promised us  help in implementing it.    It is now important that the program is transformed into  reality.    We believe that the formation of a market economy signifies  faithfulness to the ideas of 26 May, the creation of a free  autonomously functioning economy, and the basis for political,  constitutional, and state independence.    The bodies of state power -- the government and parliament  --  are implementing planned special measures in order to strengthen  the exchange rate of the coupon and carry out financial and  economic reforms in the banking system.    Unfortunately, inflation and hyperinflation and other  negative factors are hindering the efficiency of economic  reforms.    Taking into account historical genesis in the sphere of  reforms, we have an extremely interesting picture.    Inflation and hyperinflation in 1918-21 [years of Georgian  independence] undermined the economy of the first Georgian  republic and its monetary unit, the boni.    Unfortunately, in our contemporary republic as well, the  temporary monetary unit -- the coupon -- is having a difficult  time; the paralysis of the economy is the principal reason for  its devaluation.    It seems that it is not so easy to form a national currency,  national finances, and a national economy. It was difficult at  the beginning of the 20th century and is likewise difficult  today at the end of this century.    However, the main thing is that we have the basis for social  and political optimism. I am sure that, in a year's time, when  an independent democratic Georgia will again be celebrating the  national holiday of 26 May, we will be faced with a different  picture in the national economy that will have already been  considerably revived.    This will be facilitated by the implementation of a  wide-scale anti-crisis national program, balancing the budget,  financial reform, the creation of a state treasury, wide-scale  privatization, the formation and development of small, medium,  and large business, our alliance with the IMF, World Bank,  European Bank [for Reconstruction and Development], CIS, and  countries in the Black Sea basin, credits and investments and  humanitarian aid from other international organizations, the  United States, Germany, France, Ukraine, Russia, and many other  countries, and other types of economic relations that are being  formed on the basis of a market economy and the principles of  international law.    The state and private sectors of the economy will exist in  the transitional period, but both sectors will function only  according to market principles; monopoly will be excluded and  free competition and free enterprise and commerce will be firmly  established.    These will be some of the principal directions of our  economic strategy.    Taking into account the achievements of national and  contemporary world civilization, political strategy  and state reforms have been implemented during the last two  years with a mixed degree of success and in the face of  resistance, but always along a firm democratic course and  inspired by the ideas of 26 May.    We frequently say that the contemporary Georgian republic is  the successor of the first Georgian republic of 26 May 1918 and  this thesis is correct. This political formula is manifested,  first and foremost, in our devotion to the ideas in the 1921  Constitution and to its essence.    The constitutional law on power and the 1921 Constitution  are  in force today. However, these two fundamental documents are  unable to fill the "constitutional and legal vacuum." They  require amending and improving, taking into account Georgia's  dynamically changing internal and international situation and  the achievements of national and world constitutionalism.    The interests of state construction and political strategy  call for an improvement in the structure, functions, and  activities of parliament, the government, ministries,  departments, and central and local bodies of power.    New steps need to be taken in the branch of state reforms.    During the last two years, in accordance with the demands of  democratization, constitutionalism, and the specific nature of  the transitional period, parliament, the government, and local  administrative structures have changed and all such changes that  have been carried out have been based upon the interests of the  people.    The Georgian Parliament is the symbol of 26 May,  of national and state independence and freedom and  democratization and no matter how difficult and complicated it  may be to administer its activities, no matter what kind of  crisis it involves, we have to tolerate and improve its  activities. I firmly believe that the future path of the nation  will run along the foundations of democratic development.    Parliament has adopted many laws. The market economy, a  rule-of- law state, and a civic society are acquiring a solid  legal base.    At the same time, all factions in parliament, the  opposition,  and the parliamentary majority or minority should be aware that  national energy and intellect and the nation's ability and  spiritual culture should not be wasted aimlessly; it should have  more constructive pathos than it has today.    Unfortunately, the contemporary stage of parliamentary  development, at times, assumes a destructive character; there  are often confrontations and violations of regulations and  parliamentary ethical norms.    There is no need for confrontation between different  branches  of the national movement and political duels between factions in  which forbidden ploys are used. History assigns everyone and  everything to his and its proper place.    We should make a distinction between the oral declaration of  national statehood, on the one hand, and its real construction  on the other.    It is necessary to implement constitutional reforms.    Let us begin by examining either the whole or parts of the  draft constitution.    According to the new Constitution, a new parliament and a  system of executive power will be created and judicial power and  local municipal bodies of administration and power will be  formed alongside legislative and executive power.    One of the main events during the last two years has  been Georgia's entry into the CIS; the beginning of the  building of new relations with Russia.    Joining the CIS is necessary for Georgia so that it can  attain in reality precisely the ideals of 26 May.    Without joining the CIS, it is impossible to overcome  the economic crisis and settle ethnic conflicts and restore the  country's territorial integrity. Therefore, no matter how  unpopular the adoption of this or that decision may be, if the  necessity of its adoption has been scientifically substantiated,  the state and the government should adopt such a decision and  patiently explain to the people the correctness of that  decision. This action is dictated by historical inevitability  and national interests.    Joining the CIS does not mean in any way that we will be  paying less attention to the development of relations with  western countries, the United Nations, the IMF, CSCE, the  European Union, the alliance of Black Sea countries, and other  international organizations.    Our country is and will be an independent, national, and  sovereign state.    The social sphere and the social protection of citizens is  the most burning issue confronting our reality.    Man is the measure of everything. Man is the  supreme philosophical and political value. This forms the very  basis of our democracy and humanism.    Therefore, care for the individual necessitates the creation  of a humane rule-of-law state and civic society and three basic  directions form the cornerstone of our policy: a market  economy, a rule-of-law state, and a contemporary civic society.    Democracy, freedom, sovereignty, and the supremacy of the  Constitution and the law -- this is our path toward the future.    All this is being created for man; therefore, the protection  of man's civil rights, including social rights, at the level of  the demands of contemporary civilization, is our most important  task.    Unfortunately, today, we have a budget that is not balanced  and a catastrophic budget deficit. By covering the deficit with  bank credits, we are causing a further deepening of the economic  and financial crisis.    The appropriate social funds and a different environment  providing effective infrastructures have not been created.    Therefore, it should be clear that the social protection of  the population is greatly lacking. Alongside hundreds of  thousands of unemployed, we have up to 300,000 refugees and  displaced fellow countrymen. They need to be looked after and  helped, but we do not have enough provisions and resources.    The humanitarian aid sent by our foreign friends is a factor  of great significance, but it is impossible to live in constant  hope of charity. There are also deficiencies in the  distribution of this aid; we are implementing emergency measures  to eradicate these.    Ninety percent of the republic's population is living below  the poverty line. The coupon has almost lost the function of  money and, in conditions of inflation and hyperinflation, wages,  grants, and pensions suffice for only two or three days. The  main thing now is to resolve the problem of the national  currency, improve finances, emerge from the economic collapse,  resolve the energy problem, be prepared for next winter, and  provide the essential minimum for the population. It is  precisely this that is our main concern.    Central and local authorities and administrative bodies  have elaborated an extensive national security  program that is acquiring a new content. This means not  only maintaining a basic standard of living but also improving  the quality of life in the future.    Today, however, at the present stage, it is necessary to  overcome the danger of starvation and poverty and ensure that  the population is provided with the minimum amount of consumer  goods.    A new system of national security signifies that the nation,  the state, and each citizen is provided with political, legal,  economic, financial, demographic, ecological, military and many  other types of protection.    Certain achievements have been attained in  strengthening our defense capability, forming an army and navy  and border and internal troops, and in their combat,  professional, and moral training.    Georgia's defense capability has been considerably  strengthened following its entry into the CIS.    The CIS and NATO member countries will help us in the  creation of our Armed Forces.    At the present stage, the Ministry of Defense and the  command  nucleus of the Armed Forces have been changed and strengthened;  the new cadres have been supplemented with general officers and  an officer corps; conscription call-up is proceeding better;  national military and naval academies have been opened; an  experienced general has been appointed as new [defense]  minister; a large part of the bandit armed formations have been  disarmed and the disarming of other formations is continuing; a  single modern army and navy are being created that will be  subject to a single military doctrine and iron discipline, and  directly subordinate to the defense minister and the commander  in chief of the Armed Forces-head of state.    Not only the Army, Navy, and border troops but also the  other  power structures of the state are developing dynamically and  growing in strength; the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the  State Security Service are improving their activities and also  the Ministry of Justice, the court, and the Procurator's Office  that represent the strong backbone of state power.    The new Constitution will form a new system of power  structures -- ministries and departments -- at a more democratic  and civilized level; it will improve further their combat  ability and efficiency.    Judicial power is being formed on the basis of the new  Constitution. Judicial reform is being implemented. This will  be a big step forward along the path of the division of power  and the construction of democratic institutions.    As a result of the effective, comprehensive, and integrated  functioning of power structures, it has been possible to prevent  a wide-scale civil war, defuse to a certain degree the criminal  situation, disarm criminal bands, and strengthen the struggle  against such particularly dangerous crimes as murder,  kidnapping, rape, theft, burglary, banditry, armed robbery, drug  addiction, the drugs business, and so forth.    All of this does not have only legal and criminal  significance. Stability creates the preconditions for attracting  capital from abroad and its effective investment in the Georgian  economy. This requirement is demanded of us by all serious  businessmen, bankers, financiers, and investors in the world who  are attracted to Georgia by favorable conditions that have  already been created in legislation, a relatively cheap work  force, completely unexploited resources, and a whole range of  other factors.    From the point of view of adopting a new constitution,  state-  territorial organization, and economic development, the  settlement of ethnic conflicts acquires vital importance,  as does the restoration of Georgia's territorial integrity.    During the last few months, many things have been done to  settle the Abkhazian conflict by peaceful means.    One should point out the certain positive results of the  bilateral Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations in Geneva and Moscow,  the efforts of the UN and the Security Council, and the positive  role played by the CIS, the Russian Federation, and a number of  other states in resolving the Abkhazian conflict. We have seen  a turning point and change in favor of Georgia's territorial  integrity and the restoration of Georgian constitutional  jurisdiction on territories that have been temporarily occupied.  In the near future, there will be the first big flow of  refugees and persecuted fellow countrymen returning to Abkhazia  under the aegis of the United Nations and with the constructive  participation of Russia.    CIS member states and the Russian Federation will fulfill an  even more constructive role regarding this problem.    The so-called "South Ossetian" conflict in Shida Kartli  [area  of Georgia historically comprising six regions into which South  Ossetia was reincorporated under its historical name of  Samachablo by the government of ex-President Gamsakhurdia] needs  to be resolved. Conditions have now been created for political  and diplomatic activity; the Georgian-Ossetian conflict will  definitely be resolved taking into account the interests of  Georgians and Ossetians.    I would not say that the world today is divided into spheres  of influence between the giants of the East and West, between  the superpowers, but one thing is clear: When the sun shines, a  shadow is nevertheless cast somewhere on the earth. This refers  with specific logic to certain regions.    The signing of the large package of treaties on friendship  and cooperation between Russia and Georgia during Batoni  [Georgian polite form of address] Yeltsin's visit to Georgia was  a great event.    I believe these are viable treaties as they contain the  rational balance of interests of two independent sovereign  countries.    We should improve our democracy and multiparty system and  firmly establish the achievements of modern world party and  political science in our party and political life.    Many political parties are playing a positive and  constructive role in parliament, the parliamentary majority, the  press, and radio and television while, on the other hand, there  are many that are forming a destructive opposition and negative  public opinion....    New political parties and political movements have  appeared on the scene and it is significant that one of these is  the Union of Georgia's Citizens that is trying, through  specific actions, to bring economic, social, and political  stability to society, implement an anti-crisis program,  correctly forecast the parameters of economic and social  development, and actively participate in carrying out cardinal  economic and social reforms.    The Union of [Georgia's] Citizens is a party that advocates  reforms and this is stated in its policy document "Market  Economy, Rule-of-Law State, Civic Society."    I agreed to become the chairman of this political movement  precisely because it aims to implement radical reforms and the  implementation of cardinal democratic reforms represents my  political credo.    I also want to say here that I initiated [the ruling] that  the chairman of parliament should not participate in  parliamentary elections on behalf of any party. This was  already correspondingly reflected in the rules of parliament.  However, many things subsequently changed. Parliament adopted  a law on state power that is already in force, the institute of  the chairman of parliament-head of state was established, and  the necessity arose of creating such a party that would form one  of the supports of the government's state policy so that the  head of state, when requiring full agreement and support, from  the point of view of the consolidation of society, the country's  salvation, and determining new domestic and foreign policy,  would not find himself hanging in mid air, as they say.    At the same time, the Union of [Georgia's] Citizens favors  close cooperation with all progressive political forces.    Today, 26 May, I want us to extend the hand of accord to one  another. Our united efforts will bring greater benefit to  Georgia than our separation from one another.    Let us be together; let us love our nation, language,  motherland, and faith; let us love our fellow man and render the  greatest service to mother Georgia.    This is a reliable criterium today for [gauging] service to  one's country and patriotism.    The national state idea should unite and bond a society that  has been dismembered into parties according to political ideas.    Today, as never before, we need the unity of people and  power, mutual understanding between parties, parliament, the  Cabinet of Ministers, and local authorities and administrative  bodies and their support and the unification of a fractured  national consciousness.    Democratic Georgia is the motherland not only of Georgians  but also of people of all nationalities and faiths and all the  republic's citizens.    The Republic of Georgia is concerned with protecting the  language and cultural development of all peoples living on its  territory and their political rights.    The motto of the sovereign Georgian state is: People should  save culture and culture should save people.    We often say: Georgian culture is a unique phenomenon.  Unfortunately, in conditions of a market economy, particularly  in the transitional period, when there is hyperinflation and a  growing budget deficit that is not being covered by reviving  production but by loans taken by the government from the  National Bank, the state does not have the means to grant big  sums and subsidies to science, education, the arts, the press,  radio, television, and culture in general. However, there is no  other way; certain sums should nevertheless be found so that  Georgian literature and arts, music, cinema, theater, painting,  architecture, and all branches of material and spiritual culture  can again blossom.    This is the immediate concern not only of the authorities  but  also of patrons, sponsors, large, medium, and small business,  free entrepreneurs, farmers, traders, well-to-do compatriots,  and representatives of national business; it is a subject of  concern for the private and state sectors of the economy.    It is interesting that the Committee for the Salvation of  Georgian Culture is doing effective work; international contacts  in the scientific, cultural, and educational sphere should be  extended.    We should utilize in every way the experience of countries  that have an advanced market economy in the sphere of creating  cultural funds.    We should save Georgian culture and science and education.  The epoch of the spiritual revival of the Georgian nation -- a  new renaissance -- should be established once more.    The state policy of reforms cannot be changed. This is the  road to our salvation. Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers,  all ministries and departments, local bodies of power and  administration, all city halls, sakrebulos [administrative  boards], and all rayon and village gamgebeli [administrative  board chiefs] should be reformist in their form, essence, and  activities.    There is no alternative to the policy of reforms.    It is necessary that all regions and centers unite and form  a  cohesive whole on the basis of a single strategy and tactics and  that there be a consolidation of people and power at all levels  around the policy of reforms.    This year, on 26 May, the sovereign Republic of Georgia will  hold a military parade and the newly-born national Army will be  on view. This is the Army that has to protect Georgia's  sovereignty, its borders, its freedom, and all its historical  achievements.    The 26 May parade and celebration will be a state  demonstration of the new Georgian forces that are undergoing  organizational development.    Dear fellow countrymen!    I congratulate you on the great national holiday of 26 May  and wish you health, happiness, and success. God give us hope!  Tomorrow will be better than today.    God bless mother Georgia now and forever!</p>

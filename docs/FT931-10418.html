			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Tough morning for sterling STERLING fell by more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in half-an-hour of London trading yesterday, as dealers remained concerned about the UK currency's immediate prospects, writes James Blitz. The pound hovered at DM2.41 at 8am in London yesterday, having bounced back from an historic low against the D-Mark last week after the Bundesbank's interest rate cut on Thursday. But between 9am and 9.45am London time, the currency dropped from around DM2.4030 to DM2.3800. It stabilised for a while, before suffering another fall from DM2.3840 to a low for the day of DM2.3750 between 11.30am and midday. The pound subsequently rallied to finish in London at DM2.3825, down more than a pfennig on the day. Against the dollar, it ended at Dollars 1.4395, off  3/4 cent, and later closed in New York at Dollars 1.4390. Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London. was concerned by the speed and scale of the morning's fall. 'It is very unusual to see a currency go down like that,' he said. 'People have shorted the pound, and you would expect dealers to buy back the currency as it falls, giving it a bit of a boost. All in all, it is very destabilising.' Several dealers suggested that the currency had fallen victim to two very large sell orders, although there were also reports of very heavy selling of the currency in general. One London dealer said his bank had executed what were regarded as two large buy orders for the pound. But he had been astonished at the tiny impact of these counter-flows on the price action. Another dealer believed the pound would probably creep back up to DM2.40 in the next few days because of signs yesterday afternoon that large institutions were demanding the currency once more. 'The pound could fall to DM2.20 or DM2.30 in the next few months,' he said. 'But the fall should be gradual because all the bad news has been factored in by the market.' There was a growing feeling in London that the problems of the European exchange rate mechanism were far from over, in spite of Thursday's easing by the Bundesbank. The French authorities cut the overnight rate for lending francs by 1/8 percentage point, but the franc simply lost ground on the move, bottoming out at a bid rate of FFr3.3880 to the D-Mark and ending in London at FFr3.3810. It closed at the bottom of the ERM grid, with a divergence of -35 per cent from its central Ecu rate. The Danish krone, which rebounded dramatically against the D-Mark following the cut in German rates, closed yesterday at around DKr3.8075 to the D-Mark, comfortably within its ERM bands. But problems linger for the Danish authorities. Three-month krone were quoted yesterday at 17 per cent. Some dealers also believe a large proportion of the recent outflow of krone is yet to be repatriated.</p>

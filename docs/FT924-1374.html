			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Tonight brings the last episodes in three dramas. In ITV's studiously odd Gone To Seed the villainous Wesley (Peter Cook) thinks that the triplets' garden centre is finally within his grasp (8.00). In Framed, the saga of a super grass, Detective McKinnes (Timothy West) tries to tempt his squealer into making a break for the spondulicks (9.00 ITV). In Son Of The Morning Star (9.30 BBC1) General Custer fights Little Bighorn again, with Rosanna Arquette looking decorative as his wife. ITV offers more human interest journalism with hints of the 'Crimewatch' formula. Missing (10.40 some ITV regions) aims to find missing people, and in addition to appeals for information there is a record of a police sweep for young runaways in London. A good deal of pretentious nonsense has been written about Triumph Of The Will (12.05 BBC2), Leni Riefenstahl's notorious film about the 1934 Nazi party congress in Nuremburg. Whatever Riefenstahl herself may have said, it obviously is propaganda, and very polished propaganda. Most of the techniques were not new, but they were used more cleverly here than ever before (12.05 BBC2).</p>

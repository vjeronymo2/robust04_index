			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MORE BARS:  </P> <P> El Mexi-Rock Cafe, 28411 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. Open 3 p.m. to 2  a.m. Monday through Saturday. (714) 364-6674.  </P> <P> By day, it's just another pastel-colored Mexican restaurant. But after 9 p.m.,  the rather small dance floor is generally packed with a youthful mix ranging  from long-haired rockers to close-shaved hip-hoppers. The sound system is good,  meaning that the only place for intimate conversation is out in the parking  lot. CHERYLANNE BEALER  </P></p>

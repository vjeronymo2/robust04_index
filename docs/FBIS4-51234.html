			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- The Navy intends to lease  more Newport-class tank-landing ships from the United States, a  Ministry of National Defense official said Wednesday [25 May].    The official's remarks came after the United States House of  Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill by voice vote  authorizing the transfer of 17 US naval vessels to nine  countries, including the tank-landing ships to Taiwan.    The US Navy declined to reveal the lease price for the three  ships.    "They will be used to replace some aging LSTs (landing ship,  tank) that have been in service since the Second World War by  the ROC Marines," the official said.    Each of the Newport-class ships is capable of ferrying 700  fully equipped soldiers and 500 tons of military equipment, and  can sail at 20 knots per hour.    Meanwhile, a ministry report released Wednesday indicates  the  army is planning to procure some new-generation light tanks from  the United States. The Army, according to the report, is  keeping a close watch on evaluations being done by the US  military on three types of newly developed light tanks,  including the M8.    The Army needs not only medium-sized tanks but light tanks  as  well to defend Taiwan and the offshore islands, the report says.    It also defends the ministry's plan to buy an unspecified  number of US-made M60-A3 tanks. The plan was severely attacked  when the budget to finance arms acquisitions was recently  submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval, with lawmakers  claiming that the medium tanks would not be suitable for use on  the rugged Taiwan terrain, and that they were old models  scrapped by the US Army.    The report said the Army has no alternative but to buy the  M60-A3s because Taiwan is unable to acquire more advanced tanks  such as US M1 tanks, British Challengers and German Leopard 2s  due to political factors.    Nevertheless, the report places the M60-A3 on the same level  as the M1 in terms of combat capabilities. M60-A3s are equipped  with solid-state computers, laser rangefinders with a maximum  range of 5,000 meters, add-on-stabilization systems, and passive  night-sight equipment, according to the report.</p>

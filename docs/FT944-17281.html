			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: Trapped by special boring rights - James Morgan recounts the horrors of an IMF conference One of the more intriguing problems confronted by any reporter is how to tackle a story that is complex to the point of incomprehensibility and arcane to the point of being meaningless. How does one present a story, when one has never heard of the subject matter and one's readers have not the slightest interest in it? So it was with last Sunday's tale from Madrid of the collapse of various detailed plans to launch an issue of the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights (SDRs). Many who had assembled in the Spanish capital for the IMF and World Bank annual meeting had dreaded the prospect of a row over SDRs. In the event, there was not only a row but a split. The fact that this arcane matter was linked with something called a 'systemic transformation facility' meant that many who had jumped the first fence refused the second. Some even left town as their editors could scarcely face filling their pages with such matters. Those of us who stayed to cut our way through the unyielding rock of news suffered many defeats. Spanish journalists were in a particularly unfortunate position - they had nowhere to go because they could not ignore the news that was taking place on their doorstep. El Mundo, heroically, ran the headline: 'The Fund gets no agreement on the widening of its capital.' Quite wrong, but a good try. In its hands, SDRs became 'the nominal money of the IMF'. El Pais called SDRs 'credit commitments' - but a typographical error made it 'cedit commitments', which seemed quite interesting and very Castillian. Elsewhere in Europe, opaque definitions ruled. For Le Monde, the phrase was 'reserve money of the Fund', while NRC-Handelsblad of Rotterdam used the phrase 'Monopoly money'. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dismissed SDRs, sniffily, as 'money out of thin air'. So it was that Europe's top economic writers turned quickly from the tedious details of the row to a much more profitable field: who to blame for the ghastly debacle. The problem was eased because there were so many candidates. The IMF's boss, Michel Camdessus, had put up the original plan for SDR distribution, which had the firm support of developing countries. But the British and Americans cut the proposed amount in half and said it should go mostly to their friends in the old Soviet Union. The Germans were grudging even about this. The French, however, like the idea of free money for everyone; it was not surprising that Le Monde blamed the G-7 and its 'sin of pride' in refusing to compromise further. So, in Germany, Handelsblatt made something of the typical French generosity with other people's money. The man from the Dutch Handelsblad thought that weak leadership in both organisations had combined with the 'new self-confidence of the developing countries'. The FAZ, of course, blamed everybody. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung noted, happily, that there had been 'no winners, only losers'. I blamed Spain. It provides a suitable stage for the theatre of disaster and, after all, the country has a proverb which runs: 'A rio revuelto ganancia de pescadores' - troubled waters are the fisherman's gain. Troubled waters dominated. The press corps gloomily contemplated the recently privatised telephone system and was amazed to hear how much it had improved. Only the Italians felt at home, but even they admitted that the interface between Telecom Italia and Telefonica did provide some nasty surprises. The trouble with Spain is that, barring bloodshed, revolution and civil war, not much happened there between around 1770 and 1970. A whole epoch of development was missed. Thus, there is scarcely a hotel room which has a radio, although all have television sets. Then there is the curious phenomenon of clocklessness. Northern Europe abounds with clock towers, cuckoo clocks or whatever. In France, there are few; in Spain, there are hi-tech digital items on streets but none in the hotel rooms. A jet-lagged colleague from New York rang reception in the early hours to say he wanted a clock. He was advised to tune into the French television channel where he would see the time 24 hours a day. Then there was the television producer who also rang reception to ask how she should operate the air-conditioning. 'Open the window,' came the reply. Spain is not at its best when it is trying to be a modern, sophisticated industrial state. Madrid still provides the best of old Spanish customs: marvellous, efficient bars and restaurants. Helpful, honest taxi drivers. It also understands realities that others miss. A cartoon in El Pais on the IMF and Bank meetings asked: 'If all goes well for the economy, what matters if it doesn't for the people in it?'

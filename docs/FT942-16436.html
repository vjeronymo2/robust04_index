			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Nato strikes leave peace in balance: Attacks could bring new realism to Serbs or ruin joint diplomatic initiatives The fate of peace-making efforts in Bosnia hung in the balance last night as the Damocles' sword of Nato air strikes finally dropped. At best, the air attacks will bring a new realism to the Bosnian Serbs who in recent days have brazenly tested the will of the international community and exploited every sign of hesitation and departmental infighting among western governments. At worst, the Nato action will alienate Russia and thus ruin the chances of co-ordinated diplomatic action by the Security Council. The most optimistic view of the Bosnian Serbs' bid to capture Gorazde, one of three so-called safe areas for Moslems, is to see it as a final grab for territory before bowing to international pressure and making peace with the newly established Croat-Moslem federation. The outlines of a deal already exist: the Serbs would trim their share of Bosnian territory from 70 to 49 per cent, and in return regain international respectability. But the precise contours of the ethnic divide have been left undecided, creating an irresistible temptation to take advantage of a fluid situation. The Bosnian Serbs have made no secret of the fact that, for them, the existence of Gorazde and two adjoining safe areas is an irritant. It obstructs their dream of creating a greater Serbia by linking eastern Bosnia with Serbia proper and the Serb-controlled parts of Croatia. There is speculation that in exchange for full control of eastern Bosnia, the Serbs would cede territory in the centre and north of the republic, where their army is over-stretched and under pressure from the Moslem-led government's well-trained infantry. But the passions unleashed by the latest fighting - both inside former Yugoslavia and beyond - could complicate the peace-making process. Progress has been made over the past two months by a mixture of old-fashioned 'superpower' diplomacy and the personal authority of Gen Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia. The US and Russia have largely taken over the 'glamorous' side of peace-making in Bosnia. But more recently, western policy has been compromised by embarrassing public squabbles between the Pentagon - which has been hesitant about the use of force - and the State Department, which has been less so. Because of the political disaster which a failed intervention in Bosnia could entail, different sections of the American administration have been passing responsibility to one another, and to Gen Rose. Nor can Russia be counted on to exercise a moderating influence over the Serbs - especially now that the air strikes have inflamed passions throughout the orthodox Slav world. Lord Owen, British co-chairman of the EU-UN conference on Yugoslavia, has predicted a 'crucial eight weeks' in which the current settlement plan will live or die. If the opportunity is fumbled, it will mark the third Bosnian peace plan to have died - and will cast a shadow over the prospects for stability in the Balkans.</p>

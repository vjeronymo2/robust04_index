			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Buyers retreat as air of excitement evaporates THE ATMOSPHERE of excite-ment which has suffused the gilts market, particularly at the long end, showed signs of abating last week. Enthusiastic buyers, particularly overseas investors who have pushed yields to new lows recently, have begun to feel that they had had enough excitement for the time being. There are several powerful reasons for this. Firstly, recent economic data has been disturbingly buoyant with retail sales rising and exports outside the EC making a strong showing. This was compounded by a 0.5 per cent gain for gross domestic product in the second quarter, suggesting that the UK might see 2 per cent growth this year. Second, there is the increasingly unpredictable political situation ahead of the Christchurch by-election and following the Government's defeat on Thursday in its vote on the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Finally, the supply arguments are starting to look authorative. Another huge government bond auction takes place on Wednesday, adding Pounds 3.25bn worth of stock maturing in 2001. Yields within the five to 10-year range rose quite sharply last week and the very short-dated maturities were relatively firm. But the long end of the yield curve was barely changed with 8.75 per cent stock dated 2017 still offering less than 8 per cent by the close of dealing on Friday. However, as Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, says: 'The characteristics of this market astound those who haven't taken on the low inflationary view.' It is that growing confidence in the long-term economic fundamentals of the UK, particularly the belief in steady growth combined with low inflation, that inspires most economists to believe in a continuation of the downward trend in long-dated yields. Mr Bootle sees long yields hitting 7.75 per cent by the end of the year. He is also confident that base rates can fall by another point within the same period - and possibly by as much as another three points - which would bring down short-dated yields. At SG Warburg Securities, economist Mr Kit Juckes is equally confident that rates will fall further, arguing that the Maastricht vote tension only increases that likelihood. 'Worried politicians are rate cut politicians,' he says. Gilts have reflected that confidence. Every time there is a dip in prices, buyers return and push the price back up. Gilts were dented by the high street sales figures and early political worries but they fought back later, and after a gut reaction on Friday morning they largely ignored the government's defeat. The consensus, therefore, is that the market will continue onwards and upwards - but not just yet. The government faces a by-election this week and is unlikely to ease beforehand. And, overseas investors could start to take profits over the next few days. Longer term, however, a more cautious view is expressed by Mr Ian Harnett, economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. 'Despite inflation at a 30-year low, we remain sceptical about the ability of the government to deliver non-inflationary growth,' he says.</p>

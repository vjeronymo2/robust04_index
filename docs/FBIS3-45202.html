This shows that the focus of foreign investment is moving  from the Pearl River delta in south China to the Chang Jiang  river delta, economists said.    In 1993, the local government approved a total of 10,248  overseas-funded enterprises, involving 10.8 billion U.S. dollars  in contracted foreign funds, of which 2.84 billion U.S. dollars  have been put to use.    By the end of last year, the province had approved 20,354  foreign funded enterprises. Of these, 6,800 enterprises have  been operational.    Economists attributed the trend to the implementation of  China's strategy of opening up and developing the Chang Jiang  river delta and the economic belt along the Chang Jiang river in  1991.    Jiangsu is situated where the Chang Jiang river and the East  [China] Sea meet. It has several major ports, including  Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Zhangjiagang, Nantong and Lianyungang.    In 1993, it stepped up the construction of energy, transport  and telecommunications facilities and has greatly improved the  investment environment.    It has also strengthened drafting of regulations to attract  overseas investment.    Good performances among overseas-funded enterprises have  bolstered the confidence of overseas investors in the province,  provincial officials said.    A survey of 2,010 foreign-funded enterprises conducted by  the  provincial department of finance during January and September  last year showed that they had a total output value of 16.8  billion yuan and reported a sales income of 14.2 billion yuan,  respectively up 64 percent and 62 percent over the previous  year. They produced 982 million yuan in profits, up 92 percent.    The still greater investment tide has not come yet, Vice  Provincial Governor Wang Rongbin said.    He estimated that the paid-in foreign funds for this year  will grow by 50 percent over last year.</p>

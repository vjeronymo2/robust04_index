			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS' FIRINGS UPHELD BY CIVIL SERVICE PANEL  </P> <P> Two San Diego police officers who lost their jobs, one for alleged sexual  misconduct, the other for falsely reporting his involvement in an off-duty  shooting, have lost their appeals to be reinstated.  </P> <P> In a report released Friday, the city Civil Service Commission ruled that the  conduct of Officer Charles R. Demers was "offensive," "deplorable and seriously  jeopardized the reputation and public trust of the entire" Police Department.  </P> <P> Two young women testified in commission hearings that they were frightened when  Demers pulled them to the side of the road in separate incidents, then began  making sexual advances toward them in the summer of 1988 -- a time of  heightened public awareness because of the Craig Peyer case. Peyer, a  California Highway Patrol officer, was convicted of murdering a young woman he  had pulled over on Interstate 15 late at night.  </P> <P> In its report, the commission noted that Demers provided "untruthful testimony"  under oath and that his firing should not be revoked.  </P> <P> The commission also found that Officer David A. Nellis lied to his superiors  and to the commission in fabricating the details of a shooting that he said  occurred in the 2100 block of Saipan Drive on April 26, 1988.  </P> <P> The report cites Nellis for waiting "approximately 42 hours prior to reporting  the shooting" to the Police Department. It notes that none of 13 area residents  who were contacted about the shooting heard the shots "alleged to be fired" by  the officer.  </P> <P> A clerk who worked at the convenience store where Nellis said the shooting took  place testified that he did not hear any shots or observe any "shooting victims  or any related activity," the report says.  </P> <P> The commission supported Nellis' termination notice of February, 1989, which  says: "You falsely reported that you were involved in an off-duty shooting.  Further, you failed to obey lawful orders of superior officers during the  investigation, and failed to answer questions truthfully."  </P> <P> The five-member Civil Service Commission also noted that Nellis refused to  cooperate fully with internal-affairs officers investigating his case.  </P> <P> Everett Bobbitt, the attorney for both officers, said Friday that he will take  the Demers case to court in an attempt to win back his client's job.  </P> <P> "I definitely intend to pursue Demers through the courts," he said, contending  that the officer was fired and then reinstated on various levels of the command  staff, and that Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper eventually intervened and  upheld the termination.  </P> <P> "That was unprecedented," Bobbitt said. "And I've got new information that one  of the alleged victims was a friend of (Dist. Atty.) Ed Miller. So I want to  find out what involvement Ed Miller may have had."  </P> <P> Bobbitt said he has not studied the commission's report on Nellis and will  "wait and see" whether to pursue that appeal.  </P> <P> Michael R. Pent, chief of the special-operations division for the district  attorney, said on Miller's behalf that "the district attorney has intervened in  no way in the Charles Demers matter and has no knowledge of either of the two  victims that were mentioned."  </P> <P> The commission cited each officer's otherwise impeccable police record in  making its findings, but said the civil service violations in each case fail to  warrant a repeal of the department's dismissals.  </P> <P> In Demers' case, the report says, "despite such record . . . the commission  finds that the appellant's egregious, unacceptable misconduct in this case,  aggravated by his providing untruthful testimony under oath and his admission  of issuing previous invitations to female citizens for personal conversations  while conducting official business, critically detracted from his suitability  and acceptance as a police officer."  </P> <P> Demers was fired in March, 1989, after two years as a police officer in San  Diego and after seven years as an officer in Rhode Island. The district  attorney declined to file criminal charges against Demers, 32. John  Vanderslice, a deputy city attorney who asked the commission to uphold the  termination, said prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence for a  guilty verdict of criminal wrongdoing.  </P> <P> A 24-year-old aerobics instructor testified that she and a friend were driving  home from a nightclub in July, 1988, when Demers pulled them over. After giving  her a sobriety test, she said, he threatened to take her to the County Jail at  Las Colinas.  </P> <P> She testified that, later, while she sat in the back of the patrol car, he  squatted 2 feet in front of her and asked her to show him her genitals.  </P> <P> The woman "responded by saying something to the effect of, 'Give me a break,' "  the report says. "The appellant (Demers) then backed up and said something to  the effect of, 'OK, you can go; go on, get out.' "  </P> <P> In another incident, a 19-year-old San Diego State University student testified  that she was headed home after a late-night party when Demers pulled her over.  She said he gave her a sobriety test, threatened her with jail and then said he  would release her.  </P> <P> But she testified that Demers told her, "Since you've been partying with your  friends all night, would you mind partying with me for a while?"  </P> <P> She said he motioned her to a patch of nearby shrubbery and when she cried, he  asked her, "Are you embarrassed because you've never been with a man before?"  </P> <P> She said she began crying "really hard" and covered her face with her hands.  She testified that Demers then told her that, if she stayed with him, "it would  be the best five minutes she ever had."  </P></p>

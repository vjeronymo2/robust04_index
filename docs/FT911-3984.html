			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Top law firms maintain growth THE UK's top law firms continued to grow in size over the past 12 months in spite of the recession in the property market and the sharp downturn in mergers and acquisitions work. Clifford Chance, the largest UK law firm, increased its number of assistant solicitors by 92, a 17 per cent rise on the April 1990 figure. Three other top 10 City law firms, Linklaters &amp; Paines, Lovell White Durrant and Simmons &amp; Simmons, all increased their number of assistants by 11 per cent, according to The Lawyer magazine's annual review of the top 100 solicitors' firms in England and Wales. The continued growth in the size of law firms is partly a reflection of commitments made to trainee solicitors several years ago. The effect of the recession on law firms is seen more clearly in the 10 per cent fall in demand for graduates by the top firms this September. Nevertheless, the overall demand for graduates remains strong. The top 100 law firms are looking for just under 2,000 graduate trainees between them. Non-law graduates are in increasing demand. At City solicitors Slaughter and May, 50 per cent of last year's trainees were non-law graduates. Medium-sized law firms also show a growth in numbers. Richards Butler, in spite of making some property lawyers redundant last autumn, reported a year-on-year increase of 25 per cent in assistant solicitors. Leading provincial firms appear to have been more affected by the recession, with seven of the top 10 regional firms showing a fall in the number of assistants over the past 12 months. The highest starting salary being offered by a law firm to its graduate trainees this September is Pounds 18,500, the same as last year's highest. The average starting salary offered to trainee solicitors by the top five City law firms has risen from Pounds 16,180 to Pounds 16,844.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 ALBANIANS DIE IN ETHNIC RIOTS IN YUGOSLAVIA  </P> <P> Five ethnic Albanians were reported killed in riots Wednesday in Kosovo  province, while about 100,000 Slavs rallied at anti-Albanian protests  throughout Yugoslavia, some firing guns in the air and demanding arms to fight  in the province.  </P> <P> The eight-member collective state presidency, Yugoslavia's highest  constitutional body, said the situation in the southern province is  "deteriorating" after eight days of clashes between police and ethnic Albanians  demanding political reforms.  </P> <P> "The presidency has ordered that measures be taken to protect the peace and  security of inhabitants of villages threatened by inter-ethnic confrontations,"  according to a statement carried by Tanjug news agency. No details of the  measures were provided.  </P> <P> According to Tanjug, 15 people have been killed since the ethnic Albanians, who  are the majority in Serbian-ruled Kosovo, took to the streets. Reporters in  Kosovo say about 26 people have been killed.  </P> <P> Among Kosovo's 1.9 million inhabitants, ethnic Albanians outnumber Slavs 9 to  1.  </P> <P> State-run TV described the situation as on "the verge of civil war."  </P> <P> Kosovo is an administrative part of Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia.  Its ethnic Albanians want more autonomy, a stop to political trials, free  elections, release of political prisoners and lifting of a year-old state of  emergency.  </P> <P> The state news agency Tanjug said at least three people were killed and five  injured Wednesday in Glogovac, a village 12 miles south of Pristina, capital of  Kosovo. It said police used a helicopter to disperse "several thousand  aggressive" protesters there.  </P> <P> Meantime, Yugoslav television said police shot and killed a man in the village  of Stanovac.  </P> <P> The television report also showed an anti-Albanian rally of about 100,000 Slavs  in Titograd. Gunfire could be heard, and speakers implored demonstrators to  stop firing handguns. Several rallies were also held in Belgrade, the nation's  capital.  </P> <P> At Ivangrad, another 10,000 people demonstrated against "Albanian separatists  and Slovenian and Croatian leaders supporting them," the news agency Tanjug  said.  </P> <P> As violence spread through Kosovo on Wednesday, protesters called for military  intervention to end "the Albanian uprising."  </P> <P> At Vucitrn, 20 miles northwest of Pristina, five demonstrators were reported  injured, apparently in clashes with police.  </P> <P> Violent clashes were also reported in Lipljan, Titova Mitrovica, Klina,  Prizren, Kosovska Kamenica and Gnjilane.  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Boeing sues Airbus over patents Boeing is suing Airbus as well as the British, French and German partners in the European consortium for alleged patent infringement over a wing slat and flap actuator mechanism. It is the first time Boeing, the world's largest maker of commercial aircraft, has launched a law suit against its European rival, it confirmed in Seattle yesterday. The writs have been filed in the UK, Germany and France against Airbus Industrie, British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale. Airbus yesterday vigorously rejected the charges. 'We totally dispute the Boeing claims and we have instructed our lawyers to fight the action,' a senior official said in Toulouse. Airbus described the Boeing action as 'completely misconceived' and said it was 'confident as to its outcome'. Although Boeing declined to give details of its complaint, it confirmed that the alleged patent infringement involved wing parts for its 757 twin engine airliner as well as its new 777 wide-body aircraft. Boeing would not disclose which Airbus aircraft was involved in the allegation, but it is understood to involve all Airbus airliners dating from the A320 twin-engine, 150-seater aircraft, the A321 stretched version of the A320 and the new A330 and A340 family of Airbus wide-body airliners. British Aerospace has overall design responsibility on the slats and flaps on these Airbus airliners, for which it manufactures all the wing sets.</p>

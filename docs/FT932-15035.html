			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Goodrich shares hit by poor figures SHARES in B. F. Goodrich, the US plastics group and specialty chemicals group, dropped after the company posted first-quarter financial results that were much lower than expected, Reuter reports. The Ohio-based company lost Dollars 7.6m, or 38 cents a share, in the first quarter, while analysts had expected a profit of about 1 cent a share. For the same period last year, the company made a loss of Dollars 1.9m, or 16 cents a share, before accounting adjustment. On Wall Street, Goodrich shares closed Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 46 7/8 . Goodrich said its aerospace businesses continued to meet expectations during the quarter and that many of its speciality chemicals businesses performed well in the quarter. 'But results for the segment overall continue to be hurt by weak demand in construction-related markets and by generally poor economic conditions in Canada and Europe,' said Mr John Ong, chairman. Goodrich has said that it planned to spin off its Geon Viny division as a wholly-owned subsidiary, offering about 50 per cent of the new company's stock to the public.</p>

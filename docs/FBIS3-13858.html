It has been learned  from the PLO headquarters that these talks are focussing on the  formal resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations after  the UN Security Council condemned, in its Resolution No. 904,  the massacre at the Tomb of Patriarchs [in Hebron].    The Palestinian president had earlier met, for the second  time since yesterday, an Israeli delegation that is carrying  proposals on security measures to be taken by Israel to ensure  the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territories.  The Israelis have said that they would implement these measures  only after a date for the resumption of talks on autonomy in  Gaza and Jericho is announced.    In an interview with the U.S. newspaper NEW YORK TIMES,  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat had said that it was very  difficult to resume talks with Israel under the pressure of  aggressive practices [as heard] and that talks held under such  conditions would not last very long.</p>

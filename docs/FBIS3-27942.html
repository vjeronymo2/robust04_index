			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] revealed on 26 January that it is, in effect, cancelling  the project to develop the next-generation medium passenger  airplane (YXX) which was being worked on jointly by Japanese  airplane makers and the U.S. Boeing company. This follows  Boeing's decision not to use the YXX (called the 7J7 by Boeing)  to replace the current Boeing 737. The decision meant, in  effect, that even if the YXX was developed, sales would never be  enough to make it economical.    As a result, Japan's aircraft development plans will shrink  to one, the next-generation small passenger plane (YSX). The  MITI and the Japanese aircraft makers will hold negotiations  with foreign makers, including Boeing, Saab-Scania of Sweden,  and Aviation Industries of China, to select a partner this year  to share development costs of the YSX.    Japanese heavy industrial companies and Boeing conducted  market research for the YXX, which was to be a medium passenger  aircraft capable of carrying 150 passengers. However, last fall  Boeing unilaterally decided to give priority to remodeling the  Boeing 737 as the 737-X and using it to replace its existing  Boeing 737 because this option was than development of the YXX.    As a result, the MITI and Japanese aircraft makers have  decided to withdraw from the development project, concluding  that if Japan tried to go it alone the YXX would be more  expensive than the Boeing 737-X. The Japanese partners in the  project are expected to withdraw from the project some time this  year after consulting Boeing. The MITI is now shifting its  attention from development of the YXX to development of the YSX.  In formulating its budget for next year, the MITI will ask the  Ministry of Finance to allocate only 500 million yen to the YXX  project -- for payment of interest on the past development costs  -- but to allocate 1.6 billion yen, 16 times the YSX development  project received this year.    Japan has not developed any civil passenger aircraft since  the "YS-11." The MITI wants to do everything to develop the  genuinely Japanese-made YSX as a replacement for the "YS-11" in  order to help defend Japan's aviation industry technology. It  is hoped to use the YSX on domestic routes, the so-called "niche  market," in which there is no competition from aircraft made by  European and U.S. manufacturers.</p>

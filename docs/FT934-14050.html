			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Observer: Emi meeny miney mo It couldn't be easier, could it? The leading candidate to run the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the future European central bank, is technically qualified, politically astute, and deemed a heavyweight among fellow European central bankers. The only snag is; he seems not to want the job. Dutch central bank governor Wim Duisenberg apparently regards the EMI post as nothing compared with the power he already wields, not only in Amsterdam, but also as a leading member of the committee of European central bankers. Why else should he declare last weekend on German television that a single European currency was 'decades away'? John Major could scarcely have put it better. The noose is tightening around Duisenberg, not least because Amsterdam's 11th-hour challenge to lure the EMI on to its soil is running out of steam - despite deft manoeuvring by Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister. Lubbers had made clear that he is no longer prime candidate for the job of running the presidency of the European Commission when Jacques Delors steps down in January 1995. No doubt his calculation is that, in staving off accusations that the Dutch were trying to pinch the biggest Euro-prizes, he would be lending Amsterdam's EMI candidacy a helping hand. Like the British and French, the Dutch are slowly facing up to the fact that the EMI building will rise on German soil; Duisenberg is under pressure to win its presidency as a consolation prize. With his back to the wall, the reluctant Euro-banker is believed to be demanding that he is allowed to stay on as central bank governor - a condition already dismissed by one leading EC official as a 'non-starter'. Others are watching with interest; hovering in the background is former Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato, who was in the running to replace Jacques Attali at the EBRD.</p>

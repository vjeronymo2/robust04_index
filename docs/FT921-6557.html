			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: CGS and Volmac link in Benelux venture CAP Gemini Sogeti (CGS) Europe's largest computer services group, yesterday announced a wide-ranging co-operation and share exchange deal with Volmac, the Dutch market leader in which it already has a small stake. The deal comes a fortnight after the French company's acquisition of Programator, its main competitor in Scandinavia. It marks the latest step in CGS's attempts to broaden its European market coverage, in line with increasing demand from big corporate customers for services groups able to handle contracts spanning several countries. The partners will seek to increase their share of the developing market for the provision of in-house computer services - 'facilities management' in industry jargon - said Mr Michel Jalabert, development director for CGS. The new group, yet to be named, will have 4,000 staff in the Benelux countries, and annual sales equivalent to FFr2.7bn (Dollars 480m). Under the agreement, the pair will pool their activities in the region in a company to be 60 per cent-owned by a new holding group. The other 40 per cent would be divided between Volmac's existing public shareholders, institutional investors and WSG itself. The new holding group will in turn be roughly two-thirds owned by CGS, and one-third by The World Software Group (WSG), which is Volmac's holding company. However, the exact parities have yet to be fixed, said Mr Jalabert. CGS is not planning to offer for the remainder of Volmac's shares, listed on the Amsterdam stock market. Volmac was founded in 1966, the same year as the companies which subsequently formed CGS. The pair exchanged small minority stakes in 1988. Mr Jalabert said the deal would not directly affect CGS's profits, which fell by 10 per cent last year, but would help it boost its international business. CGS has made more than 20 acquisitions over the past seven years.</p>

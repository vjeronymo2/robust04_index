			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / CBI sees little risk of pay spiral THE DANGER of a price-wage spiral developing as a result of Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism is 'limited' given the present weak state of the labour market, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The latest CBI pay and performance analysis for 1992-93 warns, however, that if 'employers do not keep a firm grip on pay and continue to improve performance, the benefits (of ERM withdrawal) will be squandered through higher inflation'. Over the past year UK earnings growth has finally fallen below the EC average. But the CBI points out that the EC figure has been inflated by high increases in Germany which will not last and that the UK is still well above US and Japanese levels. In the three years to 1991 unit labour cost increases in the UK were higher than in the US and Japan and higher than the European average. This year the UK has done better, 'but not well enough to regain lost ground'. The CBI argues that employees have become much more realistic about pay, with survey evidence showing that 65 per cent of employees expect their next pay increase to be the same or lower than last year. Two thirds of employers now have performance pay for some or all of their white-collar staff while one in four has it for manual workers. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, repeats his plea for a freeze on the overall pay bill in the public sector. But the CBI itself estimates that the 1992-93 pay rise for nurses is likely to be 5.7 per cent, the armed forces more than 5 per cent and teachers 7.5 per cent. Manufacturing pay increases remain around 4 per cent. Since 1979 white-collar average earnings have risen 38 per cent compared with 11 per cent for blue-collar staff. That has prompted the CBI to ask members to take a closer look at white-collar pay and push for more 'multi-skilling' for such workers. In terms of output per worker, UK manufacturers moved closer to German competitors in the late 1980s but there has been some slippage since the recession began. The CBI now estimates that absence from work is costing British business Pounds 7.5bn a year - equivalent to 3 per cent of the pay bill. Pay and Performance 1992-93.

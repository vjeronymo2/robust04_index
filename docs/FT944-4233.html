			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Banks get guidelines on marketing of mortgages A voluntary code of practice on the information banks should give customers choosing mortgages was launched yesterday by the British Bankers' Association. It has not, however, headed off demands for new regulation of the sale and marketing of home loans. The code was agreed in discussion between the bigger high street banks. They said they already met its terms. The Office of Fair Trading welcomed the guidance as 'a step forward but not the end of the road'. In February, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, called for lenders to be required to give borrowers the most appropriate advice. The guidance is more limited than the plans for a code being discussed by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies and centralised lenders which sell through intermediaries rather than branch networks. The CML code is likely to include telling the borrower in writing after the sale the reason why a particular type of mortgage was recommended as appropriate. Mortgages involving investments - such as endowments - will be included in new financial services regulations next year which require more information to be given to customers. The annual report of the banking ombudsman, published earlier this week, said requiring banks to give 'best advice' on mortgages would make complaints about mortgages - the third biggest category of complaint - much easier to deal with. It also highlighted the difficulty of resolving mortgage complaints on the basis of what the bank said when the loan was taken out, as this was usually several years before the complaint.</p>

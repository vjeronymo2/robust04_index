			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex rally pushes gold to Dollars 372.50 GOLD PRICES rallied strongly yesterday and closed in London last night at Dollars 372.50 a troy ounce, up Dollars 8.05. Traders said the move was started by investment funds on the New York Commodity Exchange but activity in London was negligible. The rally was helped by rumours - not widely believed - that the high-profile investor Mr George Soros was selling bonds and buying gold. 'The bond market is weak and that is helpful to gold. But the rally was technically based and there was no fundamental news to move the market,' said one dealer. Ms Rhona O'Connell, in a special report for stockbrokers T Hoare &amp; Co, suggests gold's price will average Dollars 360 an ounce this year, 'only 5 per cent up on 1992 - but not a bad performance after hitting a low of Dollars 326 in March'. Ms O'Connell looks for an average of Dollars 390 next year and Dollars 420 in 1995. She suggests demand for physical gold in jewellery in the western world, after falling from 2,270 tonnes in 1992 to 2,030 tonnes this year, will recover by 1995 as the developed economies pull out of recession. Also, Russian production and exports are falling; forward selling by producers has recently been noticeably absent and she expects central bank selling to be more muted.</p>

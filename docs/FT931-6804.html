			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / MPs urge tighter financial controls PRESSURE ON the government to strengthen the present system of financial services regulation increased yesterday when a former Tory trade and industry secretary joined a cross-party group of MPs in tabling two critical motions. Mr Paul Channon, the MP for Southend West, was one of six MPs who signed a motion highlighting the 'inadequacies' of the present system of self-regulation for banks and building societies. Expressing 'grave concern' at the plight of elderly holders of home income plans, the MPs urged the government to ensure mortgages were treated as investments for the purposes of the 1986 Financial Services Act. Mr Channon, whose time as trade and industry secretary partly coincided with the passage of this act through the Commons, also backed a second motion urging the Securities and Investments Board to proceed 'with urgency' to set up the proposed Personal Investment Authority. The motion, which has so far been signed by eight MPs, endorsed the principle of self-regulation of financial services but acknowledged a 'lack of confidence' in the existing system. The motion says the PIA's establishment should create a single system 'embracing banks and building societies, as well as those bodies and individuals currently covered by Fimbra and Lautro, to resolve complaints and provide compensation for investors'. SIB has said that it might refuse to recognise the PIA as the new self-regulatory body for retail financial services if it does not raise standards of investor protection. Earlier this month the PIA appointed Sir Brian Jenkins, a partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to conduct an independent review of membership criteria.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Kvaerner shows improvement KVAERNER, Norway's largest privately-owned industrial company with interests in engineering, shipbuilding and shipping, yesterday reported an improvement in its profits before financial items to NKr424m (Dollars 68.3m) in the first four months of the year from SKr401m for the same period of 1991. The order book rose by 11 per cent to NKr6.535bn from NKr5.906bn. Kvaerner's shipping business suffered a sharp fall in profitability to NKr39m from NKr164m for the first four months of last year. It made a small loss of NKr12m in its manufacturing division compared with a NKr14m profit in the year-earlier period. However, this was more than compensated for by the rise in profits from shipbuilding to NKr252m, nearly double the NKr137m made in the same months last year. The company also reported a hefty increase in profits from offshore activities, from NKr40m to NKr87m. In its wood-processing division, profits rose to NKr69m from NKr50m. The company also announced that it was launching a seven-for-one equity issue, creating 5.33m shares. A further 300,000 new shares will be issued to employees. Kvaerner's financial position was strengthened recently by its acquisition of Masa, the Finish shipbuilding group, and Gotaverken Energy, the Swedish environmental company. Aker, one of Norway's largest industrial groups, made a profit after financial items of NKr263m for the first four months of the year, a substantial improvement on the NKr23m loss a year ago. Turnover rose to NKr5.4bn for the first four months, compared with NKr3.8bn. The company said that the market for cement and construction materials continued to be weak even though the economic downturn in Norway seemed to have bottomed out. Aker estimated that this year it would make a loss in those activities comparable with the NKr79m deficit in 1991. The main hope of revival lies in the oil and gas technology side of the business, where orders have been encouraging.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A danger to remember Sir, Before we get too carried away by reports about the governor of the Bank of England's discussions with the high-street banks over their lending policies towards the smaller business, we should remember the dangers of over-expansion as we come out of recession ('Bank governor calls in clearers', September 21). Of course we should encourage industry to grow and invest, but having survived the recession the companies that have learnt to play defensively must not go down because they are now encouraged to over-trade. The disciplines that the banks' lending policies impose should protect many survivors from this danger. Receivers are often accused of being the undertakers to British industry, yet a large proportion of our work is in helping industry and lenders redirect businesses that might have failed to survive. Experience has taught us that more companies fail coming out of a recession than during one. If we are to learn from the mistakes of the past, industry/lenders/advisers have all got to work together to make certain that the light at the end of the tunnel is not the proverbial train.

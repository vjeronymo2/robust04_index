			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Moorfield Pounds 691,000 in the red MOORFIELD Estates, the USM-quoted property development group, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 691,000 in the year to October 31 1991. The result compared with a profit last time of Pounds 565,000 and came from turnover down from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 8.6m. The commercial division reported a profit of Pounds 296,000 on property disposals. However, after after writing off interest of Pounds 388,000 and making provisions of Pounds 949,000 against the value of part of its portfolio, a loss of Pounds 1.04m was incurred. The residential division recorded a 25 per cent advance. The division turned in profits of Pounds 1.87m from house sales slightly up at 67 (65) units. The average sale contributed Pounds 20,000 to profits. Mr Tony Phillips, chairman, said the property sector had been badly affected by the recession, although the group's residential developments in Yorkshire and commercial developments in the Midlands and Yorkshire had not been as badly affected as other parts of the country. He did not envisage a recovery in the commercial sector until later this year. A tax credit of Pounds 226,000 (Pounds 193,000 charge) helped mitigate the loss. A final dividend of 0.1p is proposed. This compares with a total for the 1990 year of 2.4p.</p>

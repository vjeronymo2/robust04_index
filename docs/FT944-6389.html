			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Aristide plea on crime gangs Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's president, has asked the US government to allow its troops to become active in disarming criminal gangs and renegade army units which he fears pose a threat to the country's stability. However, the request is unlikely to be entertained by the US government, diplomats in Haiti said, as the move could bring the 12,000 troops in the country in direct confrontation with armed Haitians, leading to US casualties and fatalities, and raising pressure to pull the troops out. Senator Robert Dole, who will lead the Republican majority in the new Congress, has said disarming of Haitians should be done by the Haitian police.</p>

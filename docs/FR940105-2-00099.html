			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the violation involving the failure to establish a written Quality Management Program, the Licensee admitted that it did not establish a Quality Management Program by the January 27, 1992 effective date of the rule. The Licensee states that it first learned of the requirement to establish a Quality Management Program following receipt of the June 1992 NMSS Newsletter and that it immediately devised a plan and submitted it to the NRC by July 27, 1992. Because corrective action was taken without NRC intervention, the Licensee requested that the violation be dismissed or mitigated to a reprimand without penalty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the violation concerning the administration of sodium iodide without a written directive signed by an authorized user, the Licensee admitted that a ``minimal number'' of patients received dosages of greater than 30 microcuries without written directives having been prepared. The Licensee stated that it took immediate corrective action and requested that the violation and the civil penalty be mitigated. In addition, the Licensee requested that the NRC take into account the fact that during the past 23 years, approximately 20,000 to 23,000 diagnostic administrations had occurred with no known misadministrations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request for Mitigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The violations were not considered separately in this case. The proposed penalty was based on the aggregate of the two violations (i.e., a Severity Level III problem). Thus, the severity level of the violations was based on their collective significance_that is the combination of not establishing a Quality Management Program until six months after the effective date of the rule and not implementing the requirements of the Quality Management Program even after a written program was established by the Licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC places a great deal of importance on its Quality Management regulation. Thus, its Enforcement Policy was revised at the same time the rule was adopted to place an emphasis on noncompliance with the rule. Example C.6 was added to Supplement VI, such that violations involving ``A substantial failure to implement the quality management program as required by &sect;35.32 *&blank;*&blank;*'' was to be classified at Severity Level III (Note: This was later amended to state ``Substantial failure to implement the quality management program as required by &sect;35.32 that does not result in a misadministration *&blank;*&blank;*''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``substantial'' has consistently been applied to failures of a programmatic, as opposed to an isolated, nature. In this case, the Licensee's failure was deemed programmatic because the Licensee repeatedly failed to use written directives for diagnostic administrations of sodium iodide I&hyph;131 on quantities that exceeded 30 microcuries because of weaknesses in the program. Thus, the violations were appropriately classified in the aggregate as a Severity Level III problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the magnitude of the proposed civil penalty, the Licensee's argument are related to the civil penalty adjustment factors of Identification, Corrective Action and Licensee Performance. The use of these factors is described in Section VI.B.2 of the Enforcement Policy. No adjustment was made to the proposed base penalty with respect to any of these factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Licensee identified its failure to establish a Quality Management Program and corrected it by submitting a plan to the NRC, the plan it submitted lacked specificity, contributing in part to the second violation, the failure to use written directives for diagnostic administrations of I&hyph;131 in excess of 30 microcuries. The second violation was identified by the NRC, continued for nearly a year after the Licensee became aware of the regulation, and was occurring at the time of the license transfer. The Licensee's arguments do not provide a basis for mitigation under the identification factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No adjustment was made under the corrective action factor because these violations were discovered after the license had been transferred to another entity. Thus, this factor did not, and still does not, appear to be applicable to the circumstances of this case. In addition, although the Licensee corrected its failure to establish a Quality Management Program, its corrective action was weak, i.e., the Licensee did not implement the use of written directives for diagnostic procedures, as discussed above. Thus, the Licensee has not provided a basis for mitigation under the corrective action factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No adjustment was made under the licensee performance factor. The Licensee's performance was considered relatively poor in the two inspections that preceded the July 14&hyph;16, 1993 inspection. Several Severity Level IV and V violations were issued following each of the two prior inspections, one occurring in September 1991 and the other occurring in March 1990. This was balanced, however, against the fact that the July 1993 inspection found only the violations related to the Quality Management rule. Thus, notwithstanding the Licensee's statements about an absence of misadministration, the Licensee has not provided a basis for mitigation under the prior performance factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Licensee has not provided any information that provides a basis for reclassifying the violations or mitigating the proposed civil penalty. The proposed civil penalty in the amount of $2,500 should be imposed by order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;126 Filed 1&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

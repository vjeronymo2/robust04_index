			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Arts: Pacific Overtures - Theatre The Leicester Haymarket has acquired a reputation as one of the country's leading homes for musicals; and this staging of Stephen Sondheim's 1976 musical Pacific Overtures shows you why. The large company, with 16 performers playing several roles each, performs on a high level, Paul Kerryson's staging is deft and eloquent, and Charles Cusick-Smith's designs are striking. Pacific Overtures (best known in this country from an English National Opera staging) portrays the events of 1853, when, after 250 years of isolation, the Japanese first established contact with western society. The central irony is that the tale is told as if from the Japanese point of view, and illustrated with key features of Japanese theatre: onnegata, whereby female roles are played by men; kabuki, whose bold maquillage and coiffures are employed, even for the American characters; and bunraku, whereby certain silent figures in black attire behave like puppeteers. There are many shrewd musico-dramatic strokes. Perhaps the most telling is the one in which three British sailors climb over a wall and accost a young Japanese woman. The trio they sing at her is gentle, plaintive, and its overlap of three separate voices is exquisite. Such delicacy] But what they are attempting is rape, and she (played by a man) sits there in the middle of her trap, trembling in terror all the while. Elsewhere, the story Sondheim tells is multi-faceted, with scenes of comedy, love, grief, and conflict. The Leicester staging is virtually flawless. Russell Dixon takes the central role of narrator and Shogun with command. Amid the excellent supporting cast, three are outstanding: Scott Davies as Kayama (a minor official catapulted into the forefront of international negotiations), Michael Heath as the Shogun's knowing mother ('Chrysanthemum tea'), and Peter Edbrook as a madam training her 'girls' to receive the invading Americans. The only flaws are that 'Pretty lady' should be more mellifluous, and the big dances lack variety. And yet, and yet . . . The more Sondheim you know, the less there is. I acknowledge his finesse and his urbanity. But oh, how all those smart little cycles of clever worldweariness weigh one down. So many rhymes are insistently milked. So many lines are just four, six, or eight syllables long. So many phrases are strings of evenly weighted syllables until the last is prolonged. Sondheim is often praised for steering his idiom clear of the rock musical. True, Sondheim's urbanity is a cut above the crudities of Les Mis or Phantom. But what are you to make of a modern musical composer who not only does not rock but also cannot even swing? He seems both glib and repressed. Pacific Overtures has plenty of japonaiserie - plus minimalism of a generally exotic type; but these features are only skin deep. Au fond, Sondheim's musical style is just an ever so refined version of old vaudeville formulae. The overall effect is sophisticated, trite, and, above all, anaemic. Sometimes, listening to Pacific Overtures, I thought 'This is his best musical.' I would not, however, care to work out which is his worst. Or to calculate what little difference there is between the two. Bygone innocence is forever counterposed by present dissatisfaction. Nostalgia and cynicism rule. The modernisation (Americanisation) of world culture that afflicts Japan here is the same as afflicts art in Sunday in the Park. Worse, Sondheim's characters lack force and scale. Beneath all that polish lies a depressing meagreness of spirit. At the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, until November 6</p>

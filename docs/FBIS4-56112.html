			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oliviu Gherman, president of the Social </F> Democracy Party of Romania and president of the Senate, in  response to a 14 May interview with Vasile Secares, president of  "A Future for Romania" Group: "Politics From the Outside"]    [Text] I have carefully read Mr. Vasile Secares' interview  with CURIERUL NATIONAL and I cannot refrain from making a few  remarks in this connection. I would like to point out that I do  not intend to enter into a polemical discussion with Mr.  Secares, but I would rather try to clarify a few points raised  in my interview with the same newspaper, an interview that was  published a few days before his interview. For the uninformed  reader, I would like to recall that "A Future for Romania" was  initially the title of one of the three motions submitted to the  28 March 1992 National Convention of the former National  Salvation Front [FSN], a motion that was not adopted. During  the aforementioned convention, the FSN split and a grouping  initially called the Democratic National Salvation Front [FDSN]  and later the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] emerged.  What happened with the "A Future for Romania" option? Well, it  remained outside the party structures, turning itself into a  kind of "Political Academy," with an internal life tacitly  supported through the functioning of the National School for  Administrative Studies and Police, an institution sponsored by  this grouping.    Of course, as I said, sometime in the middle of 1990, it is  infinitely easier to sit on the sidelines and criticize what  others are doing. By getting involved, you must cover the  sinuous road of achievements and failures, which constantly  exposes you to justified criticism of your mistakes. Examining  now the road covered by the PDSR (and the FDSN previously), I  can honestly say that many things could have been done  differently than they actually were. Unfortunately -- or maybe  one should say fortunately -- in politics, like in life, you  cannot simultaneously follow two roads. You cannot both take a  medicine and also not take it if you want to check its  usefulness. In politics, you must assume responsibility for  decisions where the alternatives are not clear-cut. Most often,  you have to choose between 45-55 percent solutions, in  circumstances whereby it is impossible to estimate the evolution  of the two choices. The people involved in politics are held  responsible for all bungling decisions, while the fact that  someone has to take a decision of sorts is often omitted.  Therefore, we would have gladly welcomed the involvement of the  supporters of the aforementioned motion in a party political  activity and we would have applauded their successes and  criticized their failures. That would have been a more manly  and honest dispute. Unfortunately, the majority of motion  supporters, including Mr. Vasile Secares, preferred to remain  outside the party battle and slightly above it so as to  occasionally pass judgment -- often quite pertinently -- on the  political climate in Romania. It is like writing reports about  a war you are not participating in. However, there is no doubt  that they are entitled to their choice. Returning to my  previous interview, I would like to emphasize several other  elements. First, referring to the political crisis in Romania,  Mr. Secares fails to give an appropriate explanation. If he  wants to characterize the entire post-December 1989 political  life in our country by using the term "crisis," then I must  agree with him: Yes, we are going through a political crisis  characteristic of the stage of political infancy, whose main  feature is the miming of authentic politics, which is not  suitable to Romania's situation of today. Indeed, by avoiding  the imperious requirements of the current period, the political  forces in Romania engaged themselves in a sterile dispute that  has nothing to do with what must be done by all of us. I  remember a significant moment. A few weeks ago -- to be more  precise, in a television broadcast on Monday 25 April --  correspondent Cristache asked Petre Roman, president of the  Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)], whether  he feels he is fulfilling his mission of parliamentarian. With  his known elegance and precision, Mr. Petre Roman presented a  summary of the parliamentary actions, with which he has combated  the governmental solutions. It was a kind of synopsis of an  opposition stance. There is no doubt that we do not have the  right to ignore the barricade side we happen to be on.  Nevertheless, reality is above us all. I would have liked to  ask my friend and political adversary Petre Roman what his  answers might have been to all those accusations if he had been  the leader of the government party or the country's prime  minister? In today's conditions, are we allowed to change our  options from one extreme to the other in function of our stand  vis-a-vis those temporarily in power at a certain point? May we  change our position vis-a-vis the relations with the IMF, as a  function of whether we are in power or not? Therefore,  proceeding from this example, I agree with the term of  "politicking" used in the aforementioned interview, a term  attributed to the attitude of the majority of the political  parties in Romania.    If Mr. Secares is exclusively referring to the current  moment when talking about the political crisis in Romania, I  will tell him that he is wrong and tendentious. As I have  already said in the past, the concept of political crisis, as it  refers to a given moment, is a formula invented by the  opposition in its attempt to gain political capital. For a long  time, the PDSR was damned for everything by having the most  colorful invectives hurled at it: neo, crypto, and everything  else that could be put before the word "communist" was  attributed to the party to suggest the revival of communism.    Initially, things were simplified to ridiculous proportions  when one proceeded to evaluate the Romanian political spectrum:  On the one hand, you had an identifiable evil -- that is, the  PDSR, an infernal instrument of the return to the past; on the  other hand, you had an incontestable good, represented by the  forces of opposition, which are allegedly promoting progress and  reform, although they opposed all measures for their  implementation. This kind of evaluation lasted until a stable  majority centered around the PDSR took shape. With the  emergence of this majority, the concept of political crisis also  emerged. The script is so simple and clear that I am offended  by the hope of those who concocted it that we would fall into  the trap set for us. The first stage consisted in an attempt to  isolate the PDSR from its allies, which helped our party cover  the Calvary of reform, by omitting to mention that those who  claim to want the reform were also the ones who actually raised  the greatest obstacles in the path of reform. I do not want to  give examples, so as to not appear too obvious. The second  stage consisted of an attempt to turn the PDSR, which ceased to  be called neocommunist, into a kind of ping-pong match between  the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and the PD(FSN) --  that is, into a kind of minority beggar within a coalition that  would have decided its existence.    The solution proposed by Mr. Secares for solving the  hardships of the transition in Romania is a variant of the "A  Future for Romania" type, that is a nonparty or supraparty  variant, which would realign the parliamentarians -- some from  the PDSR, others from the CDR, and some from the PD(FSN). First  of all, I regret that his solution omitted to mention the other  parliamentary groupings, which are equally entitled to a role.  I also cannot refrain from raising a scholarly question: On  the basis of what criteria will those parliamentarians be  elected? Are we going to set up a supraparty or an extraparty  of just a few people? I believe the realistic thing to do is to  convince all parties that, for a certain period of time, we must  all work together to come out of the deadlock, while maintaining  our identity, as it is confirmed by the various parliamentary  and extraparliamentary official acts.    I am saying all this because I am deeply convinced that Mr.  Secares' solution, although attractive at first glance, is mere  utopia. I agree that we are at a crossroads, albeit less  obvious than the ones we have put behind us in the past one and  a half years of government. I agree that we must undertake  something to ensure the triumph of the good values. However,  unlike Mr. Secares, I believe that this can only be achieved  from within the parties, be they good or less good, as the  situation is today. We must pool our political efforts, but  only after clarifications that must occur within each party. In  the medium run, the parties must shape Romania's political life  around several basic choices based on pragmatism: center-right,  center, and center-left, with their natural satellites, to  preserve the stability of the political spectrum.</p>

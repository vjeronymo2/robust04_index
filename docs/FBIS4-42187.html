			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Vienna -- The international community should  confine itself to "purely humanitarian actions" in Rwanda,  Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says: "One should not try to  govern countries. This mistake was made in Somalia." Therefore,  he is against a military intervention.    "If I take food from point A to point B and I am stopped by  a  gang, I can shoot them. If I evacuate civilians and someone  wants to kill them, I can defend them. But this is different  from the attempt to disarm the Somalis," Museveni said at a  joint news conference with Chancellor Vranitzky in Vienna on  Thursday [26 May].    The Rwandan rebels are not supported by Uganda, he said. In  answer to the question of where the rebels get arms from, he  answered: "When we were fighting, we did not have a special  country from which we got weapons. We either bought them on the  black market or took them off our opponents." [passage omitted]</p>

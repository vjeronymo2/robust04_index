			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EII now seeks to acquire, from time to time through July 1, 1996, the additional 400 shares of class C nonvoting common stock (``Additional Shares''), $2,500 per share, for $1 million. The proceeds of the sale of the Additional Shares would be used by Cogen Corp. to fund ongoing project development expenses. EII's ownership of the Additional Shares would, together with the 3,000 shares of Stock authorized in the Order, be subject to terms and conditions of a stockholders agreement that delineates the powers of the shareholders of Cogen Corp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the Order, EII has an obligation to acquire, from time to time through July 1, 1996, an additional 2,000 shares of Stock. As security for that obligation, EII has deposited $2.5 million in cash into an escrow account. However, under the Stock Purchase Agreement, EII may substitute an irrevocable bank letter of credit (``LOC'') for the cash escrow. EII represents that use of an LOC for this purpose may be less expensive than cash collateral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, EII proposes to enter into a letter of credit reimbursement agreement with a bank, which would provide an LOC to Cogen Corp. The reimbursement agreement would obligate EII to repay the issuing bank in the event of any draw on the LOC. The LOC would have a maximum fact amount of $2.5 million. Drawings on the LOC would bear interest at a rate not more than 5% above the prime rate as in effect from time to time. EII may be also required to pay fees not to exceed 1% annually of the LOC face amount. The LOC would have a final maturity of not later than July 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, et al. (70&hyph;8337) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (``OVEC'') and Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation (``Indiana-Kentucky''), both located at P.O. Box 468, Piketon, Ohio 45661 and both electric public-utility subsidiary companies of American Electric Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, have filed a declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indiana law requires that permitees of a solid waste landfill in the state satisfy certain financial responsibility standards. To satisfy such standards for its fly ash landfill at the Clifty Creek Plant, Indiana-Kentucky proposes to enter into a reimbursement agreement in connection with the issue of a letter of credit. The letter of credit would not exceed $10 million and would be for a one year term then renewable annually. Drawings under the letter of credit would bear interest at not more than two percent above the bank's prime rate. Indiana-Kentucky may pay an annual fee which would not exceed one percent of the face amount of the letter of credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OVEC proposes to indemnify the bank issuing such letter of credit for any payments, or to guarantee the obligation of Indiana-Kentucky to reimburse the bank of such payments. OVEC's obligation to the bank would be on the same terms as Indiana-Kentucky's obligation to the bank. OVEC would charge no fee to Indiana-Kentucky for such indemnity or guaranty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EUA Energy Investment Corporation (70&hyph;8351)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EUA Energy Investment Corporation (``EEIC''), P.O. Box 2333, Boston, Massachusetts 02107, a non-utility subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates, a registered holding company, has filed an application under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By order dated December 4, 1987 (HCAR No. 24515), as amended by order dated January 11, 1988 (HCAR No. 24515A) (collectively, ``Orders''), EUA was authorized to organize and finance a new subsidiary corporation (named NewCo in the Orders, but chartered as EEIC) primarily for the purpose of participating in cogeneration and small power production facilities and in related activities.

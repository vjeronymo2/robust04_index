			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHOICE IS WIDE FOR LOW-FLOW WATER SYSTEMS;  </P> <P> IRRIGATION: DIFFERENT DRIP SYSTEMS SERVE DIFFERENT PLANTINGS. KITS ARE  AVAILABLE FOR MOST.  </P> <P> What people call drip irrigation can actually be several types of systems.  "Drip" should probably be called "low-flow," "low-pressure" or "low-volume"  irrigation because that's the one thing the various systems have in common.  </P> <P> The methods all operate on low water pressure with a low rate of application --  they deliver the water slowly so it can soak in.  </P> <P> Because they operate at low pressure and low volume, you can hook quite a few  devices up to one garden faucet, or one valve. In fact, a big advantage of drip  irrigation is that you do not need a lot of valves. One for the front yard and  one for the back is usually enough.  </P> <P> Here are the various low-flow systems in broad groups, with some suggestions  for starter kits. Pictured are some of the components from the kits, plus a few  components available only through irrigation suppliers (see the Yellow Pages),  to give you an idea of the great variety available if you are ready to assemble  your own system from scratch:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drip tubing, emitters  </P> <P> This is what most people think of when you say drip -- skinny little tubes  (one-quarter-inch tubing), often called "spaghetti" with individual "drippers"  or emitters, along the way or at the ends. The spaghetti fans out from larger  pipes (one-half-inch tubing).  </P> <P> The emitters have very small orifices so that water drips out slowly. As it  soaks in it also spreads out so it waters a much larger area than you think.  </P> <P> In the past, these tiny orifices tended to clog, which gave drip systems a bad  name, but better filters and "torturous path" or "turbulent flow" emitters have  helped tremendously. The filters screen out the inevitable particles found in  our water and a zigzag channel inside the emitters keeps the water turbulent so  that solids do not have a chance to settle.  </P> <P> Many of the inexpensive starter kits that are commonly available use separate  emitters and skinny drip tubing. If you plan to water individual plants --  young trees, shrubs or shrubby ground covers -- that are spaced several feet  apart, this is the easiest system to put together. It is also easy to add onto  later.  </P> <P> And if you vary the size of the emitters (which determines how much water comes  out, measured in gallons per hour -- gph), you can give different plants  different amounts of water. It is also easy to figure out how long to leave  this kind of system on.  </P> <P> Drip Mist makes inexpensive kits. Raindrip makes several sophisticated starter  kits with turbulent flow emitters and pressure compensating devices, as does  Drip Irrigation Garden (DIG). Rain Bird makes kits with pressure-compensating  emitters with with self-cleaning diaphragms.  </P> <P> Pressure-compensating devices -- different than the pressure regulators at the  beginning of the system -- are contained in each emitter and ensure that the  amount of water coming out of emitters at the far end of the system is the same  as that close to the faucet.  </P> <P> Such devices are important on long runs of tubing or on hillsides. In fact, it  is hard to imagine watering a hillside with anything other than  pressure-compensating emitters -- there is virtually no runoff and plants at  the bottom of the hill get as much as plants at the top.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In-line emitters  </P> <P> In some applications, there are problems with spaghetti tubing and individual  emitters. The tubes can be unsightly (you may bury the tubing, but not the  emitters), they are in the way when weeding or cultivating, dogs make a mess of  them and there are a lot of parts to keep track of.  </P> <P> So when plants are spaced close together (as in flower beds or vegetable  gardens or even in areas where trees or shrubs are close together), you might  consider "in-line emitters."  </P> <P> In-line emitters -- almost always turbulent-flow types -- are hidden inside the  main tubing, are between short lengths of solid tubing. Because the tubing is  much larger, it tends to stay put, and while you can't bury the tubing, you can  hide it under a mulch.  </P> <P> A particularly nice kit (pictured) is offered through the mail by The Natural  Gardening Co. Raindrip also makes a new in-line system.  </P> <P> A variation on this theme uses separate emitters, but they are punched into the  sides of larger tubing, with a simple hand punch, so there is not a maze of  spaghetti. Again, this works best where plants are fairly close together,  although you can vary the placement of the emitters so you are not watering  empty ground anywhere. Rain Bird makes a new kit using half-inch tubing. (The  pieces, not available as a kit, are available separately through irrigation  suppliers. They are made by Olson Irrigation Systems, 10910 Wheatlands Ave.,  Santee, Calif. 92071, (800) 776-5766.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drip tape  </P> <P> Used extensively by agriculture, drip tapes are just beginning to show up as  kits. Agricultural tapes are short-lived, designed to be disposable; homeowner  versions are sturdier. Some even have tortuous paths molded inside the  flattened tube-like tape. They work much like the in-line drip systems, with  holes evenly spaced along the lengths of tape.  </P> <P> However, most can not turn corners and must be laid in fairly straight lines or  they become pinched, which cuts the flow. Drip Irrigation Garden makes a  simple, inexpensive kit with torturous paths molded into the tubing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Porous piping  </P> <P> Not to be confused with perforated, laser-drilled piping (which is not  available in kit form and is intended only for short runs), porous piping  "sweats" water though many little pores. It is best when buried. Porous piping  is favored in flower beds where plants are very close together because it  cannot be seen.  </P> <P> It is possible to run 600 feet of porous piping off a single faucet, and  filters are usually not included in kits. Pipes are simply flushed  occasionally, but a filter is nevertheless a good idea. Moisture Master makes  kits and sells fertilizer injectors/filters separately.  </P> <P> The flow in porous piping is determined by little disks placed at the  beginning. Disks that create flows of 1, 2 or 4 gallons a minute are available.  Note that this is per minute, not per hour, as flow is usually measured in drip  emitters.  </P> <P> (To compare porous pipe to individual emitters, figure out how much water is  coming out of any one foot of pipe, by dividing the total flow by the length of  the pipe. With the smallest flow disk, a foot of pipe in a run 50 feet long,  will have a flow of 1.2 gallon per hour, which is close to the typical 1 gph  drip emitter.)  </P> <P> Hydro-Grow is another porous pipe system, available through the mail from  Gardener's Supply.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mini-sprinklers  </P> <P> The newest idea in low-flow irrigation devices are tiny sprinklers. Unlike  regular sprinklers, these put water on slowly, so it has time to sink in and is  not lost to runoff. Because the droplets are small, you cannot operate  mini-sprinklers when the wind is blowing.  </P> <P> Mini-sprays or jets are similar but simpler still. They are most like the shrub  heads used with sprinkler systems -- a simple jet of water -- but again they  apply the water slowly. They cover less area so more are needed but they are  almost invisible if the supply pipe is buried.  </P> <P> Neither are for lawns, but are for ground cover areas or other plantings where  there are lots of individual plants close together. Gardeners fond of  perennials and other flowers like them a lot because they are less  trouble-prone and easy to fix.  </P> <P> If they clog, you notice it right away. They are very easy to install -- it  takes just minutes -- and they feel more familiar since you can see how much  ground is being wetted.  </P> <P> They are also good for azaleas and other shallow-rooted plants that need a  large, shallow area wetted.  </P> <P> Raindrip makes a mini-sprinkler kit and more systems are on the way. Raindrip's  operate at a pressure of 15 pounds per square inch and the 180-degree heads  deliver only 6 gallons per hour, compared to an ordinary sprinkler which pours  the water at a rate of about 60 to 180 gallons per hour. Putting this kit  together is more fun than Tinkertoys.  </P> <P> DIG also makes a kit. (Mini-sprays and sprinklers by Olson Irrigation Systems,  not available in kit form.)  </P> <P> No particular drip irrigation system seems to be ideal for all uses. All have  their advantages, and gardeners will most likely use more than one kind of  drip.  </P> <P> Rows of vegetables will be irrigated one way, flowers another, ground covers  another, trees and shrubs yet another. Special plants like azaleas will get  their own special system. Conventional sprinklers are still the only way to  irrigate lawns.  </P> <P> If this great variety of systems leaves you confused, don't worry. If you stick  with kits, they do come with instructions. Just choose a kit that most suits  your needs -- for watering flowers, or shrubs, ground covers, or whatever need  irrigating more efficiently.  </P> <P> Next: How long you should water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DRIP-IRRIGATION MANUFACTURERS  </P> <P> Drip Irrigation Garden (DIG Corp.), 7916 Ajay Drive, Sun Valley, Calif. 91352.

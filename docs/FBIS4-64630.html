			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "The Conservatives Out of </F> the Shadows"]    [Text] It is creaking, but it is holding. Cooperation  between the Liberals and the Conservatives has been shaken  several times recently. Following a reconciliation meeting  between the two parties' coordinating committee last Tuesday [15  March], it was decided that the parties would continue to work  toward creating a nonsocialist-liberal government after the  coming Folketing elections.    Conservative leader Hans Engell was the cause of the latest  furor in the nonsocialist camp. He opened the door to  discussions on expanding the possibility of investing  wage-earner funds in businesses. This elicited harsh criticism  from the Liberals, from the Danish Employers Association, and  from Danish Industry. On the other hand, as expected, Engell was  warmly embraced verbally by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen,  since the government is making a conscious effort to split  Liberal-Conservative cooperation.    This kind of basic political truth is known all too well by  the leaders of the Liberal and Conservative Parties and their  main concern is to keep the two parties together as a possible  alterative government. Consequently, the two parties issued a  joint news release following the Tuesday meeting of their  coordinating committee. The meeting, by the way, had already  been arranged before Engell stole the nonsocialist scene last  week.    Nothing was left to chance, however. Engell and Liberal  leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen clarified a number of issued over  the telephone on Monday. They agreed to issue a joint statement  to the press and it was polished up by Liberal Vice Chairman  Anders Fogh Rasmussen the same day. After a friendly luncheon  meeting of the coordinating committee at Engell's office on  Tuesday, the news release was sent out. It stated that the two  parties had begun to develop a joint election platform,  containing general guidelines for economic policy. It was  stressed that during the coming months the parties would strive  to coordinate their political statements at regular meetings of  the coordinating committee.    However, the political reality is such that a power struggle  between the two parties has now clearly begun. The Conservatives  are now emerging from the shadows of the Tamil affair, and they  have recently become more and more irritated over the Liberals'  posture as the leading opposition party and Ellemann-Jensen's  style as a prime minister candidate. Moreover, Engell is now  confident enough to act more firmly as the Conservative leader  who must demonstrate that the Conservative Party is an  independent party and not the Liberal Party's little brother.  "Nonsocialist votes that work" was Poul Schluter's slogan in the  1977 elections, and it is still valid.    During the past half year, Engell has talked to a number of  business leaders and he has noted an increasing need for new  ways of thinking in many areas. The question of ATP [Labor  Market Supplementary Pension] and the Wage Earners Cost of  Living Fund investments are one example. Thus, Engell spoke out  in an interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE last Sunday, without  first informing the Conservative Folketing group and, of course,  without informing Liberal Party members.    Many Conservatives were pleased by Engell's manner of making  the political agenda, at least for a time, for the Liberals and  for the government. The political turmoil has strengthened  Engell's position.    The Conservative leadership is simply shrugging off the  Liberals' reaction to the proposal in the form of predictable  objections to "fund socialism through the back door." In the  view of the Conservatives, every time the Liberals have brought  up controversial proposals they have assumed that the  Conservatives would simply stand by silently. But now that the  Conservatives have spoken, the Liberals are suddenly talking  about a threat to Conservative-Liberal cooperation.    The Liberals feel that the Conservatives not only take  positions on Liberal proposals, but that they clearly criticize  Liberal policies. And it is this that is the threat to  Conservative-Liberal cooperation. Among other things, the  Liberal leadership is still bitter over the fact that the day  before the Liberal Party's national meeting on the EU on 26  February, Engell (in an interview with JYLLANDS-POSTEN)  distanced himself from the Liberals' EU policy and warned  against making EU policy a political battle ground in Denmark.    Liberal politicians warn that the two parties could end up  as  they did in the 1970's, when in every decisive situation the  Social Democrats managed to play the Liberals and Conservatives  off against each other so that, despite a nonsocialist Folketing  majority most years, Denmark had a Social Democratic minority  government.    Another concern is also clearly discernible in the Liberal  Party. The party's leading politicians are afraid that, in  reality, the Conservatives do not actually want the  Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority after the Folketing  elections, toward which the Liberals are working. This majority  would make Ellemann-Jensen prime minister of a strong  nonsocialist bloc that would work against the Social Democrats  and the middle parties. This concern of the Liberals is not  without basis in reality. The Conservatives want a  Liberal-Conservative government, but they are not particularly  interested in forming a bloc with the Progress Party as a  supporting party in Folketing. The Conservatives would like to  use a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority as a  battering ram for creating a nonsocialist government. But they  would also like for a future nonsocialist government to work  together with the middle parties.    This is why many Conservatives stress the idea of including  the middle parties in a coalition, knowing full well that a  nonsocialist government after the next elections is highly  unlikely. Regardless of the election outcome, the three small  parties in the present government cannot go from Rasmussen to  Ellemann-Jensen in the fall of 1994. But perhaps in the  following elections, possibly in 1996, they could turn from  Rasmussen to Engell.    Engell's statements on the wage-earner funds have served as  a  catalyst in the escalating debate over the difference between  the Liberals and the Conservatives. But EU policy is certainly  the area in which the major difference between the Liberals and  Conservatives will be seen.    The Liberals' proposal for a national referendum in the near  future on Danish membership in the WEU [Western European Union],  the party's official line in favor of eliminating all of  Denmark's exception clauses as soon as possible, the Liberals'  acceptance of less power for the smaller EU nations and,  especially, the decision at the Liberal Party EU congress that  the EU should have a two-chamber system in which the European  Parliament would be one of the legislative chambers are all  elements that the Conservatives oppose. The Conservatives do not  want a confrontation over Denmark's EU policy. A more peaceful  development that would guarantee a yes vote in a future  referendum is more in line with the Conservatives' thinking.    EU policy is also an area that can make cooperation  difficult  for the Liberals, Conservatives, and Progress Party. It would be  difficult to reconcile the EU position of the Liberals with that  of the Progress Party.    Even though the Liberals and Conservatives are now drawing  up  a joint election platform, they will continue to act as  independent parties, the party leaderships state. The Liberals  released a tax plan the other day that the Conservatives knew  nothing about. The Conservatives have remained silent on the  plan, while the government is shooting it down. Next week the  Conservatives will present a report on the political economy of  education, taxation, and business policy.    And what about the candidate for prime minister? After the  meeting on Tuesday, Ellemann-Jensen was asked if they had  discussed who would become prime minister. "Yes, we did. One of  us two," Ellemann-Jensen said, with a nod toward Hans Engell.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Yugoslav industrial output tumbles INDUSTRIAL production in Yugoslavia fell just over 23 per cent last month compared with a year earlier. Croatia, the independence-minded western republic, was hardest hit ; its output fell by 29 per cent. The three-month figure for the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo was 31.2 per cent below that for the same period last year. The republics of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia are all resisting the market reforms proposed by Mr Ante Markovic, the prime minister. These reforms call for the total overhaul of the country's financial and banking system and introduction of a restrictive monetary policy. The programme aims to break the hold over the economy of local political authorities. Mr Markovic criticised the republics sharply last week for sabotaging his plans and he appealed to the federal parliament to back the reforms in the 'transitional period' while the country's leaders sought a resolution to the political crisis. He said Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn in loans from the International Monetary Fund and western banks depended on the republics' compliance with the programme. Yugoslavia's foreign debt totals Dollars 16.1bn and its trade deficit is more than Dollars 4.5bn. In his address to parliament, Mr Markovic announced a 30 per cent devaluation of the dinar. He also outlined plans for restructuring the banking system and the privatisation of state enterprises which the governments of the republics have brought to a standstill. Mr Markovic this week faces a battle in parliament for the approval of his economic reforms.</p>

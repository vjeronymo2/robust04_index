			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEWMAN;  </P> <P> IF HIS DETRACTORS ARE RIGHT, THEN WHERE DID THOSE SIX MISL TITLES COME FROM?  </P> <P> There is a tad of little boy left in Ron Newman. You see it when he jumps up  from his chair to demonstrate a play. Or when he flashes a devilish smile while  discussing a tactic that might bend Major Indoor Soccer League rules to the  limit.  </P> <P> It's a bit surprising that Newman hasn't lost his appetite for this game. He  has been through more than his share of rough spots as coach of the often wild,  sometimes complaining and usually zany Sockers.  </P> <P> Newman has been called everything from a borderline idiot to a borderline  genius, sometimes in the same sentence. Players say his English style of soccer  is archaic. Coaches say his innovations show disrespect for the game. He has  been trashed in the newspapers and is never far from a critic.  </P> <P> Yet Newman has been on the winning end of more indoor soccer games than any  coach in history. His record over nine years is 298-153, including a 60-23  playoff mark.  </P> <P> The skeptics have their argument. Check the talent, you'll hear. Where would he  be without Juli Veee? Branko Segota? Kevin Crow, Brian Quinn and Steve Zungul?  </P> <P> It seems people think this group could have racked up as many victories with  Fred Flintstone running the show. But even Newman's harshest critics admit he  deserves some credit.  </P> <P> "I'm sure we would have won championships," says Crow, the defender who once  requested a trade because he said he no longer wanted to play for Newman. "But  I don't think we would have won six."  </P> <P> Monday, the Sockers play Baltimore in Game 1 of the MISL championship series.  Newman is four victories away from his seventh title. His team, as usual,  pulled through a slow start, a host of injuries and a 3-2 deficit in the  semifinals of the playoffs against Dallas.  </P> <P> That's typical. Little has come easily for Newman.  </P> <P> As a child, he often had to go to bed in an air-raid shelter because German  bombers were attacking the naval yard in his hometown of Portsmouth, England.  </P> <P> His first professional contract as a player earned him $7 a week, hardly enough  to start an early retirement plan.  </P> <P> And despite the championships, life with the Sockers has been rocky. Perhaps  most indicative of that is the way he has learned to measure success. It isn't  in terms of money, victories or championships. Rather, he figures his worth by  the number of times he has been ripped in the newspapers.  </P> <P> Somebody once told him: "It's only when you've made it that you're going to  start getting people calling you names in the media."  </P> <P> By that criteria, Newman could be considered among the greatest coaches of all  time. In any city, any sport.  </P> <P> Examples?  </P> <P> First some background. During January and February of 1986, the Sockers made a  practice of calling timeouts late in games in which they held comfortable  leads. Newman decided these were good situations to practice pulling the goalie  in favor of a sixth attacker, his invention.  </P> <P> Most of the league, even some of the Sockers, took exception, calling it poor  sportsmanship. Displeasure was voiced in print.  </P> <P> Former St. Louis defender Steve Pecher said: "Some of (the Sockers) were coming  up to us after the game and apologizing. They said, 'Don't kick us. It's not  our fault. (Newman) was an idiot last year, and he's an idiot this year.' "  </P> <P> To this day, Crow thinks his coach was wrong.  </P> <P> "I still disagree with it," he said. "He said he was doing it for practice. If  you're the other team, you're not going to look at it that way."  </P> <P> Newman defends himself, saying if he was looking to rub salt in a team's wounds  he would "tell everybody to get on one leg and cover an eye."  </P> <P> Criticism of Newman has been frequent. Many disagree with his ideas, from  players who were taught different brands of soccer in their native countries,  to referees who never could figure what Newman was going to come up with next,  to coaches who were perhaps simply jealous.  </P> <P> Without Newman, this game might have progressed at a nice, steady pace and,  quite possibly, never reached its present level of excitement. Call it a poor  imitation of traditional soccer if you will, but Newman's intentions were  always to improve the entertainment value of both his team and the game.  </P> <P> His first step in preparing for the switch from outdoor to indoor was to read a  hockey book. He didn't get much out of it.  </P> <P> "I found it just like a very ordinary soccer coaching book," Newman said. "They  did the same sort of things you do with high school boys."  </P> <P> Early on, Newman toyed with substitution. It didn't make sense to him to make a  great player run up and down the carpet so long that he could hardly walk by  game's end. So he had players coming and going so fast it made heads spin. Of  course, that also caused problems.  </P> <P> Once, in a game against Chicago, Newman noticed opposing players coming on the  field before their teammates had gone off. He questioned the referee, and the  conversation went something like this:  </P> <P> Newman: What bloody rules are we playing?  </P> <P> Referee: As long as they don't interfere with the game anymore, the other  player can come in.  </P> <P> Newman: That seems a bit bloody lax.  </P> <P> Referee: That's the way hockey does it.  </P> <P> Newman: OK, if we're following hockey . . .  </P> <P> So the next game, in New York against the Cosmos, Newman decided to give the  laws of hockey a go. He asked the referees to clarify the substitution rule  once again and was told the same thing, a player could enter the game as long  as the player coming off was no longer involved in the play.  </P> <P> With that established, Newman proceeded to have an offensive player run toward  the wall every time the Cosmos began a breakaway and send a defensive player  flying off the bench at the other end to mark their unsuspecting center  forward. It worked like a charm and, in Newman's words, "The New York fans went  mad."  </P> <P> The refs pulled Newman aside at halftime and told him he was stretching the  rule a bit too far. Maybe more accurately, it was another case of Newman  stretching his imagination.  </P> <P> During games, Newman stands near the substitution doors. He found out awhile  back he could give his players an advantage by opening the door and redirecting  the ball.  </P> <P> Asked about that, he breaks into a "guilty-as-charged" smile. "I shouldn't do  that," he says. "Sometimes I see that ball coming, and I know if I turn that  door a little bit it may change the angle. It's irresistible."  </P> <P> If Newman's creative mind is one reason for his success, perhaps a bigger one  is his ability to squeeze the best out of a wide variety of players with vastly  different backgrounds.  </P> <P> This season, he brought back superstar Yugoslavian Steve Zungul who, at 34, was  a question mark. Other teams didn't want him. Some thought it was a stupid  move.  </P> <P> Turns out Zungul is second only to Segota in playoff points (12) and has given  the team valuable experience on the attack.  </P> <P> Over the years, Newman has learned bits and pieces from each player's style and  incorporated it into his master game plan.  </P> <P> "I think he's been very flexible," Quinn said. "He kind of gives players a free  rein to do what they want as long as they produce."  </P> <P> That hasn't been easy. Players don't always agree with Newman's style, which is  largely based on his English background.  </P> <P> Listen to Juli Veee: "He comes from the old school, caveman time. The indoor  game is a very new game. The English style of soccer doesn't fit this game at  all."  </P> <P> But Newman's coaching does. He has never put a choke hold on the creativity of  his players. He knows when to leave well enough alone. To hear Veee tell it,  there's no other way to deal with the Sockers. They've always been too crazy to  control.  </P> <P> "The American public doesn't understand the nationality problem," Veee said. "I  couldn't stand half of (the players). And they didn't like me, either."  </P> <P> Judging by some of the negative things said by Socker players in the  newspapers, Newman couldn't be categorized as a popular coach. You don't find  him at the bar on team trips surrounded by players, though maybe he would like  that.  </P> <P> "Ron would like to be close to the players," Quinn said. "He likes everybody to  be his friend. Maybe that's not the nature of the job requirement."  </P> <P> There's difficulty in playing two roles, authority figure and friend.  </P> <P> Veee said he hardly spoke two words to Newman off the field. But when Veee was  having personal problems, going through a divorce, Newman told him: "Juli, take  as much time as you want. Don't worry about it."  </P> <P> "He let you work your own things off," Veee said. "I think he's one helluva  good human being."  </P> <P> A sensitive one, too. He admits the public criticism isn't something he takes  in stride.  </P> <P> "It hurts," he said. "I don't know anybody who likes it. I don't like my family  involved in that type of thing. I don't think it should be done in the media.  I've never criticized a player in the media."  </P> <P> For every critical player who feels Newman's coaching has had little to do with  the Sockers' success, there are others who say he has had quite a bit to do  with it. Waad Hirmez is the first to admit that if anyone should criticize  Newman, it should be him. Newman cut him twice.  </P> <P> Instead, Hirmez says: "He will give a player a chance over and over. You have  to give credit to the person who's putting all these players on the field. He  has done so much for the game in this country. I just can't see why anybody  would criticize him for anything he does."  </P> <P> If nothing else, through good and bad, Newman has retained his sense of humor.  </P> <P> There's one story Newman's son, Guy (who played for the Sockers from 1980-86)  enjoys telling. One day before practice, the players were sitting around  waiting for Ron Newman. He arrived and told Steve Daley, a midfielder, to get  up and do some sprints. The players watched. About the time Daley was getting  tired, somebody asked Newman what he was doing. Newman said he had recently  been in for a checkup, and the doctor told him: "You need to exercise 'daily.'  "  </P> <P> There are many more stories, including the time Veee was supposed to speak at a  luncheon and wasn't able to make it, so Newman showed up with a life-size  cutout of Veee and spoke for him.  </P> <P> The bottom line is that Newman still enjoys coaching. He dismisses the mishaps  with a simple: "Those sort of things happen."  </P> <P> It's the price for doing what he loves.  </P> <P> "The tolerance this man has," says Veee, pausing. "He puts his whole life into  soccer."  </P></p>

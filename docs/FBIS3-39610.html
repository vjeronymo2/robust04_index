			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CPB Expects Stronger Growth in the </F> Economy"]    [Text] The Hague -- The Central Planning Office [CPB] is  expecting economic growth of 2.5 percent for 1995. This is more  than the average of 1.75 percent the political parties took into  account when drawing up their election platforms.    The CPB has not yet made any calculations for 1996 and  subsequent years. If economic growth is actually 2.5 percent,  that would mean a windfall for the government finances of around  10 billion guilders.    As a result of the high economic growth, the number of jobs  will start rising again -- by 23,000 in 1995 -- following two  years of reductions. Some of these will be part-time jobs,  which means that next year an extra 54,000 people will be back  at work. Wim Kok, who heads the electoral lists for the PvdA  [Labor Party] confirmed yesterday evening during a speech in  Leeuwarden that things are going somewhat better with the  economy. For 1995, he is counting on economic growth of "more  than 2 percent." According to Kok, higher economic growth gives  those people entitled to benefits the prospect of receiving  higher benefits, because if there is satisfactory growth there  is no reason to freeze their benefits. The PvdA leader thought  it foolish of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] to call for  an advance freeze of the old-age pension over the next four  years. "There is no reason for such a rigorous step," said Kok.  He has the feeling that, "economically speaking, the worst is  over."    At the Central Planning Office and the Ministry of the  Economy and Finances there were warnings of "exaggerated  optimism." The CPB's figures for 1995 are still early. They  were sent to various ministries for comments. Experience shows  that they can often subsequently undergo radical changes. The  fact that the calculations this year were released so early is  linked to the structural windfall of 18 billion guilders which  the Finance Ministry reported yesterday in the so-called  February Memo. As economic growth rises, the need for radical  savings is not so great and the room for reducing taxes  increases. The report on the anticipated figures comes too late  for the five political parties, which had the CPB check their  election programs. When making the calculations, the CPB starts  out from an average annual economic growth of 1.75 percent. The  CPB hopes to have completed the calculations by next Monday.    With annual economic growth of 2.5 percent, the maintenance  of purchasing power for people at all income levels is back in  sight -- taking account of miscellaneous claims which already  rested on it (growth of the working population, incidental wage  increases, reduction in the budget deficit, and the improvement  of companies' profitability). Planned adjustments to the  national budget and the social security system can, in this  case, be scrapped or reduced drastically. The PvdA, which,  according to the latest version of the election platform has  plans for saving 8.8 billion guilders, will even have money left  over with average economic growth of 2.5 percent. The debate in  the Social and Economic Council (SER) on reducing the difference  between gross wage costs and net wages (the wedge) by 15 billion  guilders is now being looked at in a different light because of  this burst of fair weather. Namely, these 15 billion guilders,  as well as the 2.5 billion guilders which the SER wants to  earmark exclusively for intensifying the structural  reinforcement of government spending must be saved by cuts in  the national budget and social security (employers' view) or  higher energy taxes (employees' view).</p>

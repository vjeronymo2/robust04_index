			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bodycote bolstered by metal division BETTER RESULTS from Bodycote International's metal technology division offset a downturn in its two other areas - workwear and industrial - leaving group pre-tax profits 1.8 per cent ahead at Pounds 6.52m in the first half of 1993. The shares fell 5p to 304p. Mr Joe Dwek, chairman, reported an encouraging outlook for the metal technology activities, now 74 per cent of group profits, and signs of recovery in its UK-based industrial activities. However, EHCO-KLM, which sells workwear and protective clothing mainly in Germany and the Netherlands, was hit by the worsening recession there. Mr Dwek said it was cutting costs and attempting to increase market share. The interim dividend is up from 1.875p to 2p, and earnings per share rose 5.6 per cent to 7.68p (7.27p) helped by a lower tax rate. Group sales were 1 per cent higher at Pounds 37.7m, and interest charges took Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 102,000). Sales by the metal technology division rose 20.4 per cent to Pounds 21.2m, helped by the purchase of Industrial Materials Technology in March 1992. Pre-tax profits from the division, before central costs, rose 19.5 per cent to Pounds 5.15m. EHCO-KLM's profits fell 37.7 per cent to Pounds 629,000 on sales 10.1 per cent lower at Pounds 12.7m, and the industrial division made profits of Pounds 1.15m, down 20.7 per cent on sales 32 per cent down at Pounds 3.77m. Net current assets at June 30 showed a rise from Pounds 24.18m to Pounds 27.6m. Cash at hand and in the bank rose from Pounds 14.78m to Pounds 17.3m, while stocks increased from Pounds 11.22m to Pounds 12.27m over the 12 months.</p>

But,  in return, Britain and the United States must support  Azerbaijan."  <H5>  Russia's Role </H5>   In rely to a question on Russia's role in the region, the  Azerbaijani President Aliyev said: "Russia is already in the  region. Russia keeps 23,000 troops in Armenia. It even wants  to increase their number. Russia also has troops in Georgia.  It wants to raise the number of troops there to the level  existing in Armenia. The borders of Georgia and Armenia with  Turkey are being defended by Russia. Russia has already  interfered in the region."    Indicting that there are no Russian troops in Azerbaijan,  Aliyev said: "We will definitely not allow them in. Azerbaijan  will not hand over its independence to anyone."    In referring to reports that Russia is supporting the former  President Mutalibov against him, Aliyev said: "They cannot  support anyone against me. No one has the power to support  either Mutalibov or Elchibey against me."    Aliyev also received and met for a while with Bulent Ecevit,  leader of Democratic Left party.    During the part of the meeting open to reporters, Aliyev  said  that his meetings with President Suleyman Demirel and Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller were very beneficial and that the ties  between the two countries will be further consolidated. Ecevit  said he shares the same wish.    On the other hand, Hacettepe University conferred on Aliyev  the decree of "honorary doctorate on international relations."    When Aliyev arrived in the university campus to receive the  honor, he was met by a group of protesting Azerbaijani students.  The Azerbaijani president, who was given the doctorate honor by  the university rector Professor Yuksel Bozer, said that  Azerbaijan has now attained the long-aspired independence and  that it will never relinquish it.    Indicating that Azerbaijan has always pursued peace in its  foreign policy but that this is not being implemented due to the  Armenian attacks, Aliyev said: "We are not the attacking side.  We are only fighting against Armenians attacking us. We want  an end to aggression against Azerbaijan and the liberation of  the Azerbaijani lands from the Armenian occupation. We will  defend our lands and independence to the very end."    Aliyev also met and talked for awhile with Deniz Baykal, the  leader of the Republican People's Party.

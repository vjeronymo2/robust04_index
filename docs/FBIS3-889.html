Listen to Francois Reichmans's report from Kigali. He is a  colleague with Belgian Radio-Television:    [Reichmans] The vehicles of humanitarian organizations can  be  seen in the Rwandan capital, as well as the jeeps and the light  armored vehicles of UN soldiers. There are night patrols, a  curfew is in force, the town is anxious. Weapons and grenades  are changing hands. Districts have set up militias armed with  bows and arrows, as well as bludgeons.    There will soon be 2,500 UN soldiers in Rwanda, including  450  Belgians who have already been here for four months. The UN  mission in Rwanda [MINUAR] is an operation aiming at maintaining  peace. The UN soldiers have been deployed to contribute to the  implementation of the Arusha peace accords. Things are now at a  total standstill: There is still no parliament and no  broad-based government, but a political vacuum and rumors that  the war has resumed. The UN representative in Rwanda,  Cameroonian Jacques-Rene Booh-Booh, issued another warning on  Friday: The UN soldiers may leave:    [Booh-Booh] I would like to remind you that the MINUAR  is saying quite simply that the economic and social situation in  the country is worsening; that famine is killing large numbers  of people; that insecurity is taking a firm hold; and that at  the end of the day, the signatory countries of the Arusha peace  accord have not yet honored their commitments. The peace  process is at a standstill. The specter of a new war is  persisting. I would like you to remember that the MINUAR can  only enjoy continuing support if parties implement quickly all  the Arusha peace accords. On 4 or 5 April, if there has not  been substantial progress in the implementation of the Arusha  peace accord, we may not continue our activities. This was said  on several occasions by the Security Council and, only recently,  by the Security Council chairman.    [Reichmans] The outgoing Rwandan prime minister, Agathe  Uwilingiyamana, came from the main opposition party, the  Republican Democratic Movement [MDR]. Her successor has already  been appointed, but he has not yet taken up office. The Rwandan  prime minister has denounced the paralysis, while the situation  in the country is worrying:    [Uwiliniyamana] We have security problems. Almost  every day, people are killed, whether they are poor peasants or  political leaders. Famine is raging in the country. In almost  every part of our country, people die of hunger every day.  People die of diseases such as dysentery and malaria. You see,  we do not have institutions capable of negotiating with our  donors, our backers, in order to solve these problems. The  Rwandan people want peace. They can no longer bear waiting for  the institutions to be set up. The Rwandan people believe that  this is their only salvation. The setting up of the broad-based  transitional government means the end of the war, it means  peace.    [Reichmans] Rwanda is stifling under the weight of refugees.  Those from the north, after the war; those from the south, those  from Burundi, who came in October. People were traumatized by  the coup and the massacres in Burundi, the sister country. Two  officials of political parties were assassinated a fortnight  ago, and this caused concern. Several attempts to mend the  accords turned out to be a failure. Political maneuvers led to  radicalization on both sides. The political center has been  weakened. The Rwandan prime minister has condemned President  Habyarimana's division tactics:    [Uwilingiyamana] Some political leaders are showing a  lack of goodwill, irresponsibility even. We have my own  political party, the MDR, and the Liberal Party. In both  parties, there have been different tendencies, but at some  stage, the president started supporting one of the tendencies in  his party. Division, confusion within both parties has  prevented the establishment of the institutions. I believe that  ethnic differences were used. This is more obvious as far as  the Liberal Party is concerned: They believe that there is a  Tutsi faction and a Hutu faction. The Rwandan people are not  ready to give themselves over to this extremism. Extremists will  always be wrong, whatever their ethnic origins.</p>

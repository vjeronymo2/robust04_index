			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The four-day Invention Convention opens in Pasadena today, and the latest crop  of gizmos in search of financial backers includes:  </P> <P> * Running shoes with springs on the soles, which allegedly cushion the knees  and give more lift. (Warning: They have not been approved for use in the  Olympic Games.)  </P> <P> * A flying disc that contains a gyro, enabling it to be thrown more accurately.  (Just think: No more bouncing one off that 240-pound guy who's asleep on the  beach.)  </P> <P> * And, Rapel, an anti-rape device that consists of a capsule filled with a  synthetic skunk juice that can be punctured to ward off an attacker. Rapel also  includes a companion capsule of skunk-juice neutralizer for the victim to use  afterward.  </P> <P> "It completely removes the smell," said convention spokesman Jim Hughes. "And  the would-be attacker can be easily detected."  </P> <P> Not all of the novelties are fresh off the drawing board. Canadian-born  inventor Paul LeBlond has been trying to find a backer for Rapel for more than  a decade.  </P> <P> The most profitable product of all may be the Invention Convention itself,  which extracts fees from the inventors as well as $10 per head from members of  the public.  </P> <P> It's a laudable idea even if it doesn't sound very poetic.  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn wants to proclaim September "Adjustable Wrench for Gas  Meter Shut-Off Month," a challenge for any scroll-maker. The idea is for  residents to familiarize themselves with how to shut off their gas in case they  discover a leak after a disaster.  </P> <P> This, of course, follows another disaster preparedness proclamation issued by  Santa Clarita, which chose August to celebrate "Flashlight and Batteries  Month."  </P> <P> Bruce Compilli of Pleasanton, Calif., was rolling in the money -- 60 tons of  quarters -- at Universal Studios Wednesday. As the announced 60-millionth  visitor to the attraction, he was given the opportunity to grab as many of the  coins as he could in one minute. He then took the option of trading it all in  for a mystery grand prize, which turned out to be $25,000 in cash and prizes.  </P> <P> A s a young man, novelist William Faulkner worked in a post office in Oxford,  Miss. So who knows? Maybe there's a another future winner of the Nobel Prize  for Literature represented in the book, "Men &amp; Women of Letters: An  Anthology of Short Stories by Letter Carriers." Among the entries included by  Los Angeles-born editor John Yewell is "Tempe," by F. N. Wright of Agoura.  </P> <P> Faulkner, by the way, was fired from his postal job after he was accused of  being so negligent that the only way residents could obtain their mail was to  dig it out of the trash can at the back door of the post office.  </P> <P> Even Faulkner would have been able to find the "AIRMAIL" box on a front lawn in  Sherman Oaks. But the neighborhood landmark, perched on a 15-foot pole, doesn't  really receive mail from the U.S. Postal Service or carrier pigeons, for that  matter.  </P> <P> It's actually a signpost that the owner installed so that friends would be able  to spot his house, which is hidden from traffic on fast-moving Beverly Glen  Boulevard.  </P> <P> Vineyards Street, Mother Ditch and Grasshoppers Street might not ring a bell  with workers in downtown Los Angeles today. But those were the names of roads  in the Civic Center on Los Angeles Map No. 1, which was completed 140 years ago  this week.  </P> <P> The map maker was Lt. Edward O.C. Ord, who was hired for $3,000 to number the  blocks and lots of the impoverished town -- a task that was needed before the  sale of public lands could begin.  </P> <P> Some names, such as Vineyards, give a clue as to the agrarian character of the  region. Vineyards, later Orchards, now is not-so-sweet-smelling San Pedro  Street. Mother Ditch and Grasshoppers are better known today as Los Angeles and  Figueroa Streets, respectively.  </P> <P> The dusty pueblo wasn't so sprawling then. In fact, Ord only bothered to number  as far south as 8th Street. But he did draw unnamed streets as deep into the  country as present-day Pico Boulevard.  </P></p>

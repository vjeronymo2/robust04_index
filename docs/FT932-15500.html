			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Two unusually tempting offers, and both at 9.00. Channel 4's excellent catch-all culture series Without Walls shows the first of three programmes on technological advances this century and asks the old Frankenstein question: will mankind's ingenuity produce technology to serve our interests or will it take over the world. Artificial intelligence, robotics and plastic surgery all come into the picture. The movie Broadcast News, receiving its first screening on terrestrial television (9.00 ITV), is wickedly accurate and the funniest Hollywood film about television. It involves romance and has a 'Thirty-something' flavour, but it is the authentic and hilarious newsroom scenes which are so rewarding. Assignment (7.45 BBC2) reports on the astounding political situation in Italy where scores of politicians, civil servants and businessmen are now in prison. As they await investigation for corruption the horrors of prison life are inducing many to sing like canaries, producing a virtuous circle of revelation and further incrimination.</p>

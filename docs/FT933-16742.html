			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Warning for glass makers in Japan JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry has warned leading sheet glass makers to end a system of kickbacks to dealers, which the Fair Trade Commission has suggested is a restriction on industry competition. But one of the makers, Asahi Glass, said an FTC report describing the industry's behaviour as inappropriate had vindicated its way of doing business because 'they found that we do not violate the anti-monopoly law'. Three companies - Asahi, Nippon Sheet Glass and Central Glass - dominate the Japanese market. The FTC found they run a dealer network that tends to exclude competitors, including foreigners. After publication of the FTC report, the ministry warned the three companies that they should change their ways, in particular payments to dealers who achieve sales targets set by the manufacturers. The ministry's ceramics and construction material division asked the companies to 'observe anti-monopoly laws more thoroughly' and ensure their contracts with dealers include no clause to stop them selling competitors' products. They were also told to 'educate employees to avoid market activities that might cause illegal mutual dealing' - a reference to what is sometimes friendly co-operation among the three companies. But the removal of contract clauses to restrict dealers' contact with other suppliers might not clear a path for foreign suppliers. An FTC study of car dealers found that about half believed they were restricted to sell one make of vehicle, even though there is no specific limitation in their contracts. After suggesting that the FTC report had vindicated the glass makers, Asahi Glass said the company would examine whether measures could be taken to ensure that the market remain open to foreign competition.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Competition policy queried THE LACK of a cohesive approach by the competition authorities to defining markets is producing inconsistencies in the vetting of monopolies and mergers, research published yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading shows. The research, carried out for the OFT by economic consultants Nera, indicates that a company's 'market share' is invariably quoted by the OFT and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to help justify a decision to block a merger on competition grounds, or to infer that a company enjoys a dominant market position. But the question of how the particular market is defined is rarely addressed explicitly and there are inconsistencies in approach between one case and another, the report says. For example, the MMC's approach to defining markets in cases involving secondary products (spare parts) has varied considerably, it says. Nera says that in an attempt to iron out such inconsistencies the OFT and MMC should be obliged to define the relevant market as an explicit stage in their analysis before using market shares to support their conclusions. This would bring UK competition policy into line with the way the European Commission and the European Court apply EC competition law. Nera notes that many different concepts of the term 'the market' exist, and suggests an economic approach to market definition, including checklists for dealing with specific problems such as deciding whether a market is national or international, and assessing how similar two products need to be in order to be classified in the same market.

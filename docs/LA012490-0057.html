			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> ESSAYING A TANTALIZING, UNUSUAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY  </P> <P> Freud's Vienna and Other Essays, by Bruno Bettelheim (Alfred A. Knopf: $22.95,  271 pp.)  </P> <P> At 85, Bruno Bettelheim remains one of the commanding figures of psychoanalysis  and child psychology in the 20th Century -- a man who survived the Holocaust  and then devoted his life and work to exploring the most intimate regions of  the human mind and the human experience. Yet Bettelheim declines to reveal very  much of himself in print: "I believe what Freud said about biographies applies  even more to autobiographies, namely that the person who undertakes such a task  'binds himself to lying, to concealment, to flummery.' " Curiously, the analyst  who has probed deeply into the heart and mind mostly refuses to divulge the  secrets of "that most private world which I believe best remains private."  </P> <P> Instead, by way of summing up a life of immense intellectual accomplishment,  Bettelheim now offers a collection of 18 of his most important essays, none of  which are otherwise available in book form. Bettelheim gives us a few  tantalizing details of his own experiences in Vienna, in Dachau and elsewhere,  but these lectures, book reviews and essays are mostly works of critical  scholarship, not self-revelation. As I read Bettelheim's lapidary words, I had  the sensation of strolling through an elegant sculpture garden, stopping here  and there to contemplate the statuary. Many of these essays are famous and  familiar, a few are even notorious, others are fairly obscure, but all reveal  the workings of a civilized and compassionate mind.  </P> <P> The first section of the book is devoted to Freud and psychoanalysis, and the  title essay is a fine example of Bettelheim's genius for picking out what seems  to be a narrow and even parochial topic -- the reason why psychoanalysis "was  born and came of age" in Vienna -- and then bringing his mastery of art,  history, letters and science to bear upon his subject. Thus, for example, we  are reminded in "Freud's Vienna" of the political and diplomatic decline of the  Austro-Hungarian empire; the sexual scandals of the Hapsburg court, including  the suicide pact of the crown prince and his lover; the obsession with sex and  death in the art and letters of turn-of-the-century Vienna, and, above all, how  all of it influenced Freud as the founder of psychoanalysis.  </P> <P> Even more compelling is "A Secret Asymmetry," in which Bettelheim demonstrates  his genius for turning a book review into a fascinating short course in the  history and politics of psychoanalysis. Here, Bettelheim uses the publication  of the letters of Dr. Sabina Spielrein, an early patient of Jung and later a  practitioner of psychoanalysis, to reveal some of the shocking details of the  love affair between Jung and Spielrein, to explore the rivalries between Freud  and Jung, and to pay homage to "one of the great women pioneers of  psychoanalysis."  </P> <P> The second section of "Freud's Vienna" is ostensibly devoted to the fundamental  theme of Bettelheim's research, writing and practice: "On Children and Myself."  Bettelheim includes his thoughts on "The Child's Perception of the City,"  "Children and Museums" and "Children and Television," as well as an essay on  the similarities between the techniques used by Annie Sullivan in teaching  Helen Keller and Bettelheim's own "milieu" therapy for severely disturbed  children.  </P> <P> But the miscellaneous essays also collected here range from a discussion of the  "essential books" of Bettelheim's life (Freud, of course, as well as the works  of Jacob Burckhardt, Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem and Goethe) to a  call-to-arms addressed to the makers of motion pictures: "Let us hope that the  art of the moving image, this most authentic American art, will soon meet the  challenge of becoming truly the great art of our age" by "giving us myths  suitable to live by in our time, visions that transmit to us the highest and  best feelings to which men have risen."  </P> <P> The final section of "Freud's Vienna" is the most honest and touching -- and,  for me, the most troubling and painful. In these final essays, Bettelheim  offers a moral and historical perspective of the Holocaust that may be  charitably described as deeply challenging.  </P> <P> Bettelheim praises the righteous few who acted courageously in the face of  death, including Janusz Korczak, the director of a Warsaw orphanage who turned  down the opportunity to save himself and instead accompanied the young children  in his care to the gas chambers at Treblinka, and Miep Giese, the Dutchman who  helped to shelter the family of Anne Frank. And he contemplates the special  horrors of the "Children of the Holocaust."  </P> <P> "The terrible silence of children who are forced to endure the unendurable!"  Bettelheim writes in an uncharacteristic cry of despair. "Their agony is mute:  with all the strength available to them they need to bury in the depths of  their souls a wound, an anguish which never leaves them, a sorrow so cruel that  it defies all expression."  </P> <P> Bettelheim's compassion, remarkably enough, extends not only to the German  people, but even the tormentors of little children: "The conclusion became  inescapable that every German had in some way or other been an inmate of that  wider concentration camp which was the Third Reich," Bettelheim writes of his  return to Dachau after the war. "Every German who had lived under the Nazi  regime, whether he accepted it or fought it, had been through a concentration  camp in a sense. Some, the actual camp inmates, had gone through it as tortured  slaves; others, the majority of Germans, had gone through it as trustees, so to  speak."  </P> <P> Some minds and hearts may recoil at such expressions of compassion, especially  when we consider that Bettelheim has some sharp and even shocking words for the  Jewish victims of the Holocaust, whom he also sees as victims of "ghetto  thinking." But the fact is that Bettelheim, although guarded about the most  intimate details of his own life, is honest and plain-spoken when it comes to  revealing what he has learned and what he believes. For that reason, "Freud's  Vienna" is an accurate, useful and even inspiring gloss on the life's work of a  man of conscience.  </P></p>

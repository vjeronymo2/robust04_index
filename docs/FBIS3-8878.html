			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EVENIMENTUL ZILEI Director Ion Cristoiu by </F> Laurentiu Badicioiu; place and date not given: "Cotroceni's New  Stupidity"]    [Text] [Badicioiu] Ion Cristoiu, the daily EVENIMENTUL  ZILEI is under criminal investigation for violating the law on  state security. How do you view this new conflict between the  president and your newspaper?    [Cristoiu] Even if the decision belongs to the General  Prosecuting Magistracy, I believe this is a new stupidity of the  Cotroceni [Romanian Presidency], namely using this pretext to  start a new campaign against the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. Let us not  forget that there are most tense relations between our newspaper  and the president. We have been under criminal investigation  for quite some time following a personal request of the  president and we were penalized, meaning that our journalists  can no longer attend news conferences held at Cotroceni Palace,  as if it were President Iliescu's personal property. Maybe this  is a new pretext used to start a campaign against our newspaper.  If a newspaper such as EVENIMENTUL ZILEI can intercept a  telephone call from Cotroceni Palace, this means that any dumb  spy can listen to what is being discussed at Cotroceni and find  out even more about the head of the state! President Iliescu is  taking his revenge on the person who drew his attention to this  fact. This act of ours also has the purpose to drawing the  attention of the public to the chaos currently prevailing in  Romania.    [Badicioiu] Mr. Cristoiu, it has been indicated that there  is a person at Cotroceni Palace who supplies information to the  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI and, now, there are attempts to eliminate this  person...    [Cristoiu] There is no such a person. Nobody is supplying  us any secret information because, as a matter of fact, such a  person would be useless, considering that the decisions taken by  President Iliescu are taken by him alone, so we should have a  person hiding inside the president's head, a sort of small  devil, who could tell us what goes on in the president's head.  We get our information through our specific means. Mrs.  Nicolaescu, who was answering the phone, had a behavior that is  unqualifiable for a person who is the chief of the cabinet of  the head of state, meaning that she allows herself to make  idiotic comments. Thus, instead her being removed from office,  this criminal investigation was started against us!    [Badicioiu] How do you view this formulation in the law on  state security?    [Cristoiu] Only now, we are beginning to realize that when  the law is implemented, there are all kind of loopholes in it  that allow evasion of the law. The same holds true for this law  on state security. We are accused of disseminating information  of a secret nature. I believe that this is the most aberrant  affirmation possible, because when a newspaper can disseminate  information of a secret nature, it means that the respective  information has not been protected. Therefore, the first  measure to be taken would be to protect such information.  Instead of those who fail to protect such information being  punished, those who publish them are attacked. Certainly, I  agree that a high Army official should be punished if he  supplies secret information to somebody. However, if the press  got hold of this piece of information, I fail to see why it has  to be punished rather than those who were entrusted to keep the  respective information secret!    [Badicioiu] Do you believe that the messages published in  your paper damaged the image of the president?    [Cristoiu] No, I do not think so. I believe that things are  much simpler than that. Considering that I am aware of the  state of affairs at Cotroceni, I understand how things work  there. For the president, that was the greatest eulogy on his  birthday because we were the only paper that published something  positive. None of the pro-presidential newspapers bothered to  report on the president's birthday. I believe that if I had  worked with the DIMINEATA [presidential paper] I would have been  given an award because I, using my own means, published a whole  page -- just imagine! -- full of positive messages. I believe  that Mrs. Nicolaescu made a big fuss and, just like Desdemona,  complained to the president, and he, being a sensitive person  when it comes to female company around him, got very angry.  Probably, if we had not reported what the lady was chattering  about, nothing would have happened. I believe that, from the  president's viewpoint, it was some of the most successful  reading for Ion Iliescu. Now, President Iliescu has to prove  that he has a feeling for drama because, when a newspaper in  Romania can intercept what is being discussed at Cotroceni, it  means that the system of national defense is in the worst  possible shape. Considering that humor often mixes with the  tragic side of things, the president should close the entire  affair and start taking internal protection measures. In any  event, we have done an immense service to the president, because  we drew his attention to the fact that, in spite of all the  money that the electorate gives him to ensure his protection,  talks in the Cotroceni Palace can be intercepted any time by  anybody who wishes to do so.</p>

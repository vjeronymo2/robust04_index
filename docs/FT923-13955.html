			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Davy holders likely to lose Pounds 54m payment DAVY Corporation shareholders yesterday lost any hope of receiving the remaining Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, due under the successful takeover of the company by Trafalgar House, the engineering and construction group. Midland and Scottish Resources, reporting a Pounds 46.4m pre-tax loss for 1991, said it was unlikely to fulfil conditions set by Trafalgar enabling Davy shareholders to be paid the money due to them. Trafalgar made payment to Davy shareholders conditional on MSR, the oil production company, completing the purchase from Davy of the Emerald Producer offshore rig. But Mr Jon Hawksley, MSR managing director, said it was now 'very difficult' to see how his company could obtain a Section 10 ship certificate from the Department of Trade necessary to complete permanent finance of the rig. 'We could only achieve this if oil production from the rig was in excess of our estimates' he added. Nor is MSR likely to be able to draw upon the Pounds 118m letter of credit with the project's bankers. Instead Trafalgar will lease the Emerald to MSR for Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 34,200) a day. Trafalgar said the annual Pounds 12.3m leasing fee would barely cover its interest costs on the assets and the depreciation of the rig. MSR has been offered an option to buy the rig from Trafalgar but after reporting the loss, which compared to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.8m, it is unlikely to exercise the option. The loss was struck after a Pounds 37.5m exceptional charge relating to the delay in completing the rig. The project has taken three years instead of the anticipated 20 months. Therefore MSR was not able to receive revenue from production this year while paying its 100 strong project management team working on the rig. Mr Hawksley said initial oil production was now imminent. Losses per share of 22p compared to earnings of 5p. Turnover rose from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 5.9m. The cost of sales increased from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 10.3m.</p>

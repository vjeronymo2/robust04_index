			<p>BFN     [Text] For the third time in the last three years, the U.S.  Government has acknowledged Cuba's serious efforts and  efficiency in the antidrug-trafficking struggle in or near the  island's territorial waters and airspace. This means that the  truth about Cuba is prevailing.    In an article published on 7 April, GRANMA journalists Leon  Nicanor Cotayo mentions the specific dates of the U.S. State  Department reports on this issue: 7 March 1991, 12 April 1993,  and 4 April 1994. It is interesting how in the last report, the  U.S. Government notes that Cuba's efforts against drug  trafficking have not been more extensive because of the effects  of the more than 30-year-old U.S. blockade. In this regard, the  document states that the shortage of fuel and essential spare  parts somewhat limits the Cuban Government's capabilities to  intercept drug traffickers.    Leon Cotayo adds that Miami's far right and other  conservative sectors in the United States frequently unleash  smear campaigns, tying Cuba to drug trafficking. This is the  third communique issued by the U.S. State Department, which once  again putting objectivity before any propagandistic defamation,  seems to add an element of significant value to anyone pondering  the seriousness of Cuba's arguments when it comes to explaining  its actions, or when it comes to repudiating those who around  the clock, try to distort Cuba's reality.</p>

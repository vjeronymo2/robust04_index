			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Mayuchiy video report; from the "Utro" program's </F> "Mir" feature]    [Text] Good morning, friends! Our greeting comes to you  from Belarus. To be more precise, it is from that unique place  where the borders of the three sovereign states, Russia,  Belarus, and Ukraine, converge.    A meeting of the leaders of the Russian, Ukrainian, and  Belarusian Agrarian Parties took place this spring here at the  Friendship Monument. Worldly wisdom tells us that peasants  should be growing grain and not be engaged in politics.  However, the reality of our life proves otherwise.    A number of documents that will coordinate the parties'  activities were signed at this meeting and the opinion of those  gathered here was that this political act today could become the  beginning of the movement toward the re-creation of the union of  the three Slavic states, and possibly, a single state.    [Begin recording] [Biryukov] These are not political  ambitions. Even with the most cursory of analyses, we can see  the worsening situation and the decline in the standard of  living of the peasants, and the population of Russia in general.  Probably the same situation exists in Belarus and Ukraine, and  it shows that the basic reason for it is this artificial, forced  breakdown of the former great state.    [Sharetskiy] The peasants are the most landed sector of the  population and that is why we, before anyone else, sensed that  the purely human need to produce, to recreate that which we had  and lost.    [Dovgal] I think that the Belarus and Ukraine state systems  will regenerate and strengthen if we work in a unified space  like this. [end recording]    The peasant politicians' pronouncements, like the documents  they signed, so far are nothing more that a beautiful gesture,  the same as the sowing of seed that took place at the monument  near the border of the three sovereign states. Belarus' and  Ukraine's mutual relations with the third brother, Russia, will  most probably depend to a great degree on the results of the  presidential elections. Namely, the Belarusian and Ukrainian  Republics' future political and economic directions will be  determined after the elections.</p>

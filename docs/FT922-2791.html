			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Arts: Samson et Dalila - Opera The revival of Saint-Saens' opera at Covent Garden on Saturday was the 143rd Midland Bank Prom, with 700 eager fans sitting on the floor of the stalls. Outside in the piazza, there was a still larger crowd watching it on the giant screen (courtesy of the Royal Opera House Trust, the Covent Garden Friends, the City of Westminster and Premium Cinzano). With such overflowing generosity and enthusiasm, all that was needed was good weather and a really good performance: both of which we got. This time round, Elijah Moshinsky's 1981 production has been rehearsed to excellent purpose by Jeremy Sutcliffe. Sidney Nolan's designs, which lend an Aboriginal tang to the Near East, still look fine. So does Placido Domingo, the original Samson of the production, though his elegant distress while pushing the millstone around suggests a fastidious Duke in exile rather than a legendary strong-man. (Jon Vickers' bull-like frame was always an unbeatable advantage there.) By Domingo's own lofty standards he was only in second-best voice - incisive and eloquent at the millstone in despair, slightly out of puff when the time came to pull down the temple. There were of course all his usual marks of thoughtful integrity; and with his new Dalila, he conducted himself with perfect gallantry. For young Olga Borodina is a new star of the first magnitude, as the entire house soon recognised; and far from attempting to pull operatic rank, Domingo played to her as to an equal. The seduction-scene at the heart of Act 2 was for once a seriously erotic affair, not an operatic contest. Miss Borodina is tall and beautiful, and her warm mezzo is a lovely instrument: ample, not huge, but never forced. Where many another Dalila vamps strenuously, she sang limpid phrases, the more penetrating because they were so effortlessly balanced. Her French is secure (rare among Russian artists nowadays), if not exactly native; and she inhabits her billowing costumes with languorous grace. The combination of gentle facade with unbending inner purpose is extraordinarily potent. In plain, familiar French, what Saint-Saens' opera is about is a discarded mistress (Dalila, a Philistine) who turns nasty, and the off-and-on strongman (Samson, a Hebrew) who swings helplessly between wanting her and wanting to follow his God-given instructions to annihilate her tribe. Beyond the text, however, there are ambiguities of feeling which would normally seem beyond Saint-Saens' tidy artistic range. Borodina's performance was positively radioactive with them, and to the end they remained fascinatingly unresolved. The rest of the cast are mostly old regulars: Jonathan Summers' stylised brute of a High Priest, Roderick Earle's sneering Abimelech, Mark Beesley's staunch Ancient Hebrew. The dancers again fling themselves into David Bintley's Bacchanale with a will. That still turns the final scene into a flashy charade - which is no more than this curiously jerry-built opera deserves; but I want to enter another plea for some British opera company to get Steven Pimlott to re-stage Samson. His memorable Bregenz Festival version, with its echoes of the Holocaust, lent the piece unprecedented force and depth. For the first time here Mark Ermler conducts the opera, and he finds consistent musical dignity in a score that contains not a few passages of ricky-tick and fustian and academic note-spinning. That is a creditable achievement, and an important strength of this performance. On the last night, by the way, Domingo's place will be taken by Vladimir Popov.</p>

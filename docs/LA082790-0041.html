			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YACHTING;  </P> <P> GRAND ILLUSION WINS IN A BREEZE  </P> <P> Ed McDowell's patched-up Grand Illusion trailed Mitch Rouse's Taxi Dancer  around the course without a need to win the heat during Cabrillo Beach Yacht  Club's Summer Sled Regatta for ultralight 70s at San Pedro Sunday. Taxi Dancer  had lost a chance at the overall title Saturday when she was disqualified for  colliding with Grand Illusion in the second race, so it didn't matter that  Rouse won Sunday by 2 minutes 25 seconds.  </P> <P> Rouse could easily have absolved the foul in Saturday's race -- in which he was  second -- by performing a 720-degree penalty, two full circles. Even with the  penalty, he would have placed high enough for the overall win.  </P> <P> Sunday's race was sailed in winds to 17 knots on a 23-mile course to Pt. Fermin  and around the outer harbor. After overnight repairs to her hull, Grand  Illusion, with Billy Peterson at the helm, had only to beat Bob McNulty's  Chance and Peter Tong's Blondie. RICH ROBERTS  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Malaysia extends time for telecoms contracts MALAYSIA has granted a six-month extension to three foreign-led telecommunications groups to comply with the terms of a MDollars 2bn (Pounds 470m) telecommunications contract awarded earlier this year. The three groups, led by Fujitsu of Japan, Nokia of Finland and Alcatel/CIT of France, have been granted the extension to ensure their equipment is fully compatible with each other's systems and with existing ones installed in Malaysia by NEC of Japan and Ericsson of Sweden. In March, Malaysia's finance ministry signed letters of intent with all five companies to install 4m digital-exchange lines over the next five years. Each of the companies, with their local partners, would be responsible for installing an equal number of lines. Critics said too many companies were involved and problems of equipment compatibility would arise. But NEC and Ericsson, which have been supplying digital-exchange lines in Malaysia for some years, have already signed firm contracts. It is understood the other three groups have been assured they too will be given contracts, if they meet the compatibility specifications.</p>

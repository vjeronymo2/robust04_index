			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Joint statement" issued by political parties and public </F> organizations in Pyongyang on 3 March]    [Text] In connection with the fact that the random dumping  of nuclear waste materials into the sea has recently been  disclosed in South Korea, DPRK political parties and public  organizations released the following joint statement:    Joint statement of DPRK political parties and public  organizations:    The random dumping of nuclear waste materials into the sea  has recently been disclosed in South Korea. This greatly angers  the nation.    Data show nuclear power stations in South Korea dumped into  the sea 142 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste materials  in 1991 and 155 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste  materials in 1992.    The South Korean puppets dumped 11,000 trillion becquerels,  or approximately 100,000 curie, into the sea in the seven years  from 1986 to 1992. This is an unimaginable, grave crime that  artificially destroys the ecosystem and inflicts miserable  nuclear damage on the South Korean people, in addition to fellow  countrymen and mankind in general.    Generally speaking, radiation amounting to approximately 1.7  curie has damaged the ecosystem. It is not difficult to imagine  the horrific, devastating consequences the massive nuclear waste  materials, amounting to 100,000 curie that the South Korean  puppets dumped into the sea, will bring to the ecosystem and the  frightening catastrophes it will inflict on the South Korean  people, in addition to fellow countrymen and mankind in general.    As is well known, if nuclear waste materials are dumped into  the sea, they will contaminate or kill fish, shells, laver,  brown seaweed, and other maritime resources and, thus, inflict  fatal damage on the existence of the maritime ecosystem and  people. Therefore, the London Convention bans the maritime  dumping of high-intensity [kojunwi] nuclear waste materials. It  also stipulates that dumping of low-intensity [chojunwi] nuclear  waste materials in maritime areas must be over 200 miles away  from continental shores [taeryuk yonan], where fish live, and  over 4,000 km deep, where there are no volcanic activities and  where man will not enter even in the distant future. It also  stipulates that dumping in those areas is prohibited without  notifying the International Atomic Energy Agency. A decision  was adopted in 1993 on completely banning maritime dumping of  nuclear waste materials.    The South Korean puppets' random dumping of nuclear waste  materials into the sea is an unforgivable grave crime of  flagrantly violating international law on respecting the natural  environment and protecting maritime resources. Because of the  uncouth ruling bunch, which ignores the law and destroys the  environment at random, the South Korean sea is turning into a  sea of death where all maritime resources are on the verge of  extinction and the ecosystem and the people's existence are  gravely threatened.    Because of the puppet clique's reckless dumping of nuclear  waste materials in the South Korean sea, many sorts of fish have  disappeared, fish are killed en masse, and seaweeds are dying.  Moreover, in South Korea, women who ate fish contaminated by  nuclear waste materials have given birth to premature or  deformed babies, numerous people suffer from cancer and other  incurable diseases and unidentified diseases, and fishermen's  lives have become difficult because people will not buy  contaminated fish.    This is none other than a crime of devastating the land  where our fellow countrymen live and threatening the existence  of our fellow countrymen.    Our country is called a 3,000-ri land of beautiful mountains  and rivers because water is clear and because the scenery is  beautiful, and it is all the better to live in because the land  is fertile and because maritime resources are abundant for the  land is surrounded by the sea on three sides. How can Korean  [Choson] people who have a national spirit tolerate this utterly  unforgivable crime of turning such land into a land contaminated  by nuclear waste materials where man cannot live and how can  people of the world who have conscience turn a blind eye to  [panggwan] this crime?    The Workers' Party of Korea and all other political parties  and public organizations on the northern half of the Republic  sternly denounce the Kim Yong-sam ring's dumping of nuclear  waste materials in the name of all fellow countrymen, describing  such dumping as an antinational crime of severing the lifeline  of the South Korean people and all fellow countrymen in general  and of turning our country into a barren land [pulmojidae]  contaminated by nuclear materials and as a flagrant violation of  the international law and convention on protecting the natural  environment and banning the dumping of radioactive waste  materials.    The South Korean puppets' dumping of nuclear waste materials  is unthinkable apart from the secret maneuvers to develop  nuclear weapons in South Korea. The South Korean puppets'  maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons which started in the early  seventies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella have reached a very  grave stage today.    The puppets raise our nonexistent nuclear issue and  viciously  conduct an anti-Republic smear campaign. One of the reasons for  this is to divert attention at home and abroad to the North and  accelerate their maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons. Traitor  [yokto] Kim Yong-sam himself told a news conference on the first  anniversary of his inauguration a few days ago that the North  has no nuclear weapons. In this way, he himself admitted that  their anti-North nuclear commotions were a false smear campaign  to harm their fellow countrymen and hide the truth of their  nuclear development.    Even while pursuing nuclear development, the Kim Yong-sam  ring babbles about even military countermeasures [kunsajok  taeung] against someone else. Because it is so mean and  shameless, the Kim Yong-sam ring unhesitatingly dumps nuclear  waste materials, an antinational act against humanity [pan illyu  chogin].    Even after running amok in toadyism, treachery, fascism,  anti-North confrontation, and divisionist maneuvers, traitor Kim  Yong-sam even kicks up maneuvers to dump nuclear waste  materials. If traitor Kim Yong-sam is left intact, no one can  expect independence and democracy in South Korean society or  peace in the country and its peaceful reunification, and our  fellow countrymen will not be able to escape from the danger of  nuclear disasters [haekchenan].    The South Korean ruling bunch must immediately disclose its  past dumping of nuclear waste materials and apologize to all  fellow countrymen. If the South Korean authorities continue  dumping nuclear waste materials and secretly pursue nuclear  development, they will not be able to escape from the stern  judgment of all fellow countrymen and history.    It is the South Korean people who will suffer the greatest  damage from the nuclear waste materials that have flowed into  the South Korean sea and who will be sacrificed first. The  South Korean people must wage a popular struggle against the  puppet ruling bunch's dumping of nuclear waste materials and  develop this struggle into an anti-U.S. and antigovernment  struggle by closely linking it to the antiwar and antinuclear  struggle.    The South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to dump nuclear  waste materials are a crime against humanity [panillyujogin  pomjoe haengwi], which harms not only our fellow countrymen but  also countries in our vicinity and various regions in Asia and  the world. On this opportunity, we expect that political parties  and organizations of various countries of the world,  international organizations, and people of all countries that  love peace and aspire for social justice and progress will pay  due attention to the South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to  dump nuclear waste materials, raise their voices against such  maneuvers, and take appropriate measures to stop them.    [Issued] 3 March 1994, Pyongyang</p>

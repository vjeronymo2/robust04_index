			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN AIR ACT REVISIONS PASSED BY SENATE, 89-11;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE COMPROMISE MEASURE BREAKS A 10-YEAR IMPASSE AND WOULD IMPOSE  TOUGH NEW CONTROLS.  </P> <P> The Senate, bridging a decade-old division between economic and environmental  interests, approved Tuesday a sweeping revision of the Clean Air Act that would  impose tough new pollution controls to make the air in all U.S. cities fit to  breathe by the year 2010.  </P> <P> The far-reaching and intensely controversial bill, the first revision of the  nation's clean air laws since 1977, was adopted by a vote of 89 to 11.  </P> <P> The House is still drafting its own version of the bill, with floor action not  expected until next month. But while some of the fierce battles that almost  derailed the Senate bill are likely to be refought on the House floor,  supporters of the legislation said it was now all but certain that a new Clean  Air Act would be signed into law this year.  </P> <P> Senate passage was considered a major victory for Senate Majority Leader George  J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who fought for years to bring clean air legislation to the  floor and who helped craft a complex compromise proposal with the Bush  Administration last month.  </P> <P> The compromise, however, has been strongly criticized by both environmental and  business interests. Industry lobbyists contend it goes too far in imposing  financial burdens on businesses and environmentalists maintain it does not go  far enough to ensure its avowed aim of protecting public health.  </P> <P> Business lobbyists predicted the bill would cost many billions of dollars more  to implement than the Administration has estimated and said it could result in  severe economic upheavals and the loss of at least 200,000 jobs in the  industries hardest hit by the new regulations.  </P> <P> Environmentalists said the concessions made to win White House support for the  bill had left it riddled with loopholes. "This is no longer a bill that will  achieve its aim of protecting public health or cleaning up the nation's air,"  said Richard Ayres, director of the National Resources Defense Council, an  environmental lobbying coalition.  </P> <P> California environmental officials said they were disappointed because the  changes negotiated by the White House left them without strong federal backup  for the much tougher clean air regulations either already in effect or being  planned for the state.  </P> <P> "The bill does not preclude us from carrying out our own plans, but to the  extent that it could have extended those goals to the rest of the country, it  would have made it much easier for us," said Bill Sessa, an official with the  California Air Resources Board.  </P> <P> Defending the compromise, Mitchell said the Senate faced only two choices:  "This clean air bill or no clean air bill." This bill, he added, "dramatically  expands and strengthens" existing law in "the most cost efficient manner  possible."  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One before the Senate vote, Bush said  that in the clean air effort, "We are not going to go to either extreme: the  extreme of throwing people out of work and shutting down America and stopping  all economic growth, or the extreme of doing nothing about the terribly  pressing environmental questions."  </P> <P> Bush spoke during a flight from Indiana to Michigan, during a day of political  speeches at fund-raising events in Indianapolis and Dearborn, Mich.  </P> <P> Considered perhaps the most important and complicated legislation that Congress  is likely to pass this year, the omnibus bill tightens a number of controls on  the major sources of smog, acid rain and toxic air pollution in order to force  the nation's 100 most polluted areas into compliance with federal air quality  standards over the next 15 years.  </P> <P> The one exception would be Los Angeles, the nation's smoggiest city, which  would be given 20 years, until 2010, to achieve attainment.  </P> <P> Rivaling the tax code in its complexity and scope, the bill takes a two-track  approach to lowering levels of ozone, a major component of urban smog, by  controlling emissions from both stationary and mobile sources of pollution.  </P> <P> It mandates use of reformulated and cleaner-burning gasoline mixtures for cars  in Los Angeles and eight other urban areas with the nation's worst smog levels,  and it expands the regulation of toxic chemicals, many of them carcinogenic,  from the seven covered under current law to more than 190.  </P> <P> To curb acid rain, the focus of the bill's strongest provisions, giant  utilities in the Midwest would be required to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by  10 million tons, with a cap at 1980 levels, after the year 2000. The production  and use of chlorofluorocarbons, the main class of chemicals responsible for the  erosion of Earth's protective ozone layer, would also be phased out by the  Senate bill.  </P> <P> To achieve these reductions, the bill imposes restrictions that would affect  virtually every major industry and touch the lives -- and the pocketbooks -- of  American consumers in myriad ways, from raising the price of the cars they  drive to determining what ingredients go into the hair sprays and deodorants  they buy.  </P> <P> It will also cost a lot -- anywhere from $21.5 billion per year by the Bush  Administration's estimate to more than twice that amount if the industry  lobby's figures are accurate.  </P> <P> But cost is only one aspect of a controversy that, trapped by competing  political, regional and economic interests, has stalled passage of clean air  legislation in Congress at the committee level for the past 10 years.  </P> <P> The gridlock was finally broken at the end of 1988, when Mitchell, an ardent  environmentalist, became majority leader and George Bush, newly elected as  President, radically departed from Ronald Reagan Administration policies by  calling for passage of tougher clean air laws.  </P> <P> A much stronger version of the bill drafted by the Senate Environment and  Public Works Committee subsequently won the endorsement of environmentalists  and public health groups but was strongly opposed by the White House as too  expensive.  </P> <P> Calculating that he did not have enough votes to defeat a filibuster or  override a threatened White House veto, Mitchell agreed to closed-door  negotiations with the Administration that finally produced the clean air  compromise last month.  </P> <P> Staff Writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SENATE VERSION OF CLEAN AIR BILL  </P> <P>  The clean air bill passed by the Senate is substantially tougher than current  law, but still weaker in many respects than regulations already in effect, or  proposed for, California. Here is a comparison:  </P> <P> AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS -- Current law: Restricts tailpipe emissions of  hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx), major components of smog, to .41 grams  per mile (gpm) for hydrocarbons, 1.0 gpm for NOx, and carbon monoxide to 3.4  gpm.  </P> <P> California law: Restricts hydrocarbon emissions to .25 grams per mile, carbon  monoxide to 3.4 grams per mile for the first 50,000 miles, phased in over a  three-year period. Currently limits NOx emissions to 0.4 grams per mile.  Another proposal not yet law but expected to be adopted would cut hydrocarbon  emissions by an additional 50% beginning in 1997.  </P> <P> Senate bill: Same emission reductions as California mandates for 1993, but  another round of 50% emission cuts would go into effect in 2004 if 12 or more  "seriously" polluted cities outside California remain above federally mandated  ozone limits in 2001.  </P> <P> ALTERNATIVE FUELS -- Current law: No provision for alternative fuels in current  law.  </P> <P> California law: No current provisions. Regulations being developed would  require cleaner gasoline for all cars by 1993 and the phase in of even cleaner  alternative fuels beginning in 1994. Alternative fuels would be twice as clean  as the cleanest gasoline then in use.  </P> <P> Senate bill: Requires that new cars in the nation's nine smoggiest cities run  on a cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline mixture by 1994. Even cleaner fuel  standards would be phased in for fleet vechicles in serious smog areas starting  in 1995.  </P> <P> ACID RAIN -- Current law: No provisions for acid rain control currently in  effect.  </P> <P> California law: No provisions related specifically to acid rain, but state  places limits on both NOx and sulfur dioxide emissions.  </P> <P> Senate bill: Requires 107 polluting utilities in the Midwest and Southeast to  cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons in the year 2000, when emission  levels would be capped at 1980 levels. Utilities also would cut NOx emissions  by 4 million tons by 2005. Allowance system would let utilities reducing  emissions below the required levels sell "pollution credits" to others.  </P> <P> AIR TOXICS -- Current law: Imposes controls on the emissions of seven chemicals  classified as toxic. Enforcement has been lax.  </P> <P> California law: State regulates same seven chemicals classified as toxic by  federal law. The state also regulates two additional toxics not regulated by  the federal government -- benzene and chromium. State developing regulations  for another seven, and studying 10 others for possible regulation.  </P></p>

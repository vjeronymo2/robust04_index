			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest upgraded Growing confidence that the economy is reviving prompted one investment bank to raise its already high forecasts for National Westminster Bank. The move sent the shares up 9 at best before they were brought back with the market. They closed 6 better at 461p on turnover of 4.9m, heavy relative to yesterday's general trading levels. Morgan Stanley, the US bank, raised its 1993 profits estimate by Pounds 45m to Pounds 915m and re-emphasised its bullish stance. Banking analyst Mr Nick Collier said: 'We had already forecast quite heavy provisions and, with the growing sense of economic recovery and the number of new problems slowing down, we feel the debt is going to be slightly better than anticipated.' The improved optimism spilled over into Barclays, which is more burdened with heavy high profile debts but also poised to benefit from economic upturn, especially in the hard hit property area. Barclays appreciated 6 to 414p.</p>

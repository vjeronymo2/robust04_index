			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Let's Be Realistic Toward Oil Revenues"] </F>   [Text] Last week President Hashemi-Rafsanjani presented the  Second 5-Year Economic, Social, and Cultural Development Plan  along with the 1373 (1994-1995) Budget Bill to Majles (Islamic  Consultative Assembly).    In view of the discussions made by the cabinet members and  Majles representatives, the Second 5-Year Plan might not start  from the next Iranian calendar year and might be postponed to  1374 (1995- 1996).    An official announcement has not yet been released in this  regard.    Thus the year 1373 will be of momentum, making the sound and  meticulous survey of the budget and adoption of favorable  policies decisive for the country.    The country's overall budget in 1373 will amount to Rls.  [rials] 79686.7 billion, showing marked increase as compared to  the previous year.    Revenues stand out prominently in next year's budget: Of the  entire revenues of next year's budget--that is Rls. 33,592  billion, some Rls. 22,026 billion (amounting to 65 percent) are  earned through oil incomes.    Apparently, this is largely wishful thinking in view of the  slope in the oil prices over the past year and the possibility  of continued oil price drops.    By far, if the year 1373 opens up with such a speculation,  the country's economy will face manifold bottle-necks. To put  it better, the officials in charge of the country's economy and  industry try to boost the oil prices in the global markets.    Meanwhile, these officials should have a sound and realistic  estimation of the oil prices so as to prepare themselves for  hard times, to pocket more revenues through non-oil exports, and  to base the next year's budget on less dependence on oil incomes.    The year 1373 is a milestone since important plans such as  the first phase of Martyr Rajai's Thermal Power Plant, Sarkhun's  Gas Refinery, the second phase of Arak's Petrochemical Plant,  the Petrochemical Plant of Imam Khomeyni's Port, and ... will  come to fruition. As such, the incomes, expenditures, economic  policies should be more realistic.    Hopefully, the Majles representatives and the cabinet  members  will approve of the 1373 budget bill after thoroughly and  precisely discussing and surveying it, so that next year will  see the materialization of the country's economic, social, and  cultural objectives.</p>

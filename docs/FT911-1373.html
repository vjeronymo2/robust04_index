			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / ILO seeks end to ban on unions at GCHQ THE International Labour Organisation, the United Nations agency, has called for talks between the government and unions as a way of ending the block on union membership at the GCHQ communications centre in Cheltenham. An ILO committee of experts has renewed its criticism of several aspects of British labour law in spite of hearing a defence of legislation from the government. Britain may be asked to explain further at the annual ILO conference next month. Although the government could ignore the ruling by the committee of experts, it is a signatory to the ILO and the criticism of several pieces of employment legislation since since 1979 is potentially awkward. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that it was 'shameful that a country and a government that places so much store on the authority of the UN and the value of world opinion' should be criticised in this way. Mr Willis said the government should follow the advice of the committee of experts and 'bring this country in line with civilised standards without delay'. The ban on independent unions at GCHQ has existed since 1984. The ruling by the committee of experts criticises the provisions of the 1988 Employment Act under which unions are prevented from disciplining members who refuse to take part in industrial action called after a ballot. The committee says that interferes with the right of unions to set their own constitutions. It says unions should be free to impose sanctions on members who will not comply with democratic decisions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wing Kay Po] </F>   [Text] The Liberal Party is confident it will secure  enough votes in the Legislative Council to thwart the Governor's  political reform proposals. Their confidence stems from a visit  to Beijing by a party member, James Tien, who says he received  encouragement from China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen.    Tien, who returned from Beijing yesterday, said Qian had  indicated "support in principle" for the amendments proposed by  the Liberal Party and some independent members, known as the  1994 package. China's backing should deliver a crucial five  votes in favour of the Liberals' amendments to Chris Patten's  plan when the issue is decided an Wednesday.    Meanwhile, Patten has been stepping up his campaign for  support. Yesterday he hosted a breakfast for 10 non-aligned  legislators -- members of the so-called Breakfast Club. The  meeting provided his last opportunity for lobbying the group.  The Chief Secretary, Anson Chan, and the Secretary for  Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng, were also present.    The 10 legislators invited were Simon Ip, Eric Li, Martin  Barrow, Vincent Cheng, Marvin Cheung, Timothy Ha, Roger Luk,  Samuel Wong, Hui Yin-fat, and Andrew Wong. Apart from Hui, who  has pledged support for the Patten proposals, and Wong who has  said he would oppose all amendments except his own, the other  eight legislators are thought to support the 1994 package.    An independent legislator, Emily Lau, is also rallying  support for her private member's bill for full direct elections  but is likely to support Patten. It is understood that apart  from the 13 United Democrats, Hui, Pang Chun hoi, Christine Loh,  and Wu have also pledged support for Lau's bill.    Qian told Tien to "do your best in Hong Kong" when he was  asked by Tien to persuade the pro-China legislators to vote for  the amendments. The votes of five pro-Beijing legislators are  crucial in deciding the fate of the Liberal package as there is  now an almost equal split in the council between support for the  amendments package and the Patten proposals.    The five are Tam Yiuchung, Philip Wong, David Li, Peggy Lam,  and Tang Siutong.</p>

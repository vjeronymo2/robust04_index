			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 26 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Government  has declassified a significant proportion of Council of  Ministers' documents dating from the years 1944 to 1960. Among  these are documents filed under the names of the state leaders  of that period. The overwhelming majority of documents are from  leaders of the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, and the  organizational units working under the Secretariat, government  spokeswoman Judit Juhasz announced at her customary Thursday [26  May] press briefing.    She added that several documents still contain information  which remains protected for foreign policy or national security  reasons, or because their publication would violate personal  rights. The secrecy of these documents will continue to be  upheld, on the proposal of the committee that reviewed the  "secret" classification of the documents.    In addition, the cabinet decided on Thursday to place an  addendum on the document on Peace Partnership which clarifies  that the State Office for Technical Development is in charge of  scientific affairs among the organizations designated for  cooperation.</p>

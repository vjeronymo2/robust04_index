			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu told Radio Carve that  Uruguay favors including Chile in Mercosur [Common Market of the  South]. The minister participated in the meeting  Mercosur-member country representatives held a few hours ago  with the Chilean foreign minister. Abreu is participating in  the OAS meeting being held in Belem, Brazil.    [Begin recording] [Abreu] Well, the meeting that was  proposed  by the Chilean foreign minister presupposes the political  intention of strengthening trade ties and relations with  Mercosur.    This is contemplated in the Treaty of Asuncion, in other  words, that any country can become an associate as long as it  does not belong to a subregional agreement, and this is the case  with Chile.    But Chile's proposal presupposes the beginning of  negotiations at the technical and political levels that can lead  us step by step to an incorporation that will give credibility,  strength, and projection to Mercosur in that the four countries  comply with all its obligations and, of course, are accepted by  the partners that wish to join it afterward.    [Unidentified reporter] The other case is Haiti, which has  caused concern in both the region and the entire world.    [Abreu] Well, within the political sphere we all know about  the international repercussions that the violation of human  rights by the military government has had in Haiti and  especially the actions that go against the compliance with  obligations that have been assumed for the restoring of a  democratic system.    We are discussing this subject and there are proposals from  some of the countries, but Uruguay is maintaining a solid  position regarding the need for restoring democracy, but  fundamentally based on an unrestricted respect for the principle  of nonintervention, which is one of the legal bases of the  inter-American system, and which also happens to be one of  Uruguay's purest traditions in the matter of international law.

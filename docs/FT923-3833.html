			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / People: Luke Rittner moves to Sotheby's Luke Rittner, who two years ago quit as boss of the Arts Council on a matter of principle, has at last found a worthwhile job. He is moving to Sotheby's as its first director of communications. Rittner, 45, appointed by the then Mrs Thatcher to bring a monetarist approach to arts spending, became an enthusiastic advocate of subsidy and objected to moves to make the Council a poodle, with the Arts Minister of the day making all the important decisions. He suffered for his beliefs, and, apart from work as a consultant on the British arts events at Seville's Expo 92, has been under-employed. But Lord Gowrie, an Arts Minister with whom he worked well, is now chairman of Sotheby's Europe and, while he is on the road bringing in new business, he felt the auction house needed a safe pair of hands to deal with clients and governments, as well as the press. By coincidence, Rittner's deputy at the Arts Council, Richard Pulford, who in 1986 quit to become general director of the South Bank Arts Centre, is also moving. He is off to the US for personal reasons. The artistic director Nicholas Snowman takes on Pulford's responsibilities; there had been a feeling that the tandem at the top was no longer necessary but Pulford's departure is generally regretted.</p>

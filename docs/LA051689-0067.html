			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> An Assembly committee Monday defeated a bill by Assemblywoman Lucy Killea  (D-San Diego) that called for an advisory vote of San Diegans on the proposed  merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison.  </P> <P> Killea was able to muster just six votes for the bill in the Assembly Utilities  and Commerce Committee, where seven votes are required for passage. Although  Assemblyman Bill Bradley (R-San Marcos) supports the bill, he missed Monday's  hearing because he is hospitalized in San Diego with a bleeding ulcer.  </P> <P> The committee granted Killea the right to bring the bill up for another vote  when Bradley returns to the Capitol.  </P></p>

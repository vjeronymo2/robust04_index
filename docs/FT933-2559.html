			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: High-powered smelters find the going too hot PECHINEY, Europe's biggest aluminium producer, is working with other producers to gather as much information as possible about unexpected technical problems affecting plant installed at the world's most recently-completed aluminium smelters, all using the French group's leading-edge technology. Nearly 1m tonnes of annual capacity using this AP30 technology came into operation in 1991 and 1992 at three very similar new smelters costing about Dollars 1bn each and at an expanded operation at Alba in Bahrain. Operators say that so-called 'hot spots' have developed in some electrolytic reduction cells (called 'pots' in the industry jargon) and have lead to failure of some pot walls after only 300 days, compared with the expected life of 2,000 days. Operators at the smelters involved say that at present the problem is not a major one and they are convinced that Pechiney will eventually find a solution. Mr Christian Bickert, Pechiney's vice-president-aluminium technology, confirmed that 60 pots at the group's own 250,000-tonnes-a-year smelter at Dunkirk, which started up in November, 1991, had been affected. But he said each one had been repaired and reactivated in 15 days. He said these were 'start-up problems'. Other operators suggested, however, that, until Pechiney came up with a solution, the problem would recur in repaired pots. The two other smelters involved are both in Quebec, Canada, and have an annual capacity of 215,000 each: Lauralco, owned by Amax of the US, and Alouette, operated by VAW of Germany for a consortium which also includes Hoogovens of the Netherlands, Austria Metall and a Japanese joint venture between Kobe Steel and Marubeni. The operators are now swapping information about the problems among themselves and with Pechiney. In aluminium smelting the aim is to push as much electricity through the raw material as possible - the higher the amperage, the more metal can be produced. But this is a tricky business. The magnetic fields created by huge quantities of energy can play havoc and create very dangerous conditions in the smelter if not properly controlled. Pechiney won many technical contracts because it was the first company to operate a pot line functioning at more than 280,000 amperes. At Dunkirk and the other recent smelters, the group brought into operation the first complete sets of pots running on a direct current of 300,000 amperes. This technology makes the smelters the most productive in the world, Pechiney claims. Dunkirk, for example, produces 400 tonnes of aluminium a year for each one of the 550 members of the workforce. The 300,000 amperes technology was a step up from the 280,000 amperes Pechiney was previously offering. About 80 per cent of the smelters built since 1985 use Pechiney's 280,000 amperes technology. An executive at one of the new smelters said: 'Pechiney's 280,000 amperes technology is absolutely perfect and we assumed that the new technology would be the same. Our expectations were too high but, even so, Pechiney's image has been dented a little by all this'. Nevertheless, Alusaf of South Africa, the aluminium producer in the Gencor group, although given the choice by Pechiney of 300,000 or 280,000 amperes technology, is still opting for the former for a new Dollars 2bn, 466.000-tonnes smelter near its existing operations at Richards Bay. Mr Francois Prins, Gencor's senior manager, intelligence and strategy, said the opportunity to lift productivity from the present 80 tonnes per man a year to 400 tonnes was irresistible and, in any case, Pechiney was giving certain guarantees with the technology.</p>

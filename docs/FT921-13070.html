			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / HK politicians hit out at 'cavalier' UK HONG KONG politicians yesterday attacked Britain over the way it is handling the replacement of Sir David Wilson, the colony's governor. In a debate in the Legislative Council about Hong Kong's requirements of a new governor, many members criticised 'the thoughtless and cavalier way' in which the British government announced his retirement, and the failure to name his successor. London announced in December that Sir David would leave some time this year. The debate reflected the life breathed into local politics by the direct elections to some seats last September. Mixed feelings in Hong Kong about the advent of this limited democracy were underlined, however, by speakers to a conference on Hong Kong's future in London yesterday. Mr Stephen Cheong, a member of the Legislative Council, sharply criticised the United Democrats, who won a majority of the directly-elected seats. He said they insisted on interfering in Chinese political affairs and were undermining the Hong Kong government through their opposition to its policies. Mr Cheong said their 'welfarist' approach could dampen the territory's laissez-faire atmosphere. 'Political agitations which threaten to destroy the fabric of our society, no matter how idealistic they sound, can only be detrimental to the long-term interest of the people of Hong Kong,' Mr Cheong said. Another senior member, Mr Allen Lee, was also unwilling to upset Beijing when asked about speeding up the democratic process. Although he noted that Hong Kong had originally sought a faster pace than was agreed between Britain and China, and that Britain planned to raise the issue again, he said there was little hope of fighting China on the issue and that confrontation should be avoided.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Markets Report: US trade figures keep dollar under pressure The dollar remained very weak on the currency markets yesterday, with the US August trade figures providing further ammunition for the bears, writes Philip Gawith. Analysts said the report was doubly bad in that the US's trade deficit with Japan had widened, refocusing attention on the US-Japan trade dispute, while robust import growth had aggravated market fears about inflation, undermining US bonds and the dollar. Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y97.15, from Y97.685, after touching a low of Y96.70. It was virtually unchanged at DM1.5009 from DM1.5003. In New York it ended at Y97.325 and DM1.5015. Mr Wayne Angell, chief economist at Bear Stearns, and a former Federal Reserve Board governor, said the dollar's weakness was 'solely' attributable to over-accommodative policy from the Fed. He said interest rates needed to rise by 100 to 150 basis points to reach a neutral policy stance. The D-Mark was generally firmer in Europe. It ended at FFr3.433 against the French franc, from FFr3.431. Sterling finished slightly higher against both the dollar and D-Mark, at Dollars 1.6188 and DM2.4296. The trade weighted index closed at 80.2 from 80. With the German elections out of the way, political volatility in France has come into focus, fuelled by the resignation of the industry minister over corruption allegations, and cabinet squabbles about the conservative candidate in the 1995 presidential election. 'Political issues are still a big factor in the market,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London. Commenting on the franc, he noted: 'It has again been weak against a not overly robust D-Mark.' Other political issues in the market at the moment include the upcoming US congressional elections; and some evidence that political tensions in Russia are causing weakness in the D-Mark. Speculation about the likely abolition of the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners, has recently renewed focus on South African currencies. This - and generalised dollar weakness - has helped the finrand to strengthen. The discount to the commercial rand has shrunk to 11 per cent, a level last seen around the time of the successful reform referendum in February 1992. The finrand breached the psychologically important R4 level to finish at R3.96 against the dollar. The commercial rand ended at R3.5193. Finrand traders in London said activity had been brisk but mostly speculative, with no sign of large institutional orders. But Mr Emin Eyi, head of South Africa sales at Baring Securities in London, said speculators might have opened the door for other investors. He said net foreign purchases of bonds and equities had risen in recent weeks. Referring to the expected merger of the currencies, he said: 'There are not many currencies that have a sure fire rise of 5 to 10 per cent built in.' Mr Eyi predicted that the financial rand would continue to appreciate, but said its abolition could probably only be expected in the first half of 1995, rather than imminently. The country's foreign reserve levels are still too low, and there is little evidence as yet that it is seen as a pressing political priority by the gov-ernment. Following the granting of an investment grade credit rating recently, the government is expected soon to announce its return to international capital markets with a bond issue. The prospectus for the issue is likely to contain more detail about a possible timetable for the abolition of the finrand. The Bank of England provided Pounds 764m assistance to UK money markets, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. Overnight money traded between 5 and 7 per cent. In the gilt repo today, the Bank will provide the market with Pounds 1.28bn assistance, maturing on November 10, at established rates. For the first time since the repo facility was introduced in March, only the shorter maturity date was taken up. There was no demand for the repo maturing on November 24. Analysts said this reflected the fact that market rates were fairly soft, making investors reluctant to lock into a longer dated repo facility when cheaper funding was available. Today's repo will introduce a net injection of about Pounds 500m into the system. This should take some pressure off the size of the daily shortages, which have recently crept up to around Pounds 1bn.</p>

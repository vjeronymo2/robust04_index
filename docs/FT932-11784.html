			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Uni recapitalisation approved UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurer, is to be released from the grip of state-appointed public administrators after the acceptance by authorities of a recapitalisation plan to raise NKr4.3bn (Dollars 649m) for the troubled group. Uni collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn in short-term debt accrued to build a NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia Forsakrings of Sweden. The terms of the deal are similar to those revealed on April 19 but were approved by authorities on the condition that a further NKr300m be raised through a share issue at a later date to help underpin Uni's financial base. The deal, to be concluded in the next few months, is also conditional on the recapitalisation ensuring that Uni meets capital adequacy rules. Uni's creditors are guaranteed full reimbursement of loans outstanding. Norway's Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission (BISC) approved the plan, which calls for NKr2.8bn to be raised through the issue of NKr1.8bn worth of ordinary shares and NKr1bn worth of redeemable preferential shares. In addition, NKr1.5bn will be raised through a bond issue. All three of the issues have been guaranteed by two consortiums of domestic and foreign companies. Sundal Collier &amp; Company and Fondsfinans, two domestic brokerage firms, have been given the mandate to undertake the issues and to ensure further capital is raised at a later date. Because authorities sought to push the deal through as quickly as possible, a decision is pending on whether to spin off the Skandia holding into a wholly-owned daughter company which would purchase the shares from Uni. An estimated NKr1.4bn would be raised by the new company for the Skandia acquisition through a bond issue and subordinated loan, which would qualify as core capital. If this is decided, Uni will be given an option to buy back the Skandia shareholding. Uni's shares are to be written down to a nominal value of NKr10 a share from NKr20.</p>

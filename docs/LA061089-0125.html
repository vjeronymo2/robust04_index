			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Bramalea California Inc. is moving up -- literally. The Costa Mesa home builder  -- already in the news this year for the $250-million acquisition of  Marlborough Homes in Los Angeles -- said it is moving into the top two floors  of Jamboree Center's 1 Park Plaza in Irvine.  </P> <P> That makes it the biggest tenant -- with 28,000 square feet of office space --  in the first phase of the Irvine Co.'s office park at Jamboree Road and the San  Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> Bramalea, the U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian public company, will be on the 11th  and 12th floors, having signed a five-year lease for $2.9 million.  </P> <P> The company will move from four one-story office condominiums near the John  Wayne Airport in Costa Mesa, allowing it to consolidate operations in one  building for the first time, said Samuel E. Haynes, Bramalea's executive vice  president.  </P> <P> With Marlborough, Bramalea would have been the region's sixth-biggest home  builder last year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said Wednesday [15 June] it  will hold a public hearing in Tokyo on July 7 and 8 on imports  of U.S.-grown apples.    The ministry said it will take applications from those who  want to speak at the hearing until June 24.    With U.S. quarantine measures to prevent apple disease  having  already cleared Japanese requirements, Japan plans to lift its  ban on imports of U.S. apples this fall.    Japan has kept its market closed to U.S. apples, citing  worms  and disease which it had said could contaminate Japanese crops.    Ministry sources said that at a similar hearing in April  last  year on imports of New Zealand apples, domestic apple growers  clamored for the continued ban on foreign apples.</p>

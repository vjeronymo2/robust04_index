			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Germany's AEG sets its sights on vast railways potential THERE are about 30 cities in China with more than 1m inhabitants; several forming the focus of conurbations which are home to up to 15m people. Only two and a bit - Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai - have an underground railway. Mr Klaus Oertel, the board member responsible for AEG's fast-growing rail systems division, does not even attempt a guess at the sales potential. He focuses instead on the steady devolution of centralised decision-making powers to regional and city authorities which is slowly opening China's infrastructure market to outside expertise and investment. Four years after leading a German consortium into the fledgling Shanghai metro network with a DM350m (Dollars 218m) start-up order for 96 underground carriages, power supply, overhead line and telecommunications equipment, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary is on the verge of making its first direct investment in Chinese railways. This month, during the opening of the first stretch of Metro Shanghai, Mr Oertel signed a letter of intent to take a majority stake in a joint venture to make trains in China with the Shanghai Crane and Conveyor Works. With a stake of less than DM10m, and planned start-up capacity of one carriage a week, the deal is a tiny step along what may prove to be a permanent way leading to an infrastructural Eldorado. Like most German companies, AEG has been relatively slow and cautious in its entry into China. But Mr Oertel disputes claims from the likes of Mr Hans-Joachim von Ludwig, a director of Alcatel SEL, a Franco-German telecommunications consortium, that Germany 'seems to have lost track of the opportunities'. According to Mr von Ludwig, only 3 per cent of all German foreign direct investment last year was made in Asia, compared with Japan's 38 per cent. Mr Oertel accepts that Germany, occupied with a European and domestic boom for most of the 1980s, was late to join the 'travelling circus' search for low-wage manufacturing bases. But AEG is now more concerned with the future. So far Shanghai has opened only one 14km stretch of metro track in a planned network of 180km which, Mr Oertel says, will require about 1,000 carriages over 15 to 20 years. Meanwhile, the company is discussing a further joint venture with Changchun Railcar Works, the country's biggest rolling stock maker, and is in talks at central government level in Beijing on the prospects of deals in the locomotive industry. AEG's plans, set up in-house by a group led by chairman Mr Georg Stockl, are part of a grand group design, overseen in Daimler's Stuttgart headquarters. In a surge of activity, focused on what one Daimler official calls a 'state' visit by Mr Gerhard Liener, the finance director, Daimler group companies have this year already signed or finished negotiating more than half a dozen projects in China. Mr Liener recently capped the package with an announcement that Germany's biggest industrial concern will grace Shanghai's infant stock exchange by listing its shares there. This move, of more political than commercial importance, followed a flurry of successful diplomatic efforts by the Bonn government to further German interests in China. AEG's Mr Oertel, too, has his own diplomatic contacts. Mr Zhu Rongji, a former mayor of Shanghai, was instrumental in the 1989 deal under which AEG and consortium partners Siemens and ABB won the main contracts for the first stretch of the city's underground. Mr Zhu is now a first vice premier of the state council in Beijing. But according to Mr Oertel, the main factor qualifying AEG to win Chinese contracts is the quality and depth of its expertise in local rail transport. Another crucial element is the size and resources of its supporting parent. While Mr Oertel says he is not at all concerned about the possibility of damaging political upheaval in China, he acknowledges the risks inherent in investing in fast growing and febrile economies. 'Anyone going into a developing market must be clear that while in the long run everything will work out, in the short-term someone has to pay the water bills.'</p>

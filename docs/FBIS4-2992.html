			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.J. Tzou and Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 14 (CNA) -- A European  union (EU) official Thursday [14 April] extended his support for  Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) during a meeting with Republic of China [ROC] Economics  Minister P.K. Chiang.    Leon Brittan, vice president of the Commission of the  European Union, said however, that the EU is concerned about  Taiwan lowering its customs tariffs and removal of non-tariff  trade barriers, especially those related to the import of  European wine and liquor.    Brittan also asked Taiwan to bring its government  procurement  program and service market into line with regulations laid down  in the GATT Uruguay Round accord.    Brittan said before Taiwan enters GATT it must remove trade  barriers and adjust its custom tariffs.    Chiang asked Brittan to submit an EU list of desired tariff  reductions as soon as possible, so that both sides could engage  in bilateral talks in the near future.    Chiang, who met with Brittan for 45 minutes, was accompanied  by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng and the Board of  Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Yen-chao.    Meanwhile, the Taiwan delegation to the GATT ministerial  meeting here earlier met with Swiss Public Economy Minister  Jean-Pascal Delamuraz.    Delamuraz and Chiang discussed Taiwan's plans to open its  service market, especially the financial and insurance sectors.  Chiang also asked Delamuraz to submit a tariff reduction list  so that Taiwan can begin bilateral talks with the Swiss before  June, when a GATT working party meeting on Taiwan's membership  bid is set to meet.    Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade body in  1990 and was granted observer status in September 1992. It  hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

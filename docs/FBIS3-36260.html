Touching on the Russian side's participation in finding a  solution to the nuclear problem in North Korea, Demurin said  that Russia is working in three directions. It supports a  dialogue between North Korea and the United States, North Korea  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as  North and South Koreas.    "It is fully possible to resolve the problem of the  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula by  acting in these directions. The basis of the solution should be  a strcit observance of obligations of the agreement on  guarantees with the iaea by Pyongyang," the Russian deputy  foreign ministry spokesman emphasised.    "Russia is for North Korea remaining faithful to the Nuclear  Weapon Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we also underscore the need  to put into action the joint declaration about denuclearization  of the Korean Peninsula by the North and South," Mikhail Demurin  concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The People's Assembly Arab Affairs Committee  expressed its deep regret for the unacceptable provocative  measures that the Sudanese Government has recently adopted  against Egyptian property and nationals in Sudan.    In a statement it has issued, the committee noted that these  measures are just part of the unacceptable actions that have  become a characteristic of the ruling Sudanese regime because of  the internal and external crises gripping it.    The committee affirmed that Egypt cannot be provoked and  deeply cares for the interests of the Sudanese people and the  close relations between the two peoples, which no irresponsible  behavior can harm.</p>

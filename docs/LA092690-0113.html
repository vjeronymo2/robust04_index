			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE STRIKES DOWN PROP. 73 FUNDING LIMITS  </P> <P> Dramatically changing California campaign fund-raising rules six weeks before  the Nov. 6 election, a federal judge Tuesday sided with Democrats and struck  down the voter-approved campaign contribution limits of Proposition 73 as  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> In concluding that the initiative's restrictions on campaign financing violate  the 1st Amendment right to free expression, U.S. District Judge Lawrence K.  Karlton also rejected a key provision banning the transfer of campaign funds  from a candidate to another.  </P> <P> Barring further court action, candidates for governor and other statewide posts  are now free to raise unlimited amounts of money.  </P> <P> The decision came as a shock to candidates of both parties, who must adapt  their campaigns to cope with the sudden change in the rules. But the ruling was  hailed by Democratic Party Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr., who helped bring the  lawsuit.  </P> <P> "The decision strikes down one of the most pernicious campaign laws ever  enacted," the former governor said.  </P> <P> Two authors of the initiative and the state Fair Political Practices Commission  said they would go to court immediately to challenge the ruling and seek a stay  of the judge's order.  </P> <P> "The timing of this decision is most unfortunate," said Assembly Republican  Leader Ross Johnson, the primary author of Proposition 73. "There will be  enormous confusion now as hundreds of candidates at all levels of government  try to figure out what the new rules are."  </P> <P> Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson called on his Democratic rival,  Dianne Feinstein, to continue complying with the $1,000 campaign contribution  limit. But Feinstein, who trails far behind Wilson in fund raising, did not  accept the challenge.  </P> <P> Further complicating the fund-raising picture, the Fair Political Practices  Commission declared that Karlton's ruling now means the fund-raising  restrictions of a rival initiative, Proposition 68, will take effect for  legislative races -- not statewide offices. Proposition 68 was approved by  voters in 1988 but did not take effect because it received fewer votes than  Proposition 73.  </P> <P> Proposition 73 has been under legal challenge ever since its passage.  </P> <P> Among other things, it prohibited candidates for state and local offices from  accepting contributions of more than $1,000 from individuals and more than  $5,000 from political committees during the fiscal year from July 1 to June 30.  The limits applied only to candidates, not ballot measures.  </P> <P> In a direct attack on the power of Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and  other legislative leaders, the measure also outlawed the longstanding  legislative practice of transferring campaign funds among candidates.  </P> <P> Proposition 73 was sponsored by Johnson, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco)  and former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who is serving a 6 1/2-year  prison sentence on federal corruption charges.  </P> <P> In large part, the measure was drafted in an attempt to defeat Proposition 68,  a broader measure that called for public financing of campaigns and even more  sharply restricted campaign contributions.  </P> <P> With Karlton's ruling, the only major provisions of Proposition 73 that remain  intact are the ban on public financing of elections and certain restrictions on  mass mailings sent out by elected officials.  </P> <P> The lawsuit challenging Proposition 73 was brought by Speaker Brown of San  Francisco, Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the  Democratic Party, the Service Employees International Union and the California  Teachers Assn., among others.  </P> <P> Karlton agreed with the argument of the Democrats and labor unions that  limiting contributions by fiscal year is unconstitutional because it gives an  inordinate advantage to incumbents running for reelection.  </P> <P> "I conclude that Proposition 73, in measuring the limitation on campaign  contributions by fiscal year rather than election, unconstitutionally restricts  free speech and favors incumbents against challengers," Karlton said in a  65-page opinion.  </P> <P> Enacting contribution limits that correspond with the election year cycle --  such as the limits imposed by Proposition 68 -- would not give the same  advantage to incumbents and would therefore not be unconstitutional, the judge  noted.  </P> <P> "The situation for challengers is entirely different than for incumbents,"  Karlton said. "Few non-incumbents will decide to run for a particular office  years in advance of the election. Even if they do, they will have significant  trouble in raising money early in the election."  </P> <P> The ban on transfers by candidates is also unconstitutional, Karlton ruled,  because it violates their right to freedom of expression. But the judge  specifically noted that he was offering no opinion on the similar transfer ban  contained in Proposition 68.  </P> <P> Speaker Brown, who has long used the ability to transfer funds to help maintain  his power, greeted the victory with an uncharacteristically subdued response.  </P> <P> "The court made the proper decision," Brown said. At the same time, the Speaker  was warning legislators to be "circumspect" in their fund-raising efforts until  legal questions surrounding the decision are resolved, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> But U.S. Sen. Wilson criticized the judge's decision, saying: "I disagree with  the court's ruling and believe it subverts the will of Californians who voted  overwhelmingly for campaign reforms under Proposition 73."  </P> <P> Dee Dee Meyers, a spokeswoman for the Feinstein campaign, said it is only  natural for Wilson to object, since he fares better with the contribution  limits in place. But the Republican senator will still be able to raise more  money regardless of what campaign rules the candidates follow, she said.  </P> <P> "It's no surprise that Wilson is in favor of a measure that locks in his  fund-raising advantage," she said. "No matter what the rules are, they are  going to out-raise us and outspend us."  </P> <P> John Larson, chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission, warned  legislative candidates not to engage in a "fund-raising frenzy" because the  campaign contribution limits of Proposition 68 still apply.  </P> <P> But Joseph Remcho, the attorney who represented the Democrats and unions in the  case, contended that Proposition 68 does not take effect at all since it was  superseded by Proposition 73.  </P> <P> "In my view, Proposition 68 does not click in at all," Remcho said. "Now that  Proposition 73 is not constitutional, Proposition 68 does not rise Phoenix-like  from the ashes."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jerry Gillam contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Builders' outlook most upbeat since 1989 There was more encouraging news for the government on the economy yesterday, as the building industry published its most optimistic survey on work prospects for four years. The Building Employers Confederation said contractors during the final three months of last year had enjoyed the biggest rise in inquiries from potential customers since the beginning of 1989. Sir Brian Hill, confederation president, said: 'If the construction industry is a barometer for the rest of the economy, the underlying trend is encouraging.' According to the survey, contractors were 'more optimistic about output over the next 12 months than at any time since the end of 1989'. Thirty-one per cent of the 600 companies questioned expected to increase output over the next 12 months. This compared with 47 per cent which expected output to remain unchanged, and only 21 per cent which expected workloads to fall further. A further 38 per cent reported that inquiries from customers had risen compared with the previous three months while 42 per cent said there had been no change. Only 20 per cent reported a fall in inquiries. Sir Brian said: 'Clearly output has now stabilised after its long decline. It must be emphasised, however, that any growth in 1994 is expected to be modest. 'Some contractors were still charging suicidal prices in the chase to win work, and one-fifth of companies expected to reduce their workforces further during the next 12 months.' Sir Brian said that output was expected to rise by 'no more than 2 per cent this year', adding that the industry had already lost 500,000 jobs since it employed 1.8m at the height of the construction boom in June 1989. He was also concerned that tax rises in April might undermine recovery in the housing market. He appealed to the government to consider a further cut in interest rates. The confederation said inquiries from customers had risen in every area except public housing and private industrial work. It said environment department figures showed that the value of orders won by contractors had risen by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 16.31bn in the first 10 months of last year. Since then most of the contracts had been awarded for London's Jubilee line underground extension.</p>

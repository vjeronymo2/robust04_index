			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tesco plans job cuts but continues store openings TESCO, the supermarket chain, is seeking about 100 job cuts among its head office and distribution staff by means of voluntary redundancy and early retirement. The company is also planning to reduce staff numbers in some of its 394 stores by means of voluntary redundancies and a reduction of working hours. The precise number of staff affected is not yet known. The company has also launched a restructuring of its retail management operations in consultation with Usdaw, the shopworkers' union. In spite of the possible job losses associated with these programmes, Tesco will still be a net recruiter of staff this year. By the end of the month, the company will have opened five new stores in February, including its 200th superstore at Maldon, Essex. Over the next year, a further 28 stores will open providing 8,500 jobs. About 5,000 of these will represent new job opportunities; the remaining positions will be filled through a redeployment of existing staff. In total, the company employs more than 80,000 full and part-time staff including 2,000 at its head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. Co-operative Retail Services, which runs 118 Leo's supermarkets, will launch a promotion on Monday 'guaranteeing' the lowest price shopping basket on a range of about 20 basic shopping items. The company promises that if the basket can be bought cheaper elsewhere it will give the shopper twice the difference in price back in cash.</p>

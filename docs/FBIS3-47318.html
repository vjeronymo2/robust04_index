			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 January </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] The U.S. Government has compiled a report entitled:  "In Search of a New Partnership" to seek understanding for the  its position in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The  report clarifies the U.S. demands in the priority areas,  including insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and  telecommunications, claiming: "The United States is not seeking  the setting of numerical targets. This report was compiled to  dispel any misunderstanding" (according to the U.S. Embassy in  Japan). However, Japan remains suspicious, saying, "A careful  reading of the report shows the U.S. stance of being preoccupied  with numerical targets remains unchanged" (according to the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]).    The report emphasizes: "The U.S. Government understands that  trade should be determined by the market mechanism, and the  framework talks are aimed at enhancing the opposite of managed  trade [hi-kanri boeki] in Japan."    However, the report does cite some figures in several  passages, such as: "While the market share of foreign insurance  companies in advanced nations is 10 to 34 percent, their share  in the Japanese market is merely 2 percent." Regarding  automobiles and auto parts, the report says: "We demand that"  the target of increasing Japanese carmakers' purchase of  U.S.-made parts to $19 billion in fiscal 1994 "remains in place  even in and after 1995."    MITI has reacted coldly to the report, claiming: "It merely  avoids direct expressions; the U.S. stance of being preoccupied  with numerical targets is still discernible."</p>

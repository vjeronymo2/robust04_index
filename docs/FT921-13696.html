			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Turkey unveils populist budget to lift economy TURKEY'S coalition government has announced a populist economic programme in its new budget, using tax incentives and subsidised bank credit to boost investment and revitalise the economy. The proposals, presented on Saturday by Mrs Tansu Ciller, chief economics minister, envisage growth of 5.5 per cent in 1992, compared with about 2 per cent last year. Inflation, now at 70 per cent, is to be brought down to 42 per cent. Tax exemption for minimum wage earners will be introduced. Tax breaks and cheap credit channelled through development banks will stimulate activity in poorer regions, particularly the Kurdish-speaking south east. Further tax changes for government securities are planned to attract funds to equity markets. The government projects a slower real depreciation of the Turkish lira, devaluing against the dollar by 52 per cent in 1992. The average rate for the lira over this year is forecast at 6,332. The budget also foresees spending of TL207,000bn (Pounds 21.5bn) and revenues of TL176,000bn. This excludes subventions to state enterprises. Short-term borrowings by the Treasury are to be reduced. Rates of withholding tax for government securities will be adjusted, encouraging banks and corporations to invest in longer term paper. Bills of maturities up to a year will be taxed at 15 per cent. Longer term bills will remain at the 10 per cent level.</p>

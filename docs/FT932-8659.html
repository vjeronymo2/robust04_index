			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: Mission in need of more than written message Sir, There is wisdom in the old saying 'a picture speaks a thousand words'. With reference to Lucy Kellaway's article on mission statements (Management: 'Man with a mission', May 10), it is clear that the written word is not enough to give meaning to an organisation in the eyes of its employees - or, indeed, its management. A company can spend a great deal of time soul-searching and consulting to come up with the right statement only to see it instantly emasculated by the confused messages of a hodge-podge of signs, brochures, variations of a logo and an often inconsistent quality of writing. So the message of the mission statement must be seen to be acted upon, which means it must permeate everything the organisation says and does. Marks and Spencer, for example, communicates its message so well that a mission statement blazoned on the corporate walls would actually be superfluous and would be seen to indicate a lack of confidence. M and S, however, has a physical presence and operates in a highly visual world with tangible, packaged products. The City operates in a world of invisible services dependent upon the spoken and written word where reassurance is vital to success because no one can actually see what it does. Here the approach and attitude towards employees and clients/customers become the main channel for a mission statement message. For a City organisation, the most tangible and effective means of being seen to be acting upon that message is through a clear and consistent corporate identity. In other words, the company must not only sound as if it knows what it is doing and where it is going, it must also look it. Doing otherwise is a waste of effort, time and money.

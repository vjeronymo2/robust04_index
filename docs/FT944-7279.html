			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Now hear this - clearer sound Designing the acoustic systems for public buildings can be a hit-or-miss affair, leading to inaudible announcements or the need for expensive modifications. Bose Corporation, an audio equipment manufacturer, has developed a computer model which allows acoustic engineers to hear what public places will sound like before constructions. Its Auditioner system resulted from a nine-year research project which focused on the acoustic modelling necessary to predict how sound travels and the signal processing necessary to modify audio signals in the same way as rooms do. It consists of a desktop computer workstation, an audio computer fitted inside the workstation and audio playback apparatus for the listener. Bose: US, tel 508 879 7330; fax 508 872 6541.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Letter (2): Price to be paid for bus deregulation Sir, I was very glad to see you addressing the government's proposals on London Transport in your leader, 'A better way for buses', but I do wish you had considered the visual effects of deregulation in the capital. Take a walk or a drive along Park Lane and you will see that the carriage way bordering Hyde Park from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch has become a permanent parking strip for coaches and buses. This world-famous road in the heart of our capital is now blighted for the benefit of our beloved entrepreneurs, uncontrolled and unregulated. With the likely conversion of County Hall into a tourist and leisure centre in mind it may not be too fanciful to imagine a funfair going up in St James's Park and hotdog stands outside Buckingham Palace. What a fall this has been from capital of an empire to an increasingly grubby tourist centre. P J Pace O'Shea, 45 Fellows Road, London NW3 3DX</p>

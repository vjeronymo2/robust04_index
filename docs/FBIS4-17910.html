			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Almaty, 26 Apr -- The six principles on which China  intends to build its economic relations with the states of  Central Asia were set out today by Li Peng, prime minister of  the PRC State Council, as he addressed representatives of  Kazakhstan's business circles while on an official visit here.    In the opinion of the Chinese side, cooperation must be  based  on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and should be  practiced in accordance with economic laws. Partners must heed  each other's needs, abide by the principle of equivalent  exchanges, maintain a balance of trade and regulate it, if  necessary. The creation of joint ventures must be in the  interests of the participants and aim to develop the economies  of the participating countries.    Second, the forms of cooperation must be diversified. At  present, the exchange of goods forms the greater part of all  economic exchanges. In Beijing's view, proper trade must be the  main tendency in this sphere. To this end, it is necessary to  improve the conditions for the performance of banking  operations. The Chinese Government fully shares the Central  Asian states' desire to develop relations with various areas in  the PRC, supplementing their links with the neighboring Xinjiang  Uygur autonomous region.    Third, economic cooperation must originate from the specific  conditions and muster all the local resources. Full account  must be taken of the market development prospects from the  outset of the creation of joint ventures, which must provide a  good economic return and produce competitive output.    Fourth, as a new "Silk Road" is built, transport and  communications must inevitably be improved. The prime minister  of the PRC State Council pointed out, in this connection, the  importance of the agreement concluded in this field during the  current visit. In Li Peng's view, China and Kazakhstan must  make every effort to ensure the vigorous functioning of this  transport "bridge" between Europe and Asia.    Fifth, the small amount of economic aid that we have been  able to give the states of Central Asia, the premier stressed,  is only a symbol for the PRC people's friendly feelings toward  their neighbors. China is itself a developing country at the  moment and is trying to improve its economy.    Sixth, China intends to promote multilateral cooperation so  that everyone may develop. The PRC is conducting an "open door"  policy toward the developing, as well as the developed,  countries, and particularly toward neighboring countries, Li  Peng observed. As it develops its links with the states of  Central Asia, China would like to see a growth in their trade,  the strengthening of economic ties and friendly contacts with  other countries. We are ready for honest and equal competition,  the Chinese leader said.    As he concluded his speech, Li Peng emphasized that China  did  not see Central Asia as a target for the expansion of its sphere  of political and economic influence.</p>

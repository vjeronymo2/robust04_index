			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Some day my prince will go: Even royal fairy tales can be grim he admitted it freely in public. 'I do hope,' he said, across the table, 'that this weekend you will avoid the royal family.' Well, I shall then do my best to avoid them, but avoid writing about them I cannot. One can be choosy about whom one meets, but the requirements of journalistic topicality allow of no such social discrimination. 'End of the Fairy tale' declared the headline of almost every newspaper after the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales was announced. This was in no way logical since the same sort of newspapers had, initially, declared it to be a 'fairy tale' marriage. Leave aside the absurd, if unoriginal, hyperbole in all this. The point is: what sort of fairy tales were most headline writers brought up on? All the ones I ever had read to me involved all sorts of bizarre events. Princesses were poisoned, locked up in towers, tormented by witches, and worse. The Waleses' marriage clearly has become deeply unhappy but, compared with the tales of the Brothers Grimm, it has been positively serene. Perhaps the fairy tale was supposed to mean, simply, that a girl had married her prince. This might be a commonplace among the masses; but among those grand families whose virgin daughters are seen as ideal breeding material by the Palace (and, in this, I do not include the family of Major Ronald Ferguson), there exists no such sentimentality. The late Earl Spencer, for example had few illusions. 'You could have done better,' he is said to have told his daughter, Diana, when he learnt of her engagement to the heir to the throne. This was not just an astute awareness by the old boy that, in the era of press intrusiveness, such a marriage could become more of a curse than a blessing. Even in the halcyon days of the mid-1930s, when the press knew their place and private lives were private, wise old Lord Halifax did his diplomatic best to ensure that his only daughter, Anne, did not marry George, Duke of Kent, a denouement that seemed very likely at one point. The surprising aspect of this was that Lord and Lady Halifax were very close friends of the Duke and Duchess of York, later to become King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. But, as Andrew Roberts recounts in his biography of Edward, Lord Halifax: 'He loved gossip and tittle-tattle and, although not a snob in the conventional sense, delighted in the company of duchesses and reserved for royalty a special exaltation. 'However, when it seemed likely that their only daughter might become engaged to George, Duke of Kent, Lady Halifax recalled how 'Edward and I were very apprehensive and did not at all like the prospect. It meant that we should lose Anne in a way that we should not do in any other sort of marriage. I felt sure also, knowing the royals well and their attitude to ordinary life and ordinary people, that Edward and I would always feel very much the poor relatives to the royal family.' According to the Earl of Crawford, the duke went so far as to ask the king's permission. When, in the fullness of time, the 'matrimonial project ended,' it was much to the satisfaction of Halifax himself. Lady Halifax's observation about being made to feel the poor relations was prescient: that awareness seems to have caused at least some of the disenchantment which led both the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York to regret their 'fairy tale' marriages. But add to that the horrific stresses that press and other intrusiveness places on the brides of Britain's royal family, and it becomes clear that the House of Windsor has a problem which could affect its very continuity. Having ruled out as brides virtually all suitable foreign royal princesses (because of the archaic rule preventing marriage to a Catholic), the royal males are in danger of being deemed unsuitable matches by all British families of middling to good breeding and intelligence: they would not need the wisdom and foresight of a Lord and Lady Halifax to see the potential for their daughters' misery in marrying a potential heir to the throne. If Britain's royal family is not to die out, two things must happen. The press must be nicer to the House of Windsor, and the House of Windsor must be nicer to its poor relations.

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DNA TEST CAN DETERMINE PATERNITY BEFORE BIRTH  </P> <P> The new technique of DNA fingerprinting, quickly becoming widely used in  criminal court cases, can also be used to determine a child's paternity, even  before birth, a USC obstetrician reported last week in the journal Obstetrics  and Gynecology.  </P> <P> In the technique, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic blueprint of life)  from blood or sperm cells is isolated and separated into groups of fragments to  produce a unique visual "fingerprint" that makes it possible to determine  whether two samples are from the same person or from related individuals.  </P> <P> Dr. Bruce Kovacs cited the case of a 34-year-old woman with a long history of  infertility who was receiving drug treatment to induce ovulation. During the  midpoint of one of her cycles, she was raped by an unknown assailant. On her  next visit to her physician, she was found to be pregnant. DNA fingerprinting  proved that her husband was the father.  </P> <P> In a second case, a 35-year-old pregnant woman had been sexually active while  estranged from her husband. She wanted to continue the pregnancy only if the  fetus was her husband's. Unfortunately, Kovacs found, it was not.  </P></p>

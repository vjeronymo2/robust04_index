			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Readicut advances to Pounds 20.9m Readicut International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company, lifted pre-tax profits by 8.7 per cent to Pounds 20.9m for the year ended March 31. Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, yesterday described conditions in the group's markets as 'far from ideal'. UK recovery was irregular, margins remained under pressure, the US recovery was slow and Europe was still in recession. Total turnover moved ahead from Pounds 235m to Pounds 238m. The latest figure includes Pounds 36.4m from discontinued operations, compared with Pounds 43.9m last time. The pre-tax profits included Pounds 3.9m from the disposal last month of Firth Furnishings, a maker of car carpets, and the sale last October of Readicut Wool, the distributor of rug kits, knitting yarn and handicraft products. This compared with profits of Pounds 4.2m from disposals in the previous year, when pre-tax profits were Pounds 19.2m. In the key carpet division operating profits were up from Pounds 3.78m to Pounds 6.73m on sales of Pounds 88.4m (Pounds 81.3m). Mr Shaw said profits at Firth Carpets moved from Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 2.1m on the back of a 20 per cent rise in contract carpet sales. The group lifted capital spending from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 14.5m during the year, and is planning to spend Pounds 15.2m in the current year. Earnings per share were ahead from 7.5p to 7.84p. An unchanged final dividend of 2.81p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 3.44p. COMMENT This was a solid set of results, in a difficult year, from a well-managed company that has successfully got out of its non-core, low-margin businesses. Profits this year are expected to be about Pounds 18.5m, giving a prospective multiple of 15 - not cheap, but a good share to hold in the textiles sector. The unchanged dividend looks a bit mean for a group that ended the year with net cash of Pounds 10.1m. The question now is: what is it going to buy?</p>

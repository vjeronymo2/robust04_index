			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / One more element of doubt: How London views this week's events The UK government is doing its best to play down the impact of the power vacuum in Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process. From London's perspective, there is nothing to be gained by adding to the sense of crisis that Mr Albert Reynolds's resignation has threatened to stir up. Most leading Ulster politicians have come round to a similar position. Even Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, emphasised this week that the peace process was 'bigger than any of us' - although he warned of 'widespread concern' among nationalists about the effects of Mr Reynolds's removal. Mr Adams's choice of words was uncannily similar to that of Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some loyalist paramilitaries. According to Mr Ervine, 'this is a bigger issue than any individual'. Both moderate and hardline unionists have indicated that on balance they think the peace process will gain from the fall of a prime minister whom they felt was influenced to an uncomfortable degree by Mr Adams. More important, they argue, is whether the IRA is ready to renounce violence permanently. Many unionists remain unconvinced. Mr William Ross, the Ulster Unionist chief whip, says: 'I have always been sceptical and I have seen nothing in recent weeks or days to change my mind.' However, the collapse of the Dublin coalition has added new elements of doubt to a process that was already difficult. The piece of the jigsaw most clearly in danger is the much-delayed joint framework document the two governments have been striving to agree. This document will form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's principal political parties. At its heart will be a constitutional trade-off under which Dublin would remove its territorial claim to the province in return for changes to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act enshrining partition. Speaking within hours of Mr Reynolds's resignation, senior British officials said the two governments were 'close' to agreement. But this week's events are unlikely to help the work of the so-called 'liaison committee' of British and Irish officials who are working on the framework document. The pace of progress on exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives - due to start before Christmas, provided the ceasefire holds - may also be slowed. This is because the liaison committee has yet to complete its work on developing a co-ordinated north-south approach to decommissioning paramilitary arsenals. The British government expects the handover of these weapons to be close to the top of the agenda when these talks get under way. Unless the committee continues to work while a new Irish government emerges, London may have to start the talks before the liaison committee's report is ready. Officials can pursue technical points in the absence of a government in Dublin, but they will soon need fresh political direction. Another imponderable is the personal chemistry between Mr Major and the new Irish premier. While the UK prime minister and Mr Reynolds had their disagreements, they seemed to be on the same wavelength. This was invaluable in underpinning the peace process's credibility at moments when relations between London and Dublin were strained. London will be keen for Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Irish Labour party, to retain a prominent role in the process. This would ensure an element of continuity. Although Mr Major has won plaudits for his handling of the peace process, there was a growing feeling, even before this week, that time was beginning to press. Events in Dublin have reinforced that feeling, but have also made it more difficult for the two governments to respond to it.</p>

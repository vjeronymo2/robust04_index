			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Ines Espeche and Ana Gerschenson: "The </F> Capital Is Jeopardizing the Pact"]    [Text] "The direct election of the mayor and the reform of  Buenos Aires City:    "a) The people of the city of Buenos Aires will directly  elect their chief of government.    "b) The city of Buenos Aires will be granted a special  constitutional status that will recognize its autonomy and its  own legislative and jurisdictional powers."    (From the Basic Points of Agreement of the pact signed in  Olivos by President Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin)    The measures contained in the Olivos pact have already begun  to unravel. The bone of contention is none other than the  autonomy of the Federal Capital and its new legal status.  Apparently, government officials are trying to "block" the legal  and economic independence of the city and leave alone only the  direct election of the mayor at the Constituent Assembly in  Santa Fe. President Menem himself urged the squabbling factions  in the Buenos Aires Justicialist Party (PJ) to end their  fighting and put off decisions on the future plan.    The "provincialization" of the Federal Capital would  inevitably bring with it the creation of new local institutions,  the drafting of a metropolitan constitution, the formation of a  local police force (the neighborhood precincts would come under  the jurisdictions of the city), and a new local judiciary, plus  the possible replacement of the Deliberating Council by a Buenos  Aires legislature.    But what is especially upsetting to more than one sector of  the national government, particularly the Economy Ministry, is  that it will not be able to refuse to turn over the lion's share  of its funds to a new "city state" with full autonomy.    No Buenos Aires politician doubts that this is "the debate  that will come on the heels of the Constituent Assembly."    The leaders of the metropolitan PJ who are part of the  president's inner circle would be willing to tolerate the  emergence of a "chief of government" elected by popular vote.  "What they cannot stomach," claim some former Grossists, "is  that on top of that, the new mayor would have control of the  huge budget of the new province."    Even Carlos Corach, the number-one candidate to represent  the  capital at the Constituent Assembly, told LA PRENSA that he does  not agree with the formation of a metropolitan judiciary or a  local police force. "That would result in more useless  bureaucracy," he declared, expressly contradicting the paragraph  of the Olivos pact that states: "...the city of Buenos Aires  will be given a constitutional status that will recognize its  autonomy and its own legislative and jurisdictional powers."    "Here it is evading an internal debate within the PJ," says  Simon Lazara, spokesman for Raul Alfonsin, when asked about the  possibility that the Radicals' agreement with Menem may fall  apart. While it is an open secret that within the Buenos Aires  PJ there is "an internal power struggle between Corach and  Ruckauf to control the capital," when it comes to the issue of  the city's autonomy, the minister agrees with the legal and  technical secretary that "it is not necessary" for the city to  have its own police and court system.    "What they are forgetting," whispers a former Justicialist  deputy, "is that they will not be ministers or government  officials for the rest of their lives; they will not last 100  years."    On the other hand, Alfonsinist Jesus Rodriguez, a deputy who  favors the pact, promised that at the Constituent Assembly "we  will defend our neighbors, because I do not trust the Menemists  when they talk about autonomy."    This issue, about which the Justicialists have clearly not  reached a consensus (although they do not admit that in public),  will be the subject of a meeting next week between the PJ  deputies and Constituent Assembly candidates, both those in the  capital and those in Buenos Aires Province. There they will try  to forge a united position so that there will be no more  contradictions, at least not in public.  <H5>  "The Name Is Mine" </H5>   It should be noted that Governor Eduardo Duhalde recently  brought up the "identity crisis" that Buenos Aires residents  would suffer if the city were to keep its current name. It was  then that he proposed the name "Santa Maria" for its third  incarnation, after it has achieved full autonomy.    "All the patrol cars that used to say `Buenos Aires  Provincial Police' now say `Buenos Aires Police,' to get people  used to the idea of Buenos Aires in the district," the  distressed governor explained to Buenos Aires PJ Deputy Jorge  Arguello, author of the first autonomy plan for the capital.    Despite the "psychological crisis" the residents of the  metropolitan area may suffer, on this side of General Paz no  one, Justicialist or Radical, is willing to give up the label  "Buenos Aires City," which will inevitably set the stage for  confrontations here and there in the future.    Some suspicious types speculate that what really bothers  Duhalde is "the emergence of a man who will be as strong as he  is as governor of what until now has been the country's most  important province."    The chief of government, a title agreed upon by the Radical  Civic Union (UCR) and the PJ, will be politically and  economically powerful enough to negotiate on an equal footing on  issues such as the exodus of "the 6 million people who come into  the capital each day to be treated at Buenos Aires hospitals."    To top it all off, Deputy Enrique Benedetti, a De la Rua  political operative, did not hesitate to give LA PRENSA this  diagnosis: "This is another `leak' in the pact. First there is  Levene, who does not want to give up the [Supreme] Court; now we  have the autonomy issue. The next thing you know, they will say  that Menem's reelection will not be for one term, but will be  good for the rest of his biological existence."  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Everyone Wants To Be "Chief of Government" </H5>   Being elected top leader of the Federal Capital by popular  vote is the pinnacle of politics for more than one Buenos Aires  official, regardless of party affiliation. The matter has  sparked more than one internal feud.    The list includes those who secretly yearn for the office,  as  well as those who have already announced it loud and clear.    Among metropolitan Justicialists, former Grossists and  Menemists are fighting over the right to be the elected  "figure"; everyone from recent PJ acquisition Adelina Dalesio de  Viola to Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan (PAMI) Director  Matilde Menendez, and including Legal and Technical Secretary  Carlos Corach, Public Function Secretary Claudia Bello, and  Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, wants to take Bouer's place in  1995.    After the recent elections in the capital and the dimming of  his presidential prospects, Radical insiders say that Senator  Fernando de la Rua has expressed a desire to wear the mayor's  sash. But the man who opposed the pact will not have a smooth  road ahead of him. Alfonsinist Deputy Jesus Rodriguez has  already secretly begun pulling his political strings to enter  the race for the same job.    The appearance on the scene of Socialist Councilman Norberto  Laporta, who swept the metropolitan elections last 3 October,  has dashed more than one private hope. "El Chichon" [the jolly  one] has reportedly taken the idea so seriously that many say  this was the real reason why he declined to enter into an  alliance with the Great Front. "With the race for the city  leadership so close at hand, he could not risk having his image  tarnished," Socialists assert with conviction.    There is also optimism in the front. The person who emerges  as the "best of the candidates" is former Prosecutor and  Councilman Anibal Ibarra. The opinion polls indicate he is a man  to be reckoned with, especially since he was so instrumental in  exposing irregularities in the PAMI.    Another person rumored to be vying for a position on the  list  of possible candidates is retired Brigadier General Osvaldo  Cacciatore, who made no secret during his unsuccessful campaign  for deputy as a member of the metropolitan Democratic Center  Union (UCeDe) that he would like once again to hold the office  that was once his.  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Third Incarnation </H5>   A series of legal steps must be taken before the city can be  declared "autonomous."     -  It must be approved by the National Constituent  Convention.    -  After that the second stage will begin, the local  constituent process, when limits will be set and terms will be  defined.    -  If Article 3, Paragraph 27 of Article 67, and Paragraph  3 of Article 86 of the National Constitution are amended at the  convention, the way will be clear to advance toward  autonomy.    -  Until autonomy is declared and the new institutions of  Buenos Aires City are installed, Congress will continue to be  the local legislature.    -  After the Constitution is amended,  Congress will pass a law calling an election for delegates to a  Buenos Aires Constituent Assembly.    -  Each party will have to draw  up a city model to present to the people, set in motion an  electoral process, elect delegates to the Constituent Assembly,  draft the constitution of the autonomous city, and once it is  approved, set in motion the institutional process.    -  The  Deliberative Council will be replaced by a legislature of the  new city.    -  It will have a special constitutional status.    -  It will  continue to be the nation's capital until Congress passes a law  transferring that status; it may or may not declare the capital  to be federal.    -  Although there is a general consensus on  autonomy, the debate will begin with what city model each party  will offer. Moreover, it will have a direct impact on the  quality of life of the citizens. This is a foundational stage,  the most important one since the city was federalized in  1880.</p>

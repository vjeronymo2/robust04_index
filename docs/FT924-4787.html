			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / S Africa tightens exchange controls: Government acts to relieve pressure on financial rand THE South African government has tightened exchange control regulations in an attempt to curb disinvestments by local companies which have put South Africa's investment currency, the financial rand, under severe pressure in recent weeks. Mr Derek Keys, the finance minister, said South African companies wishing to invest abroad would have to finance their investments by raising loans overseas - rather than by using the financial rand - unless the investment was 'of immediate benefit to the country in the short term'. Such loans would have to be serviced from income generated by the new investment. The move comes after a recent surge in investments abroad by South African companies, including large investments by the country's two forest products groups, Sappi and Mondi, acquisitions by First National Bank and the Standard Bank group and the proposed takeover of Del Monte Foods International by the Royal Group and Anglo American. Mr Keys' statement said that deals already approved by the central bank would have to be financed overseas, with arrangements made to stagger repayments. The impact of these investment outflows probably explains the recent weakening in the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners investing in South Africa and South Africans investing abroad. The discount between the commercial and financial rands rose as a result to a high of 46 per cent when Royal announced its proposed Del Monte acquisition, after narrowing to a low of 7 per cent in 1991 when political sentiment was positive towards South Africa. Police said yesterday that the Azanian People's Liberation Army, armed wing of the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), had claimed responsibility for the weekend golf club attack in which four whites were killed. A PAC spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that its army was involved, but said many South Africans believed political violence would be treated more seriously if it spilled over into white areas. The African National Congress (ANC) condemned the attack, calling it an 'outrageous act of naked terrorism'.</p>

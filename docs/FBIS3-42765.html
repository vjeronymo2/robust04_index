For officially registered trade enterprises, this figure is 99.6 percent.   [.sup]4[/] Here and henceforth--data according to estimates and bilateral exchange of information.      The foreign trade turnover of states of the Commonwealth  (not  including trade transactions among themselves) in  January-November 1993 amounted to $80.3 billion in current  prices. This is 7 percent less than the level for the same  period of 1992. The volume of exports increased by 7 percent,  while imports decreased by 22 percent. The balance with respect  to export and import operations of states of the Commonwealth in  January-November was positive in the amount of $15.5 billion.    The number of unemployed persons who applied to the  employment service seeking work exceeded 1.6 million on the  whole throughout the Commonwealth as of the end of November.  This is 2.4 times greater than the need for workers as stated to  employment services.    For every vacant job position in Azerbaijan, there were four  persons unemployed, as opposed to 3.4 in January. In Armenia  these figures were 53 and 75, respectively. In Belarus, they  were four and 1.5; in Kyrgyzstan, 2.4 and 1.3; in Moldova, 22  and 18; in Russia, 2.7 and 3.4; and in Tajikistan, six and 33.    The number of persons out of work and registered with the  employment services amounted to 1.1 million as of the end of  November, or over 70 percent of the unemployed population (this  figure for the end of January was 0.9 million, or 61 percent).  The dynamics of persons out of work in countries of the  Commonwealth in 1993 is shown below (as of the end of the  reporting period, numbers of individuals):                   First       Second      Third       October     November                 quarter     quarter     quarter   Azerbaijan     7,700       6,700       19,100      18,800      18,900   Armenia        76,700      87,600      95,900      98,600      100,700   Belarus        52,800      54,900      63,400      65,800      67,300   Kazakhstan     39,300      37,600      37,200      39,100      39,800   Kyrgyzstan     2,400       2,700       2,800       3,200       3,100   Moldova        12,800      9,800       10,400      10,800      11,000   Russia         730,000     717,100     706,000     728,400     779,200   Tajikistan     9,700       11,700      16,500      18,000      20,500   Uzbekistan     14,900      15,100      14,400      14,100      13,500   Ukraine        79,500      73,300      78,700      79,500      80,500      The most significant proportion of people out of work is  attributable to workers laid off from enterprises and  organizations: Their share as of the beginning of October  constituted 56 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 49 percent in Moldova, and  28 percent in Russia. One out of every five persons out of work  is a rural resident. Young people account for 55 percent of the  total in Kazakhstan, 30 percent in Kyrgyzstan, and 37 percent in  Russia. The share of individuals receiving unemployment  compensation fluctuates from 24 percent in Azerbaijan to 64  percent in Russia.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   In January-November 1993, the total volume of industrial  production throughout countries of the Commonwealth decreased by  14.7 percent from the level of the same period of 1992.    The change in production of consumer goods in  January-November 1993 as compared with the level for the same  period of 1992 for states of the Commonwealth is characterized  by the following data (in percentages):                         Consumer    Including:                       products                                    Food        All         Nonfood     Nonfood                                   products    nonfood     products    products                                               products    of light    for                                                           industry    cultural,                                                                       domestic,                                                                       and                                                                       household                                                                       use   Azerbaijan           90          94          96          93          98   Armenia              73          52          78          85          75   Belarus              96          90          99          98          99   Kazakhstan           85          83          90          90          89   Kyrgyzstan           80          76          86          93          75   Moldova              88          82          96          103         90   Russia               89          89          90          79          93   Tajikistan           89          94          87          86          89   Turkmenistan         99.2        97          106         113         78   Uzbekistan           112         108         116         115         119   Ukraine              83          84          79          75          81  (January-October)   Average across the   90          89          90          86          94  Commonwealth      The output of foodstuffs diminished. Industrial output of  meat in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was 10 percent less than in  January-November 1992; in Russia and Belarus, 16-18 percent  less; Moldova, 38 percent less. Whole milk output in Russia  decreased by 16 percent; in Kazakhstan, by 34 percent; and in  Kyrgyzstan, by 41 percent. In most of the Commonwealth  countries, production of vegetable oil was reduced, as was that  of fish as an edible commodity, flour, macaroni products, and  cereals.    A reduction was seen in the production output of the main  light industry varieties. A 25 percent reduction, on the  average, was seen in the production of fabric of all varieties  and footwear in the Commonwealth, as compared with  January-November of last year. Production of fabric in Russia  decreased by 29 percent; production of footwear in Russia,  Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan decreased by 29-32 percent.    In a number of states, the output of major varieties of  major  home appliances has exceeded the level for the same period of  last year. Production of television sets, refrigerators, and  freezers in Russia grew by 10-11 percent over this period. The  output of washing machines in Uzbekistan increased by 25  percent; in Moldova, by 21 percent; and in Belarus, by 15  percent. In Kazakhstan, production of tape recorders increased  by 13 percent. In Moldova, the output of refrigerators and  freezers grew by 9 percent. At the same time, the production of  certain varieties of these items decreased as compared with the  level of January-November 1992. In Belarus, the output of tape  recorders decreased by 34 percent, of television sets--by 25  percent; in Kazakhstan, production of washing machines decreased  by 26 percent; in Russia, output of tape recorders decreased by  18 percent, and of radios and radio equipment--by 28 percent.    Generation of electric power in January-November decreased  by  6 percent on the average across the Commonwealth as compared  with the same period of 1992. Production of electric power by  individual states of the Commonwealth in January-November 1993  is characterized by the following data:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Billions of kilowatt-hou-|Percentage of January-No-|  |                         |rs                       |vember 1992 level        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Azerbaijan               |17.1                     |96                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armenia                  |5.7                      |70                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belarus                  |30.1                     |89                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakhstan               |69.0                     |93                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kyrgyzstan               |9.8                      |92                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moldova                  |...                      |...                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia                   |820                      |95                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tajikistan               |16.4                     |105                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Turkmenistan             |11.2                     |94                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Uzbekistan               |44.3                     |96                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine (January-October)|188                      |92                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Coal production over the January-November period decreased  by  10 percent in Russia and by 12 percent in Kazakhstan, including  reduced production of coking coal of 13 and 11 percent,  respectively. Production of gas was 4 percent lower than the  level for the same period of last year in Russia, while this was  5 percent higher in Uzbekistan. Production of gas in  Turkmenistan increased significantly--by 13 percent. This was  the main factor determining the increase in total volume of  industrial production in the republic. Production of oil in the  Commonwealth diminished as compared with January-November 1992  levels, including by 13 percent in Russia, by 10 percent in  Kazakhstan, and by 15 percent in Turkmenistan. Production of  motor vehicle gasoline decreased by 14 percent, diesel fuel--by  16 percent, and furnace fuel oil--by 13 percent. The output of  motor vehicle gasoline in Turkmenistan decreased by 22 percent,  of diesel fuel and furnace fuel oil--by 29 percent. These  figures for Belarus were 31, 32, and 35 percent, respectively.  In Uzbekistan the level of production of main oil products  increased over last year's level.    The output of finished rolled ferrous metals decreased by 8  percent from the levels of the same period of last year. The  decline in total production volume in machine building was not  overcome. Output of metal-cutting machine tools in Kazakhstan  decreased by 26 percent, in Russia--by 18 percent, and in  Belarus--by 15 percent. Production of forging and pressing  machines here decreased by 10, 55, and 67 percent, respectively.  Production of tractors in Russia was reduced by 30 percent, in  Uzbekistan--by 36 percent, and in Kazakhstan--by 57 percent.    In the chemical industry, the output of mineral fertilizers  in Russia decreased over January-November by 21 percent, in  Belarus--by 36 percent, and in Kazakhstan--by 66 percent. Some  26 percent less of chemical fibers and filaments were produced  in Russia than in January-November of last year; 25 and 23  percent less--of soda ash and caustic soda, respectively. In  Belarus the output of chemical fibers and filaments decreased by  22 percent, of synthetic resins and plastics--by 23 percent.    The production of paper decreased across the Commonwealth by  21 percent, as compared with the same period of 1992.    The production of building materials diminished. Thus,  output  of cement was reduced by 19 percent on the average for the  Commonwealth, as well as for Russia; in Kazakhstan and  Kyrgyzstan, cement output was reduced by 37-40 percent, and in  Tajikistan--by 46 percent.    Intergovernmental agreements for the delivery of many  technical and industrial production varieties for 1993 are not  being implemented, although the volumes pertaining to the  above-mentioned agreements are significantly reduced from 1992  volumes. Nonfulfillment of the agreements is due to the fact  that Commonwealth countries have introduced restrictions on  product exports under conditions of declining production, and  the fact that consumer enterprises are not able to make payments.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   Purchases of the main varieties of plant product output in  states of the Commonwealth changed in 1993, as compared with the  same period of 1992, in the following manner (in percentage of  1992 level):                    Grain    Sunflower    Sugar        Raw       Potatoes    Vegetables                           seeds        beets        cotton                                        (factory)   Azerbaijan      102      -            -            105       73          75   Armenia         37       -            -            -         375         8   Belarus         105      -            164          -         80          91   Kazakhstan      49       34           -            -         110         73   Kyrgyzstan      113      -            -            79        34          25   Moldova         147      42           48           -         200         82   Russia          109      47           70           -         53          74   Tajikistan      167      -            -            166       89          80   Turkmenistan    172      -            -            104       55          72   Uzbekistan      111      -            -            103       ...         ...

At the same time that the volume of  livestock production purchases by procurement organizations  decreased, livestock output sales through other channels  increased (sales on the market, direct ties with trading  organizations, barter transactions, and so on).  <H5>  Construction </H5>   The commissioning of facilities in the social sphere by  state  enterprises and organizations in states of the Commonwealth in  January-November 1993 is characterized by the following:                           Housing,    General-education    Preschool        Hospitals,    Walk-in                         square      schools, student     institutions,    beds          clinics,                         meters of   spaces               spaces                         visits                         total                                                           per shift                         area   Azerbaijan             451,100     9,809                1,660            475           1,940   Armenia                187,200     7,105                690              -             -   Belarus                1.4355      18,518               4,700            647           3,025                         million   Kazakhstan             1.8196      15,783               4,170            387           1,230                         million   Kyrgyzstan             54,200      6,667                280              110           -   Moldova                120,200     1,198                720              -             200  (January-September)   Russia                 11.8487     159,045              24,128           6,303         17,574                         million   Tajikistan             114,500     10,698               700              724           325   Turkmenistan           370,500     27,909               4,035            902           580   Uzbekistan             767,700     79,041               9,224            2,488         4,862   Ukraine                4.800       64,000               13,500           1,550         4,500                         million   Total for the          21.9692     399,773              63,807           13,586        34,236  Commonwealth           million      Over the first 11 months of 1993, a greater volume of  housing  was commissioned than during the same period of the previous  year in Armenia (by 27 percent) and Turkmenistan (by 4 percent);

In all states of the Commonwealth, as compared with the same  period of last year, the rate of growth of monetary income of  the populace outpaced the rate of growth of expenditures for  goods and services. Thus, monetary income over the period in  question increased from 8.8-fold in Azerbaijan to 13-fold in  Belarus, while expenditures for the purchase of goods and  services varied from 5.5-fold to 12.1-fold, respectively. In  Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova, this was caused by  accelerated rates of increased amounts of cash accumulated by  the populace and correspondingly lower rates of population  expenditures on goods and services. In Russia, the rate of  growth of monetary income was greater than the rate of consumer  expenditures primarily because of greater increases in the  purchase of securities and freely convertible currency.    The growth of monetary accumulations in January-November in  Moldova amounted to 18.2 percent of income, in Russia--21.8  percent, and in Turkmenistan--67.3 percent.

In this regard, the prices of food products  increased almost 8-fold, nonfood products--2.3-fold; in Armenia  prices increased 3.9-fold, including a 4.5-fold increase in  prices for food products and 1,7-fold increase in nonfood  products.    The prices of food products in stores of Azerbaijan almost  doubled. Those in stores of Belarus and Kazakhstan increased  1.5-1.6-fold, in Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan--by  approximately one third, and in Kyrgyzstan--by 20 percent.    Prices of nonfood products increased by a factor of 1.5-1.6  in Belarus and Tajikistan in November alone, and by one-third in  Kazakhstan and Moldova. In Azerbaijan the level of prices of  nonfood products increased by 9 percent, in Kyrgyzstan--by 18  percent.    Gaps in price levels throughout states of the Commonwealth  for certain consumer products (especially food products)  continue to remain extremely significant. Thus, as of 30  November, the maximum price of beef, registered in the organized  trade network of the capitals of Commonwealth states and a few  oblast centers of Russia, exceeded the minimum by a factor of  5.4 (in Dushanbe--R7,330 [rubles] per kilogram,  Volgograd--R1,368), of cooked sausage--by a factor of 6.1 (in  Dushanbe--R9,300, Bishkek--R1,531), butter--by a factor of 3.3  (in Minsk--R5,120, Baku--R1,560), and vegetable oil--by a factor  of 7.6 (in Minsk--R4,580, Voronezh--R600). The difference in  prices of milk, more recently than the above-mentioned date, was  9.3-fold (in Yekaterinburg--R336, Dushanbe--R36), eggs--7.2-fold  (in Tashkent--R2,300 per ten, Kazan--R320), granulated  sugar--5.7-fold (in Yerevan--R3,000, Baku--R530), and wheat  bread--7.6-fold (in Moscow--R454, Minsk--R60). (Prices in the  capitals of states that shifted to national currencies are  calculated in rubles according to the exchange rates officially  published by national banks).    A quite significant increase in prices was also observed in  November in the city markets of a number of states. As compared  with October, the level of prices for agricultural products in  markets of the cities of Armenia increased 10.5-fold,  Kazakhstan--4.3-fold, Tajikistan--2.8-fold, and  Uzbekistan--2.6-fold. In Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Moldova,  Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, products on the markets increased in  prices by a factor of 1.3-1.6.    On average throughout the CIS, prices in the markets during  November increased 1.8-fold over October levels; the increase  was 23.5-fold on the whole for the 11 months of 1993 as compared  with the same period of last year.    Prices and rates for paid services to the populace rose  23.2-fold in November as compared with November of 1992, and by  37.1 percent as compared with October of 1993. The maximum  increase in prices was observed in Turkmenistan (32-fold and by  848 percent, respectively) and in Armenia (28.3-fold and by 80.4  percent); the minimum was seen in Uzbekistan (12.7-fold and by  98.5 percent) and Tajikistan (16.8-fold and by 9.9 percent).

While the  trade mass volume, that is, commodity turnover in comparable  prices, was 5 percent lower than in January-November of the  previous year, and 37 percent lower than the 1991 level.    Stocks of consumer goods on hand as of 1 December 1993 in  the  organized trade network of countries of the Commonwealth could  support trade over the course of 45 days, just as was the case  as of the same date the previous year. In this regard, the  supply of stocks in the trade network of Armenia decreased  almost by a factor of 3 (from 53 days as of 1 December last year  to 18 days), as well as in Tajikistan (from 83 days to 30 days).  In Moldova, trade was supported by a 23-day supply; as of the  same date in 1992--by a 39-day supply. A drop of 8-13 percent  was observed in product supplies available to support the trade  network in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. Stores on hand  throughout Russia comprised a 46-day supply on the average, as  opposed to a 43-day supply as of 1 December 1992.

In actual prices and rates it was 10.6 times greater, more  than 90 percent of the volume of services being attributable to  increased prices and rates for individual services. As a result  of the sharp increases in cost of paid services, a significant  reduction was seen in their demand by the population. Visits by  citizens to enterprises engaged in providing everyday services  decreased, and the reduction in numbers of such enterprises was  quite noticeable. Some 39 percent fewer services (in comparable  prices) on average throughout the Commonwealth were performed  for the populace in November than in November 1992. On the whole  over the 11 months, the reduction amounted to 29 percent as  compared with the same period of 1992.  <H5>  Crime </H5>   Data concerning the number of registered crimes in states of  the Commonwealth are provided as follows:                     January-November     January-November     January-November                   1992                 1993                 1993 as compared                                                             to                                                             January-November                                                             1992, percent   Azerbaijan       19,843               16,110               81.2   Armenia          14,416               11,974               83.1   Belarus          85,554               91,454               106.9   Georgia          20,965               18,132[.sup]1[/]      86.5   Kazakhstan       180,937              191,794              106.0   Kyrgyzstan       39,318               38,226               97.2   Moldova          41,916[.sup]2[/]      42,912               102.4   Russia           2,484,117            2,512,540            101.0   Tajikistan       22,623               22,179               98.0   Turkmenistan     16,418               14,385               87.6   Uzbekistan       84,721               82,825               97.8   Ukraine          431,508              478,633              110.9   Total for the    3,442,336            3,521,164            102.3  Commonwealth   [.sup]1[/] For officially registered administrative-territorial entities   [.sup]2[/] Does not include data for the city of Bendera      A slackening of the rate of growth of registered crimes was  observed on the whole across states of the Commonwealth in  January-November 1993.

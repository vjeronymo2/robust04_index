			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Top Spanish bank faces break-up as board is dismissed The Bank of Spain yesterday dismissed the board of Banco Espanol de Credito, the country's fourth-largest bank, raising the possibility that Banesto might be broken up and its industrial empire shared among the rest of Spain's big banks. The central bank acted after market rumours of Banesto's imminent failure sent its stock into free fall yesterday morning and started a run on deposits in Madrid. Trading in the stock was suspended at midday, with the price having fallen about 7 per cent to Pta2,135 (Pounds 10.46). Mr Alfredo Saenz, deputy chairman of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, was named by the Bank of Spain as Banesto's new chairman in place of Mr Mario Conde, the former industrialist who took charge of Banesto in 1987. Mr Conde has tried to persuade the authorities that Banesto, the most vulnerable of Spain's large banks, could survive on its own. Mr Saenz and four other directors - one each from Banco Central Hispano, Banco Santander, Argentaria, the state-owned banking group, and Banco Popular - took charge of Banesto late yesterday afternoon. The threatened failure of Banesto and the removal of Mr Conde will be a bitter blow to JP Morgan, the US investment bank, and its deputy chairman, Mr Roberto Mendoza, who was recently named to the now dismissed Banesto board. Banesto was the first investment of the Dollars 1bn Corsair banking fund created by JP Morgan. Corsair owns nearly 9 per cent of Banesto. JP Morgan also acted as an adviser this year to Banesto during the raising of nearly Dollars 700m in new capital. Yesterday, the US bank said Corsair planned to maintain its position. Mr Alfredo Pastor, the deputy economy minister, said a Bank of Spain inspection at Banesto had found a much larger equity deficit than anticipated. The results of this inspection had been studied by Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, and senior staff just two weeks ago. Urgent talks had taken place with Banesto about ways to shore up its finances. Mr Pastor said no decision had been made about Banesto's future. 'The intervention today is the end of a long process,' he said. An inspection in 1992 had detected gaps in Banesto's finances but the central bank and Mr Conde had agreed upon a timetable to raise new equity and to rebalance the bank's loan portfolio. But, Mr Pastor said, 'the situation in 1993 has worsened' even though Banesto raised more than Dollars 1bn in capital through share sales and disposals. A central bank statement said: 'Banesto's current situation obliges it to take restructuring measures that cannot be undertaken alone and which require the support of the whole banking system.' It said it had acted in order to guarantee the liquidity of Banesto. It had been assumed that the money raised with JP Morgan's help this year, plus the proceeds of the sale of a banking subsidiary to Deutsche Bank, had raised Banesto's equity levels above ratios demanded by Spanish and European authorities. The Banesto group reported losses of Pta5.7bn (Pounds 27.9m) for the first nine months of 1993. Banesto: walking on a razor's edge, Page 15</p>

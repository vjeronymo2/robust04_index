			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "There Are Disputes Going On </F> Regarding Exports of the Tamara System"]    [Excerpts] Prague--Despite the various disputes regarding  the details of the operational results of the Tamara radar that  are going on, the world is interested in this system that is  capable of monitoring all types of aircraft. The Defense  Ministries interested in buying the system include those of  India, China, Iran, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.    Nevertheless, some military officials are skeptical about  the  export of this top-ranking product. It is rumored in military  circles that the United States is interested in the  nonproliferation of this equipment because, as one of a very few  systems, it has the capability of detecting the "invisible" U.S.  Stealth reconnaissance aircraft. If Iraq, for instance, owned  Tamara, the billions spent on the development of Stealth would  be wasted. [passage omitted]    Tamara is an original Czech discovery that was 35 years in  the works. It is a system that, as opposed to other radars,  which emit radio waves and evaluate their reflection, only  receives radio impulses. Regarding the usage, it neither  competes with nor replaces radar but, rather, adds to the radar  information such important data as recognition of the type of  aircraft or ship, and facilitates the verification of the flight  or navigation route by an alternative physical method. [passage  omitted]  <H5>  Its Predecessor Was Ramona </H5>   At the end of the 1950's, a new, original method was  discovered at the research institute of the then Czechoslovak  Army that facilitated an immediate, unequivocal, and extremely  precise determination of the location of electrical signal  transmitters. The method is based on the so-called  time-hyperbolic [casove hyperbolicky] principle.    The discovery did not remain just theory but was very  rapidly  applied. Already in the early 1960's, the Czechoslovak Army had  at its disposal the precise PRP-1 Kopac [digger] radiotechnical  finder; in the 1970's, the second generation of this technology  under the name Ramona; and, in the 1980's, the third generation,  called "Tamara."    Tamara is a passive radiotechnical system that provides an  immediate survey of the activity of ground, water surface, and  aerial sources of radiotechnical signals to a distance of 100  km, determines their precise location, and is able to  concurrently follow the routes and recognize dozens of types of  aircraft or ships of practically all known categories.    Experts claim that, if the Tamara system were used, such  tragedies as the downing of the KAL-007 airliner by a Soviet  Su-15 fighter jet over Sakhalin in the night hours in September  1983, or the downing of the Iranian transport Airbus-300  aircraft by a U.S. Navy missile (from the Vincennes cruiser) in  July 1987 over the Strait of Hormuz would not have taken place.  Both instances were allegedly caused by errors. In the former  case, the aircraft was confused with the U.S. F-16  reconnaissance aircraft. One can safely assume that, in either  case, there was no technical system available with the  capability to recognize the types of aircraft with the  determination precision needed.    More than 50 Ramona and Tamara systems have been produced in  Czechoslovakia. The vast majority were exported to the then  USSR, and one to the former GDR.</p>

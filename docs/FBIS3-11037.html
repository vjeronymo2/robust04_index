As part of a visit to Cuba of an Argentine delegation from  La  Plata, an agreement was signed in Havana to declare Havana Vieja  and La Plata twin sisters. The agreement was signed by Raul  Joaquin Perez, chairman of the La Plata Town Council, and  (Miguel Angel Brown), president of the Assembly of the People's  Government in Havana Vieja. Both parties recognize the  friendship ties between the two towns and promise to actively  cooperate in the areas of tourism, preservation of their  historical heritage, health, sports, and culture.    [Begin Perez recording] They have given us a great deal of  material, including the laws that are in effect in Havana, the  tax system prevailing in Havana, the coparticipation framework  among companies, and others. Well, speaking of Cuba is speaking  of tremendous development in the textile industry, for instance;  and of course we know that, because of the special period, some  important factories with qualified personnel have been closed.  We believe that we also have a propitious field in this area  because our city has a petrochemical industry that produces such  raw materials as threads. [end recording]    La Plata is a town of 900 square km, with some 600,000  inhabitants. Its economy is based on fruit, vegetable, and  flower production, in addition to an important petrochemical  plant and several large- and medium-sized industries.</p>

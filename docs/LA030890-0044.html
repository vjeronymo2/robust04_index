			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO WILL MEET NORTH'S TOP SEED IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> El Camino College's spectacular road show will play at UC Irvine this afternoon  when the state's Final Eight Junior College Basketball Tournament gets under  way.  </P> <P> The road has been kind to the Warriors, who have a three-game playoff winning  streak against higher-ranked teams.  </P> <P> Today at 5 p.m., El Camino, seeded fourth in the South, will meet West Valley  of Saratoga, the North's top seed, at the Bren Event Center on the Irvine  campus.  </P> <P> West Valley is a good shooting team that runs well and plays a tough zone  defense. The Vikings won the Golden Gate Conference title and hold an  impressive 29-2 record. They are led by all-conference guard Craig Holt, who  signed with Loyola Marymount University earlier this season, and 6-foot-7  forward Brian Killian, a solid outside shooter.  </P> <P> El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin said his team is ready to face the Vikings, who  defeated Sacramento and Columbia en route to this weekend's tournament.  </P> <P> After all, the Warriors had to overcome long odds just to get to the final  eight. El Camino (23-10) was seeded 23rd in the South Regional playoffs before  upsetting No. 10 Santa Monica, No. 7 L.A. City College and finally No. 2  Cypress on Saturday.  </P> <P> "Everyone is ready to go," McClurkin said Tuesday. "We had a great practice  yesterday, and we're very hyped up. No one has let down. We're still very  intense."  </P> <P> That's been the case with El Camino's offense through the playoffs. At least  four players have scored in double figures in every game. Sophomore Larry  Lockley leads the team with an 18.6-point average in the playoffs. The  all-conference guard scored 23 points in El Camino's 80-71 win over Cypress and  21 against Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Sophomore forwards David Keeter and Steve Leary have each averaged 14 points a  game in the playoffs. Both had their best post-season performances against L.A.  City. Keeter (6-5, 185 pounds) had 23 points, and Leary ((6-8, 200) had 17.  </P> <P> "They've capped off the season with a trip to Irvine," McClurkin said of his  players, "and now they want to cap off the trip to Irvine with a championship."  </P> <P> If the Warriors get past West Valley, they'll face the winner of tonight's  Rancho Santiago-American River game Friday at 8 p.m. Rancho (29-3) is the  South's second-seeded team, and American River (24-12) is seeded third in the  North.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Help From China"] </F>   [Text] China's success in the United Nations in connection  with North Korea is a severe setback for the authority of U.S.  diplomacy and the credibility of the United Nations itself:  Beijing prevented a UN Security Council request to the address  of Pyongyang to open all its declared nuclear technology  facilities to international inspectors. The council had to  content itself with a mere "appeal to all parties involved" to  comply with their international obligations. Thus, any  one-sidedness toward North Korea was avoided, the only "party  involved" in the controversy that is suspected of noncompliance  with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The UN secretary  general, the U.S. secretary of state, the Japanese prime  minister, and the South Korean president were told in Beijing  that pressure on North Korea would only be "counterproductive."    Russia agrees with China on this issue. Thus, China has  backing for the political protection of North Korea in its  conflict with the United States. North Korea is not isolated,  which is what Washington and West Europe had hoped, but U.S.  policy has been blocked in the same way as the United Nations  itself. West Europe and Japan are neutralized in this  constellation, France and Britain, the two West European veto  and nuclear powers in the Security Council, have been  outmaneuvered.    If the United States, whose Defense Secretary Perry only  recently stated that his country would even "wage a war" to  prevent North Korean nuclear arms, is unable to enforce  compliance with this treaty, North Korea will remain free to  build nuclear bombs. It will even be able to pass them on to  other countries, particularly the Middle East, thus receiving  valuable foreign currency and initiating proliferation. In view  of the hesitant and wavering U.S. policy, China and Russia, both  of which are not interested in a nuclear buildup in North Korea,  will take over mediating efforts in Asia, thus getting closer to  their parallel objectives -- namely to force back Western  influence.</p>

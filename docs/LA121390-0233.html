			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LAPD OKS RANDOM DRUG TESTING  </P> <P> Rank-and-file members of the Los Angeles Police Department -- the nation's  third-largest police force -- have agreed to undergo random drug testing  beginning next year, Mayor Tom Bradley announced today.  </P> <P> The agreement, hammered out between the officers' union, department management  and the mayor's office, represents the first time a major city police force has  voluntarily agreed to submit to drug testing.  </P> <P> "The integrity of the entire police department depends on everyone, from a  rookie officer to a 30-year veteran," Bradley said at a City Hall news  conference. "Mandatory random drug testing is a reliable way to make sure that  public trust and security will be maintained at all times."  </P> <P> Bradley had long sought such a program, but it was possible only after the  leadership of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing  about 7,400 of the department's 8,400 officers, agreed.  </P></p>

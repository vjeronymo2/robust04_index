			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to the Chamber </F> of Deputies in Beirut on 21 June--recorded]    [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker, deputies: Since this government  took office, it has been striving together with the honorable  chamber to elevate our country and liberate it from several  restrictions which have manacled it throughout the past years  and made it a captive of several whims, mentalities, struggles,  plots, and secret and non- secret designs. Certainly we have  made great strides in this direction and have realized  achievements that enable us to renew confidence in our future  and to confront the challenges with the hoped-for level of  national solidarity. [passage omitted]    Mr. Speaker, deputies: The delicate phase through which  Lebanon is passing requires the highest degrees of vigilance and  solidarity. We are facing fateful challenges that are first and  foremost connected to liberating our land from the Israeli  occupation and standing on a equal footing with the states  joining us in the race toward the future in the Middle East.  Therefore, I find myself obliged before your honorable chamber  to underline the following points:    1. The liberation of our land from Israeli occupation is not  subject to any kind of diplomatic debate. Therefore, it is not  subject to bargaining with any regional or international body.  Lebanon views the negotiations held in this connection as a  means to achieve its liberation and not as an objective in  itself to be used to cow Lebanon to go along with the Israeli  objectives of controlling our land, water, and resources. In  the past few weeks Lebanon has received several messages through  security, diplomatic, and media avenues. It has been and is  still being subjected to repeated Israeli attacks aimed at  undermine its national strength and jeopardizing its relations  with its big sister Syria. However, Lebanon can only take  stances chosen by the people, stances compatible with its  sovereignty, dignity, and its rights to land and resources.    I must stress here--in the Lebanese Chamber of  Deputies--that  Lebanon will not submit to Israeli pressures, regardless of  their intensity. It reserves the right to use all means to  liberate its land and impose its legitimate authority over all  its territory. The Lebanese Government has shouldered its  national responsibility in protecting Lebanon's principles on  the issue of liberation. It reemphasizes today its rejection of  any approach intended to make the Lebanese state a policeman for  Israeli occupation, nor will we allow Israel to shrug off its  responsibility for the occupation by clashing with the  resistance, which is the natural outcome of the continuation of  the occupation. All Lebanese have behaved with complete  vigilance and responsibility regarding their right to resist the  Israeli occupation, because this resistance is an inseparable  part of the Lebanese national interest and results from the  Lebanese consensus to end the occupation and safeguard our  sovereignty. In any circumstance, the government can only be in  a position to defend this interest and affirm this consensus.    The Lebanese state is not a tool in Israel's hands.  Accordingly, it rejects any offers that aim to use it as a  weapon used against its people. Resistance is not a target to  be aimed at, but a right embodying the genuineness of the  Lebanese people and their love of their land. We uphold our  right to liberate our land. We uphold our right to resist the  occupation. We uphold our right to restore our sovereignty and  freedom on all our national soil. We will not be deflected from  this course by pressures, messages, or warnings. Nor will we be  deflected by the straying of some Arabs from the circle of Arab  solidarity, or by others resorting to separate solutions.    The Lebanese Government will not depart from the line it has  chosen toward the Arab brothers, even if some of them depart  from it. Together with sister Syria, it will continue to  negotiate when negotiations are a way to end the occupation, and  to boycott when boycotts are in the national interest and are  our duty. It is futile to call for us to return to peace under  the threat of the sword's edge; it will crush peace, not achieve  it. Therefore, we warn against the possibility of the failure  of peace under the blows of Israel and its maneuvers. We  address our warning to all those concerned with the issue of  peace and who believe in the need for a just and comprehensive  solution to the region's crisis.    2. The external dangers resulting from the continuation of  Israeli occupation and attacks places on all of us--government,  chamber, and people--the responsibility to stand in solidarity  in the face of these dangers and not give those who would  trample our security and sovereignty a chance to achieve their  aims of dividing the domestic front.    Lebanon is facing the new regional storm by cooperating and  coordinating with sister Syria and with its leadership, which  has shown extraordinary courage in confronting crucial issues;  it has displayed a responsible attitude toward Arab issues in  general and toward Lebanon and its struggle for national peace  in particular. Syria's support for us and its pan-Arab  commitments to Lebanon and its people do not absolve us from our  responsibility to our homeland and must not become a reason for  weakening this responsibility.    Therefore, the Government wishes to reaffirm some principles  that were mentioned in its last statement to this honorable  chamber. These principles deal with the need to elevate  political life to the level of civil peace and national detente.  This is a very difficult task in a country which has suffered  so long from chaos and sectarian and religious strife. Lebanon  is trying to perform political miracles and to introduce the  necessary legislation to emerge from the vestiges of that stage.  [passage omitted]    3. The issue of media freedom is not the subject of a  political argument, nor it is the subject of deep differences  among the Lebanese or between the Government and any political  party in Lebanon. The Government does not dispute the principle  of this freedom at all. It does not allow itself to contest the  issue of freedoms and their limits. However, it is natural for  the Government to work to protect media freedom with a legal  cover that will safeguard it and define the rules of the game.  Before this Government, several governments tried to create an  objective and responsible framework for the broadcast media. It  was natural for all the debates and dialogues which accompanied  these attempts to disagree on some points and agree on other  points. It was not possible for the experiment to ripen  quickly. Months passed before our Government settled this issue  once and for all yesterday when it approved a broadcast media  law which we hope your honorable chamber will discuss in a  democratic and positive way.    The broadcast media bill approved yesterday is the first of  its kind in Lebanon's legislative history and perhaps the first  of its kind in the Arab world. As much as we wanted it to  express the genuine relationship between freedom and Lebanon, we  also wanted it to truly express the strong relationship between  freedom and the law. [passage omitted]    4. The process of national reconstruction, which has  proceeded along two parallel lines--completing the return of the  refugees and restoring public services--will continue to be  sponsored by the Government until it achieves its desired  objectives as set down in the declared plans. We have given the  issue of returning the refugees priority for our Government.  The Ministry of Refugee Affairs has been able to take  impressive steps both on returning lands and properties and  paying compensations and in the area of promoting reconciliation  among the inhabitants and enabling thousands of Lebanese  citizens to return to their places of birth and residence.  [passage omitted]    In the name of the Government, allow me to commend here in  the honorable Chamber of Deputies the extraordinary effort made  by His Excellency the Minister of Refugee Affairs Walid Junblatt  and to put on record his responsible personal and public stand  in protecting progress of the return and pushing it several  steps forward, especially in the mountain area, which these days  is witnessing blessed measures taken by the Lebanese army in  Upper al-Matn, 'Alayh, and Al-Shuf. We hope that these measures  will bear fruit in the coming months and will consolidate the  march of national cohesion among all Lebanese in general and  among the inhabitants of the mountains in particular.    Parallel to this, the government has mobilized its moral and  material resources in the south and in the western al-Biqa'. It  has earmarked the necessary funds to face the consequences of  the Israeli attacks and to pay compensations to property owners  and farmers who are targets of daily shelling.

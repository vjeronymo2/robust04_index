			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: Kodo Drummers - Concert There was always a nadir during the rock concerts of the 1970s known as the drummer's solo. It was totally unavoidable and totally boring; around 15 minutes of thrashing and flailing which ended with the drummer throwing his sticks at the audience and pouring a bottle of water over his head. The Kodo Drummers perform for around two hours and fifteen minutes, and pose a different problem. Their drumming is unmatchable; you appreciate the subtlety and imagination that drives each item. You readily believe that such precision and commitment can only be attained after a routine of training which makes SAS manouevres seem like a cake walk. But for some people the drum is not the most melodic of instruments; not the most lyrical. It stirs the blood rather than the soul. After the first Kodo number, when the 12 drummers build up a wall of sound that makes your thighs resonate and your ear drums ache, you doubt the pleasure principle. Wisely the troupe knows the weakly western constitution and intersperses the drumming with delicate solos and duets on traditional Japanese instruments which tend to confirm that folk music throughout the world is inevitably wistful and melancholic. But it is for the drummer boys that the audience whoops and cheers, especially when the pressure of work strips them down to loin cloths. Like virtually all Japanese art forms these drummers from the island of Sado are totally outside European experience and reference. The dedication, the training, the physical perfection beat out as loudly as the drums - or as softly, as they manipulate the skins with masterful control. It is hardly music; more a primitive romance with rhythm. Often they pose like young Samurai, treating their drums as worthy opponents. You wait for the biggest drum, the 800 pounder, to be brought out, before which the drummers undress and lie down, and then raise sticks as large as baseball clubs to pound it to death. Some of the asceticism has worn away from the drummers during their interminable international tour. Their faces are less inscrutable; more baleful; almost self-satisfied. This is spectacle, entertainment, which must greatly delight anyone interested in drumming techniques but cause many British people to sit in respectful boredom. Sadler's Wells until May 15. 071 278 8916</p>

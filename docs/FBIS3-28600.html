In response to Prime Minister  Hosokawa's strong intention to set 1994 as a starting year for  the administrative reform, the guideline stresses, among other  things, the need for the government to steadily promote  deregulation. The guideline is composed of eight points,  including the promotion of decentralization, the promotion of  public disclosure of administrative information, and the  streamlining of administrative procedures. As for deregulation,  the guideline calls for the need to review 1,450 licenses and  approvals (800 subject to removal and 650 subject to relaxation)  and explicitly indicates the need to amend 60 laws to that end.  The guideline calls on the government to submit about 50  amendments to the Diet during its current session and quickly  draw up concrete plans for deregulation.    The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by  Prime Minister Hosokawa) will formally decide on the guideline  as part of a new package of stimulus measures on which the  government plans to decide on 3 February.    The government intends to make a thorough review of  deregulation in line with a final report compiled by the  Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa Committee). The  government is examining ways to draw up a "five-year plan for  the promotion of deregulation" in 1994 and to incorporate a  clause in the law that if a regulation is put into effect, it  shall be reviewed after a certain period.    On decentralization, the guideline calls on the government  to  review the current share of administrative functions between the  central and local governments, promote the transfer of  administrative authority from the central government to local  governments, and promote the ban or relaxation of the central  government's intervention in local government affairs. The  guideline also calls on the government to set a "guideline for  changing the current administrative relationship between the  central and local governments" on the premise that the  government tries to have the Diet legislate a basic law on the  promotion of decentralization.    As for the public disclosure of administrative information,  the guideline calls on the Administrative Reform Committee to  make a full-fledged study of systems involving the public  disclosure of administrative information, while calling on the  government to look for a way to smoothly enforce laws concerning  administrative procedures.</p>

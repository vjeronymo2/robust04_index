			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and </F> German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel: "Welcome to Our Eastern  Cousins"]    [Text] In the past, some used to say "Germany" when they  meant West Germany. Many still say "Europe" when they mean West  Europe. But Europe does not stop at the Oder-Neisse. Who can  fail to recognise that Warsaw or Riga, Budapest, Prague or  Ljubljana are European cities? The task of the Nineties, for  Britain and Germany, is to make a political reality of that  cultural reality.    Had the Iron Curtain not divided Europe after 1945, none of  the founders of European integration would have ever thought of  excluding countries such as Czechoslovakia or Poland. We must  project security and stability from our part of Europe to other  European countries in the East. Eventually, they should  participate fully in all European institutions -- in particular  the European Union [EU] and NATO.    At its last summit in January 1994, NATO declared that it  was  open to new members. The European Community summit in  Copenhagen confirmed the prospect of membership for those  countries which have concluded Europe Agreements.    There are three fundamental reasons why we should consider  enlarging the EU and NATO: security, prosperity and shared  values.    We shall not be secure if uncertainty and anxiety reign just  beyond our borders. Stability in central Europe enhances our  own stability.    The basis of our prosperity is the open world trading  system.  We have now, on our doorstep, dynamic economies with highly  skilled labour, rich in ideas and full of entrepreneurial  vigour. The fastest growing stock market in the world last year  was not in Shanghai or Canton: it was in Warsaw.    We and our trading partners to the East are already  benefiting from this. EC exports to central Europe increased by  87 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and now stand at around US$11  billion. The central Europeans themselves sell half of their  exports in the EC. The Europe Agreements stipulate free trade by  the end of 1995 -- with a few exceptions such as agriculture.    But more remains to be done. Too often the EC reserves its  greatest trade restrictions for precisely those goods that the  central Europeans produce most efficiently.    We have to face new competition. Closer ties with the  economies in central Europe will mean more structural adjustment  for us. But those structural changes will open the way for  enormous overall increases in wealth -- for us and for our  partners.    Last, but not least, culture. Our Eastern neighbours belong  to Europe, not just as a matter of geography or economics; there  is a common culture. We have to increase the exchange of ideas  -- particularly in the humanities and the social sciences.    A sober assessment of our interests shows that they all  point  in the direction of enlarging the EU and NATO. That cannot  happen overnight. Guarantees that exist only on paper do not  contribute to security. Security guarantees must grow out of a  sense of shared values, common interests and a common destiny.    Enlarging NATO is a decision for the Alliance as a whole-not  just for Britain and Germany. All its members, above all the  United States which continues to do so much to maintain European  security, must give their wholehearted consent.    The Western EU is developing its role as the European pillar  of NATO and as the defence component of the EU. Britain and  Germany are working together with others to involve the central  Europeans and the Baltic states in the work of the WEU [Western  European Union].    New members must be capable of implementing EU law. That  presupposes a competent administration and a proper system of  justice. They must be capable of competing in the Single  Market. On our side, too, there will have to be changes. EU  institutions and EU policies will have to adapt to a wider  community -- a community of 20 or more members. We must ensure  that at every stage a wider community becomes a stronger one.  Both for the EU and NATO, widening must not mean weakening.    Those are goals for the medium-term. In 1994, we must open  ourselves to our neighbours in as many ways as possible. The  forthcoming German EU presidency will spare no efforts to draw  our Eastern neighbours closer.    But in all this, the transatlantic relationship remains a  fixed anchor point for the EU. Without a continuing stake by  the United States in European affairs, enlargement of the EU and  NATO cannot succeed.    The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe also  has a vital role. It is the only institution embracing all 53  European and North American states. Through the CSCE we can  assure that developments in West and Central Europe are not  misinterpreted by our Eastern partners.    To enlarge the Alliance in a way that made those inside it  more secure but left those outside feeling threatened would be  no service to Europe. That means that other countries must be  convinced that this is a development in which they are not  ignored.    No country is an island, whatever its geography. We have a  duty to our European neighbours. They had to live under imposed  isolation from West Europe. They are now returning to freedom  and to the rule of the law. This is a historic task. Britain  and Germany have committed themselves to this goal for the rest  of the century.</p>

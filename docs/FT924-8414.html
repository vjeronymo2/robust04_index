			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: Boom and bust policy, not workers, to blame for crisis Sir, Your editorial ('CBI obfuscation', November 10) ignores the scale of Britain's economic crisis and the damage it has inflicted on the motor industry. Instead of identifying that the market for cars has been entirely undermined by boom and bust economic policy, you lay the blame on industry and trade unions. The fact is that demand has plummeted in the last two years, reflected in the fall in car sales to a 10-year low. The two excellent pay increases mentioned for Ford workers in recent years were a direct result of the achievements of those employees in the 1980s. Ford plants in Britain are now most efficient, with lower unit costs than any comparative European plant. Should these productivity gains not be rewarded? Trade unions are not in the business of martyring their membership as and when government policy fails, but of defending and improving living standards of working people. Car workers, supported by their trade unions, refuse to shoulder the burden of government economic mismanagement. Jimmy Airlie, secretary, Ford national negotiating committee, Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, 110 Peckham Road, London SE15 5EL</p>

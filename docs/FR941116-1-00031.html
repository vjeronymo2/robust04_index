			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A_General Program Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 60.2&blank;HEAL Default Rate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is proposing to add a new section to the HEAL regulations which would address the HEAL default rate. Paragraph (a) of this section, ``Default rate formula,'' would explain that the default rate of each school, lender, and holder is calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in section 719(5) of the Act, except that for lenders and holders, loans made to students at HBCUs prior to the end of the first 3 years that the lender/holder performance standard is in effect would be excluded from the default rate calculation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach for calculating lender and holder default rates is consistent with the statutory school performance standard set forth in section 708 of the HEAL stature. Section 708(d)(3) provides HBCUs with a 3-year period during which they remain eligible for participation in the HEAL program regardless of their default rates. In granting HBCUs a 3-year reprieve from termination due to high default rates, the Congress indicated concern that the performance standard provision not cause these schools to lose access to HEAL funding during the initial years of its implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing this proposed rule, the Department was concerned that lenders and holders, in an effort to maintain low default rates, might choose not to make or purchase loans for students at HBCUs, which historically have higher than average default rates. To assure that the lender/holder performance standard provisions do not unwittingly undermine the Congress' expressed desire that access to HEAL loans be maintained for HBCUs, the proposed rule exempts any loans made to students at HBCUs prior to the end of the first 3 years that the standard is in effect from being included when lender/holder default rates are calculated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of this section would establish the effective dates of the default rate calculations, for purposes of determining risk-based insurance premiums and program eligibility. The Department is proposing in this paragraph that default rates be calculated as of September 30 of each year, and that these rates be used to determine risk-based insurance premiums and program eligibility, for purposes of loans made or purchased on or after July 1 of the following year. These timeframes are designed to provide adequate time for schools, lenders, and holders to pay off defaulted loans, if desired, in order to reduce their risk category or maintain eligibility, and to plan for the costs associated with continued HEAL activity if their default rates are greater than 5 percent. The Department developed this provision in response to concerns that the initial implementation of the school risk-based premiums on January 1, 1993, did not provide adequate time for schools with default rates greater than 5 percent to evaluate their options regarding the pay off of defaulted loans and to prepare for the costs of continued participation in the HEAL program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of this section would set forth the procedures for schools, lenders, and holders to follow if they want to pay off defaulted HEAL loans to reduce their risk category or maintain eligibility. This proposal would require that if a school, lender, or holder chooses to pay off one or more HEAL loans, it must, for each borrower it chooses, pay off the outstanding principal and interest of all HEAL loans held by the Department for that borrower. This proposal is designed to prevent the confusion that is likely to arise during the collection process if a borrower's HEAL portfolio were divided, with a portion sold to the purchasing entity and a portion remaining with the Department. The proposal also would clarify that any defaulted HEAL loans paid off by a school, lender, or holder are assigned to that entity and may be collected by that entity using any collection methods available to it. Finally, this provision would require that a payoff be completed by May 31 in order to reduce the school, lender, or holder's default rate that would be used to determine the risk category (or program eligibility) for loans made or purchased on or after July 1 of the same year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

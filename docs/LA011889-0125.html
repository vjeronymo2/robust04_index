			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOSHIBA EXECUTIVE RESIGNS TO LEAD SEIKO UNIT;  </P> <P> REHFELD JOINS SHORT LIST OF AMERICANS RUNNING U.S. ARM OF A JAPANESE FIRM  </P> <P> John Rehfeld has resigned as vice president and general manager of Toshiba  America's Information Systems Division in Irvine to head operations of Seiko  Instruments USA Inc., it was announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> As president, chief operating officer and a board member of Seiko Instruments  USA in Torrance, Rehfeld will become one of a small group of Americans to head  the U.S. operations of a large Japanese firm. Seiko Instruments USA is a  subsidiary of Seiko Instruments Inc. in Japan.  </P> <P> Rehfeld said he is joining Seiko effective Feb. 10 because it is a good career  opportunity.  </P> <P> "Organizationally, I've moved from being a division general manager to being  president of a company with seven operating divisions," Rehfeld said.  "Essentially, I'm doing the job my boss was doing at Toshiba."  </P> <P> Seiko Instruments USA employs about 300 people and had 1988 sales of $130  million.  </P> <P> Rehfeld said his move to Seiko signals an expanding role in the company for  U.S. executives, and added, "We'll do everything we can to attract and retain  the best American management."  </P> <P> Rehfeld is credited with steering Toshiba into a dominant position in the  fast-growing market for so-called laptop computers -- small, lightweight  machines that are easily carried by executives, salespeople and journalists.  </P> <P> The Seiko subsidiary hopes to broaden its product line in the area of consumer  electronics, as well as high-resolution graphics and high-resolution computer  printers, Rehfeld said.  </P> <P> Seiko Instrument USA's current president, Hiroshi Fukino, will become chairman  of the board and chief executive officer of the subsidiary. Reinosuke Hara,  current chairman of the board, is stepping down from that post but will  continue as president of Seiko Instruments Inc. in Japan.  </P> <P> At Toshiba America's Information Systems Division, Mark Tanaka, assistant  general manager for personal computers, will immediately assume the position of  interim general manager of the division, company officials said.  </P> <P> The Information Systems Division employs about 450 people and expects sales for  fiscal 1988 ending March 31 to total about $450 million from the manufacture of  personal computers and printers. It is a unit of Japanese electronics giant  Toshiba Corp.  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Setback prompts review of bank sales Israel is reviewing how best to continue with the sale of the country's leading banks after the privatisation drive suffered a setback recently on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. One option being considered by the finance ministry is the sale of a controlling stake of 20 per cent in Bank Leumi by tender, before any more shares are sold in Tel Aviv or New York. The offering values the bank at around Shk5bn (Dollars 1.7bn). A public offering of 10 per cent of shares in Bank Leumi was cancelled last month after an issue of 10 per cent of Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank, flopped. In September an issue of 10 per cent of Bank Leumi was heavily over-subscribed. Mr Gil Leidner, managing director of MI Holdings, the government organisation overseeing the sale of bank shares, said yesterday that selling a controlling interest in Bank Leumi by tender was one of many options, and a final decision would be taken in two to three weeks. 'At the moment everything is speculation,' he said. Bankers, however, said the government was being forced to consider other options for the sale of Bank Leumi. They said an early sale by tender was a possibility, as a share issue in New York would be complicated and could be harmed by negative political developments. Meanwhile, the central bank is reviewing the financial records of four groups interested in a controlling share of United Mizrahi Bank (UMB), the country's fifth largest banking group, before issuing the contenders a licence to qualify for the tender. The government plans to sell a block of between 25.1 per cent and 51 per cent of the issued share capital of UMB, which last year posted net profit of Shk115m. The central bank is expected to complete its review within six weeks, and the bidding for UMB would start in April or May next year.</p>

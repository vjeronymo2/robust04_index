			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: US events give food for thought THERE HAS been a certain amount of scepticism in the UK that long-dated gilt yields - already at post-war lows - have much further to fall. But events in the US on Friday may have given the sceptics food for thought. The publication of exceptionally poor unemployment figures sent long-bond yields to historically low levels. As Treasury dealers mulled the growing belief that a hesitant recovery means inflation will be held at bay, yields sank to below 6 per cent. Although there is no guarantee that the UK recovery will mirror that of the US indefinitely, there has been a fairly strong correlation so far. The implication for gilts dealers of Friday's news is that in a year from now, the UK recovery will be as cautious and non-inflationary as the US pick-up is proving to be, some two years into its recovery. Such news has to be good for gilts. But a glance at the latest round-up of City forecasts shows that analysts are far from agreed on the future course of inflation. Forecasts for growth in the retail prices index for 1994 currently range from 2.5 per cent to as high as 6.5 per cent. The UK government bond market appeared to enter a consolidation phase last week, with prices little changed on the week. However, given lingering concerns about the future course of inflation based on the short-track record of recent improvements, the big question for dealers is where will the market head next. Have long yields dropped as far as they can, or do they, as in the US, have further to go? On Friday, yields were virtually unchanged on the week, in spite of a fairly busy week's trading. The yield on the 7 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1998 was 6.31 per cent, compared with 6.30 per cent on the previous Friday's close. Further out, the 15-year 9 per cent bond yield closed at 7.22 per cent compared with 7.24 per cent a week earlier. The yield on the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing 2017 was virtually unchanged at 7.22 per cent. Although the spread of forecasts for inflation is wide, most economists do not expect the RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments, to breach the upper limit of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range in 1994. Even those who were pessimistic at the beginning of the year are revising their forecasts downwards. 'Earlier this year we were gloomier about inflation than we are now,' said Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel. 'But the rebound that we were expecting from food retailers did not happen and service sector inflation has also come down sharply.' Analysts also appear to be drawing comfort from the very apparent commitment of Mr Eddie George, the new governor of the Bank of England, to holding down inflation. Last week, Mr George told the Securities and Investment Review that it was unacceptable to accept even a little bit of inflation. 'The danger is that it accelerates in an uncontrollable way to become quite a lot of inflation,' he said. There are even suggestions that the UK's notorious attachment to inflation is being broken at a more fundamental level. 'While the current low level of inflation is largely a consequence of the recession, a low inflation psychology is developing in the UK and a policy framework now exists to manage it. So a low inflation recovery is possible,' says Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities. Brave words indeed. If so, gilts may yet go on to perform as well as their US counterparts. However, even those who are most bullish about prospects for inflation would perhaps like to see just a little bit more evidence that it has been stifled before another rally in gilts can take off. Money supply figures from the Bank of England on Friday showed that overseas enthusiasm for gilts has been going from strength to strength. The Bank sold a record Pounds 1.9bn of gilts to foreign investors in July, following sales of Pounds 1.1bn in June. The record July sales came in a month that saw yields drop by 75 basis points. The August M0 figure contained little to worry the gilts market. Narrow money grew by 5.2 per cent in the year August, which was slightly lower than expectations of 5.4 per cent. The figure, which pointed to a steady recovery in consumer spending, was anyway inflated by a big increase in the annual rate of bankers operational deposits, which comprises a small part of M0. These are more influenced by conditions in the money markets than by economic activity.</p>

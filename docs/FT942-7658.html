			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Russia to explain defence doctrine to Nato Nato defence ministers will today hear out the co-operation ideas of General Pavel Grachev, their Russian counterpart, amid charges from a prestigious think-tank that the alliance is mistakenly appearing to pander to Moscow. The general will lay out Russia's military doctrine, which has been published only in part, and explain Moscow's terms for a more elaborate form of co-operation than the Nato-designed Partnership for Peace programme. Nato has made clear that whatever other arrangements it makes with Moscow, Russia must sign the same basic documents as the 18 countries which already adhere to the PFP. However, Moscow has baulked at the idea of being treated in the same way as its former 'satellites' in the Warsaw pact. It remains to be seen whether Moscow's latest formula - a special Russia- Nato protocol either 'within' PFP or in addition to it - provides the basis for a compromise. The International Institute for Strategic Studies alleged yesterday that Nato had already made mistakes in its treatment of its erstwhile adversaries. In its annual strategic survey, the think-tank said Nato had clumsily given the impression that its refusal to grant early entry to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic had been motivated by reluctance to upset Russia. 'It was one thing to agree that Russia . . . should have its views considered. It was another to make it appear that the west feared the strong objections expected from Moscow on this question,' the survey said. 'To let it appear that the Russians exercised a veto over Nato's non-existent desire to take these (central European) countries into the fold was a mistake that should not be made again,' it added. Diplomats expect the strongest pressure for a compromise with Russia at today's meeting to come from Germany, which is keen to find a way of consolidating its ties with both Moscow and its former allies without upsetting either side. Nato officials have discouraged suggestions of a 'special relationship' with Moscow and specifically ruled out the idea of a Russian veto over Nato policy in eastern Europe - although that seems to be exactly what Moscow wants. Mr John Chipman, the IISS director, said Nato was too concerned with shoring up its own institutional prestige as opposed to addressing real problems. An example of this was the argument used in justifying the alliance's air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs: the raids, executed with only partial success, had been presented as 'necessary to preserve the reputation of Nato'. Mr Chipman said that Nato should abandon the 'romantic' notion that it could solve a wide range of security tasks and concentrate instead on the role it could perform: providing a 'cheap, efficient bureaucracy' to manage its members' forces.

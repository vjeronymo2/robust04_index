			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Power prices are 'low on EC scale' UK DOMESTIC electricity prices are at the lower end of the price range in European Community countries, and industrial prices are in the middle, says the Electricity Association, the power industry trade group. The association's annual survey of international electricity costs put UK domestic prices at 9.29p per kilowatt hour. This compares with Belgium at the top of the range with 13p and Greece at the bottom with 7.68p. Other countries with cheaper rates than the UK were Ireland with 8.91p and the Netherlands with 8.28p. UK industrial electricity prices were put in sixth place at 5.29p per kWh, compared with Germany at 7.62p at the high end and Denmark with 4.21p at the low end. On a world scale, the UK was ranked 11th for domestic prices and eighth for industrial. The most expensive country on the domestic scale was Belgium, and on the industrial, Japan. The prices are certain to be challenged by UK industry, which has argued that British prices are much higher than in the large industrial economies on the Continent. International Electricity Prices.

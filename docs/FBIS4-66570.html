			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Letter From FLN to Zeroual: `Government Isolated </F> From Society'"]    [Text] The "letter" that the FLN [National Liberation  Front] was supposed to have handed over to the president of  state--a letter announced with a great deal of publicity--ended  up being forgotten completely. The contents of the document were  made public yesterday. The document states that the letter was  given to Zeroual by the FLN delegation last Saturday. It should  be noted that that meeting between the president of state and  the FLN delegation was not announced by either the office of the  president or Mehri's party.    It is also worth noting that the FLN waited until dialogue  had resumed before announcing its official stands on the overall  situation in the country.    In its letter, the FLN sticks to its stands regarding the  existing institutions, which it still considers to be illegal.  "The government alone, with institutions that are paralyzed or  at a standstill and whose authority is diminishing every day, is  incapable of bringing the country out of this complex situation  because it is isolated from society," the FLN document  emphasizes. A resolute supporter of a rapid return to the  electoral process and the elected institutions, the FLN feels  that it is impossible to "defer the real political solutions  required by that complex situation without exposing the state  and society to collapse and division." The HCE's [Higher State  Council's] management is considered "a failure in every area."  "It is essential to change that policy," the FLN notes in its  letter to Zeroual. The change must take place with the help of  "the country's influential political forces." That is what the  FLN means by its fetish formula "serious and thorough dialogue."  The FLN's letter clearly identifies those forces, although they  are not mentioned explicitly. According to the document  addressed to the chief of state, the FLN Political Bureau feels  that "the parties that emerged during the legislative elections  of 26 December 1991--regardless of any disagreements as to their  results--are now destined to assume special responsibilities."  To put that in clearer terms, it means, according to the FLN's  logic, the three fronts: the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the  FFS [Socialist Forces Front], and the FLN. Mehri's party  occasionally returns to the attack with the proposal that was  made and rejected in the days of the HCE: to call a meeting of  the "major parties"--or what it regards as the major parties.  The FLN considers it "an essential task" to invite those  parties, which it does not name, "to a common meeting that will  be announced to the people." But to salve its conscience, the  FLN also says that "by no means does this mean ignoring other  opinions, marginalizing other political or social forces, or  excluding them from that dialogue." The FLN says it is in favor  of enlarging the dialogue but not diluting it.    The objective of national dialogue, the FLN emphasizes, "is  to reach agreement on solutions likely to bring our country out  of the cycle of violence, ensure serenity in all homes, and  restore to the state its constitutional and legitimate framework  as that derives from the people's choice." The FLN feels that  "the chances for the success of national dialogue still exist,  although they are growing slimmer." Prior conditions must be  met, the FLN says. Among those conditions, the FLN is convinced  of the need to "create an indispensable climate of detente so  that all the political and social forces can go along with it,  support it, and prepare to take responsibility for its results."    In other words, the FLN is asking for nothing less than a  continuation and further development of the so-called  pacification measures that were initiated by the HCE and  expanded--when Zeroual became chief of state--by releasing the  prisoners in the southern camps and the two FIS leaders, among  other things. The idea of calling up reservists to support the  security forces in maintaining order and protecting property and  people from terrorist acts, as mentioned by the minister of  interior, apparently does not appeal to the FLN, which views the  measure as "a serious sign of the persistence of a policy of  confrontation and a new step further involving the ANP [People's  National Army] in a confrontation that prevents it from assuming  its role of arbiter and wise guarantor of the hoped-for  agreement among the parties to dialogue."</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Amstrad incurs its first-ever loss AMSTRAD, the electronics and computer group, suffered a loss for the first time in its history as it was hit by severe price cutting among personal computer makers and recessionary pressures. The group reported a loss before tax of Pounds 15.18m in the six months to the end of December, against a profit of Pounds 40.08m previously. The interim dividend is held at 0.4p. The results were in line with expectations and the shares added 2p to 28p on the news. Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman who also chairs Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club, said Amstrad's balance sheet was strong and it planned to cut costs. As well as recessionary pressures, the group faced severe competition in two big markets which was responsible for the sharp reduction in sales volumes. Overall sales fell 40 per cent to Pounds 196.07m, from Pounds 326.59m. Sales declined sharply in the games computer business, where it faced intense competitive pressure from Nintendo, and a sector of the personal computer market. Amstrad withdrew from games computers, a division which provided 11 per cent of turnover previously, as it was not profitable enough. The move accounted for about 70 per cent of the volume decline in the period. Amstrad was also hit in the first half by what it called the 'price-dumping' of personal computers by leading competitors. Sales of IBM-compatible personal computers in particular, were hit by price reductions by IBM. Instead of selling below cost, Amstrad had decided to stand back, it said. Mr Sugar stressed the group's commitment to the personal computer market. 'We have no intention of giving up our position in the computer market,' he said. Although stocks were high, at about Pounds 175m, Amstrad does not expect to have to make significant inventory write-downs this year as it did at the last year-end. Sales in satellite dish television receiver, word processor and fax machine divisions remained buoyant, Amstrad said. It is restructuring its distribution in the UK and continental Europe to further reduce overheads. The group's balance sheet remains strong, with net cash balances of Pounds 40m. Losses per share came to 1.9p, against earnings of 4.5p last time. Net asset value per share, however, was nearly twice the share price at 54p, against 59p last time. Lex, Page 18</p>

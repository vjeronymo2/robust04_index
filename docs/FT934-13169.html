			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: New products help Kao lift profits sharply KAO, a leading Japanese household products maker, saw a firm rise in profits for the first six months to September, in spite of a sharp fall in consumer spending due to the prolonged economic slump. The company attributed its profit rise to firm sales of new products and a realignment of production lines. Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first half rose 8 per cent to Y22.9bn (Dollars 213m) on a 3.5 per cent rise in sales to Y315.7bn. After-tax profits increased 4.1 per cent to Y12.1bn. However, its balance on financial items deteriorated due to redemptions of warrant bonds. Kao's personal care and cosmetics division saw a 4 per cent rise in sales to Y114bn due to strong demand for new products. Sales of detergents rose 2.7 per cent to Y123.9bn, while hygiene products increased by 5.9 per cent to Y37.8bn. Sales of chemicals and floppy disks rose 4.2 per cent to Y27.6bn.</p>

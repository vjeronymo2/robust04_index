			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPORTS IN THE '80S;  </P> <P> QUOTABLE  </P> <P> Some things they said during the 1980s:  </P> <P> Claude Gilbert, answering a booster's criticism about the red-and-white  uniforms worn by San Diego State's football team in 1980: "I designed those  uniforms. I've been catching hell here for eight years, and I'll keep catching  hell. But you know something? I don't care. We're going to keep those uniforms  until you get yourselves a new football coach."  </P> <P> The red-and-white uniforms were gone in 1981. So was Gilbert.  </P> <P> Don Coryell, on the SDSU administration's firing of Gilbert: "They've got their  heads so far underground they can't see."  </P> <P> Not all of Donald Sterling's promises were hollow.  </P> <P> Take this one from 1981: "One day, it will be harder to get a Clipper ticket  than it will be to get a Charger ticket."  </P> <P> In San Diego, anyway.  </P> <P> An irate Rich Gossage struck out at Padre owner Joan Kroc in the aftermath of  the clubhouse beer ban in 1986: "She's poisoning the world with her  hamburgers."  </P> <P> Steve Garvey, on the reaction of his new wife, Candace, to his revelation that  he might have fathered two babies out of wedlock: " . . . Her greatest line to  me was, 'Well, at least I got you off the streets.' "  </P> <P> Jim McMahon, commenting on Brigham Young University before the 1981 Holiday  Bowl: "I don't have a lot of fond memories of school. In fact, I hate school.  Once I graduate and get to the NFL, I won't be coming back here."  </P> <P> Jim McMahon, responding to a reporter's questions in 1989 by blowing his nose  at him: "There's an answer for you."  </P> <P> Dan Fouts could be surly in postgame interview situations, particularly after a  game such as the 34-27 loss to Oakland in the 1981 American Football Conference  championship game. A microphone thrust through a crowd of reporters veritably  brushed his beard.  </P> <P> "Get this damn thing out of my mouth," he snarled.  </P> <P> He looked up. The offending reporter was his father, Bob, a broadcaster in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Charger defensive back Pete Shaw, lamenting the 1981 trade that sent wide  receiver John Jefferson to the Green Bay Packers after a long contract  squabble: "A lot of players are angry about this. We feel a deep loss, like a  death."  </P> <P> Michael Fay, the owner of New Zealand, complaining that Dennis Conner and his  catamaran, Stars &amp; Stripes, had "dogged it" in winning the 1988 America's  Cup races off Point Loma: "I don't think that other boat was raced at all out  there today. It was disappointing to see a competitor ahead of us parked . . .  We would rather have been beaten by a greater margin than see a competitor sail  like that."  </P> <P> Former San Diego State basketball Coach David Gaines: "You know what you call a  guy who finishes last in a class of 25 at medical school? You call him doctor.  You know what you call a coach who finishes last? You call him fired."  </P> <P> Gaines was fired after SDSU tied for last in 1987.  </P> <P> A classified advertisement from 1980, when Ozzie Smith and his representative  were trying to squeeze a better contract out of the Padres: "Padres baseball  player wants part-time employment to supplement income. College education.  Willing to work. Prefer PR-type employment. Needs hours tailored to baseball  schedule but would quit baseball for right opportunity."  </P> <P> Joan Kroc offered him a job as a gardener.  </P> <P> He is doing quite well these days with the St. Louis Cardinals.  </P> <P> Dave Winfield, after leaving the Padres and signing a 10-year contract worth  $15 million with the New York Yankees following the 1980 season: "Hey, I'm  ready, I paid my dues, I need some attention. I feel good about my supporting  cast."  </P> <P> The "supporting cast" won 103 games in 1980 without him.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> CANDIDATE SAYS BAD TURF TO CLOSE PARK  </P> <P> A candidate for Moorpark mayor claimed Monday that the city's most frequently  used park will be closed for four months so that tougher turf can be planted,  but city officials said no decision has been made.  </P> <P> Tom Wheeler, a former city parks and recreation commissioner, held a press  conference at Peach Hill Park, where lighted diamonds allow adult softball  teams to play at night and where youth soccer teams practice in the afternoon.  </P> <P> He said replanting the park's turf will cost $30,000 to $35,000.  </P> <P> About two years ago, ball fields were planted with a type of grass that doesn't  stand up to the heavy use at the park, Wheeler said.  </P> <P> He said he and other commission members "identified the problem from Day 1 when  the park was dedicated. . . . Nothing has been done. There has been no real  action on behalf of the council to address this situation. This is a case where  no decision eventually equals a decision."  </P> <P> However, City Manager Steve Kueny said there has been no decision to close the  park.  </P> <P> Wheeler also charged that the city would lose an additional $3,000 in fees from  adult softball teams with closure of the park.

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): A model approach to close-up pictures A pilotless helicopter, fitted with a video camera, has been developed to take high-quality, close-up pictures in inaccessible or hazardous situations, writes Andrew Derrington. The system, available from Cunningham Aerial Inspection Services, has applications in loss adjusting and has already been used to inspect fire-damaged buildings and forests. The model's small size and the fact that it is pilotless allows it to go where conventional helicopters cannot. It is controlled by two operators on the ground, linked by radio. One watches the video pictures while the other pilots the helicopter under visual control. The new system is based on a light-weight airframe (10oz). Camera vibration has been reduced by a mechano-electric mounting that enables close inspection of the finest details.

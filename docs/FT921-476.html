			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Turks confirm armour used on Kurds GERMANY said yesterday that Turkey had acknowledged using German-supplied armoured cars in clashes with its minority Kurds, Our Foreign Staff writes. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said the Turkish government had confirmed that vehicles from the former East German National People's Army had been deployed in the Anatolia region 'for monitoring, surveillance and observation'. Bonn on Thursday accused Turkey of using German weapons against civilians and halted arms sales to Ankara. In Lisbon, the Portuguese presidency of the EC said it was seeking further clarification from the Turkish authorities and EC diplomats in Ankara about Turkey's attacks on Kurdish villages, before deciding on a common response by the Twelve. 'There are indications that the situation is much more serious than has been reported,' the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said yesterday. EC diplomats refused to comment on what an EC declaration might contain, but an EC-wide suspension of military equipment to a Nato member is thought unlikely.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome wanted Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, forged ahead 14 3/4 to 648p after one of its competitors was obliged to withdraw a key treatment for epilepsy in the US. Carter-Wallace, of the US, sent a letter to 240,000 doctors advising immediate withdrawal of patients from its Felbatol treatment after the appearance of side effects. It was one of three new entrants into an estimated Dollars 550m market dominated, according to analysts, by cheap generic products, many of which produce side effects. Wellcome's Lamictal is one of two other new products expected to gain approval shortly from the US Food and Drug Administration. Although there has been some concern that the FDA is clamping down on new products following restraint on recent applications by SmithKline Beecham and Merck, one analyst said he had spoken to the FDA and was confident that the approval process would not be slowed down. The latest figures from Abbey National, the second of the big banking groups to report interim results, saw the share price fall 12 to 385p. The profits of Pounds 423m were above expectations but, as with Lloyds Bank, they were increased by a sharp fall in the provisions for bad debts and there was disappointment that Abbey's share of the mortgage market was less than expected. The bank also announced an insurance joint venture with Commercial Union, which rose 2 on the news but slipped back to close a net 2 softer at 548p. The deal is expected to squeeze rival Sun Alliance, which receded 9 to 322p as two large blocks of shares were placed in the market. National Westminster Bank, which reports today, improved 5 to 453p, with a block of 1m shares going through the Seaq system at 451p. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries was the most heavily traded stock in London as a result of technical trading in the shares and in put options. A block of 9.5m was traded at 444 1/2 p and 9,500 short-dated puts representing 9.5m shares were also sold. Initially, it appeared that the trade might be a way of getting into the shares at 434p, close to the price of the shares after the payment of the 8.5p dividend next week. The stock ended the day 5 1/2 higher at 447p on turnover of 30m, the highest for more than a year. Mining group RTZ jumped 21 1/2 to 884p on news of increased copper production. There was also talk of a buy recommendation from BZW, but the house was unavailable for comment late yesterday. Oil shares rose in early trade as the price of Brent crude was pushed higher on supply worries as a result of the strikes in Nigeria. Brent crude deliverable in September broke above Dollars 19 a barrel, its highest level in 15 months. Shell Transport added 7 at 737p, British Petroleum firmed a half-penny but ended a penny down on the day at 411 1/2 p as US investors sold into strength ahead of second-quarter figures today. Retailer WH Smith was the focus for bearish stories which combined to push the shares down 7 to 452p. Prominent among these was the suggestion that the newspaper price war may prompt News International and The Telegraph group to consider setting up their own wholesale distribution systems. There was also talk that the newspaper industry was considering putting pressure on Smith to reduce its charges. Finally, VAT fears were also circulating, further undermining the Smith share price. The move by the Independent newspaper to cut its cover price to 30p, the same level as the Telegraph, ruffled feathers among publishing stocks. Telegraph shares slipped 3 to 365p. Suggestions that motor dealer T. Cowie may announce a lucrative deal together with today's interim figures helped the shares harden 4 1/2 to 268p. Hopes of an important order also kept GKN 2 ahead at 622p. A broker's recommendation powered engineering group Glynwed International, the shares firming 3 to 377p. NatWest Securities said: 'As the recovery in the UK continues to gather pace and profits growth outstrips that of the market in general we believe there is plenty of scope for further outperformance.' Conglomerate Harrisons &amp; Crosfield gained 7 at 179p as the market appreciated the group's Pounds 167m sale of its Indonesian plantations, announced late on Friday. Analysts at BZW, which remains neutral on the stock, welcomed the deal, saying Harrisons had received a better price than anticipated. In addition, they said the deal was not as dilutive of share earnings as originally feared and had favourable tax implications for the company. A buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs helped Trafalgar House firm 2 1/2 to 80p. There was good demand for Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel, which has received approval for a provisional licence to operate a limited passenger service. The shares rose 15 to 329p. Construction group Ashtead jumped 21 to 383p after announcing a 150 per cent full-year profits increase to Pounds 7.1m. RMC gained 6 at 958p as Kleinwort Benson upgraded its profits forecast for 1996. Chemicals group Wolstenholme Rink climbed 20 to 723p, reflecting demand in a weak market.</p>

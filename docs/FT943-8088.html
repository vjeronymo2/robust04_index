			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Lift-truck producer plans shake-up Boss Group, the lift-truck producer formerly known as Lancer Boss, yesterday announced it was restructuring its sales and service operation to improve customer support and help increase its market share. The announcement is the first big change at the company, based in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, since its controversial takeover in May by Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck group. A big investment in the manufacturing facilities at Leighton Buzzard is scheduled to be unveiled next month. The sales and service shake-up could add at least 30 jobs to the service division, which employs about 250 people. Boss would not disclose the cost of the plan but said detailed proposals for modernising the depot network had been drawn up over the past three months. Mr Bob Bischof, chairman, said: 'With the excellence of our proven product range, the reorganisation and updating of our regional network had to be one of our top priorities.' He was confident the new organisation would contribute substantially to increasing market share. The new strategy aims at a clearly defined regional structure of sales and service centres to give comprehensive territorial coverage. It includes: The development of new centres in Warrington, Leeds and Bristol. Refurbishing and modernising existing facilities. Complementing some of the regional branches with satellite depots. Investing in information technology for more efficient communications. Boss Group employs about 700 and has a projected turnover of Pounds 100m this year. Receivers were called in to most of the old Lancer Boss Group in April after its former German subsidiary, Steinbock Boss, was forced into receivership.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / People: Sir Brian Shaw to chair PLA Sir Brian Shaw's appointment as the next chairman of the Port of London Authority is a sure sign that Britain's biggest port is no longer regarded as a lame duck. It is the first time for many years that the government has recruited a chairman from the PLA board rather than parachute in an outside troubleshooter. Sir Brian - a board member since 1987 - takes over from former TI chairman Sir Brian Kellett on January 1. Before Sir Brian Kellett's arrival in 1985, the PLA had lost over Pounds 52m in nine years, and he has overseen its return to profitability and the privatisation of of Tilbury, its last remaining dock undertaking. Sir Brian Shaw, a former chairman of Furness Withy and ex-president of the General Council of British Shipping, admits that he is the first person for a long time to 'have a clear run at the job' without having to spend his time worrying about the dock labour problems which dominated the lives of many of his predecessors. The PLA still has a lot of debt, and will need to refinance itself at some stage. But the sale of Tilbury means it can now concentrate on its primary task of managing the navigation and conservancy of 150 kms of the River Thames downstream from Teddington. Like many Londoners, Sir Brian, 59, is keen to promote more use of the river. 'We have a six-lane highway going through the heart of London and virtually no one uses it,' he says. Under his chairmanship, he hopes that the PLA can be a catalyst for change on the river. The PLA, which still employs 550 staff, is no longer the power in the land it once was when London was the world's biggest port. However, Sir Brian still has an important ambassadorial role to play in promoting the interests of a port which handles 52m tonnes of trade a year. (See Observer) ***** Richard Packer, 48, is to take over from Sir Derek Andrews as permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, when the latter retires next February. A chemist by training, Packer joined the Inland Revenue as an inspector of taxes in 1966, and transferred to MAFF in 1967. He was seconded to the diplomatic service in Brussels during the 1970s and in 1987 was appointed director of regional management for MAFF. He was promoted to deputy secretary in 1989. David Hadley, 56, will take over Packer's responsibility for the ministry's agricultural commodities, trade and food production directorate. He joined MAFF after graduating from Oxford University in 1959 and apart from periods of some three-and-a-half years each in the Treasury and the cabinet office has spent the bulk of his career with MAFF. Since July 1989 he has been head of the European secretariat in the cabinet office.</p>

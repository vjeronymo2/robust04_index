			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades not a major obstacle, say UK insurers THE downgrading of financial strength and debt ratings of Sun Alliance and Eagle Star by Moody's Investors Service, the US agency, is being seen as something of an irritation by the UK insurance industry. The reaction from the companies and some of their competitors was that the move, which largely reflects concern about exposure to UK domestic mortgage indemnity risk, is not a major obstacle to tapping capital markets. 'The economic environment seems to be improving,' said Mr Peter Fiddimore, responsible for corporate treasury at Sun Alliance. Being put on review in the first place pushed up commercial paper borrowing costs by up to 25 basis points, he said. Moody's acknowledges that if there are no further adverse developments in the UK housing sector or large claims caused by terrorism or storms, the fortunes of UK composite insurers could be at a turning point as premium rates harden and interest rates fall. Moody's downgraded to A2 from A1 the senior debt ratings of the Sun Alliance group holding company and the financial strength rating of the main operating company to Aa3 from Aa2, while Eagle Star Insurance's financial strength rating was lowed to A2 from A1. Royal Insurance's financial strength rating was confirmed at A3. Between them, the three groups have an estimated 60 to 65 per cent of the domestic mortgage indemnity market. 'The fact that the downward ratings changes are so small compared with the mortgage indemnity crisis indicates there are compensating comforts from other factors,' said Mr David Anthony, a senior analyst at Moody's. 'Everybody is at least guardedly optimistic that 1993 could be a good year for the UK composite sector,' he added.</p>

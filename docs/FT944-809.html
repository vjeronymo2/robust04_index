			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Stanhope totters as bank talks collapse: The rise and fall of the trend-setting UK property developer The suspension of Stanhope Properties' shares yesterday, after the breakdown of negotiations with banks owed Pounds 140m, leaves the UK's most influential developer of the last decade hanging by a thread. The company's existing credit facilities ran out at 3.30pm yesterday after a three-day extension granted on Monday by 16 banks led by Barclays. A board meeting broke up without resolution late last night, although executives and advisers were working into the night to stave off receivership. When Mr Stuart Lipton started Stanhope 11 years ago - from tiny offices in Stanhope Gate, Mayfair - he was already a familiar figure on the property scene. In 1976, Mr Lipton had founded Greycoat Estates, along with Mr Geoffrey Wilson and Mr Ron Spinney. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Greycoat took part in some of London's most imaginative office developments. These included Cutlers Gardens, built around old East India Company warehouses on the fringe of the City of London, and Victoria Plaza straddling Victoria Station. Mr Lipton left Greycoat abruptly in 1983. While there were rumours of a rift with his partners, he said that he simply wanted a change of scene. Despite Stanhope's modest beginings - Mr Lipton's initial investment was Pounds 100,000 - the company was soon involved in a string of ambitious projects. By the time of its flotation on the Unlisted Securities Market in 1987, Stanhope had already helped develop the Stockley Park office park near Heathrow Airport, one of the first of its kind in the UK. Work on the Broadgate office development in the City was also under way, in partnership with Mr Godfrey Bradman's Rosehaugh. Stanhope's flotation prospectus detailed the first two completed phases of Broadgate and plans for four additional phases. Eventually 14 phases were built, providing 3.5m sq ft of offices. With such an impressive development record, investors were more than ready to back Mr Lipton. The tender price for Stanhope's shares was set at 250p, well above the 180p minimum price, giving the company a market value of Pounds 277m. The following year, Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer responsible for Canary Wharf and controlled by the Reichmann family, paid Pounds 137m for a 29.9 per cent interest in the company. Mr Lipton's reputation was then at its height. Stanhope and Rosehaugh were chosen to redevelop 125 acres around King's Cross station, which would have been Europe's largest inner-city development, and the Royal Docks area of docklands. Stanhope also backed a controversial scheme to redevelop the South Bank arts complex. While none of these grand designs came to fruition, the company's shares peaked at 321p in mid-1988, valuing Stanhope at Pounds 500m. Its decline since then can be blamed on the worst property recession in living memory and the way in which Stanhope was financed. Under the influence of Mr Bradman, who had imported non-recourse financing techniques from the US, the Broadgate development was funded almost entirely with bank debt. All the equity in the project was retained by Stanhope and Rosehaugh, each of which held a 50 per cent stake in Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, later re-named Broadgate Properties. When property prices were rising, this high leverage worked in favour of Stanhope shareholders. The company's net assets soared from Pounds 42m in 1987 to Pounds 457m in 1990. As prices fell, though, the value of Broadgate to its shareholders was quickly eroded. Once the bank debt supporting Broadgate is deducted, Stanhope's half share in Broadgate Properties is now valued at only Pounds 116m. It would be easy to conclude that Mr Lipton's talent for development does not extend to finance. Yet Stanhope was not alone in under-estimating the severity of the downturn and over-gearing at the wrong point in the property cycle. Mr Bradman was regarded as one of the best financiers in the property sector, yet Rosehaugh went into receivership two years ago. Greycoat - still headed by Mr Geoffrey Wilson until last year - survived by a whisker. 'To say Stuart does not care about profit margins and efficiency is laughable,' said one former development partner. 'He revolutionised construction techniques in this country and made buildings far quicker and cheaper to erect. The truth is that no-one saw the recession coming.' There is no doubting Mr Lipton's legacy as a developer. The Broadgate complex, in particular, is widely regarded as the City of London's most successful development since the second world war. Broadgate moved the City's centre of gravity decisively to the north - an achievement all the more remarkable for the fact that the area was regarded as a backwater by most City occupiers. It is doubtful whether Broadgate would have been possible without Mr Lipton's passionate concern for the quality of the buildings. His reputation for being extraordinarily demanding to work for and, on occasions, brutally direct may arise from this uncompromising approach. One close adviser commented: 'Stuart pays an enormous amount of attention to his buildings. They are like a part of his family. It is an approach which leads to great buildings but some people find that degree of commitment difficult to deal with.' Whatever the future for Stanhope, few doubt that Mr Lipton could build many more fine buildings. He has just passed his 52nd birthday and, despite yesterday's events, his reputation as a developer remains intact. Others of his generation have proved that episodes of financial distress are not a permanent barrier in an industry accustomed to boom and bust. After a brief spell in Germany after Rosehaugh's collapse, Mr Bradman is operating from offices close to Regent's Park. While shareholders who backed Stanhope may feel less than sympathetic, history has proved that building fine buildings is a risky business from which few escaped unscathed.</p>

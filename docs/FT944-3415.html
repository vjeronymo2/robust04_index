			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Cresvale brings first placing for Romanian group - International equities Cresvale, a subsidiary of France's Banque Pallas Stern, has completed the first international placing of shares for a Romanian company, raising some Dollars 1.5m from institutional investors for Societatea R, the local publishing group. The deal is one of a number of international issues planned ahead of the expected opening of the Bucharest stock exchange early next year. Mr Paddy Shanahan, head of European emerging markets at Cresvale, said the group aims to raise some Dollars 6m for a local services company and Dollars 5m for an industrial group early in the new year. Some 66,000 of the new Societatea shares were issued to repay borrowings, and Cresvale acquired additional shares from employees. In total, just under 30 per cent of the company has been sold to international investors. The paper will trade over-the-counter. Societatea R publishes Romania Libera, a popular broadsheet newspaper with a circulation of 200,000, and also has a range of other magazine and book-binding interests. Mr Shanahan said that on estimated 1994 earnings, the share is currently trading on a price earnings ratio of seven. Cresvale is involved in other under-developed east European markets. Earlier this year it raised Dollars 8m through an international placement of shares in Estonia's Hansa Bank. Its asset management department also launched the Baltic Republics Fund in August. Some 30 per cent of the fund, which is oversubscribed and was capped at Dollars 30m in August, is currently invested in Estonia. Among its investments is the wood processing company, Viisnurk, an internationally known manufacturer of cross country skis. Cresvale's Prometheus Fund, launched in beginning of 1994, has invested some Dollars 12m in Russia and eastern Europe. Pricing of the shares of Tadiran, the Israeli electronics company which is planning an offering in New York, is expected in the next few days. The issue, which follows an initial public offering in 1992, is expected to raise Dollars 80m including a Dollars 7.4m greenshoe option. Merrill Lynch is lead-managing the deal. Roughly 3.9m of the company's shares are being sold: 2.34m in the US and 1.56m on international markets. The shares will also be listed in London on the SEAQ market and in Tel Aviv. Oppenheimer, Lehman Brothers, UBS and BZW are co-lead managers. After the offering, Koor Industries' stake in Tadiran will fall from 76 to 52 per cent. SG Warburg and UBS, joint global co-ordinators for the international issue of shares in EVC, Europe's largest manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride, yesterday took advantage of the 'greenshoe option', increasing the size of the issue by a further 1m shares. The greenshoe allowed an issue of up to 1.35m extra shares. The shares were yesterday trading at Fl 77.1 compared with an issue price of Fl 77. ICI of the UK and Enichem of Italy each sold 35 per cent stakes in EVC, raising a total of Fl 770m.</p>

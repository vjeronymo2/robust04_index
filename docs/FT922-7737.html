			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Watchdogs focus on pensions sales - Disquiet deepens over the transfers business INVESTMENT watchdogs closed in on irresponsible pension salespeople this week in the wake of deepening disquiet over the selling of personal pensions to members of company schemes. On Thursday, the monitoring committee of Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) met to consider disciplinary action relating to pension transfer business against a large direct selling insurance company. Mike Abrahams, Lautro's chief enforcement officer, said six other companies were under investigation, all in connection with transfers from the same company scheme. He explained that the investigations arose from complaints by company pension schemes which had lost a large number of members to apparently less generous personal pensions. Some questioned whether the sales people concerned were genuinely meeting the standards of best advice set by the regulator. Lautro has prepared draft guidelines for companies on pension transfers which set out, in specific terms, the factors salespeople should assess in deciding whether a customer should leave a company scheme to buy a personal pension. The guidelines could be bought into force within three to five weeks. Lautro already requires sales representatives to take the investor through the detailed pros and cons. But a survey of more than 200 transfers made from the J Bibby &amp; Son pension scheme over the past two years suggests that observation of this rule is sketchy. Administering transfers on behalf of Bibby, consulting actuaries IS Cartwright of Godalming found that 15 per cent of sales people immediately told clients they needed a transfer before knowing how much money would be involved. This applied to independent intermediaries as well as representatives selling exclusively for one company. 'Some just write in and say send a cheque,' said the firm's Ian Cartwright, 'For all they know, they could be taking a transfer of Pounds 1, as opposed to a deferred pension of Pounds 30,000 a year. It amazes me when they are supposed to give best advice'. Only 30 per cent of sales people asked for information about increases to pensions once they are being paid in retirement - Bibby gives a guaranteed 5 per cent. Nobody asked about the company's record of giving discretionary increases above this. None of the sales people asked about equalising pension ages for men and women, which meant that men who transferred before Bibby introduced a common pension age of 63 lost out, since the change was backdated to May 1990. Cartwright also noticed that not a single sales person asked on what basis the scheme calculated its transfer values or requested recalculation to take account of any fall in interest rates following an initial quotation. The effect of ignoring this is to understate the value of the company pension or to lose a customer as much as 30 per cent of what might be a substantial amount. Transfers from Bibby in the past two years have ranged from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 200,000 with a norm of between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000. Despite Bibby's offer to pay for independent advice for employees, only 10 per cent of transfers came through independents. The remainder appeared to be handled mainly by representatives of Refuge, Pearl, Britannic and, to a lesser extent, Allied Dunbar. Most of these companies say they require representatives to conduct full fact-finds on the customer and to provide a comparison of the relative benefits of the company scheme and a personal pension. Refuge issued seven pages of pension transfer guidelines to sales staff in January 1992, including questions that must be asked of company schemes. Steve Conley, pensions product manager at Refuge, said sales people might not need to ask questions about schemes they already knew well, adding that many companies now handed out all the detailed information required as a matter of course. Refuge's guidelines say: 'The customer must on no occasion be advised to transfer. Sales personnel provide information and in the light of this information the customer must be the one to make the decision.' 'We are not trying to avoid liability,' said Conley, 'If people are not given proper information or are misled in any way the company is liable for any consequences.' Reacting to the most frequent cause of complaint prior to January, Refuge also warns staff that transfers 'may be inadvisable' for customers within 15 years or so of retirement, because of the impact of initial costs, but tells them to consider each case on its individual merits. At Allied Dunbar, Tony Reardon, a divisional director, said that the company had cracked down on cases submitted without fact-finds and that execution-only pensions business accounted for less than one per cent of the total. He estimated complaints at one or two a month or about half a per cent of transfers. Reardon said that notes on transfers values accompanied every personal pension application. Customers had to sign a statement confirming their understanding of the information given and wish to proceed. The National Association of Pension Funds has expressed concern to Lautro about the sales methods of some personal pension providers, but a recent survey of NAPF schemes showed only 70 per cent willing to allow re-admission to people who had transferred out. 'Some members do take a hard line,' said Mike Brown of the NAPF, 'But if an individual really had been given bad advice, they might be more sympathetic.'</p>

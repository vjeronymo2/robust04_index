			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Baturin and S. Gryzunov of RIA-NOVOSTI for </F> IZVESTIYA under the general heading "Russian Diplomacy Spares  NATO the Use of Force in Bosnia and Gives Serbs a Chance"]    [Text] Belgrade -- The mission of Vitaliy Churkin, the  Russian President's special representative at the talks on the  former Yugoslavia, has ended in success. The Bosnian Serbs have  agreed to fulfill Russia's request and withdraw the heavy  weapons from Sarajevo as quickly as possible in the interests of  ending the bloodshed.    The Russian battalion will advance to Sarajevo if the  Bosnian  Serbs keep their word. That is stipulated in Boris Yeltsin's  message to Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, and also  sent to Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, other  Serb leaders, and the Serbian people.    Although Serbia is not taking part in the Bosnian war,  according to the assurances of its leaders, it is no secret that  the Bosnian Serbs could hardly have achieved military  superiority and territorial advantages without Belgrade's  support.    Can Moscow's latest gesture be called a slide toward a  "pro-Serbian position?" Today's breakthrough by Russian  diplomacy is a logical and consistent continuation of its  Balkans policy, which has done far more good than the actions  and statements of any other Russian organ, party, or grouping.    The military from various countries operating as UN  peacemaking forces in the Bosnian war are well aware that so far  not a single agreement has been fulfilled here and not a single  cease-fire agreement has held for long. As for what will happen  this time, we shall find that out on Monday -- the day that the  NATO ultimatum expires.    The Russian president's message makes no mention of how far  the artillery and tanks should be withdrawn, it speaks only of  the "earliest possible deadline" for the withdrawal, and it is  that aspect which is now the cause of disagreement between the  participants in the conflict and the blue helmets. General Sir  Michael Rose, the British commander of the blue helmets in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, is categorical: The condition that heavy  weapons be withdrawn 20 km from the center of Sarajevo must be  fulfilled. At the moment, however, it is not being observed.    Even now, when an unusual calm is reigning in Sarajevo, you  can hardly call the Russian airborne forces' new place of  deployment a holiday camp. The Muslim side stated immediately  that it is not ecstatic about the contact between the Russians  and the Serbs. In addition, Vitaliy Churkin has stressed that  if the accords are violated and any of the Russian soldiers or  any other country's servicemen are placed in danger air support  [aviatsia] will immediately be summoned to their aid.    Even if things work out well, the resolution of the crisis  around Sarajevo is an important step but only the first step  toward ending the war and achieving a political settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

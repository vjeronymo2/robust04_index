The Malian president voiced support to the proposal for  national reunification clarified by his excellency President Kim  Il-song, saying he stands behind the principled stand of the  DPRK to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    The Equatorial Guinean prime minister said that the United  States is resorting to all intrigues to stifle the Governments  of Equatorial Guinea and Korea on the pretext of non-existent  "human rights issue". This is part of its moves to stifle  non-aligned countries, he added.    He noted that the struggle of Korea to defend its  sovereignty  fully accords with the interests of non-aligned countries.    Rigoberto Padilla Ruz, general secretary of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Honduras, when he received  the DPRK ambassador to Nicaragua on February 22, said that the  proposal for reunification through confederacy advanced by the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is the most realistic and just  overture. He said he would always extend support and solidarity  to the Korean people in their struggle for the reunification of  the country.</p>

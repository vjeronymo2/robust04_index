			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM acts to boost sales INTERNATIONAL Business Machines said it would make new mainframe computer models available several months ahead of its planned schedule in a move to boost sales. The new mid and low-range models, which were announced last year, extend IBM's latest ES/9000 range of computers. IBM executives said delivery dates had been advanced because improvements in manufacturing processes enabled the company to move more quickly. Demand for IBM's most powerful mainframe computers has not declined, despite economic trends, company executives said. Competitors say, however, that IBM has been offering steep discounts to customers in order to boost sales. Four new mid-range models are available now, IBM said, and a fifth would be available at the end of June. Upgrades for older IBM models will also be available sooner than expected. IBM also announced two new low-end mainframes.</p>

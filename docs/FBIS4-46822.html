			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Voloshina: "Is MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS </F> Buying CHAS PIK?"]    [Text] CHAS PIK, St. Petersburg's main weekly, intends to  turn over a large package of its stock to the capital's  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS newspaper. In view of the different  images of these two publications, the symbiosis seems rather  odd: In St. Petersburg CHAS PIK claims to be the "newspaper of  the intelligentsia."    As President Anatoliy Yezhelev of the Chas Pik Publishing  House, a joint-stock company, told the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI  correspondent, the weekly, like other newspapers in St.  Petersburg, is under considerable financial strain: "The  newspaper needs a sound investor to move up to a new qualitative  level, and this could take hundreds of millions of rubles." CHAS  PIK plans to begin by becoming a daily newspaper and attracting  advertising revenue.    Anatoliy Yezhelev explained that the talks with MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS had just begun, and that the discussion concerned  the creation of a joint news and commercial service in St.  Petersburg and Moscow. As the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent  later learned, however, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has already been  offered a package of CHAS PIK stock at face value by one of the  weekly's main shareholders--the UniREM joint venture. Other  shareholders--two city banks and the St. Petersburg Union of  Journalists--own a negligible percentage of the stock. The main  stockholders are the members of the newspaper labor collective.  The CHAS PIK journalists told the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI  correspondent that persistent attempts were being made to force  them to sign a "quit-claim" to their employee stock. Many  members of the collective have already signed papers of this  kind, possibly in the fear of administrative penalties. Only a  few have refused, and they want to know why MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS was chosen as the investor and what kind of policies  it intends to pursue after it gets the controlling share of the  stock. Anatoliy Yezhelev explained the choice of MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS as a matter of pure ethics: "We received extremely  tempting bids for our stock from large financial corporations,  but we do not want to fall under the influence of the banks--we  would rather deal with our journalist colleagues."</p>

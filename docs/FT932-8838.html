			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Mood swing in the public sector: A look at the pressures behind increased union militancy and the prospects for industrial action A summer of sporadic discontent threatens Britain's public services after firefighters voted last week to organise strike ballots in defence of jobs and pay, and the teachers' unions united in opposition to the government's national curriculum tests. But they are not the only groups among the 5.8m public-sector workers whose mood has gone from submissive to combative in the past few weeks. Several civil service unions appear to be edging towards a one-day stoppage in protest at the government's plans for commercial market testing, under which their members must compete for their jobs with private-sector workers. On May 26, ambulance workers and nurses are expected to join firefighters in a demonstration in London against what they see as a deterioration in the quality of public services because of government imposed financial constraints. Local council unions are considering taking industrial action after refusing last week to accept a final 1.5 per cent wage rise for their 500,000 members in line with the government's 12-month public sector pay limit policy introduced last November. Yet only a few weeks ago union leaders doubted whether a mounting sense of disquiet in the public sector would lead to industrial trouble. While saying publicly that the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit was inadequate they were in no mood to launch an offensive. It is not difficult to understand why. Last year Britain experienced the lowest number of working days lost through strikes since records began 100 years ago. The prolonged recession has meant public-sector workers were more concerned about security than about fighting for higher wages or better conditions and did not want to put their jobs at risk by going on strike. 'The feeling was that the government's 1.5 per cent public sector wage limit meant a strong trade-off between pay and jobs,' says Professor Philip Beaumont, an expert on the public sector at Glasgow University. 'Ministers were saying to public-sector workers, 'you can have more than 1.5 per cent but at a direct cost in fewer jobs'. It was that fear to their job security that suggested most public-sector workers would keep their heads down.' However, recent political setbacks - notably the Tory disasters in the Newbury by-election and the county council elections in England and Wales two weeks ago - have weakened the government. Some public sector union leaders now believe that if they adopt a more confrontational strategy, ministers will back away from rigidly imposing the 1.5 per cent pay limit or slow down plans to contract out public services to the private sector. Several public sector union leaders have been surprised by the depths of hostility now on display among some of their members, particularly to government policies on privatisation and market testing. Unions which feel most aggrieved include the Civil and Public Services Association, which covers clerical staff, and the Inland Revenue Staff Federation. But while such unions are restive, they have little industrial muscle with which to force the government to back down. Other public sector unions are in a stronger position to exert pressure because they have the ability to disrupt basic services. Because of this distinction, Mr Chris Trinder, of the independent Public Finance Foundation, points out a 'two-tier pay system' has evolved in the public sector. Weaker groups, such as local government manual workers, have been unable to secure the kinds of special pay deals covering members of some more powerful unions. For instance, some public sector groups enjoy guaranteed pay formulas linked to the private sector, such as firefighters and the police. Doctors, dentists and the armed services enjoy the benefit of pay review bodies which recommend salary increases based on comparable private sector wages. Under the 1.5 per cent public pay limit such arrangements have been suspended for at least 12 months from last November. But the government is going to find it hard to hold the line in the next wage round if it tries to reform them or scrap them altogether. The angry mood among delegates at last week's Fire Brigades Union conference suggests that some among the top tier of the public sector are preparing for conflict. The unanimous decision of the conference to authorise strike ballots in defence of a 14-year-old wage formula that links firefighters' pay to the increases enjoyed by the top 25 per cent of male manual workers and against any proposal for compulsory redundancies reflects a disillusioned and determined mood. Another of the privileged public service groups that could pose problems for the government is the police. Like the firefighters, they have benefited from a remarkably generous pay formula over the past 15 years. The inquiry by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, into police pay is due to report next month and this could well propose ending the formula. The Police Federation, the police union, which starts its annual conference today, is not likely to give up the pay formula without a fight even if it is prepared to accept a 1.5 per cent pay rise this year. With the battle against crime one of the government's priorities, ministers may want to avoid any conflict over pay with the police, and may thus be inclined to back down from abolishing the formula. Such expensive pay deals are just one aspect of public sector industrial relations that ministers would like to see changed in a radical reform of pay structure. They would also like to scrap centralised collective agreements which provide uniform pay levels across the public sector in favour of linking pay rises more directly to productivity improvements. It is a view shared by the Confederation of British Industry, which is preparing proposals that will call for an end to rigid overall pay limits like the current 1.5 per cent and replace them it with a system that makes all wage rises for public-sector workers conditional on achieving stringent performance targets. Over the past eight years, the Tories have not tried to impose such reforms on the public service sector and have adopted a pragmatic approach that has bought industrial peace at a price. Ministers have been keen to work with the unions as long as the cost of financing public sector pay was not having a serious effect on spending. But now, the government's current borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn has forced it to try to maintain a tighter control on public sector pay. The main casualty of this short-term need to rein in spending could be the introduction of plans to reform the entire public sector pay bargaining system. During this summer's public spending negotiations, which culminate in November's unified Budget, the government will have to decide whether to extend this year's formal pay norm into 1994-95. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insists it will not be extended. Last year he resisted pressure from colleagues for a two-year norm and in recent weeks has told them he is unwilling to re-open the debate. Instead he wants a series of informal pay ceilings, low but varying from department to department, to be enshrined in each of the Whitehall budgets agreed in the spending round. The implication is that nurses, for example, might negotiate a better pay deal than local authority manual workers. Many of Mr Lamont's colleagues are unconvinced that an informal system will work. If the chancellor is moved in a cabinet reshuffle some of the senior ministers in charge of the big spending departments will push for this year's publicly-stated norm to be carried forward. The spending ministers argue that this pay squeeze has only held this year because the 1.5 per cent ceiling has provided for 'equality of misery', in turn providing an argument that it is basically fair. Their concern is that the return of less constrained bargaining will bring with it the traditional 'leapfrogging' by different groups of public-sector workers. Not for the first time in recent years, the government may have to contain its long-term plans to align public sector pay on more market-oriented lines. Instead, it is likely to seek a credible response to growing signs of discontent among the public sector unions. Failure to resolve the problem this year will only build up a head of steam for greater industrial conflict next summer.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PRESSURES ON PAY  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Public sector  --------------------------------------------------------------------- % increase in pay in financial years                             Total                                                                1988/89                          1988/89  89/90  90/91  91/92  92/93  to 92/93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Local government            6.20   7.80   8.80   7.75   4.80     41.10 Civil service               6.25   6.60   9.15   7.50   4.50     38.80 Police                      8.20   9.00   9.50   9.00   7.30     51.00 Armed forces                6.40   6.90   7.70  15.30   5.60     49.15 Health                      7.95   7.15   8.20   8.75   6.50     45.22 Teachers                   10.10   6.00   7.50   9.60   8.80     49.47  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total (weighted average)    8.00   6.90   8.30   9.75   6.50     44.90 Inflation (all items RPI)   6.00   7.50  10.00   5.10   3.75     36.70 Private sector pay          9.10   9.50   9.60   7.25   5.50     48.10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

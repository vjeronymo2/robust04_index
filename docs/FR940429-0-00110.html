			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter writing on behalf of a SPRE noted that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional programs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are defined and governed under the State's education and judiciary Laws. The commenter urged that the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> recognize a State's statutory definition as provided under section 494C(d) of the HEA. (That section of the HEA requires a State to develop standards that are consistent with the constitution and laws of the State.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary disagrees with those commenters that suggest that the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> be limited to programs at or below the associate degree level. The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is commonly accepted as encompassing programs at higher degree levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees with the commenter that the proposed definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> be modified to recognize State law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the IPEDS definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> first professional degree <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is too narrow. Under that definition, the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> profession program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would encompass only 10 fields of study. However, the Secretary also agrees that the proposed definition was overly broad in that it permitted overlap between what constitutes professional education and what constitutes vocational education. The final regulations need to make the distinctions between both types of education clear. See also the discussion of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has revised the second element of the proposed definition to maintain a clear distinction between the terms  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is an educational program that prepares individuals for an occupation, if that occupation requires, in part, at least a bachelor's degree to qualify for entry. Also, the definition is expanded to allow a SPRE to use a State's statutory definition of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> professional program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Vocational Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All commenters agreed that the definition of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> under the SPRP be the same as the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational education  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> under the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accreditation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> regulations, 34 CFR part 602. Several commenters agreed with the proposed definition of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of these commenters preferred the SPRP definition to that proposed in the accreditation NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters writing on behalf of community colleges and universities believed the proposed definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was too broad. Many of these commenters believed strongly that proprietary institutions were primarily responsible for abuses in the title IV, HEA programs, and it was unfair to classify associate degree programs as vocational programs or to include any degree programs offered by community colleges or universities within the scope and meaning of the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters writing on behalf of proprietary and vocational institutions believed strongly that the proposed definition was too narrow. These commenters noted that most postsecondary educational programs are employment or career oriented and that students who enroll in those programs should be treated equally, regardless of the institution they chose to attend. These commenters believe that the term vocational program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should include all undergraduate programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter agreed with the propositions that the commenter claimed were presented in the accreditation NPRM that (1) every postsecondary educational program is technically vocational, and (2) while all programs may be vocational in nature, not all programs are academic. This commenter suggested that a better case be made for classifying programs as ``academic'' or ``nonacademic.'' Under this approach, the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be replaced by the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nonacademic program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be defined to include any program described under proposed 34 CFR 668.8(c) (1) and (2), that (1) a program of at least two academic years in length that provides an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, a professional degree, or an equivalent degree as determined by the Secretary, or (2) a program in which each course is acceptable for full credit toward that institution's associate degree, bachelor's degree, professional degree, or equivalent degree as determined by the Secretary, provided that the institution's degree requires at least two academic years of study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters believed that the proposed definition was too vague. Several of these commenters suggested adopting the definition of an ``occupationally specific program,'' as that term is defined in the CIP and used under IPEDS. These commenters noted that the National Center for Education Statistics and other Federal agencies use this definition to obtain data from institutions through IPEDS for research and other purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in this part should be the same as the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational education  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the accreditation regulations, 34 CFR part 602. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary further agrees with those commenters that suggested that the IPEDS/CIP definition, with minor modifications, is the most appropriate definition to use in this part and in the accreditation regulations because under that definition, educational programs are classified in a manner that is congruent with various SPRP statutory provisions that require a clear identification and reporting of educational programs offered by an institution that are occupationally specific and employment related.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for example, the standards described under section 494C(d)(7) of the HEA, ``If the stated objectives of the courses or programs of the institution are to prepare students for employment&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*;'' section 494C(d)(8) of the HEA, ``Availability to students of relevant information by institutions of higher education, including *&blank;*&blank;* information related to market and job availability for students in occupational, professional, and vocational programs; and *&blank;*&blank;* information regarding the relationship of courses to specific standards necessary for State licensure in specific occupations;'' and section 494C(d)(14)(C) of the HEA, ``The success of the program at the institution, including *&blank;*&blank;* with respect to vocational and professional programs, the rates of placement of the institution's graduates in occupations related to their course of study.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary disagrees with the commenter who suggested classifying programs as ``academic'' and ``nonacademic,'' because the Secretary disagrees with the commenter's premise that all vocational programs are ``nonacademic'' programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who suggest that the term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vocational program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> excludes in some manner degree programs offered by colleges and universities. The statute does not exempt types of institutions; rather, as noted above, the statute clearly speaks in terms of vocational programs offered at institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

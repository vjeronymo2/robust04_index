			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Food reaches Somalia A Somali child watches the first food aid to reach the village of Hobishoole. Looting has meant that aid is only now starting to reach some of the isolated areas of central Somalia. UN World Food Programme chief Catherine Bertini flew in yesterday to meet relief agencies that will distribute a promised 100,000 tonnes of extra WFP food before the end of the year. The start of a US airlift of 440 armed United Nations guards to the Somali capital has been delayed for 24 hours, officials said yesterday. A US diplomat in Mogadishu said reasons for the delay were not clear but preparations for the elaborate operation might not have been completed. US air force aircraft are to make 21 flights into Mogadishu over the next week to bring in the Pakistani 'blue helmets'. A vanguard of 60 troops arrived last week and have set up camp on the edge of the derelict airport as part of an operation to stop bandits plundering relief supplies.</p>

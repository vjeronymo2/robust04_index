			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: National Mutual to list HK arm NATIONAL Mutual, the Australian insurance and investment group, plans to list its Hong Kong insurance subsidiary on the colony's stock exchange. Mr Gil Hoskins, group managing director, said yesterday the listing would be the first in Hong Kong of a leading domestically-based insurer and would thus establish a new sector of the colony's investment market. Mr Hoskins gave no indication of the size of the flotation, but he said National Mutual would float a 25 per cent share of the business. National Mutual says the Hong Kong business's annual premium income grew to HKDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 325m) in fiscal 1992 from HKDollars 250m in 1986. It employs about 500 staff and 3,400 agents. Mr Hoskins suggested National Mutual would use the Hong Kong flotation as a platform for further Asian expansion. 'The Asian Pacific region is where we see our main growth coming from in future years,' he said. 'We plan to grow elsewhere in the region, initially targetting Taiwan and Indonesia. In the long term, the greater China market, once it opens up, would be of interest to the group.' National Mutual is also a significant funds manager in Asia through its Meridian Global Funds Management arm which manages assets of more than HKDollars 5bn. Simon Holberton in Hong Kong adds: The National Mutual float is expected to be the largest public offering in the colony since the 1990 flotation of 49 per cent of the South China Morning Post by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International which raised HKDollars 800m. National Mutual has received preliminary positive indications from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the colony's insurance commissioner for the float. Mr Geoff Tomlinson, associate director for National Mutual's international operations, said that the issue would be a combination of new and old shares. Capital raised through the issue of new shares would be retained within the company, while the proceeds from the sale of existing scrip would be repatriated to Australia. He said in the longer term, National Mutual's Hong Kong subsidiary would make an ideal vehicle for the life office's ambitions in the China market.</p>

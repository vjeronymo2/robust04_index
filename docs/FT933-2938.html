			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Book Review: Reports of unions' death are exaggerated Government and Unions since 1945 By Robert Taylor Blackwell (for the Institute of Contemporary British History), Pounds 13.99 paperback, Pounds 37.50 hardback, 406 pages (paperback) The widespread assumption across a large area of UK political thinking is that trade unionism, as we knew it, is dead. Like socialism, the argument goes, it belongs to the age of collectivist philosophy that has run its course and has given way to an overwhelming individualism, propelled by, if not dependent on, new technology. The industrial powers of the world are increasingly seen as warehouses of information technology, rather than centres of great manufacturing units employing tens of thousands of workers in one group of factories. Phrases like 'post-Fordism' and even 'post-capitalist' are used to describe the contemporary scene and to justify the argument that trade unions can be placed alongside the dinosaur in museums: relics of a bygone age. It is a seductive line of thought, to be sure; but I do not subscribe to it. An alternative theory can be quite effectively presented: the technological revolution may have destroyed the old, simple, collectivist industrial base on which powerful trade unions like the miners established their influence. But, in doing so, modern industry has also created a new need - which is for a more effective democratic voice to espouse the case for social justice in this new era of technological production. Without such a voice, and a well-based platform, there could be a significant growth in social, political and economic tensions that would tear at the whole social fabric. The dangers are already evident. So it is in this area that modern trade unionism should have an important, even a crucial, role to play. In short, new technology, with its revolutionary impact on work, may have fragmented (and made redundant) large tracts of the old industrial working class; but it has also created serious problems that a modernised trade union movement ought to be ideally equipped to tackle. It is in this sphere that an intelligent government would begin to explore a new dialogue with the trade unions. One thing is clear, and comes powerfully from the pages of Robert Taylor's excellent book: the trade unions have been unjustly blamed for their alleged role in contributing to national decline. Taylor, who is labour correspondent at the Financial Times, examines the nature of these charges - and he rejects the argument, convincingly. It is the best account of the government-trade union relationship for a long time. Taylor argues that the failures of UK capitalism, compared, say, with Germany or Scandinavia and certainly with the US, stem from a complex range of inherited causes, underscored by the culture of 19th-century industrial and social attitudes in Britain and its laisser-faire presumptions. The trade union responses to these mores were always defensive - hardly at all revolutionary or even markedly political. They were a reflection of an inadequacy of vision among politicians and industrialists - a reflection, not a cause. As Taylor observes: 'Whatever politicians and employers might have desired, Britain's trade unions continued to remain in the postwar world what they had always been - insecure, voluntary bodies at the mercy of the often fickle and divided moods of their own members and the uncertain and often harsh fluctuations of the labour market.' And he adds that too many political leaders, and others, used the trade unions with their imperfections as an excuse to divert attention away from more fundamental reasons for economic decline. Taylor explains the distrust the Trades Union Congress as an institution had for the state; how the TUC leaders resisted even the Attlee government in its attempts to bring the trade union machine more intimately within the corpus of state power and authority. Of course, the trade union leadership made many mistakes in in 1945-51 before the Conservatives returned to office. There was an ambivalence about the role of the unions in the newly nationalised industries: and there was confusion about the role of unions trying to maintain 'free collective bargaining' in an increasingly planned economy run by a friendly government. There were constant crises between the TUC and a succession of Labour governments over incomes policy - and ultimately the ending of the 'friendly relationship' with the collapse of the Callaghan government in 1979. As Taylor asserts, all these crises were part of 'the never-ending dialectic between freedom and control, between workplace autonomy and state intervention'. The Churchill, Eden and Macmillan Conservative governments of the 1950s and early 1960s all accepted the essential role unions had to play in collective bargaining and sensible industrial relations. Indeed Harold Macmillan often made a virtue of his affection for trade unionism. Curiously, the rot probably set in during the Wilson years - especially after the devaluation of 1967. Yet in 1964 the scene had been set for a Grand Consensus with George Brown's Declaration of Intent - a kind of 'charter of principles' agreed between government, Confederation of British Industry and TUC. In fact too much responsibility was put on the shoulders of union leaders to deliver a pay policy which they never had the power to hand to any government. Eventually, through the Heath years, it all led to Margaret Thatcher's crusade against trade unionism. Yet today, as Taylor cogently argues, Thatcherism is no longer enough for a society in the throes of vast changes. The unions remain an essential ingredient within any democratic society.

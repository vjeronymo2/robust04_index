			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM AWAITS NEW BIDS  </P> <P> The City Council will delay starting a pilot recycling program at City Hall and  the Police Department until other recycling companies in the city are  contacted.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis asked that a proposed contract with The Shred Co.  of Costa Mesa be postponed until it is determined whether other recycling  companies can give the city a better deal.  </P> <P> "We could end up with a good deal where we could have a clear profit," Genis  said.  </P> <P> The council had agreed May 21 to pay the company to haul away an estimated two  tons of garbage generated weekly at the two sites. The company would then sell  the recycled goods at market rates and reimburse that amount to the city.  </P> <P> The agreement would have set aside $5,000 to pay the company over a six-month  period; however, city staff believed the program would eventually pay for  itself.  </P> <P> In an informal survey of her own, Genis contacted four other companies and  found that most of them would not charge the city an initial fee. The council  will accept proposals from the recyclers to determine whether they can provide  the same or better services at a competitive rate.  </P> <P> The two departments will recycle newspapers, computer and ledger paper, and  aluminum cans.  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Labour halts co-operation with Tories: Smith angry at guillotine decision Labour last night broke off all relations with the government in protest at plans to curtail debate on changes to statutory sick pay and National Insurance contributions. The move means Labour will disrupt the passage of government business through the Commons, opposing even non-contentious legislation. Private meetings between government and opposition whips - accompanied by an independent official - to work out arrangements on parliamentary proceedings to the convenience of both sides will cease until further notice. So will the practice of 'pairing', whereby arrangements are made for an equal number of government and opposition MPs to miss votes in such a way that the overall margin of victory is not affected. In view of the government's slim 17-strong majority, this raises the prospect of ministers being called back from official business in the regions or overseas to vote, even on matters where there is no real dispute between the principal parties. The move was triggered by the government's decision to allow only one day each for the passage of controversial bills to raise employees' National Insurance contributions from 9 per cent to 10 per cent and to increase the statutory sick pay burden on large companies. Announcing Labour's decision last night, Mr John Smith, the party leader, said there was 'simply no justification' for the government's behaviour. 'It is oppressive and it is arrogant. It is a further sign of a government which has been in power for too long.' For the government, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, described Labour's action as 'too silly for words'. Pointing out that the recent Budget debate was extended from five days to six at Labour's request, Mr Newton said the two bills needed to be carried through in a way that allowed for 'adequate discussion in parliament'. Support for both the Conservatives and Labour has risen since the Budget at the expense of the Liberal Democrats, according to a Gallup poll in The Daily Telegraph. The poll shows Labour at 48.5 per cent, Tories at 27, Liberal Democrats 20, others 4.5.</p>

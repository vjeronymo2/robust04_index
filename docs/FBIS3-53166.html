			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Search for Corpses and Disavowal of Justice"] </F>   [Text] There are many events which an observer not only  cannot understand but cannot believe are happening. These  events are amusing enough to call for sorrow and are tragic  enough to call for amusement. Perhaps the visit by a U.S.  congressional delegation to the region to search for the corpses  of Israeli soldiers is one of these events which calls for  sorrow, amusement, denunciation, and much contempt. Indeed,  such action by representatives of the American people should  receive the aforementioned reaction and should be denounced by  the Americans themselves. What we know is that those who are  searching for corpses did not come to the region to investigate  the reasons behind the bombing of the ship "Liberty" and did not  open an investigation into this Zionist crime to show their  voters Israel's responsibility for an Israeli crime committed  against U.S. soldiers. Although we already know that U.S.  policy is not based on even a minimum level of ethics and does  not care about values and principles, this act by members of the  U.S. Congress makes us panic over this level of ethical collapse.    This act by those members is no more than cheap political  hypocrisy. If they were real representatives of the American  people, then they would have been horrified by what is happening  in Yugoslavia. They also would have questioned the crime  against tens of thousands of Iraqi children and sick Iraqis who  were martyred because of a shortage of food and medicine thanks  to the Washington government and the administrations of  Presidents Bush and Clinton.    The behavior of the U.S. Congress members puts us in a state  of panic in terms of what is awaiting the human family under the  new world order. While those members of Congress are busy  searching for the corpses of Israeli killers who slaughtered  thousands of people in Lebanon, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Tunis,  and other countries, they do not pause at the scores of U.S.  crimes which continue to be committed against humanity every  minute. They also do not deem it important to say a word of  truth in light of the human tragedies which continue to result  in the loss of hundreds of thousands of people each day without  moving the conscience of one Congress member or have him ask:  Why is our country killing all those people?    Everything that is happening is cause for sorrow and means  the United States is a country which possesses so many  capabilities but only employs them to kill people and deprive  them of security and tranquility and of food and medicine. Then  its representatives come to our region to search for the corpses  of killers whose Israeli military mechanism did not stop its  wars against the Arabs for more than four decades under a  Western racist sponsorship. The ranks of this Western racist  sponsorship are headed by a Washington that has the mentality of  a cowboy who is rancorous over anything that deals with good,  security, and peace.</p>

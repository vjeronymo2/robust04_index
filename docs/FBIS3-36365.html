			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Krayukhin report: "Kronshtadt Remains Russian Naval </F> Base"]    [Excerpts] A report on an "Ostankino" television and radio  company program and in other organs of the mass media stated  that during B.N. Yeltsin's visit to St. Petersburg the Russian  Federation president and the city Mayor A. Sobchak discussed the  future prospects for turning Kronshtadt into a free economic  zone and in this connection the naval base's relocation.  [passage omitted]    Editorial note: On the basis of information from sources  within the Russian Navy Main Staff, IZVESTIYA has been informed  that as yet no specific decision has been made concerning  Kronshtadt. Relocating this naval base really does require  enormous resources which nobody has appropriated, and nobody has  produced a plan to set up a base in another location. Such an  order has not been given. Kronshtadt will remain a Russian  naval base for a long time to come.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: ANC criticises SA Ecu250m Eurobond THE African National Congress (ANC) has attacked European banks for arranging a significant new loan to South Africa, repeating warnings that a future government could review inherited debt dues, Reuter reports. It called the five-year Ecu250m Eurobond unveiled on Monday a gross violation of anti-apartheid sanctions. 'The ANC must once again remind foreign banks and investors of the continuing validity of the economic, and in particular financial, sanctions, against South Africa,' it said. 'We are bound to declare, once again, that a democratic government will carefully assess its obligations to service and take responsibility for debts contracted by the South African government and its various agencies prior to the formation of an interim government and the formal request for the lifting of economic sanctions by such a government.' The latest loan was lead managed by France's Banque Paribas and co-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation.</p>

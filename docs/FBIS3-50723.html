			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Commenting on the News" feature by Miguel de la </F> Guardia for the "Evening Information Review" program]    [Text] Frequently, it has been said that secret or  diplomatic contacts have been made to improve relations between  Cuba and the United States, which have been historically at odds  since the victory of the socialist revolution in Cuba 35 years  ago. Apparently there were some secret contacts during the  administration of President James Carter, according to Carlos  Rafael Rodriguez, vice president of the Council of Ministers of  Cuba, who revealed this in a recent interview.    Interviewed by GRANMA, the Cuban leader revealed some  details  of that communication, although he considered it very unlikely  that there will soon be positive changes in Washington's  attitude toward Havana. At that time, a secret meeting had been  arranged between the high-ranking Cuban leader and then-U.S.  Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, to be held at the apartment of  then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Andrew Young in New York City.  At that time, a surprising accusation by President Carter was  made against Cuba. He accused the Havana Government of being  involved in an internal conflict in the African republic of  Zaire. Vance, coming from a meeting with Soviet Foreign  Minister Andrey Gromyko, was informed by the selfsame Carlos  Rafael Rodriguez of what Carter had said, which also suprised  the secretary of state. Consequently the negotiations were  suspended. It was later seen that Cuba had nothing to do with  the Zaire problem, but the moment for negotiating was over,  Carlos Rafael Rodriguez explained.    We recall that those were the days in which Reagan's  campaign  for the presidency focused on accusing Carter of having a soft  hand on foreign policy matters. Reagan based his campaign on  Carter's inability to free the U.S. hostages being held by the  Iranian Government, which became a scandal as a result of  publicity by the large contingent of U.S. media influenced by  the nation's extreme right. Carter thought it was necessary to  harden his foreign policy positions, thereby foiling the secret  negotiations with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.    Carlos Rafael Rodriguez stated that the current  administration of President William Clinton believes that the  Cuban revolution might collapse at any minute and that is why it  has not shown any interest in promptly settling differences with  Cuba. Carlos Rafael Rodriguez ruled out the violent outcome the  Republican administrations of Reagan and Bush hoped to provoke,  adding that the current policy of Clinton will face the same  fate.    This commentator agrees with the aforesaid position of the  Cuban leader and predicts that it will be too late for  Washington to improve relations, because Cuba is demonstrating  it can once again defeat the empire's pressure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yusuf Bin-'Abdallah Bin-'Alawi, Omani </F> minister of state for foreign affairs, by unidentified  correspondent in Cairo; date not given -- recorded passages in  Arabic processed from Hebrew subtitles]    [Text] This evening for the first time ever, an Israeli  delegation left for Oman in the Persian Gulf. The delegation is  headed by Shlomo Gur, political adviser to the deputy foreign  minister. He is accompanied by the technical team which  prepares for Israel's participation in the multinational  conference on water issues.    In an exclusive interview with MABAT, Yusuf Bin-'Alawi,  Oman's minister of state for foreign affairs, said in Cairo that  there is nothing wrong with inviting Israeli representatives to  his country:    [Begin recording] [Bin-'Alawi] Israel has been attending all  the multinational talks, whether they were held in Arab  countries or in non-Arab countries. That is why one cannot give  up on Israel's participation in such a conference. Israel's  presence at the water conference does not affect the importance  of the goal which, we hope, would serve the best interests of  the Arab nation.    [Correspondent] What do you think about solving the  Palestinian and Syrian water problem with countries such as  Turkey and Israel?    [Bin-'Alawi] The issue must be studied and discussed by all  the countries who will enjoy the arrangement, and those in which  territory the water sources are, where the rivers run.

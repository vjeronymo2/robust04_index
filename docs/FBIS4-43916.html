			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  intends during the German presidency of the European Union [EU]  gradually to achieve majority decisionmaking in foreign and  security policy. Speaking to the press in Bonn today, Kinkel  also called for the "interlocking" of the EU with the Western  European Union (WEU) defense alliance to be pushed forward. A  common European foreign policy is particularly necessary in view  of the events in former Yugoslavia, Kinkel said.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of  Germany) criticized the European Commission's white paper at the  news conference, saying that "a series of interventionist  principles" can be identified in it. Rexrodt argued by contrast  for private initiative to be given priority over state activity.</p>

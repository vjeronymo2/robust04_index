			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / From market demons to policy saints: Currency speculators have rescued EC politicians from their errors As European politicians and bureaucrats ponder how to rescue what is left of the exchange rate mechanism, the battle to 'save' the French franc gives rise to a subversive thought. It is that events in the currency markets since last September have turned the longstanding political demonology of financial markets on its head. The conventional wisdom since the 1930s, particularly in left-of-centre thinking, has been that untamed markets impose deflationary pressure on governments and destabilise policies that enjoy the support of electorates. In the 1980s, even right-of-centre politicians have been increasingly concerned about the capacity of currency markets to overshoot, thereby increasing trade friction. Yet consider what the currency speculators have actually brought about since last September. Away from the core of the ERM, a number of countries, including the UK and Italy, have been saved from needless deflation and even higher unemployment as a result of being forced to abandon the link with the D-Mark. If the Bundesbank decides this week to put the franc on the rack by choosing not to reduce D-Mark interest rates sharply, further speculation could spare the French from both severe deflation and a test of the political structure that might return France to the difficulties of the 1950s and 1960s. Meantime, market pressure has achieved something that the politicians could never have pulled off directly. Huge profits on currency speculation have helped restore bank capital at the taxpayers' expense. Being kind to the banks after the excesses of the 1980s sounds so shocking to the average citizen that this could not have been done by open democratic means. Even in pro-business Japan, public opinion blocked a public sector rescue of ailing banks. But in a debt-induced recession, the restoration of bank capital is a precondition of economic recovery. However unwittingly, the speculators have perpetrated a most constructive act. It is hard to escape the conclusion that the markets have been saving the electorates of Europe from policy, not the other way round; and in most cases, including those of Britain and France, the electorates were not invited to consider any alternative to the key policy mistake on offer. Nor will the markets give up, for whatever the Bundesbank does this week, the speculators have rightly perceived that a rigid link between the franc and the D-Mark is simply unsustainable as long as the strains of German unification persist, which they will do until at least the mid-1990s. This makes a nonsense of the old right-left debate on markets. It seems clear that the lifting of exchange controls, originally imposed in the 1930s, has resulted in newly empowered speculators pushing governments into an earlier recognition of the inconsistencies of their policy stance than would otherwise have been the case. Yet the air is thick with suggestions from left-of-centre economic commentators, and some right-of-centre ones too, for putting glue back into the ERM mechanism. Whatever the political case, the economic case is not being argued from fundamentals - which is probably because, as Keynes remarked, practical men are all slaves of some defunct economist. The defunct economist in this case is, of course, Keynes himself. He provided much of the demonology with his critique of short-termism in the General Theory. This led him to conclude that the state should intervene to take direct responsibility for investment. But he would not have had to reiterate the point today. Indeed, the fiscal legacy of that policy mind-set is set to provide the markets with their next big disciplinary opportunity. Loose fiscal policy is now generating a mountain of debt in the public sectors of the developed world. By the second half of the 1990s it will be very tempting for governments to monetise that debt - that is, to default via inflation. Capital will rush for the exit in anticipation; and the old left-right rhetorical divide may enjoy new life as politicians claim that the markets are sabotaging their efforts. But we may also discover the limits of unfettered financial power. There has to be one creditworthy country in the global system to provide capital with its bolt hole. Today it is Japan. But if Japan succumbs to fiscal laxity - say in an attempt to defuse trade tensions with the US - there will be no inflation-free haven for investors. The market vigilantes' goose will be cooked.</p>

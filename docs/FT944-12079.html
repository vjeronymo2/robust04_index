			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Holman Hunt replica sold for Pounds 1.87m A quarter-size replica of William Holman Hunt's 'The Shadow of Death' realised Pounds 1.87m at Sotheby's, London, setting a new auction record for a pre-Raphaelite picture and the third highest auction price for a Victorian painting. The replica was made by Hunt for the use of the engraver. The same bidder also paid Pounds 166,500 for DG Rossetti's portrait in chalks of his sister, the poet Christina Rossetti. London dealers McConnal Mason, who have frequently acted for composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, paid a record Pounds 551,500 for Poynter's highly erotic sirens of 'The Cave of the Storm Nymphs' although the painting was last seen at auction six years ago when it fetched Pounds 440,000. Mr David Mason also bid a record Pounds 168,700 for the Pre-Raphaelite James Collinson's 'The Emigration Scheme'. Albert Moore's tribute to the art of music fared less well and was bought in at Pounds 500,000. The sale totalled Pounds 4,520,849 with 79.5 per cent sold by value.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSITIVE ROLE MODEL  </P> <P> Nothing could have pleased me more than reading the Willie Bogan story ("Glory  Redux" by Nikki Finke, May 16).  </P> <P> It was, in fact, a thrilling read, and a reminder of the old, glory days when  poor but hard-working and ambitious black American parents -- as many still do  today -- inspired their children to seek higher education "as a way out" and  when those children, motivated by their parents, became academic All-Americans,  or students first, athletes second.  </P> <P> I wish there were a Hall of Fame for such unsung parents today because whenever  and wherever you find a Willie Bogan, invariably you find heroic parents. On  second thought, however, they probably feel properly honored by the successes  of their great sons and daughters.  </P> <P> Willie Bogan stands tall as a genuine role model for all young Americans, and  this is one of the most important stories the Los Angeles Times has published  in a long, long time.  </P> <P> A.S.

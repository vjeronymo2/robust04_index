			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nigeria's head of mission in Benin Republic, Mr.  Ayor Adigun, has called for an emergency meeting of the Economic  Community of West African States, ECOWAS, to discuss the  emerging economic changes in the subregion. Mr. Adigun, who was  speaking in Cotonou, said that the meeting had become imperative  in view of the recent devaluation of the CFA franc and other  geopolitical changes in the subregion. The Nigerian envoy, who  drew an analogy between the EEC and ECOWAS, pointed out that the  imminent emergence of majority rule in South Africa, has made  the EEC shift its focus toward that country. He also spoke of  the need for ECOWAS member countries to highlight the things  that were of mutual benefit to them.    Meanwhile, the transborder commercial activities between  Nigeria and Benin Republic have reduced substantially following  the January 12 devaluation of the CFA franc. A survey shows  that the usual traffic congestion at the border town of Seme has  dropped. The secondhand goods market across the border at Seme  has been virtually empty [words indistinct].</p>

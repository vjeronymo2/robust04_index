			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for oil majors A SERIES of forecast reductions for oil prices and company earnings and dividends by a number of leading broking houses left the oil majors in disarray, with the sector relative at its lowest level since 1989. At the end of a busy session in the oils, BP was 12 1/2 down at 278p on heavy turnover of 9.4m shares, Shell 10 lower at 488p on 4.3m and Enterprise 11 weaker at 434p on 856,000. The oil price forecast cuts were instigated by James Capel and Hoare Govett, and are likely to be followed by other brokers, according to dealers. James Capel was thought to have lowered its oil estimate to Dollars 20 a barrel from Dollars 21, and Hoare said it had shifted its forecast to Dollars 20. The real damage to BP's share price, however, came from the earnings and dividend reductions said to have been carried out by Capel, which was thought to have reduced its full-year net income estimate for BP to Pounds 950m. This compares with a majority of estimates above Pounds 1bn. The broker was also thought to have adopted a cautious line on fourth-quarter dividend expectation. Oil companies have been hit by a combination of falling oil prices and adverse currency movements. Eurotunnel firm A French press report that Eurotunnel was close to settling its dispute with contractors TML sent the former's shares leaping 22 to 420p. The financial daily Agefi reported that an agreement would be concluded this month and that Eurotunnel's provisions for the deal, made in its last accounts, would cover most of the cost of the renegotiated construction contract. BAe lacks support The implications of negative speculation at the weekend regarding British Aerospace's (BAe) chances of winning the second phase of the Pounds 2.5bn Al Yamamah defence contract continued to depress the shares yesterday. The company's insistence that these negotiations are at an advanced stage, was counterbalanced by news yesterday that US sales of the Range Rover, manufactured by Rover, BAe's UK car manufacturing subsidiary, fell by nearly 28 per cent last year. This blow follows a bearish note last week from Nomura, the Japanese securities house, which reportedly referred to disparaging remarks about Rover by Sir Peter Levene, the former head of Britain's defence procurement. After an initial fall to 282p, the shares rallied to close 3 down at 288p. BT 'new' edged higher to 125 1/4 p on heavy turnover of 20m shares; today is the last session in which SG Warburg Securities, global co-ordinator of the government's sale, is allowed to 'stabilise' the share price. Bank shares were among the weakest of the Footsie constituents, upset by continuing worries about the level of provisions against bad debts to be included in their preliminary figures, expected next month. Adding to the gloom in the sector was a story that a leading UK agency broker had downgraded the whole of the sector. One stock to stand out against the trend was Standard Chartered, where a flurry of buying, part speculative and part recovery, left the shares 11 higher at 433p on relatively heavy turnover of 1.9m. The downgrade stories weighed heavily on NatWest, which dropped 15 to 270p in exceptionally heavy trading of 6.1m, and Barclays, down 9 at 364p on 4m. More downgrades and sell recommendations on NatWest are said to be in the pipeline. Composite insurers were well supported, with buying interest prompted by a positive note from Kleinwort Benson Securities. Kleinwort said it believed: 'The worst is now behind the sector, which may now be at the bottom of the trading range; sustained outperformance is expected later in the year.' Its best buy in the sector is Guardian Royal Exchange, up 3 at 121p on very heavy turnover of 5.1m. Health and household sector shares reversed early gains as investors took profits after the recent rallies. Sellers were also motivated by weekend press reports that leading drugs companies were likely to face pressure to cut their prices. Wellcome was finally down 29 at 1062p, after touching 1119p, as investors reconsidered reports on tests for a new combination Aids treatment using two Wellcome drugs. The shares had risen sharply on the reports last week. Glaxo lost 8 on the day at 845p after being up 15 initially. SmithKline Beecham held steady for most of the session, receiving some support from news that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved a minor drug. However, the shares slipped later to close 3 off at 900p. ICI managed to remain firm at 1194p following recent comment about the company's anti-cancer drug. Ratners shares, under relentless downward pressure since October last year, dropped to a record low of 18p before stabilising and ending a difficult session only marginally easier at 21 1/2 p. Turnover reached 4m. The latest slide was triggered by a number of bearish stories in the weekend press suggesting that the company had endured a decline in sales over the Christmas period. But the stock picked up after hints in the market that some big management changes may be in the pipeline, along with a debt restructuring programme. Other retailing shares also took a pasting. Argos, the specialist catalogue-showroom retailer, dropped 15 to 256p and Kingfisher, weakened by a bearish review of the DIY companies published by the influential County NatWest retailing team, fell 18 to 446p. Details of J. Sainsbury's price-cutting promotion were received calmly by the market and food retailing shares perked up as dealers took the view that the move was nothing out of the ordinary. Sainsbury managed a minor gain at 360p, Asda hardened to 33p and Tesco eased a fraction to 224p. Argyll edged up 3 to 277p. A Kleinwort Benson note highlighting the 'generous' yields on food shares boosted Unigate, 6 higher at 278p. Strong brewery shares reflected the continuing pressure imposed by one big buyer in a tight sector last week. Bass, up 12 to 1019p, was helped by a buy note from Panmure Gordon; Whitbread continued to recover and gained 13 to 463p; and Grand Metropolitan and Guinness improved 13 to 911p and 11 to 553p respectively as investors sought out quality stocks. Ladbroke attempted to instill some new year cheer into its recent poor form with the announcement that its Texas DIY chain had increased sales over the Christmas period by 15 per cent. The shares put on 3 to 223p, but analysts were less enthusiatic. Paul Heath at UBS commented: 'Despite the fact that they took 25 per cent off everything at Texas anyway, I am more worried that recent dollar movements are going against Ladbroke.' Profit-taking took the wind out of Airtours' sails in spite of the group announcing a deal with the leading holiday tour operators to sell Airtours packages. The announcement, made towards the end of trading, could not halt a slide in the shares of 21 to 874p. Buying in a tight market ensured strength in Reuters Holdings, which ended 11 up at 1055p after being 25 ahead at one stage, with volume reaching about 1m shares. Observers said general optimism was being driven by hopes of a forthcoming share split. Conglomerate BTR suffered initially from speculation - soon rejected - regarding the wellbeing of its chief executive. The shares fell 7 against the market on talk that Mr Alan Jackson would be retiring through ill health. However, securities houses telephoned the company and satisfied themselves that the talk was, in the words of one analyst: 'A classic market rumour that swept around and went as quickly as it came.' The stock rallied to close a penny firmer on balance at 397p with 3.2m shares traded. On hearing the stories, the company said: 'Mr Jackson is hale and hearty and not going to stand down.' Several engineering groups benefited from weekend press tips. Fairey Group moved ahead 11 to 317p. Dealers reported more heavy switching out of the electricity distribution stocks and into the power generators. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (63).

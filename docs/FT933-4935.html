			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Brussels to side-step UK on works councils issue THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday served notice that as soon as the Maastricht treaty has been ratified it will side-step the resistance of the British government and push ahead with the directive on establishing works councils for consulting employees in large companies. Mr Padraig Flynn, social and employment affairs commissioner, said yesterday in an address to the British Trades Union Congress conference in Brighton that all Community countries except Britain had agreed to start implementing the directive, which will affect about 700 larger companies in Europe. Britain will not be directly affected, as it has opted out of the Maastricht treaty social chapter, but about 100 UK multinationals will be drawn in through their European subsidiaries. Assuming that the Maastricht treaty is ratified in November, the works council legislation could become law, after a period of consultation, within six months. Mr Flynn said he regretted the British 'opt-out' from the social chapter and hoped that the UK would rejoin the other 11 before 'too huge a chasm' has built up on social legislation. But he also confirmed that the Commission last week agreed an 'opinion' on equitable wages, which has no legislative force but underlines the philosophical difference between the UK government, which has been abol-ishing minimum wage legislation, and the European Commission. Mr Flynn also lent his backing to the idea of a world social charter. In his address to the TUC, Mr Flynn stressed that a new balance 'between regulation and adaptability' was required to help create a 'more employment-intensive pattern of production'. Calling for a 'new social pact' to beat unemployment, he pleased his TUC audience by stressing that wage competition with countries of the Pacific Rim was not a sensible strategy but he also said that everyone would have to 'give up many cherished preconceptions'. He suggested, in particular, reform of tax regimes to help job creation and further reductions and changes in working time, 'bearing in mind that work sharing implies income sharing'.</p>

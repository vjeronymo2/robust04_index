			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Personal View: Now is the time to spend - Japan must boost demand-led growth and open its markets The US and Japan are committed to strengthening and renewing their partnership by adopting a new economic frame-work. This approach re-cognises that strategic continuity in the relationship will require economic discontinuity - a fundamental change in Japan in the way economic integration is promoted and its benefits shared. The US is concerned with two enduring features of Japan's relationship with the world economy. Japan has an imbalance problem - a chronic external surplus rooted in macroeconomic forces. And it has a penetration problem - a peculiar resistance to foreign goods, services and investment that cannot be explained by benign factors like geography, a modest endowment of natural resources, or the competitiveness of its producers. Excessive current account surpluses are always a global problem, because they invite pressures for protection. In today's global economic environment where demand is limited, with America and Europe consolidating their fiscal positions and the world suffering below-par growth, Japan's growing external surpluses are particularly significant. What the world needs from Japan now is a sustained period of domestic demand-led growth, making Japan a net provider of, rather than a net drain on, jobs elsewhere. The extra demand that would be created by a return of the Japanese current account surplus to its historically average level of 1 1/2 per cent of gross national product would be enough to create more than Dollars 60bn in additional exports from the rest of the world, which would translate into an extra 1m-2m jobs. A reduction in the surplus of this magnitude is a prudent and realistic objective for the Japanese government. Indeed, a more ambitious objective of reducing the surplus from its 1990 level of 1.2 per cent of GNP was embraced by the Japanese government in 1991. Fiscal expansion to spur domestic demand and reduce the current account surplus is consistent with Japan's long-run and short-run objectives: Japan still has by far the largest fiscal cushion in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Even after the last two stimulus packages, Japan has a structural general government surplus, and the net stock of outstanding public debt is negligible in relation to GNP unlike the rest of the G7. Inflation is under control and excess capacity is growing. Consumption-led growth fuelled by fiscal policy measures will not lead to asset price bubbles. The bubble economy in the late 1980s was not caused by too much growth in domestic demand; witness relatively stable inflation. It was caused by excessive liquidity and savings, which were the consequence of excessively tight fiscal policy and loose monetary policy. Increased infrastructure spending is a better way to prepare for the challenge of an ageing society than the prodigious accumulation of low-yielding financial assets. Right now, the world needs Japanese demand much more than it needs Japanese savings. The barrier to increased investment in the industrialised and the developing world is low capacity utilisation and low investment demand, not an inadequate supply of capital. Credibility is like capital. Accumulating credibility for fiscal rectitude is not particularly valuable unless you are occasionally prepared to spend some of it. If there was ever a time in Japan, that time is now. Japan has frustrated foreign businessmen even in years when its surplus was relatively low. Because of its low level of import penetration, the market share of imported manufacturing goods in Japan is only half what it is in the US or the European Community. Some people misinterpret these statistics as evidence that Japan is more competitive than its competitors. That may be tempting, but it is not compelling. In a broad range of high-tech manufactured goods, US manufacturers outstrip Japanese producers in third markets, but cannot get a foot in the door in Japan. Japan's closed market and the hostility it engenders is a significant threat to the multilateral trading system. As long as Japanese trade barriers keep foreign products out and Japan continues to run large surpluses, it is difficult to mobilise support for reducing trade barriers in other countries. In line with its commitment to multilateralism, America's goal in the ongoing negotiations on a new economic framework is to open Japanese markets for the benefit of producers from all countries. Trade barrier reduction is sought solely on a most favoured nation basis. The focus of the new framework is on results, not because of any desire to cut special deals for US producers unable to make it on their own, but to ensure that market outcomes are allowed to prevail. Contrary to some suggestions, the US is not proposing hair trigger retaliation based on single market share targets for uncompetitive US producers. But the ultimate test of any trade agreement is the changes it brings about. And it is difficult to see any other way than by looking at benchmarks to monitor progress. The US government is not seeking to manage trade. That would be wrong - damaging to its own interests and to the whole trading system. But it is right to try to unmanage trade. Removing discrimination by the government in procurement is not managing trade. Expanding opportunities for foreign producers in markets where they face anticompetitive business practices abetted by the government is not managing trade. Increasing the number of operating licences granted to foreign companies in regulated industries is not managing trade. The lesson of trade negotiations with Japan is that exceptional measures are sometimes necessary. There are areas where the liberalisation of formal trade barriers has not been accompanied by improved performance by competitive foreign producers, thus further deterring those companies from investing in Japan. This chicken and egg problem may require a temporary jolt, to give foreign companies the opportunities they would enjoy in fully competitive markets. The US-Japan economic partnership over the past 45 years has been as productive as any economic alliance in history. Both countries must do their part to ensure equal success in the future.

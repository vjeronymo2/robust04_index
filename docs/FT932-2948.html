			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dairy farmers look forward to higher prices for milk DAIRY FARMERS can look forward to higher prices for their milk when the market is liberalised and the Milk Marketing Board is abolished in April next year, according to Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the MMB. 'European milk prices are a lot higher than ours - only three countries pay prices as low as in the UK - and most UK milk is of a higher quality than the lower fat European varieties,' Mr Dare said. He expects farmers to see an additional couple of pence per litre for their milk in spite of an over-supply in the market. Interest from farmers in the Milk Marque - the planned successor to the MMB  -has been encouraging and the board hopes to be able to sign up 80 per cent of farmers for the new voluntary co-operative. Some food companies are setting up schemes to buy milk directly from farmers, but Mr Dare said these were asking farmers to adopt a high risk strategy by linking themselves to the fortunes of just one customer. This year's milk price to farmers is 22p per litre and is likely to rise to 23p per litre by the beginning of next year, Mr Dare said. The MMB's costs came to 1.4p per litre of which 1.1p goes on transport. Announcing the MMB's annual accounts, Mr Dare said last year had produced a surplus of Pounds 2.31bn for producers compared with Pounds 2.23bn the year before. The amount of milk sold by the MMB dropped slightly by one per cent to just over 11m litres. The doorstep market for milk declined 7 per cent but this was compensated by an increase in shop sales. The number of milk producers, however, continued to decline last year when the number of registered dairy farmers dropped by 2.6 per cent.</p>

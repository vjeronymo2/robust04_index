			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Observer: Goodbye Ojai Kleinwort Benson must be ruing the day it ever heard of Kenneth McCormick and Ojai. Until a year or so ago, McCormick was one of the darlings of the Kleinwort Group and Ojai (pronounced O-hi) was best known as a Californian shangri-la - a small town with just one traffic light and a music festival. An American banker who rose fast up the swinging Californian banking tree, McCormick became treasurer of First Interstate of Los Angeles while only just into his 30s. There he became adept at the swaps business, and was hired by Kleinwort to set up and run their fledgling US swaps operation in 1985. A tall, soft-spoken man with a sharp eye for the market, he quickly turned it into a success. The business flourished, earning Kleinwort several million dollars a year. But like many Californians, McCormick was also interested in the venture capital business, and persuaded Kleinwort to help finance a new investment vehicle, Ojai Capital, which would specialise in funding business start-ups and real estate projects. At the time, Kleinwort said the financing 'had been negotiated on an arm's length basis' and it considered the transaction 'to be in the best interests of the group and its share- holders.' Some Dollars 23m later, McCormick is out of the door with a promise that Kleinwort will not try to sue him. It all smacks yet again of a fringe player trying to buy into a market it should never have got into in the first place.</p>

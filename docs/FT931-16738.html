			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies Perhaps Mr Jurgen Mollemann should be awarded the legiond'honneur for resigning as Germany's economics minister. His departure certainly helped weaken the D-Mark yesterday. That in turn made for a less determined new year offensive against the French franc than many had expected. Holding the line over the next few weeks may not be easy, however, especially since France appears to have dipped into its foreign exchange reserves in the second half of December. True, that matters less if the Bundesbank is prepared to finance further intervention. Much depends on German commitment and skill in managing the markets. The Bundesbank will be teasing dealers today with its first money market repurchase agreements of 1993. By moving out along the yield curve - this package will include some one-month repurchases - it has created an opportunity for a cut in the headline repurchase rate. That might buy time, but it could as easily blow up in the Bundesbank's face by creating false expectations of lower money market rates. Pressure on the franc will not go away until the Bundesbank signals unequivocally that a substantial monetary easing is in prospect.</p>

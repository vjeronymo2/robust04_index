			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Swiss to trim budget deficit The Swiss government is making progress towards reducing a budget deficit that was driven up to 19 per cent of spending last year by soaring welfare payments. Berne is projecting an 11 per cent reduction of this year's deficit to SFr6.9bn (Pounds 3.45bn) and a further 6 per cent cut to SFr6.5bn next year. With net debt service costs amounting to less than 5 per cent of spending and total federal debt of SFr70bn at the end of last year representing only 20 per cent of gross domestic product, the government is not in difficulty. But double digit growth rates in interest charges in the past two years have caused concern. Spending is set to increase only 4.9 per cent this year to SFr42.6bn and to rise a negligible 0.8 per cent next year after a 7.4 per cent jump in 1993, mainly because demand for welfare payments is easing as the economy recovers. Revenues, which plunged 6 per cent last year to SFr32.8bn, are expected to advance 8.6 per cent this year and a further 2.1 per cent next year when a value added tax comes into effect.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Senegal in 'debt for children' swap A Dutch aid organisation has bought Dollars 24m of Senegalese foreign debt and converted it into projects for women and children in the west African nation. The Netherlands Unicef Committee cancelled Senegal's entire bilateral debt with Argentina in a buy-back operation managed by Internationale Nederlanden Bank NV (ING Bank). In return, the government of Senegal has agreed to invest Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.3m) in Unicef projects ranging from child immunisation programmes to the education of street children in Dakar. The debt-for-children swap was first proposed by President Abdou Diouf of Senegal in 1990. Since then, debt conversions have benefited children in Madagascar, Jamaica and the Philippines. 'The debt conversion has reduced Senegal's overall debt burden while releasing extra resources for the country's women and children,' said Mr Samir Sobhi at Unicef's office in Dakar.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Early halt to CFC output is announced THE UK will stop making ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of 1995, the Department of the Environment and ICI, the country's largest chemical manufacturer, said yesterday. That will be two years ahead of the European Community deadline and five years ahead of the internationally agreed Montreal Protocol. The commitment matches the announcement by President Bush on Tuesday that the US would stop producing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals causing most damage to the earth's protective ozone layer, by the end of 1995. Both countries are accelerating the phase-out of CFCs in the light of new evidence that the upper atmosphere is losing ozone far more rapidly than scientists had realised previously. An 'ozone hole' may appear over densely populated regions of the northern hemisphere, letting in harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said it was not enough for the UK just to echo the new US timetable. Ms Tracy Heslop of Greenpeace called for an immediate ban. 'All John Major has to do is pick up the phone to ICI to stop the production of ozone destroyers,' she said. Mr John Beckett, who is managing ICI's phase-out of CFCs, said an immediate halt was not practical because many users, particularly in the refrigeration industry, still had no available substitutes. ICI halved CFC production from 80,000 tonnes in 1986 to 40,000 tonnes last year, and the company has committed Pounds 200m to the development and manufacturing of alternatives. People are still not taking the CFC phase-out seriously enough, according to Mr Beckett. 'We at ICI have had a free CFC recycling and recovery scheme for some time and we're very disappointed at the response,' he said. He added that ICI's new plant at Runcorn, Cheshire, which produces a non-ozone-destroying substitute for CFC coolants, was running below full capacity. Yesterday Mr Klaus Toepfer, Germany's environment minister, urged the EC and the US to help bring forward to 1995 the worldwide ban on ozone-destroying chemicals. Mr Toepfer said such a deadline should be set by a conference next November in Copenhagen of 46 industrial and developing countries which are signatories to the Montreal Protocol. He said he was in touch with his EC and US counterparts about a joint push for a worldwide ban by 1995. Mr Toepfer is also pressing German industry to stop making and using CFCs next year. 'Germany will become the first CFC-free country in the world in 1993,' he said.</p>

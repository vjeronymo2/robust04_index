			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Pope widens electoral base for choice of his successor Pope John Paul II yesterday nominated 30 new cardinals, further broadening the international base from which a future pontiff will be chosen. The most politically innovative of the choices are the appointments of cardinals serving in Albania, the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, Cuba, and Belarus, as well as the Lebanese patriarch, Nasrallah Pierre Sfeir. The move to increase the number of cardinals - the highest ranking members of the Catholic hierarchy with the sole right to elect a new pope - had been foreshadowed. However, the decision was made earlier than expected and comes against a background of the 74-year-old pontiff's declining health. Vatican watchers said the Pope had tended to choose persons generally sympathetic to his conservative ethical views. Within this, he had considerably broadened the geographical spread, especially to former communist eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. Nevertheless, four new appointees are Italian and the Europeans still dominate the cardinals' conclave. Britain gained a cardinal with the nomination of Mons Thomas Winning, Archbishop of Glasgow. The cardinals will be formally proclaimed at a special consistory in Rome on November 26. The precise number of new cardinals shows that Pope John Paul II is anxious to respect the informal limit of 120 electors under the age of 80 set by his predecessors. At the time of the consistory 96 cardinals will be below the age of 80, while six of the new cardinals will be over that. In the event of a new conclave 100 of the 120 cardinals would have been chosen by Pope John Paul II. Of the total, 55 would be from east and west Europe (20 of whom are Italian), 33 from the Americas, 15 from Africa, 14 from Asia and three from Oceania.</p>

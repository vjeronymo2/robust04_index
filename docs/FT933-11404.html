			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sun Microsystems beats predictions in final term SUN Microsystems, the US computer group, exceeded market expectations as it reported that net income in the last quarter of its financial year to the end of June was more than double the level of a year ago, but warned that recession in Europe would harm results for the current quarter. 'While weak economies in Europe and other international markets pose a significant challenge for our first fiscal quarter and could exacerbate the normal summer seasonal weakness, our product lines are in an excellent position,' said Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer. Turnover climbed 30 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn, during the three months to the end of June, from Dollars 972m in the same period in 1992. The system software company sold 140,000 software product licences, while Sun Microsystems Computer shipped a record 71,000 computer systems and 92,000 processors. Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 76.1m, or 72 cents a share, from Dollars 37.7m, or 37 cents a year ago. For the financial year, net income slipped to Dollars 156.7m from Dollars 173.3m on turnover of Dollars 4.3bn up from Dollars 3.6bn. Mr Melia said headway had been made in bringing costs under control. Operating expenses as a proportion of total revenue were 5 1/2 percentage points lower in the fourth quarter than a year before.</p>

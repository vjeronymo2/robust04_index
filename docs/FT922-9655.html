			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / US steps up threat to seize Iraqi assets WASHINGTON has stepped up talks with its Gulf war allies on a proposal to appropriate frozen Iraqi assets to pay for humanitarian needs and United Nations programmes in the country. The US is pressing Britain and France to consider framing a Security Council resolution to enable the spending of some of the Dollars 5bn in Iraqi overseas assets frozen since the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Washington's renewed vigour in pursuit of a proposal which has been in the air for some weeks is aimed at forcing Baghdad into accepting the terms of a UN-permitted sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of Iraqi oil to buy food and medicines. A western diplomat in New York said: 'Iraq is being told, either do a deal with the UN, or we'll spend your assets.' Talks between Iraq and the UN on a limited sale of oil have remained deadlocked, with Iraq maintaining that the UN supervised terms for the sale, and for spending the revenues, are an unacceptable abrogation of its sovereignty. Mr Abdul Razzak al-Hiti, Iraq's oil minister, said at the Opec summit last month that an agreement on the oil sale could take only 'a few days' to work out, but no date has been set for further talks and oil analysts believe Iraq is unlikely to resume any oil sales before the end of this year. Mr Abdul Amir al-Abnari, Iraq's representative at the UN who has led negotiations over the permitted oil sale, has flown to Baghdad for talks with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, and is expected to escort him on a trip within the next few days to non-aligned UN member countries. Mr Aziz is expected first to visit Rabat, capital of Morocco, the sole Arab country presently on the UN Security Council. US officials say an appropriation of frozen Iraqi assets could easily be enacted. However, Britain and France have been less enthusiastic about the possible legal ramifications of such a move. Bankers and lawyers in London say an assets appropriation would have to be backed up by passage of domestic legislation to protect banks against potential future Iraqi claims on the seized assets. Just over Dollars 530m of frozen Iraqi money lies in London banks. Bankers also say that they would be unhappy about the effect any such appropriation would have on the view of London as a financial centre: 'It's Iraq this time - but who might it be later? That would be the thinking,' said one banker. The US treasury is also understood to be worried that any Iraqi assets spent on humanitarian needs would not then be available to offset claims by US companies against Iraq. 'The problem is we have more claims against Iraq than we have money,' said one US official. More than Dollars 1.4bn of Iraqi assets are locked in US banks. Money secured, either through an oil sale or appropriation of assets would be spent largely on food and medicine, with 30 per cent used to pay for compensation to victims of the invasion of Kuwait and for UN programmes in the country. Syria denied a report that it was importing Iraqi oil, which is under a UN embargo, and exporting it mixed with its own crude, Reuter reports from Damascus. Dadoud Hido, president of Sytrol, the body responsible for marketing Syrian oil, said the increase in his country's oil exports was a result of newly discovered oilfields coming onstream. He denied a report in Petroleum Intelligence Weekly last month that Syria was mixing its oil with Iraqi crude.</p>

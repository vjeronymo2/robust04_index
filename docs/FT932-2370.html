			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / NZ governor praises merits of independence for central banks THE anti-inflation policies of New Zealand's independent central bank are credible because any government decision to override its targets has to be public and formal, its governor said in London yesterday. Mr Don Brash has headed the Reserve Bank of New Zealand since its independence was established by law in 1989. Its success in bringing down inflation to 1 per cent has provoked discussion about its suitability as a model for Britain. In a speech to the European Policy Forum, Mr Brash said the New Zealand experience had shown that 'under a Westminster style of government, central bank independence can be reconciled with political accountability.' He added: 'While we are sometimes described as the world's most independent central bank, our governing legislation explicitly acknowledges the role of government.' The governor is personally responsible for meeting policy targets - currently, for consumer price inflation between zero and 2 per cent - agreed by the finance minister and Reserve Bank. But the law also provides for government to change the targets. However, Mr Brash said, there could be no 'secret, under-the-table instruction to allow slippage from the price stability target.' The government must do so openly, and new policy targets must be publicly agreed if necessary. He said the override provision was a strength rather than a weakness. 'Where trade-offs are to be made between or among policy objectives, it is vital for good economic management that the nature of the choices being made are well understood.' Mr Brash said the override provision enhanced the credibility of the bank's commitment to stable prices. 'If people are reluctant to believe that the central bank is serious about tackling inflation, then the costs of meeting this objective are likely to be much higher.' The New Zealand system also allows for departure from the stable pricing target in the event of unpredictable shocks, such as a sharp rise in oil prices or an increase in the rate of value added tax.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Repellant for some, but ferociously effective for vikings Sir, You reported ('Man bites midge', August 6/7) that the bog myrtle, 'one of the least productive features of the Scottish Highlands', now is ripe for exploitation as a base for a natural insect repellant. There is another use for bog myrtle. As a herb, it can be used to spice vodka to a rich and full flavour. A glass jar, say half a litre size, is filled with the spring leaves of the bog myrtle, after which the leaves are drenched in vodka. After some four days the essence is separated and the leaves thrown away. The essence should then be poured into fresh vodka to the proportion of 1:10. The legend has it that the vikings also used to spice their beer with bog myrtle, which was said to make them especially ferocious. Or perhaps they used it as a repellant.

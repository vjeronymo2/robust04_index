			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Danny Morrison, a Sinn Fein "strategist": </F> "Morrison: Why We Haven't Said `Yes'" -- last four paragraphs  are IRISH PRESS footnote]    [Text] On December 15, the BBC broadcast live the release  of the Downing Street Declaration.    Extended bulletins coincided with one of our lock-up periods  here, but a large number of us put our names down for the  canteen, where there is a television, and watched events unfold.    Whoever first described the Declaration as a "masterpiece of  ambiguity" was telling no lie.    There was little mistaking the smug tone of John Major in  the  Commons later that afternoon, when he interpreted the  Declaration as meaning:    "No" to united Ireland, or to the value of achieving a  United  Ireland.    "No" to joint authority    "No" to any change in the Unionist veto.    Later, his Government's pro-Unionist bias became even more  evident when he said: "I have gone to great trouble to ensure  that the constitutional guarantee is firmly enshrined in the  joint declaration.    "So there can be no doubt that those people who care about  the Union -- and we are primarily concerned about the people in  Northern Ireland who care about the Union -- shall have it  within their own hands, with the full support of the government,  to remain within the Union for so long as that is their wish."    You might think that people serving 25 to 35 years'  imprisonment would be clutching at every straw, would have been  reduced to a measure of desperation by the vicissitudes of a  long, hard, unprecedented and seemingly endless struggle.    Not so.    Sacrifices have been made, are being made and will continue  to be made until the conditions for a peace are at least  approximated.    The problem does not lie in the 26 counties. While Albert  Reynolds is perceived as more sincere and committed than any  other Taoiseach in the past 25 years, and although he is a  co-signatory to the Declaration, the fact remains that it is the  British who exercise power and control over the North -- and  appear not to be prepared to relinquish or share it.    It is the British whom we do not trust.    I remember a written British declaration to the Blanket-men  in December, 1980, offering them peace and progress in this jail  if they would only end the hunger strike. But when that hunger  strike was ended, Britain reneged on its declaration and put the  boot in.    The result was the second hunger strike, 10 men dead and  scores of others killed on the streets. My analogy is that  acceptance of the Declaration -- about which we do not have all  the facts -- followed by disillusionment as a result of  misunderstanding, could put back the hopes for peace.    In our contribution to Sinn Fein's Commission for Peace, we  have said that we realise there will be a crucial stage, "a  negotiating stage, a time of potential peace and perhaps  imperfect peace, but a genuine peace, when many of our demands  may not be met."    We have said: "We realise that at such a crucial stage we  will have to compromise to close gaps, to demonstrate gestures  of reconciliation, to give assurances and to move the situation  forward. It is time the British government expressed a similar  willingness."    It appears to have given no ground. In the language of  "throwing down the gauntlet" and "no quarter" there is no room  for dissent.    It threatens increased repression if we reject the  Declaration. It refuses to clarify.    Are these the actions of a party interested in making peace?    Northern Editor Anne Cadwallader writes: Danny Morrison, one  of the leading political strategists in Sinn Fein over the past  20 years, is serving an eight-year sentence for false  imprisonment.    In this article, detailing his response to the Declaration,  he quotes for the first time from the prisoners' submission to  the Sinn Fein Peace Commission and provides a unique insight  into party thinking, both inside and outside the Maze [prison].    In the 10 weeks since the Declaration was signed, the  prisoners have been debating their response, one that will be  carefully studied by their republican colleagues outside and by  the two governments. Significantly, as Morrison reveals, the  prisoners' submission to the Peace Commission refers to the need  for "compromise," and indicates that Sinn Fein might need to  accept an "imperfect peace" in the short term.    His comments that the republican movement will need to move  to "close gaps" and make "gestures of reconciliation" is the  type of language that will be welcomed by the government.</p>

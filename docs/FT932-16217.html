			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Launch may end an era on Tyneside TYNESIDE shipyard workers gathered yesterday to watch the launch at Swan Hunter of HMS Richmond, a Type 23 frigate (left) hoping it will not be the last in the north-east's shipbuilding history. The ship is the last in Swan Hunter's present order book. The Tyneside company is itself the last shipbuilder in a region that used to produce about two of every five ships built in the world. The launch of the Duchess of York in 1928 (far left) from Palmers in Jarrow was just one of many days when huge crowds turned out. Swan Hunter, founded in 1874, has launched more than 400 warships. The future of the Tyneside company as a shipbuilder hangs on its bid for a Ministry of Defence helicopter carrier, an order worth around Pounds 170m, for which it is fighting Barrow-in-Furness-based VSEL.</p>

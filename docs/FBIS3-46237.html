In  particular, as Hainan is located in the forefront of national  defense, it is more important to strengthen this work. All  levels of party committees, governments, and military  departments should take reform as a driving force, adapt  themselves to the development of the socialist market economy,  and make a success of the work concerning the armed forces and  militia reserve service, to provide a solid safety guarantee for  Hainan's development and construction. We should continue to  exercise party leadership over the armed forces. All levels of  party committees should pay close attention to this and should  put the improvement of militia reserve service, the people's  armed forces departments, and military garrisons on their  agenda. There is a need to put the stress of military reserve  service on grass-roots-level organizations. Grass-roots-level  organizations are the foundation of the reserve forces and  should be consolidated so as to improve the military reserve  forces' combat effectiveness and bring into better play the role  of the militia reserve forces in Hainan's two civilizations.

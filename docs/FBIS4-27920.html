			<p>CSO     [Text] In order to prevent the generation of  trihalomethane, a carcinogenic substance which is formed during  tap water disinfection by chlorine, a basic policy on  preservation of water quality in tap water source water areas  established by the Environment Agency [EA] was approved by the  cabinet on 17. Although harmful substances such as cadmium were  already regulated by the Water Quality Pollution Prevention Law,  trihalomethane, a secondary generation, had been placed outside  the subject of regulation. Moreover, according to results of  earlier surveys by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, it has  been revealed that the greatest value of trihalomethane  concentration in 110 water purification plants of 94 concerns  nationwide has exceeded 70 percent of the water quality standard  for the past three years. In the midst of this, a special  measures law was newly put into effect on 10 May with  trihalomethane the target of regulation, narrowing the focus to  tap water source water areas. Along with this, the EA recently  established basic policy to make the law effective and provided  specific application procedures. In the future, based on the  demands of the waterworks industry, the EA will seek the  provision of high-level water purification treatment facilities  such as ozone treatment and granular activated charcoal  treatment on a case-by-case basis, in addition to drainage  regulations for plants and business establishments that are  considered to discharge substances that are the source of  trihalomethane in upstream river areas.</p>

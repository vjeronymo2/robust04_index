			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- There are no Georgian  guerrilla groups in the Abkhazian Gali region, says a statement  of plenipotentiary representative of the Georgian state head on  settlement in Abkhazia Aleksandr Kavsadze received by ITAR-TASS  today from the press center of the Georgian Embassy in Russia.    The statement refutes Abkhazian claims that 250 armed  Georgians allegedly crossed the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation  line along the Inguri River to terrorize the local Abkhazian  population.    Kavsadze "personally controls the regional situation and can  say for sure there are no Georgian guerrilla groups or other  units on territory of the Gali region. Such Abkhazian reports  aim to prepare the public for a new wave of deportation of the  remaining Georgian population from the Gali region."</p>

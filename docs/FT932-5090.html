			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK INDEX futures and share options were in negative form yesterday and helped to undermine the equity market itself. However, business in derivatives was mostly left to the locals, or independent traders. Traded options featured a large trade in Amstrad, the consumer electronics company. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE Index came in for selling as the market repositioned itself for the new equity trading account which will take in the expiry of the June contract. Locals tried to take the contract higher at first but soon found no buyers were around, a factor which dominated derivatives throughout the session. The June contract then fell to a discount of around 7 points to cash, with Fair Value at 5. By the close, the contract was virtually in line with the cash market, considered by traders to be a realistic rating as it moves towards expiry. Total contracts in traded options increased from 24,467 to 28,691 with Amstrad (6,422) the active feature.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANS FOR MALIBU EQUESTRIAN CENTER APPROVED BY STATE, SCHOOL DISTRICT  </P> <P> The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and the California Coastal  Commission have given the go-ahead to plans for an equestrian center in Malibu.  </P> <P> The equestrian park, which will be on leased school district property near  Point Dume, will be developed and operated by the county Department of Parks  and Recreation. Two horse arenas, a multipurpose field and other facilities  will be built on half of the 20-acre site, and the other half will remain  vacant.  </P> <P> The school board on Tuesday unanimously approved a master plan for the park  that included several revisions it had previously demanded, including  provisions for boundary fencing and limits on the loudness of a public-address  system.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the California Coastal Commission approved the project, subject  to certain conditions, said county landscape architect Larry Hensley, who is  guiding the project through the approval process. Those conditions include  controls on erosion during construction, commission review of final landscaping  and parking lot plans, and commission approval of a trail that will link the  park to a proposed horse trail that would run to the Zuma Ridge Trail in the  Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Hensley said. The commission  also set construction time schedules, he said.  </P> <P> Construction is expected to start early next year and be completed by mid-1992,  Hensley said.  </P> <P> The project has been studied and changed by several governmental agencies since  1981, when the county, the school district and the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy agreed to develop the land for recreational use. The county  originally wanted an all-purpose park with baseball diamonds, but that idea was  later thrown out partly because it would have required extensive excavation and  grading. County officials have also said the site is ideal for an equestrian  center because hundreds of horse owners live within a few miles.  </P> <P> It has taken eight years to get to this stage, Hensley said, because "you have  public agencies working together, and they're each trying to satisfy the part  of the population they serve the most . . . (and they) have other things to do.  . . . It's just a fact of life in this day and age."  </P> <P> The first phase of the project, estimated to cost $1.4 million, will entail  grading, landscaping, installation of water and electrical utilities, and  construction of two arenas and a children's play area.  </P> <P> The second phase, which doesn't yet have a cost estimate, will include terraced  spectator seating, a community center and a graded multipurpose field, Hensley  said.  </P> <P> The park, which will be open from dawn to dusk, will have enough parking for 50  cars and 55 vehicles with horse trailers.  </P> <P> Hensley said the thumbs up by the district and the commission were a relief.  "Any time you get any portion of a project completed, you feel you can see more  of a glimmer at the end of the tunnel."  </P></p>

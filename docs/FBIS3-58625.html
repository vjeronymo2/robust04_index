			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Strasbourg, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The European Community  can progress towards the introduction of a single currency  without reimposing narrow bands on the exchange rate mechanism  (ERM), Finance Commissioner Henning Christophersen said on  Tuesday [18 January].    "If everybody accepts that the 15 percent band is a normal  band, the only important question is: Is your currency close to  the central rate?," he told journalists outside a meeting of the  European parliament.    At the beginning of August, in the face of massive  speculation against currencies in the European monetary system  (EMS) and particularly against the French franc, EC finance  ministers widened the permitted range of fluctuation of most of  the currencies within the ERM from 2.25 percent to 15 percent.    Christophersen said that the re-imposition of narrow bands  might lead to a resumption of speculation against ERM currencies.    Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, the Community is  to  begin stage three of economic and monetary union between the end  of 1997 and the end of 1999 at the latest.    Under stage three the Community is to adopt a single  currency, and Christophersen declined to rule out the  possibility that the currency might be adopted in 1997.  However, he said that it would be "very, very difficult."    A senior EC official has said that six members of the  Community might be ready quickly to meet the conditions for use  of a single currency. He named them as Belgium, Luxembourg, the  Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and France.</p>

Before the dedication,  President Endara commented on U.S. accusations Panama is not  doing enough to fight drug trafficking. The U.S. Government  accuses the Panamanian justice system of releasing drug  traffickers. Here is President Endara's response:    [Endara] [Words indistinct] how many drug traffickers it  does  not free? It frees hundreds, not to say thousands of drug  traffickers. The Panamanian judicial branch--the United States  Government had better get this from now on--is not controlled by  the executive branch, as it is not in the United States. The  U.S. justice system frees many more drug traffickers [words  indistinct] the Panamanian justice system.    [Fernandez] Do you suggest [words indistinct]?    [Endara] The U.S. justice system?    [Fernandez] [Words indistinct].    [Endara] And why do they not talk about corruption in the  United States? They free more drug traffickers than Panama.  Why do they accuse us Panamanians? Why is our justice system  charged with corruption if it frees two drug traffickers? Why  do they not talk about corruption over there?    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Endara] I am not justifying the acquittal of any drug  trafficker. What I am saying is, no matter what the United  States does, the executive branch will not intervene in matters  concerning the judicial branch. The executive branch will not  intervene in the judicial branch. If the judicial branch frees  someone, we will free that person because that decision concerns  the judicial branch, as per the same policy President Clinton  follows vis-a-vis the U.S. judicial branch whenever it decides  to free a drug trafficker. If President Clinton respects and  heeds the U.S. justice system, I want to tell President Clinton  I also respect and heed my justice system.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Endara] [Word indistinct] we will continue the task. This  is a momentary [words indistinct]. For now, we will follow the  same path.    [Martinez] There will be a lack of U.S. cooperation.    [Endara] If they do not want to cooperate, we can do nothing  about it. They are the ones who consume the drug, and they are  the ones who have created a problem for us in Panama. The most  consumption takes place in the United States. Because the drug  passes through here, some of it remains in Panama, and it  affects our youths. If they do not help us, what can we do?</p>

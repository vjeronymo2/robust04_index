			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER LOCKOUT ON OPENING DAY?;  </P> <P> TROUT: RANCHERS CLOSE STRETCH OF EAST WALKER RIVER, BUT MOST FISHERMEN WOULDN'T  GO THERE ANYWAY.  </P> <P> The ranchers and the anglers are at it again.  </P> <P> With the Eastern Sierra trout season opening Saturday, the Plymouth Land and  Livestock Company of Nevada posted signs Thursday, closing a stretch of the  East Walker River north of Bridgeport to trespassers.  </P> <P> That is the same trophy trout fishery severely damaged by silting when the  Walker River Irrigation District -- a group of Nevada ranchers -- released a  large volume of water from Bridgeport Reservoir in the fall of 1988.  </P> <P> The irrigation district subsequently was convicted of violations of the  California Fish and Game Code and ordered to mitigate the damage and maintain  controlled water levels and flows in the future.  </P> <P> The motive for this week's posting was not immediately clear, but fishing  interests suspected vindictiveness.  </P> <P> "I don't think they were worried about a fly fisherman hooking a cow," said Jim  Edmondson, regional manager for the fishing lobby, Cal Trout.  </P> <P> Edmondson scheduled a press briefing this afternoon in Bishop to outline Cal  Trout's response.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was uncertain how the posting would be enforced, or whether it  would be enforced at all.  </P> <P> Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck said that in trespassing situations, there  must first be a complaint, after which a violator is asked to leave.  </P> <P> "If he refuses, then there's a violation," Strelneck said.  </P> <P> Rick Rockel of Ken's Sporting Goods in Bridgeport pointed out a state law  permitting public access to private lands where the center line of an adjacent  highway is within 50 feet of the high-water mark. An angler, for example, could  fish that water as long as he remained within the high-water marks on both  sides.  </P> <P> Strelneck also said that the Department of Fish and Game might have primary  jurisdiction when trespassing involves hunting or fishing.  </P> <P> Initially, the posting covered only a mile from the Bridgeport dam to the  bridge where California 182 crosses the river -- the area most heavily impacted  by the '88 incident, where trout anglers wouldn't want to go now, anyway.  </P> <P> "All they've got down there is 20-pound carp," Strelneck said.  </P> <P> However, if the posting were to be continued as far down as the choice area  known as Murphy's Pond near the Nevada border, it could affect serious fishing.  </P> <P> Some important points on this Eastern Sierra trout opening:  </P> <P>  -- The limit, now statewide, has been cut from 10 to five fish a day, 10 in  possession.  </P> <P>  -- This will be the initial test of the DFG's promise to plant larger fish,  from half a pound up, in exchange for cutting the limit.  </P> <P>  -- Because of recent warm weather, any ice remaining on higher lakes is  considered rotten and unsafe -- hence, ice fishing and exploring is being  strongly discouraged, especially in view of the Convict Lake tragedy Feb. 19 in  which seven people drowned.  </P> <P>  -- Thursday was beautiful, but forecasters said a stormy cold front was moving  in that could bring winds of up to 60 m.p.h. in the higher elevations by  Saturday and snow down to 6,000 feet by Sunday, and 5,000 by Monday.  </P> <P> But, experts say, bad weather can mean good fishing, especially for larger  fish.  </P> <P> Tom Gieser of Ken's Sporting Goods in Bridgeport said surface disturbance  mistaken for insects sometimes brings small trout to the surface, with big  browns in pursuit. Also, the fish aren't as sensitive to motors.  </P> <P> Mike Sharkey of Big Rock Resort at June Lake said: "The weather is always a  question mark, but that doesn't bother the fishing -- only the fishermen."  </P> <P> Anyone seeking a trophy brown will almost certainly be at Upper or Lower Twin,  which in '89 also produced the largest catch for opening day and the season,  22-8 by Jim Becker of Arcadia. Gieser recommends the strike-action trolling  method: trolling fast with 13- to 18-size Rapalas.  </P> <P> Fish up to five pounds should be common everywhere. Since last fall, the DFG  has dumped thousands of older broodstock rainbows into every major lake.  </P> <P> And during lulls in the wind, fly anglers should enjoy unusual opening-day  success. A warm spring has brought early insect hatches.  </P> <P> Besides the new limit, the 1990-91 state fishing regulations impose new  restrictions on some waters.  </P> <P> For example, in '88 Gene Cox of Rosamond caught a 12-4 brown in Rush Creek that  was the largest fish on opening day, using a worm for bait.  </P> <P> This year he will not be able to use a worm, and if he catches another fish  that big, he will have to throw it back. Rush Creek, from Grant Lake to Mono  Lake, now has 10-inch maximum size and artificial-lure restrictions.  </P> <P> Anglers are urged to pay close attention to the new regulations. Generally,  anglers 16 and older need licenses -- $21 at any tackle store. Fishing hours in  Mono County (north of Bishop) are from an hour before sunrise to an hour after  sunset. Fishing is allowed 24 hours in Inyo County (Bishop and south).  Penalties for violations can range from $40 to $80.  </P> <P> The outlook:  </P> <P> Bishop area -- All of the streams and lakes have been heavily stocked, and  knowledgeable anglers still loyal to troubled Crowley Lake should be rewarded,  at least on the opening weekend, if the weather doesn't run them off the lake.  There will be less water but more seclusion on the Owens River above and below  Crowley.  </P> <P> Mammoth Area -- Hot Creek still hard to beat for fly fishing -- but that's all  you can do there, and the limit is zero, since it's all catch and release. The  Twin Lakes -- not to be confused with those near Bridgeport -- have been loaded  with lunkers by the locals, but the roads are still closed to Lakes Mary, Mamie  and George.  </P> <P> June Lake loop -- Except for Grant, water level is no problem at these  spring-fed lakes, and a late freeze in the off-season allowed a triple plant of  brooders in June and Gull. Also, the mysterious cutthroat in June have grown to  five or six pounds by now, but trolling is the only way to get them. Grant, as  low as it is because of a court order to maintain a minimum level in Mono Lake,  could be very productive.  </P> <P> Bridgeport area: The Twin Lakes are the best for big fish. Although low,  Bridgeport Reservoir will also be good for those who don't mind launching boats  off the beach between the public ramp and the dam. The two regular ramps are  high and dry. The Virginia Lakes have bad ice but are fishable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trout Fishing Spots in the Eastern Sierra  </P> <P> With corresponding numbers for map  </P> <P> 1.

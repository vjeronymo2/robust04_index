			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Sweden in fresh delay on bridge Sweden yesterday paved the way for an eventual bridge and tunnel link with Denmark, but avoided a government crisis by again postponing a formal decision on the issue. Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, said the government needed to be sure that water flows into the Baltic Sea would not be disturbed by the bridge before the final go-ahead could be given. Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said the postponement was 'deeply regrettable'. The Water Tribunal, which has already examined the issue, has been asked to give further guarantees. Provided the assurances are forthcoming, the government has said it will approve the project. But its position may not be supported by the Centre party, one of four members of the minority coalition government, which has strongly objected to the link on environmental grounds. The party has retained the right to dissent from the final decision. Yesterday's formula makes it more likely that the government will remain intact in the run-up to September's general election, although differences between the Centre party and the other coalition partners remain significant. 'The risk of a government crisis is now wholly averted,' said Mr Bildt. A final decision on the link is expected before the election, although the exact timetable is unclear. The environmental investigations will take a month. The 17km road and rail link across the Oresund between Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmo is strongly supported by most Swedish and Danish politicians, as well as industry and trade unions. It will cost Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn). Construction of the onshore access roads on the Danish side of the bridge has already begun, after Denmark and Sweden agreed to build the link three years ago. But, following yesterday's announcement, the Danish government said it was considering calling a halt to the building work.</p>

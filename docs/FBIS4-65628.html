			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F> by Franco Papitto; place and date not given: "Individualism  Threatens Europe"]    [Text] Brussels -- Just a few days away from the European  elections and a few months away from the end of his third term  of office, European Commission President Jacques Delors promised  to continue working in his position "unceasingly and until the  last day." But Europe is about to witness the end of the  "Delors decade" -- a period which has already acquired legendary  status within the Brussels institutions; a period which many  factors suggest is coming to an end too soon, and which is  referred to as some kind of "golden age" in the offices of  Europe's capital. This era has come to an end mainly because  today's Europe seems to reject the values of Jacques Delors.    [Papitto] Mr. President, you are about to leave a Europe  very  different from the one you found 10 years ago. A swing to the  right is occurring in almost every country, and a party that has  always declared itself to be heir to fascism, at least until a  few months ago, is joining the Italian Government. Is this a  good thing or a bad thing for Europe? Could it set an example  for other countries?    [Delors] The president of the European Commission must be  careful not to intervene in a Community member country's  internal affairs. For my part, I will judge the Italian  Government's action on the basis of what it does and without any  mental reservations. As far as I am concerned, it is only deeds  that count.    [Papitto] Mr. President, Italy's affairs are also Europe's  affairs. We could regard Italy as a portion of Europe.    [Delors] There are two disturbing factors in Europe today.  On the one hand, the vigor of our democracies is growing  weaker. The Europeans are drawing in on themselves, in a crazy  individualism that ignores the real situation, namely, that the  future of each one of us depends partly on the future of the  group to which we belong. And, on the other hand, there is the  return of false prophets -- and not only in the East.  Yugoslavia is the tragic expression of all this, with the  monstrous ideology of ethnic cleansing. Furthermore, we are  witnessing everywhere the advance of populism, the spread of an  attitude of rejection of others, of those who are different by  virtue of their religion, their ethnicity, or the color of their  skin. Irrespective of individual elections, this is the real  danger that threatens to poison our democracies.    [Papitto] How should we respond to this?    [Delors] It is more necessary than ever to return to the  fundamental values that led to the formation of the European  Community: respect for others, the awareness that in the world  of today and tomorrow none of our countries -- even the  strongest -- can defend its interests on its own and disseminate  its own values. We are at a crucial moment in Europe's  evolution, which is more vulnerable precisely because it is  stronger.    [Papitto] Mr. President, why is it stronger and more  vulnerable?    [Delors] A doctor too will tell you that a virus makes  swifter progress in a strong and healthy body than in an aged  body. As it progresses, Europe becomes more vulnerable because  it becomes more and more part of everyone's life. Then citizens  rightly begin to wonder about the nature of this Europe that is  influencing their lives. Until Maastricht Europe was something  to be taken for granted; not any more. And I do not say this  with regret. In fact it is a good thing, because the citizens'  involvement will be more aware.    [Papitto] Are the Euroskeptics among the false prophets who  are returning?    [Delors] Until a few years ago, our cooperation developed  within the context of the historical necessity of a Europe split  in two. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall other problems  have arisen, and we must not be surprised if there are  hesitations with regard to their scale. The priority now is to  heed the countries of the East in order to understand their  demands, hopes, and expectations. I have visited them, and it  seems to me that their main concern is security. Some of them  have been received into the WEU [Western European Union] as  associate members; and we are working on the stability pact  proposed by France and taken up by the European Council.    [Papitto] Meanwhile the European Union [EU] is extending to  include four more countries -- Austria, Norway, Finland, and  Sweden -- while another two, Poland and Hungary, have officially  applied for membership. As of next year we will be 16, and  later 20 or 24. How will such a huge EU function?    [Delors] There are plans for a meeting in two years of an  intergovernmental conference that will broach these very issues.  It is obvious to everyone that a Europe of 20 or 24 members  cannot function with the existing institutions. But permit me  to say that this is a matter that the next Commission will  broach, insofar as it is its responsibility to do so, and I will  not be free to express myself as an ordinary citizen until next  1 January. I will do so, because my battle for Europe will  continue. But I do not own any television channels or  newspapers, nor do I lead any large political party. I will  continue thinking about and working for Europe; whether I will  be heeded, I do not know.    [Papitto] Will these issues be broached at the coming  European Council meeting in Corfu?    [Delors] The Corfu meeting will mainly discuss the economy  and how to improve cooperation within the context of the second  phase of Economic and Monetary Union that we are building. It  will also make up a balance of the first implementation phase of  the Maastricht Treaty which created the EU. There will also be  a discussion of the implementation of the White Paper on  competitiveness, growth, and employment approved by the European  Council in Brussels. Judging from what I was told by the Greek  presidency, there will not be much discussion of Europe's future.    [Papitto] What about unemployment?    [Delors] This was the subject of the European Council in  Brussels, which approved the White Paper whose implementation  will be discussed in Corfu. Its analysis of the situation can  be summed up in three points: 1. We are emerging from the most  serious recession since the thirties; 2. we are doing so without  any instances of overheating of the economy, partly because the  great European market and the policy of competitiveness have  proved to be important resources in combating inflation; 3.  despite the recovery of growth, unemployment will remain large  and Europe's chief problem. The White Paper already contains  some ideas and proposals, but we must develop them, move  forward. We cannot find solutions without considering such  fundamental issues as the role of work in tomorrow's society,  and the overall organization of society. At the European  Council in Essen in December, the Commission will submit some  new ideas for considerably reducing unemployment. We are  already working on this, and it will be my "vacation homework."    [Papitto] With "Europe's chief problem" so highly developed,  is it really possible to build Economic and Monetary Union?    [Delors] Our countries could resign themselves and exclude  7-8 percent of the population; or they will realize that  societies with strong exclusions are generally socially and  politically unstable. If the latter happens, the evil of  unemployment will be tackled vigorously. The voters will say:  A single currency is all very well, but what do you propose in  order to build a more homogeneous society that displays more  solidarity? This will be the main subject of political debate  before the end of the century.    [Papitto] What do you think you could say to the voters in  this election campaign, when almost everywhere national issues  are stifling European issues?    [Delors] This campaign takes place every five years and is a  valuable opportunity to take stock after the very busy years  that Europe has experienced. It is necessary to vote, not to  yield to the temptation to abstain, because through their votes  citizens express their interest in their own collective future.  Basically the choice is simple: There are those who want a  political Europe -- in which the member countries will agree to  exercise their sovereignty together whenever their interests are  shared, and which for this purpose provides itself with the  necessary capacity for decisionmaking and action -- and there  are those who advocate a soulless and spineless trading area.    [Papitto] What is the European Parliament's role?    [Delors] It has been crucial in boosting our cooperation. My  efforts to gain approval of the Single Act -- the first reform  of the Community -- would have been in vain without the support  of what was called the "Spinelli report." The Parliament that I  have known, during my 10 years as president of the Commission,  has played its part in strengthening European building. The  next one will have a more important role because it will have  greater powers, granted to us by the Maastricht Treaty, and  because in 1996 there will be the institutional reform that will  decide on Europe's future.    [Papitto] What is your greatest regret, looking back over  these years?    [Delors] Not to have been heeded when I said that Germany's  unification would place a heavy recessionary burden on everyone.  I did not stress this sufficiently, because I risked appearing  like the Frenchman hindering unification, whereas I was the  first to support it.    [Papitto] What is your overall assessment of the "Delors  decade?"    [Delors] I think I am leaving a more compact European  Community, with almost irreversible bases. But in the meantime  the world has changed, and new challenges have therefore  emerged. They must be taken up. Even as a youngster, I did not  believe that a man could become God or Prometheus. I know that  often the obstacle lies at the end of the road, that failure  always lies in wait, and that it is necessary to start over  without a break. But this is mankind's adventure.</p>

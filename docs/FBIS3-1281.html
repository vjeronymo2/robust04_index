MacLennan] </F>   [Text] East London March 24 SAPA -- The South African  Defence Force [SADF] was monitoring Ciskei but there appeared to  be no need for it to move into the territory, an SADF spokesman  said on Thursday [24 March]. She said SADF personnel in King  William's Town were scheduled to meet the joint administrators  of Ciskei later on Thursday, and would then "decide what is  happening".    At the moment, however, the situation was "quite quiet".    It was reported that the ANC had called a rally in Bisho on  Thursday morning.    A rally called on Wednesday dissolved inconclusively after  former Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo failed to turn up, and  representatives of the African National Congress and the  Transitional Executive Council were prevented from addressing  the crowd by a failure in the public address system.    Ciskei police, whose strike on Tuesday led to the toppling  of  the Gqozo government, met on Thursday afternoon at the Bisho  Police College.    A warrant officer, who answered the telephone in the office  of the commander of the college, would not say what the meeting  was about.    A police captain described the situation as tense.</p>

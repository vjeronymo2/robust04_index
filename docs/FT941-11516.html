			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Major warns rebel ministers: Disunity could cost election, MPs told Mr John Major last night moved to shore up his premiership with a blunt and unprecedented warning that disunity and faction-fighting among Conservative MPs could cost the party the next general election. At a hastily-called meeting of the 1922 committee attended by nearly 200 of the party's backbench MPs, Mr Major said that errant or disloyal ministers in future would be sacked from the government. He would put the country and party ahead of personal friendships. His comments won warm applause from those attending. But some suggested later that unless the warning was followed by a much surer approach in running the government, it would do little to restore the Conservatives' popularity with the voters. It came on the eve of a Daily Telegraph poll which showed the Tories' rating up half a percentage point on last month at 26 per cent, still trailing Labour at 45.5 per cent. The speech, dubbed by MPs as the beginning of a 'No more Mr Nice Guy' approach from Mr Major, marked his second move within two days to restore his battered authority over the party. Earlier this week he abruptly dismissed a delegation of rightwing Tory MPs who had demanded a cabinet reshuffle to promote their supporters. But with many backbench MPs openly speculating that Mr Major's own future would depend on the outcome of the local and European elections in May and June, he decided last night to go much further in attempting to shore up his premiership. In a 20-minute address during which he acknowledged that the party had been riven by infighting between right and left and between pro- and anti-Europeans, he said: 'The sniping has to stop, the feuding has to stop, the squandering of energies on petty factionalism has to stop. We have to unite and fight for what we believe in.' Mr Major, who disclosed that he plans to tour the country with his message, said that the infighting was drowning out the good news about economic recovery. He added: 'I have to say that we cannot afford that.' The economic recovery was strengthening, inflation would remain low, unemployment would continue to fall and British exporters had unprecedented opportunities. In those circumstances, he added: 'I am not prepared to stand quietly by and see our party squander its power and lose its opportunity for good.' Referring to constant carping at his leadership, he went on: 'We need to stop the huge weight of criticism we have faced that is based on unsourced, anonymous comment . . . I do not flinch from criticism but I would rather have it direct than anonymously, rather face to face than behind the hand.' Mr Major then indicated that he would take a much tougher line with ministers who embarrassed the government. He told the MPs that he would put the interests of the country and the party ahead of any personal feelings for colleagues. Senior aides said that his remarks were directed at ministers whose personal lives made them the subject of scandal and those in the government who were disloyal to its decisions. Mr Major rejected the arguments of those on the right of the party that the Conservatives needed a period in opposition to rebuild their philosophy and energy. He said: 'We don't know what it is like but I bet it's miserable and frustrating.' Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

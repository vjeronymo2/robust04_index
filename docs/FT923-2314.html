			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / August car production down 7.8% UK CAR production in August fell by 7.8 per cent from the same month a year earlier, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office. Car output in August declined to 52,943 from 57,388 a year earlier. In the first eight months of the year, however, output was virtually unchanged at 858,204, a marginal 0.5 per cent rise from the 853,769 achieved in the corresponding period a year earlier. UK car output has performed relatively well during the recession, with much higher production for export markets largely making up for lower output for the home market. Production fell only 4.8 per cent from the peak of 1.3m in 1989 to 1.24m last year. In the same period, UK new car sales fell 30.9 per cent from 2.3m in 1989 to 1.59m. The share of output for export markets jumped from 21.6 per cent in 1989 to 48.9 per cent last year. The trend has been reversed this year, however, with car output for export markets falling 17.9 per cent in the first eight months to 331,525, accounting for 38.6 per cent of output compared with a share of 52.7 per cent in the same period last year. The immediate outlook for car production has been clouded by short-time working announced recently by Ford and Rover in the face of disappointing UK sales and weakening demand abroad. UK commercial vehicle output of 12,437 in August was 48.8 per cent higher than a year earlier, while production in the first eight months has jumped 29 per cent to 175,528. The increase reflects the start-up last autumn of production by Ford of its Fiesta-based Courier van, for which Ford's plant in Dagenham, Essex, is the sole source of supply for Europe.</p>

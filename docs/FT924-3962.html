			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Direct Line rings the changes: A UK insurer's success at selling policies by telephone The scale of the threat to the UK insurance industry posed by rivals that sell by telephone is underlined by yesterday's results from Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland's general insurance subsidiary. When the company began direct telephone sales of motor insurance policies in 1985 the experiment was dismissed by many in the industry as unworkable. Seven years on Direct Line has shown that it is possible to market motor and home insurance successfully through mass media advertising and selling policies over the telephone. This approach - copied by other fast-growing insurers - short-circuits the industry's traditional chain of distribution and leaves no role for the insurance broker. In the past 12 months premium income from motor policies has grown 90 per cent. Direct Line insures 670,000 drivers, 4.5 per cent of the Pounds 4bn-plus a year UK motor insurance market. Inroads are also being made into the home insurance market, where Direct Line now has 206,000 policies. At the same time, the company is continuing to make profits - pre-tax profits for the 12 months to September 30 were Pounds 15.1m compared with Pounds 12.1m (on a restated basis) last year. The company's assets rose to Pounds 304.3m, up 48.2 per cent from the previous year's Pounds 205.4m. It was this performance that won a Pounds 6m remuneration package for Mr Peter Wood, the quietly spoken former insurance broker who launched the company. Some of Mr Wood's rivals say Direct Line is able to grow so fast only because it is under-reserving for future claims, offering cheap premiums or skimping on service. Mr Wood says this is nonsense, and that R Watson &amp; Co, the actuaries, describe reserving levels as 'reasonable'. The Consumers' Association has consistently awarded the company high marks for the quality of its policies and the speed of response on claims. Instead, Direct Line's success appears to be based on two inter-related factors. Its cost base is much lower than that of insurers which sell through brokers, because its centralised computer system allows its clerks to handle much more business per head than traditional insurers. Clever software helps ordinary clerical workers to make underwriting decisions, saving the costs of skilled underwriters and middle-managers. As a result, Direct Line says its expenses are only 18 per cent of its premium income, well below the market average in the high 20s. The company is also more selective than its competitors about the business it writes. It uses computer systems to tune finely the premiums it charges in line with the level of perceived risk. For good risks Direct line's motor premiums can be up to 20 per cent cheaper, while the company refuses to insure what it regards as bad risks. As a result a much higher proportion of customers choose to renew their policies with Direct line than is the case with other companies, which in turn reduces distribution costs. Retention rates are more than 85 per cent, compared with 50 per cent for companies that sell through brokers. Direct Line's success has attracted imitators, such as Churchill, a subsidiary of Switzerland's Winterthur. Other recent 'direct writers' in the UK market include Denmark's Topdanmark and France's Gan-Minster. Together, this clutch of rivals poses challenges both for the composite companies and for the UK's more than 3,000 independent brokers. Trade association figures show that by 1991 direct writers had 13 per cent of the motor insurance market. Independent analysts such as Stephen Bird, of securities house Smith New Court, suggest that market share could now be as much as 16 per cent, and may rise to 25 per cent within the next few years. Mr Wood claims that if present trends continue, Direct Line could soon be the UK's biggest motor insurer. The composites 'have to decide what to do about the magpie in the nest', says Mr Clive Bannister, insurance specialist with Booz Hamilton &amp; Allen, the consultants. Increasingly companies relying on brokers to sell their products run the risk that they will lose much of the better quality business and be left with policies likely to produce heavy claims. In industry jargon composite companies are being 'selected against'. Some companies have responded by tightening their links with those brokers who obtain the best quality business for them. They have stopped accepting policies from brokers whose business produces higher than average claims. Others have acquired interests in the larger broking groups such as Swinton, AA Insurance Services and Hill House Hammond. Three companies - General Accident, Royal Insurance and Eagle Star - set up their own direct insurance operations between 1988 and 1990 but were initially anxious to avoid open identification with these subsidiaries for fear of offending brokers. During 1991 GA faced a brief boycott from brokers angered by its promotion of direct sales. Over the past 12 months, however, there have been signs that the insurers are changing their minds. Royal Insurance, for example, is understood to be considering 'rebranding' its Bristol-based subsidiary, The Insurance Service, which in the first nine months of 1992 sold 30 per cent of the motor insurance policies sold by the whole Royal group. Hitherto publicity material produced by TIS has made little or no mention of the fact that it was actually a Royal subsidiary, in spite of the well recognised strength of the Royal Insurance brand. The big losers from these trends are likely to be the smaller brokers. According to Ms Julianne Jessup, of De Lisle Jessup Scott, an insurance consultancy, 'personal lines brokers are clearly feeling the pinch'. The British Insurance and Investment Broking Association, which represents some 3,000 brokers, says its membership has fallen slightly recently, partly as result of the competition between the direct writers and the traditional composites. Composites may be forced to continue to abandon caution and opt for more vigorous promotion of their direct writing subsidiaries. 'They have to fish or cut bait. They have to choose one way or another,' says Booz Hamilton's Mr Bannister. 'If they continue to walk down the middle of the road they will get run over.'</p>

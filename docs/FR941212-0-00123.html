This subpart also sets forth procedures for the administrative recovery from responsible third parties for loss, damage, or destruction of such personal property. The underlying Act is a gratuitous payment statute; claims thereunder do not sound in tort even though some tort concepts are used in the adjudication of claims under this subpart. Further, the Act is not designed to make the United States a total insurer of the personal property of proper claimants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The maximum amount that may be paid for any loss or damage arising from a single incident is limited by the Act as amended by Pub. L. 100&hyph;565, 31 October 1988, to $40,000. The maximum limit of $40,000 is specifically limited to losses of personal property occurring after 31 October 1988, and to losses resulting from evacuations or from hostile acts directed against the United States or its officers and employees. A maximum limit of $25,000 is applicable to losses of personnel property occurring after 28 July 1982 and before 1 November 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Any claim within the scope of this subpart, which otherwise would be cognizable under the MCA and subpart C; the FTCA and subpart E; the Act of 9 October 1962 (10 U.S.C. 2737) and subpart E; the NGCA and subpart F; the Maritime Claims Settlement Act and subpart H; or the FCA and subpart J will first be considered under this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If not payable under this subpart, the claim will be considered under the other subparts prior to any disapproval. Particular attention should be given to the nature of the claim; many alleged ``unusual occurrences'' are actually torts, either by employees or by individuals in their private capacities. While some incidents may not seem common to those experiencing them, an ``unusual occurrence'' is defined as an occurrence beyond the normal risk associated with day-to-day living and working. An unusual occurrence does not involve a reasonably foreseeable consequence of normal human activity. For example, having a vehicle hit by a golf ball while driving by a golf course or struck by an unknown vehicle in a parking lot is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of driving a vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If a claim cognizable under this subpart arises from an incident resulting in personal injury, no payment or emergency partial payment will be made under this subpart until an investigation completed in accordance with &sect;&sect;536.19 and 536.20 has been conducted. The Commander, USARCS, Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, or the chief of a command claims service may waive this requirement. Prior to payment the investigation must establish that the incident was not caused by the negligence of the claimant or an agent of the claimant. An example of such an incident would be a fire in quarters that results in an injury to a soldier's family member and was presumably caused by faulty wiring, but might have been caused by the claimant's negligence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Any claim within the scope of this subpart which is also cognizable under Article 139 will first be considered under subpart I. If settlement of the Article 139 claim will be unduly protracted, the claim may be settled under this subpart and the claimant counseled to repay any overpayment if payment is later received under the provisions of subpart I. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Any claim cognizable under this subpart that is primarily the result of fault or negligence of a Government contractor other than a common carrier or warehouse firm will first be referred to the contractor or his or her insurer for settlement in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.164 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claimants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A claim may be presented under this subpart only by_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A member of the Active Army. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A member of the USAR or the ARNG who is engaged in inactive duty for training or in active duty training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A civilian employee of DA; a civilian employee of the ARNG funded under 32 U.S.C. 709; a civilian employee of the DOD who is not an employee of the Department of the Navy or the Department of the Air Force; or a continental wage scale, local wage scale, and other foreign national local civilian employees. (See DODD 5515.10.) However, the claims of DOD dependent school teachers and Defense Commissary Agency civilian employees will be settled by the Service operating the installation where that school teacher/Commissary Agency employee is employed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The authorized agent or legal representative of paragraph (a) (1) through (3) of this section. However, any claim presented by a claims preparation service or other hired agent must be signed and ratified by the proper claimant to preclude assignment of claims, regardless of whether the claimant has executed a power of attorney. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The survivors of paragraph (a) (1) through (3) of this section in the following order of precedence: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

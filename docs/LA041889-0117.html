			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GROUP SEEKS INCREASE IN MINORITY TEACHERS  </P> <P> Decrying what they called an appalling lack of minority teachers in the public  schools, educators from across the state gathered in Newport Beach on Monday to  seek ways to increase the number of minority instructors from kindergarten  through 12th grade and on into college.  </P> <P> "We predict that we will need more than 80,000 new teachers in this state over  the next 9 years," said William L. Rukeyser, special assistant to State Supt.  of Public Instruction Bill Honig. "The majority of the students in many  districts are minorities and it only makes sense that we get an equitable  number of minority teachers into the teaching pool."  </P> <P> But many of the nearly 200 educators who gathered at Hotel Meridien agreed that  the obstacles to minority recruiting are substantial.  </P> <P> "Right now, our number (of minority teachers) is abysmal," said Paul B.  Gussman, a spokesman for the state Intersegmental Coordinating Council. "It's  largely because we have no pipeline. We have no system that says teaching is  honorable and is something that is terribly important to our society. We have  lost any sense of idealism (about teaching) that we once had."  </P> <P> Gussman said that one of the council's main goals in the recruitment of  minority teachers is to try to instill the notion that teaching is of prime  importance, has a powerful effect on society, and improves it as a whole.  </P> <P> "Once someone has got his or her degree, coming up with reasons for them to  (accept) a huge salary sacrifice -- a choice that they are often confronted  with -- is very tough," Gussman said. "(We) have to appeal to their higher  instincts."  </P> <P> The 2-day conference, entitled "Increasing Faculty Diversity," is sponsored by  the coordinating council, an agency of the California Education Round Table  which is affiliated with the State Department of Instruction.  </P> <P> The council is made up of representatives from the state's  kindergarten-through-12th-grade school districts, community colleges, the  University of California, the California State University system and various  private universities and colleges.  </P> <P> "It's really about educational quality and social fairness. Hispanics, blacks  and Asians are often radically under-represented in the teaching ranks," said  council Executive Director Mark G. Edelstein. "This needs to change. These kids  need positive role models for their success."  </P> <P> The educators formed about 30 teams from the council to carry the message  throughout the state. The mission of the teams will be to meet and develop  methods on the local level to improve the numbers of minority teachers. The  group also called for a corporate-sponsored center to coordinate statewide  recruiting of minority instructors.  </P></p>

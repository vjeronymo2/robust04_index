			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Chienping (7115 1696 1627): "China </F> and Britain Should Still Cooperate on Other Issues; Lu Ping  Urges British Side to Show Sincerity and Hopes Chris Patten Can  Return to Britain Using the New Airport"]    [Text] Beijing, 13th -- Lu Ping, State Council Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office director, stated his view todays on  Hong Kong's political and economic problems in an address to a  seminar held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for Hong Kong  young executives entitled "Leap Toward Beijing." The following  is the essence of his speech.    Lu Ping said: On 1 July 1997, the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] will move into Hong Kong to be stationed there -- this is  laid down by both the Joint Declaration and Basic Law. However,  first, it will be small in size and symbolic. As Mr Deng  Xiaoping said, it symbolizes our sovereignty. Second, the PLA  will not interfere the internal affairs of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] Government. It will merely be  responsible for SAR defense affairs. Normal public order work,  including border patrols, will be carried out by the Hong Kong  SAR's own police force; the PLA has no duties in this area.  This has been written into the Basic Law which stipulates that,  in case of a disaster or under special circumstances, the PLA  can assist in rescue operations or maintaining Hong Kong public  order at the request of the SAR chief executive. However, this  will only be under very special circumstances. As soon as these  special and extraordinary circumstances disappear, Hong Kong  will once again be under the rule of the SAR authorities. The  PLA has strict provisions in its mandate. Moreover, the PLA  will be directed to strictly observe the law of Hong Kong. If,  for example, a PLA vehicle is involved in a traffic accident  with a Hong Kong person, the whole thing will be handled  according to the law of Hong Kong and the case will be tried by  a Hong Kong judge. The PLA party will do whatever is required  by Hong Kong law. There will be strict legal provisions on this  and other related issues in the future.    On the current state of Hong Kong real estate and the  problem  of the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar link, Lu Ping said: The problems  with Hong Kong real estate are rather complicated. There are  many causes of high property prices, one of which is inflation,  though there are also many other factors behind it. For  example, the fact that Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S.  dollar. As we all know, the American economy has been  performing very badly over the last few years and interest rates  have had to be lowered, whereas Hong Kong's economy has been  vibrant. But, because of the linkage, Hong Kong could only  follow the United States and lower its interest rates. People  find their bank deposits are suffering from negative interest  rates when compared with inflation. To keep the real value of  their money, people invest in stocks and the property market.    Lu Ping thinks the current property situation in Hong Kong  is  highly abnormal. He said: Our view is that the property and  land prices should be brought down. To do that we need to solve  the problems from different angles. Increasing land supply is  one way but not the only way. The problem of property prices  cannot be solved by solely increasing land supply. Expanding  public housing and the home ownership scheme is another way.  The Hong Kong government is organizing manpower to study this  problem. Our view is that current property prices are indeed  too high and are affecting people's livelihood and Hong Kong's  position as an international financial and trade center. If  property prices continue to rise, the cost of investing in Hong  Kong will become increasingly higher. Rent for offices in  Central now is the highest in the world. This is not going to  help Hong Kong. Why would foreign companies establish their  Asia offices in Hong Kong when rent and wages there keep going  up? It is better for them to move somewhere else. One very  important factor contributing to Hong Kong's past success was  its relatively low costs, wages, and prices. Whatever happens,  Hong Kong must not lose this advantage. Only thus can it  maintain its competitiveness.    Lu Ping stated: The property market is now a key sector  for Hong Kong. A very large number of listed companies are  property developers and a very large proportion of bank loans  are property-related. If the property market slumps, the stock  and financial markets will be affected. So, we must handle this  problem with great care and caution and adopt a step-by-step  approach in cooling off the market. Moreover, we cannot depress  the market too much but must keep a basic equilibrium and  prevent the market from rising indefinitely. This is better for  Hong Kong's economy.    When asked how Hong Kong can now achieve a smooth transition  given the present status between China and Britain, Lu Ping  said: The position of the Chinese Government has been  consistent: It hopes to secure Britain's cooperation in efforts  to achieve a smooth transition for Hong Kong. This was, is, and  will be our position. Unfortunately, Britain changed its  policies toward Hong Kong and China. You all have read the  report released earlier by the British House of Commons Foreign  Affairs Committee (FAC) which pointed out explicitly the  fundamental change in Britain's policy toward China and Hong  Kong since 1989, namely from the previous policy of cooperation  with China into one of noncooperation or even confrontation. It  can be said that there was very good cooperation between China  and Britain following the signing of the Joint Declaration in  1984 and, in general, the two sides were able to iron out  contradictions and differences through consultations. Some  people dubbed this the honeymoon period for China and Britain.  By 1989, however, things were different. By that time Britain  had chosen to be very uncooperative with China. All in all, it  is very unfortunate. Lu Ping said: Our position on the airport  problem is the same -- it is very clear. The Memorandum of  Understanding [MOU] was in place by then, and it was very clear.  In principle, we do not want to leave the SAR government with  any financial burdens and inputs should be kept low while  returns must be high. Also, a minimum $25 billion must be in  place for the SAR government to use as financial reserves and  the debt to be taken over by the SAR government must not exceed  5 billion. We had thought that with the signing of the MOU,  these problems were resolved. Go ahead and build the airport if  you want to. We, the Chinese government, have made it clear  that we support the construction of the new airport. So here we  have a case of flying off at a tangent: The financial  arrangements tabled by Britain would leave the SAR government  with a debt far exceeding the 5 billion allowed in the MOU.  Despite this, we were still willing to talk to Britain and we  did not limit the debt to 5 billion either. It just cannot  exceed the amount by too big a margin. We hope that we can  first achieve some progress on the airport financial  arrangements in the coming Airport Committee meeting so that  there will be a new airport earlier rather than later. We would  like to see Mr Chris Patten leave Hong Kong in 1997 via the Chek  Lap Kok Airport on the Lantau Island and not from Kai Tak  Airport.    When asked if it was possible for him to meet Chris Patten,  Lu Ping said: As I have said earlier, this calls for  cooperation from both sides and a good atmosphere. Without a  good atmosphere, there would not be any result even if the two  of us sat down and talked for days on end. Very simple problems  can become quite complicated if the atmosphere is not good; and  very complicated problems, if the atmosphere is good, can become  very simple and can be solved very quickly.</p>

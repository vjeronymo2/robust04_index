			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Retroactive Relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. ABS represents that it has engaged in transactions related to mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities based on the assumption that retroactive relief would not be granted. However, it is possible that some transactions may have occurred that would be prohibited. For example, because many certificates are held in street or nominee name, it is not always possible to identify whether the percentage interest of plans in a trust is or is not ``significant'' for purposes of the Department's regulation relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(f)). These problems are compounded as transactions occur in the secondary market. In addition, with respect to the ``publicly-offered security'' exception contained in that regulation (29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(b)), it is difficult to determine whether each purchaser of a certificate is independent of all other purchasers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, ABS requests relief retroactive for transactions which have occurred on or after August 12, 1994, the date ABS originally filed its exemption application with the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 26. In summary, the applicant represents that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions for which exemptive relief is requested satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act due to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The trusts contain ``fixed pools'' of assets. There is little discretion on the part of the trust sponsor to substitute receivables contained in the trust once the trust has been formed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Certificates in which plans invest will have been rated in one of the three highest rating categories by S&amp;P's, Moody's, D&amp;P or Fitch. Credit support will be obtained to the extent necessary to attain the desired rating;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) All transactions for which ABS seeks exemptive relief will be governed by the pooling and servicing agreement, which is made available to plan fiduciaries for their review prior to the plan's investment in certificates;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Exemptive relief from sections 406(b) and 407 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales to plans is substantially limited; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) ABS has made, and anticipates that it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to make, a secondary market in certificates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

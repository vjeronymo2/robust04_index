[Baku Azerbaycan Radio  Televiziyasi Television Network in Azeri at 1600 GMT on 12  January, in a similar report adds: "The Azerbaijan president's  decree conferred on her the diplomatic rank of ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary."]    A number of analysts from opposing political currents  consider this appointment exclusion from power, as the former  secretary of state has not been agreed with the personnel  policy. The same analysts suppose that Minister of Foreign  Affairs Gassan Gassanov and chairman of the National  Independence Party of Azerbaijan Etibar Mamedov are two possible  candidates to the state secretary vacancy. Gassan Gassanov is  known as president's comrade-in-arms, and the national harmony  might be the major factor dictating Etibar Mamedov's  appointment. The state secretary position was offered to Etibar  Mamedov last summer.</p>

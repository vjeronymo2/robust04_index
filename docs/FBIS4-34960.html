			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elsy Fors: "Front Row Witness in the </F> Caribbean's Integration"]    [Text] [no dateline as received] -- The Association of  Caribbean States [AEC], to be commenced in Bridgetown, Barbados,  on 4 July, will include the Cuban Chamber of Commerce as a front  row witness and as an exceptional participant to consolidate the  market closest to the island. According to AEC President Carlos  Martinez Salsamendi, this will be Cuba's door to its  incorporation into the international economy.    During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official  underlined the Caribbean market's importance for his country,  which enjoys comparative advantages in the subregion in the  fields of industrial development, health, and even tourism. He  said that Cuba exports cement, salt, construction materials, and  technical services of various types to the Caribbean. With the  incorporation of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela into the AEC,  Cuba will be able to export oil, minerals, raw materials, and  commercial services to these countries also. From Guyana, Cuba  buys minerals and lumber.    Salsamendi said that five years ago the 13 Caribbean Common  Market [Caricom] countries regarded Cuba as a potential  competitor in tourism and for supplies of some traditional  Caribbean exports. Cuba is now considered a complementary  economy, even regarding tourism. There are travel packages that  include Jamaica and Cuba, as well as Mexico and Cuba in the same  packages. In addition, air and sea travel agreements have been  established to improve tourism development in the area. This  improved relationship includes a growing interest in Caribbean  business meetings and the Caribbean Exposition, which have been  held since 1993 and 1992, respectively. These events are  sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce.    This year, the events will precede the signing of the AEC  Charter by the heads of government. The second meeting of  Caribbean businessmen will be held in Santiago de Cuba on 27 and  28 June. Expocaribe '94 will be held in this same city in Cuba's  eastern region from 28 June to 3 July.    In the 1993 exposition, Expocaribe gathered 11 companies  from  nine countries. Presently, 15 countries and 32 firms have been  registered for this year's exposition, the Chamber of Commerce  president has reported.    The exposition grounds are small and, consequently, we have  had to keep the number of participants low, Salsamendi said.  Cuba will be represented by 195 enterprises, all of them  established in the five easternmost provinces of the island.  These provinces are destined to lead in trade and relations  with Cuba's southern neighbors.    Representatives from outside of the region, including  executives from Canada, France, and Spain, have also confirmed  their participation in the businessmen's meeting. The meeting  will include a discussion of Cuba's commercial policy toward the  Caribbean. There will also be a discussion of business  opportunities in each of the five eastern provinces of Cuba.  For this discussion, a catalog has been prepared showing the  idle industrial potential of this region of the island.    Local industrial potential includes the poligraphic  industry,  and nickel, copper, chromium, iron, and manganese mining. There  is an abundance of reserves of these minerals in Cuba's eastern  region.    The meeting will also discuss the Cuban economy and its  prospects, as well as the possibilities for foreign investments  in the country. Salsamendi explained that the new opening to  foreign capital has brought to the Chamber of Commerce host  province increasing activities. Because of these increasing  activities, the Chamber of Commerce will have to open two  subsidiary sites this year. One of these sites will be in  Santiago de Cuba and the other will be in Matanzas.    All commercial delegations and investors go through the  Chamber of Commerce. So far this year, the number of foreign  businessmen who have dealt with the Chamber of Commerce exceeds  the number of foreign businessmen who did business with the  Chamber of Commerce in 1993. This year, the Chamber has handled  the creation of one combined enterprise or economic association  every week, which is twice the amount of last year.    According to the Chamber of Commerce president, foreign  capital investments have been increasing, not only in oil  prospecting and exploitation -- a sector in which Total of  France, Sherrit of Canada, and Taurus of Sweden, among others,  with their Cuban counterpart Cupet, participate -- but also in  the nickel industry, by Inco of Canada; in cement, by Cemex of  Mexico; and in the telephone industry, by Domos International.  In the area of cosmetics and perfumes, the most recent  association agreement was signed with Unilever of Great Britain,  one of the world's leading companies in this industry.    According to Salsamendi, Cuba conducts its trade according  to  market economy rules after three decades of operating with a  long-term system of commercial agreements and equitable prices,  which was used in the old Socialist field.    He said that Cuba is not yet prepared, but it is learning to  negotiate without maladjustments, and it is maintaining the  social equity principle.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Rush to see Stasi files overwhelms government THE government agency holding the files of the former East German Stasi secret police ran out of application forms yesterday because so many people wanted to find out who spied on them, Reuter reports from Berlin. 'We did not reckon with a rush like this,' an agency spokesman said. The initial batch of 100,000 application forms had gone, and another 300,000 would arrive only next week. East Germans were allowed to see their files from January 2 under a new law giving them access to the 200km of documents amassed by the Stasi's 85,000 full-time agents and hundreds of thousands of informers.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Global investors remain intent on Pacific Rim The attention of the world's investment community remained firmly fixed on Hong Kong and the Pacific region's other emerging markets last week. But weakness in some of the mature equity markets, including Japan and France, kept the advance in the FT-Actuaries World index to a minimum. The enthusiasm for Hong Kong - it is the world's third best performing market in dollar terms so far this year after Malaysia and Finland, according to the FT-A data - is not shared by everyone. Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, supports an overweight position on the Pacific Rim but he argues the case against investment in Hong Kong. 'One of the main arguments used to justify the heavy inflow of money into the Far East is that it is a rapid growth area. We have no quarrel with that view; but what we would point out, however, is that mature economies such as the US and UK are generating earnings growth that compares favourably with the Far East'. He adds that while rapid earnings growth in the west may be unsustainable in the long term, it will drive p/e ratios down to levels which will look favourable compared to the Pacific Rim: 'the prospective UK p/e is now actually below that of Hong Kong.' As the emerging markets in the Far East become ever more popular, especially with US investors, a popular game to play at the moment is in identifying those countries which remain ripe for for-eign investment. According to one UBS global strategist, arranging markets by their market capitalisation reveals that the Philippines, Thailand and even Taiwan have some way to move before reaching the level of Hong Kong, which is now bigger than that of Italy. Japan was one of last week's disappointments, and the market's drift downwards continued yesterday. The listing of East Japan Railway, which had been expected to drive the Nikkei higher, did the opposite. The market's drift has caused no surprise for Nomura's strategy team, which advised a cautious approach back in May. While still sympathetic to a bullish appraisal of Japanese equities, Nomura suggests that a lot of the good news has already been priced into shares. For example, 'an imminent package of Y5,000bn in income tax cuts has been the market gossip for some time, leaving prices vulnerable to disappointment over both timing and size'. Europe's equity markets showed a divergence of performances over the past week, with both France and Italy falling back as domestic worries took hold. The decline of the French market, says Nikko Europe's Mr Michael Woodcock, was due more to the government's climbdown over a package of austerity measures proposed for Air France, the state-run airline, than concern over the slow pace of interest rate cuts. Mr Woodcock suggests that the Air France saga - which ended on Friday after a 16-day stoppage of the airline's operations - called into question the government's privatisation programme, given that a number of those companies lined up for sell-off are in need of similar cost-cutting. If the government's resolve broke once, might it not happen again? The level of European interest rates and the likely scenario for further reductions remain uppermost in investors' minds. Warnings last week from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, against expecting further interest rate reductions following the surprise  1/2 percentage point cut on October 21 may have dulled some appetites; but others remain unconvinced. Hoare Govett forecasts a further 50 basis-point cut before the end of the year, probably in December, with a further full percentage point off in the first half of 1994.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**     sterling** US Dollars**              1 Week   4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                          1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +0.76    +9.48   +32.97   +33.69    +30.97       +28.59 Belgium       +0.82    +5.15   +24.71   +24.06    +15.58       +13.47 Denmark       +0.88    +6.25   +46.41   +37.98    +30.29       +27.93 Finland       +1.06   +12.80  +122.64   +99.10    +84.17       +80.84 France        -1.62    +3.35   +29.12   +21.54    +16.31       +14.19 Germany       +0.18    +8.54   +37.18   +33.68    +31.29       +28.90 Ireland       +1.05    +5.44   +57.68   +47.98    +30.66       +28.29 Italy         -1.94    -3.24   +47.16   +39.02    +27.92       +25.61 Netherlands   +0.32    +8.10   +37.29   +33.55    +31.22       +28.83 Norway        +1.15   +11.45   +54.24   +41.74    +36.43       +33.95 Spain         -0.69    +7.26   +60.51   +44.58    +25.62       +23.33 Sweden        +0.54    +7.85   +81.03   +41.62    +25.22       +22.94 Switzerland   +1.15    +9.20   +43.70   +31.66    +32.43       +30.02 UK            -0.83    +4.02   +22.66   +12.99    +12.99       +10.94 EUROPE        -0.44    +5.34   +33.00   +24.07    +20.91       +18.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +2.97    +7.45   +44.40   +31.40    +29.73       +27.37 Hong Kong     +7.23   +22.12   +47.80   +68.00    +71.41       +68.30 Japan         -1.47    +1.31   +27.79   +25.09    +46.76       +44.08 Malaysia      +3.47   +13.93   +82.39   +78.29    +85.78       +82.41 New Zealand   +3.05   +12.02   +69.95   +45.52    +59.88       +56.98 Singapore     -0.28    +8.54   +66.60   +46.51    +54.25       +51.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +2.83    +8.56   +19.32   +19.95    +17.59       +15.45 USA           +0.91    +1.10   +10.60    +7.05     +9.03        +7.05 Mexico        -0.98    +9.21   +28.24   +10.68    +12.44       +10.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +1.37    +5.52   +35.41   +25.62    +47.55       +44.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.05    +2.95   +22.81   +18.07    +23.93       +21.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on October 29th 1993.

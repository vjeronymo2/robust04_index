			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Provider of wood to the stars seeks Pounds 1.6m The producers of Batman and Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, among others films, had no need to worry where they would find wood when they came to the UK. They merely went round to the Pinewood or Shepperton depots of John Mansfield Group. Now the timber processing and manufacturing company is coming to the market in a placing to raise Pounds 1.6m for expansion and to cut debt. The studio division, which also supplies the television and advertising industries, accounts for sales of about Pounds 1m. Total sales in 1993 were Pounds 6.88m (Pounds 5.33m) for pre-tax losses down from Pounds 359,000 to Pounds 90,000. Its biggest activity is the provision of timber products to housebuilders. Ellis &amp; Partners is placing 53.4m shares at 3p apiece, representing 63 per cent of the enlarged capital and valuing the Staffordshire-based company at Pounds 2.52m.</p>

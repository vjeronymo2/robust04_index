			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKS RULES TO PROTECT HEALTH WORKERS FROM AIDS, HEPATITIS B  </P> <P> Employers of the nation's estimated 5.3 million health care workers would be  required to protect them from blood-borne diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis B  under new regulations proposed Monday by the Labor Department.  </P> <P> "Health care professionals are truly on the front line," Labor Secretary Ann  Dore McLaughlin said in announcing the proposals. "They're working to contain  the problem. We must ensure that they are not victims of it."  </P> <P> The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed that  all employers be required to adopt safety programs using a strategy called  "universal precautions," in which all blood and bodily fluids are presumed  infectious and handled accordingly. Under that approach, the fluids are placed  in leakproof containers or color-coded bags or labeled with a clear warning.  </P> <P> McLaughlin said the new standards would affect health care workers at 620,000  sites. The proposals are now subject to public comment and could take up to two  years to become final.  </P> <P> The new rules would require safety training and annual re-education of health  care workers, as well as cleaning and maintenance employees, laundry workers,  students and clinical staff -- anyone who may be exposed to potentially  dangerous body fluids while working in a health care setting.  </P> <P> Further, employers will be required to provide their workers with protective  clothing, such as rubber gloves, masks and fluid-proof aprons, and must provide  free hepatitis B vaccinations to workers who are regularly exposed to blood and  body fluids.  </P> <P> Labor groups and others who have been pushing for such action applauded the  proposed regulations, although some complained that they were too long in  coming.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased to see that they're finally coming out -- we've been  waiting for them," said Donna Richardson, assistant director of congressional  and agency relations for the American Nurses' Assn., which represents the  nation's 1.8 million nurses.  </P></p>

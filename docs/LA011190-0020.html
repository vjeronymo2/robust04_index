			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDISON EXCELS IN ALL AREAS TO BEAT HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> Edison High School easily fended off Huntington Beach, defeating the Oilers,  86-70, in the Sunset League opener for both teams Wednesday.  </P> <P> Edison (12-4 overall, 1-0 in Sunset League) led all the way as it shut down  Huntington Beach (7-8, 0-1) inside.  </P> <P> "It's hard to play catch-up," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller said. "That's  the one thing we didn't want to do. We're tired of always having to make the  adjustments. We tried some things . . . I'm disappointed in a couple of the  players."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach did respond with five three-point baskets, three from Anh  Duong, a 5-foot-9 guard who came off the bench to lead the Oilers with 17  points. But the Chargers outshot, outrebounded and simply outran Huntington  Beach on offense and defense.  </P> <P> "The nice thing about this team is its balance," Edison Coach Jon Borchert  said. "We have six players averaging between 6.5 and 14 points a game. If  someone has an off night, we have other people who can take up the slack."  </P> <P> Bill Martineau, Edison's 6-10 center, had an "off" fourth quarter, fouling out  with 3:43 left to play. But the senior had already scored 21 points and grabbed  a team-high eight rebounds, as his teammates constantly found him open under  the Charger basket. His teammate, guard Tom Tyler, scored 20 points, seven on  free throws, and had six rebounds.  </P> <P> The real show, however, was Brandon Jessie, Edison's 6-4 guard. Jessie scored a  game-high 23 points and pulled down six rebounds. But the sophomore got into  foul trouble in the third quarter, so Borchert took him out with 3:19  remaining.  </P> <P> "Brandon is a very spectacular athlete," Borchert said. "All he needs is a step  and he'll come out. But for us to be good, we need solid play from Martineau  and Tyler. Like any other well coached team, (Huntington Beach) will take what  they're given."  </P> <P> Ocean View 77, Fountain Valley 59 -- Ryan Martin scored 19 points to lead Ocean  View (8-3, 1-0) at Fountain Valley (6-9, 0-1). Greg Evans added 15 points for  Ocean View and Jim Gwaltney had 14.  </P> <P> Marina 68, Westminster 49 -- Marina's Cherokee Parks had 20 points to lead all  scorers. Marina is 9-7 overall, 1-0 in league play. Westminster is 6-8, 0-1.  </P></p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Intrigue under wraps at MI5 THE FASHION for open government yesterday took its toll in that most romantically secretive of organisations, MI5. Mrs Stella Rimington, MI5 director-general, posed for official photographs for the first time. And for Pounds 4.95, the public can buy a 36-page guide to the Security Service from HMSO and good bookshops. The booklet poses no threat to any of the spy novels also available in bookstores. The pulse slows when Mrs Rimington announces in her introduction that 'details of the service's methods and operations in protecting national security must necessarily remain secret'. But Security Service officials say no contemporary spy novel accurately reflects their work, and recommend the booklet for a more down-to-earth view. It certainly provides that. The booklet reveals that an important part of the Security Service management board's brief is not the running of agents, but the management of financial resources. It speaks of resource planning, performance measures and internal audit controls. Being a secret agent, it seems, is like any other job in the modern, financially pressured public sector. MI5, as it has been popularly known since 1916, employs about 2,000 people. More than half are women. There is a similar proportion of women among the 340 staff of the GI (general intelligence) group responsible for investigations and tasks such as recruiting agents. Half the staff are under 40 and, while it might not always have been so, Oxford and Cambridge universities contribute only a quarter of recruits. Some people enter via normal Civil Service selection processes but, it emerged yesterday, MI5 also places newspaper advertisements for recruits. It does not advertise under its own name, or declare that the situation vacant is one of secret agent. Intriguing, but officials could say no more for security reasons. Since last year the service has led the mainland intelligence effort against IRA terrorism. About 70 per cent of work is concerned with terrorism, a big shift in emphasis from the Cold War days. Mrs Rimington's introduction to the booklet concludes with the message: 'Letters should be addressed to PO Box 3255, London SW1P 1AE. All correspondence will be treated in strict confidence and acknowledged.' This is the service's first experiment in soliciting information directly from the public. While not as colourful as burying a note beneath a tree in Regent's Park, it is the closest the booklet comes to the atmosphere of the spy novel. But, an official stressed, MI5 wants to hear from people only if they have information of a genuine security nature. 'Anyone wanting to report a crime should ring the police, not write a letter to a box number,' the official said.</p>

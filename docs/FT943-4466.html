			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Dublin likely to tap 10-year eurobond sector Ireland is likely to tap the 10-year area of the dollar and French franc sectors of the eurobond market to meet its 1995 foreign borrowing needs, which are expected to be about IPounds 4bn, the National Treasury Management Agency said yesterday. Mr Adrian Kearns, head of foreign borrowing at the NTMA, said Ireland has already met its IPounds 800m of foreign borrowing needs for this year. 'It is unlikely that there will be any more issuance this year,' he said, although Ireland could come to the eurobond market in October or November to start next year's funding programme. Cemex, the Mexican cement company, yesterday increased Tuesday's Dollars 250m offering of seven-year eurobonds by a further Dollars 50m. The price range on the original tranche was a yield spread of 230 to 240 basis points over underlying US Treasuries. 'Emerging markets have proved to be difficult all year, Mexico in particular. But this is a fairly strong sign that they are back in business,' said one syndicate manager. 'This deal could lead to a number of Mexican entities coming to the (eurobond) market now that the elections are over and things have calmed down over there,' said another syndicate manager in London. Syndicate managers said the deal was aggressively priced but that it had been a success. 'Being a seven-year deal, it is most likely to appeal to US institutional investors,' a syndicate manager at lead manager Bankers Trust International said. Abbey National launched a FFr2bn four-year bond priced to yield 24 basis points above the 9 1/2 per cent French government bond due 1998. The offering received significant support from French retail and institutional investors, joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said, and the spread of 24 basis points was maintained after the bonds broke syndicate. The proceeds were swapped back into sterling, Abbey National said. Depfa Finance launched a Dollars 150m offering of two-year bonds, priced to yield 15 basis points over the 6 1/4 per cent US Treasury due 1996. The bonds were sold to retail and institutional investors in Switzerland, Germany and the Benelux countries, Depfa said. The proceeds were swapped into floating rate dollar and D-Mark funds, Depfa said. 'There is still good demand from continental European investors for short-dated dollar paper,' said Frank Ruehland, treasurer at Depfa.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Observer: End of affair Sir Evelyn Rothschild's flirtation with the idea that an outsider could run his family's bank, NM Rothschild, has run its course. Fred Vinton, the chief operating officer, is departing to look after another family fortune - that of the Argentine Bembergs. The proprietorial Sir Evelyn plucked the outsider Vinton from JP Morgan at the end of 1987 in a move so unusual that some Rothschild directors assumed Vinton was Sir Evelyn's heir apparent. But last month Sir Evelyn appointed his cousin, Baron David de Rothschild, as deputy chairman. Sir Evelyn has made it clear that Baron de Rothschild, senior partner of Rothschild et Cie in Paris, is likely to succeed him. Although Sir Evelyn has two sons, they are still at school and considered just a trifle too young to take over just yet, though their eventual succession is taken for granted. Sir Evelyn's hope is that cousin David will help to knit together the various Rothschild banks worldwide - just as Michel David-Weill has forged strong links between the assorted Lazard banks. Vinton himself, an American, is returning to his roots without the upheaval of leaving the UK. He was born in the Argentine and worked there for JP Morgan. However, he will manage the Bemberg private businesses from London and will still be able to indulge his passion for foxhunting.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Speculators get taste again for ERM blood THE European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is designed to give governments and industry a stable and predictable framework for economic decision-making. However, after three realignments in 10 weeks, the only predictable characteristic of the ERM now seems to be its instability. This week's unrest is both ironic and inevitable. Ironic, because several European countries now have lower inflation rates than Germany, which provides Europe's 'anchor' currency, the D-Mark. These virtuous countries include two non-ERM members, Sweden and Finland, which have recently abandoned 'pegging' arrangements against the European currency unit, as well as France and Denmark, whose currencies are suffering within the ERM. Inevitable, because this autumn's round of European currency devaluations has now built up sufficient steam to become virtually self-perpetuating. In view of sluggish European growth, it is very difficult for governments to use tight monetary policies to counter the markets' belief that some currencies are over-valued. Germany is much less keen than other countries to see a fall in the Bundesbank's short-term interest rates. The Bundesbank believes premature easing would lower its own anti-inflation credibility. Reflecting this complex environment, much-repeated proclamations by EC finance ministers that they will do 'everything possible' to defend parities count for next to nothing. Convincing the markets is almost as difficult for countries with low inflation rates and healthy current account positions as for those with less convincing performances. As Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg in London, puts it: 'France may have a lower inflation rate (than Germany) and stronger economic growth. The only economic 'fundamental' which counts is that nobody has enough growth. So no government is going to live with 15 per cent interest rates for too long. Like this, defending the system becomes unthinkable.' The size and number of recent exchange rate movements have had two important consequences, both tending to reinforce currency strains. First, the changes in key European currency relationships - including those produced by the decisions by Britain, Italy, Sweden and Finland to float their currencies - have been large enough (of the order of 10 per cent or more) to enable currency speculators to reap large rewards. This has fired traders' desire to make fresh profits by carrying out further assaults on currencies deemed 'weak'. Just as important, the prevailing fear of fresh devaluations has made large companies reluctant to hold weaker currencies. Second, the members of the hard-currency ERM 'core' are facing growing competitive difficulties vis-a-vis the increasing number of countries which have devalued or floated. With European exporters' prospects anyway highly uncertain, the temptation to join the devaluation spiral is growing - above all, for countries which transact much of their trade with the devaluing nations. Within the ERM 'core', the most vulnerable currency is the Irish punt. Ireland sold 34.4 per cent of its exports last year to other members of the 'core' (Germany, France, the Benelux countries and Denmark), while 41.6 per cent was sold to Europe's 'soft seven' - Britain, Finland, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Next in the firing line on competitive grounds is Denmark, which because of its strong trading links to the UK, Sweden and Finland sold 31.7 per cent of its exports last year to the 'soft' club - against 34.8 per cent to the 'core'. French exporters are also coming under pressure: 33.4 per cent of French exports go towards the 'core', while 30 per cent last year were sold to the weaker currency group. Mr Jonathan Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston in London believes the best solution for the ERM's travails would have been for Germany unilaterally to have left the system earlier this year. This would have allowed the D-Mark to float upwards. Now, he says, France can only hope for a repeat performance of September's intervention by the Bundesbank.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo climbs as stronger dollar brings out investors A WEAKER yen encouraged sentiment, and share prices rose on active trading as index-linked buying by arbitrageurs prompted purchases by institutional and individual investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 314.23 at 18,764.92. The index opened at the day's low of 18,471.96, and hit a high of 18,877.50 in the morning session. Share prices eased in the afternoon on profit-taking. Volume rose from 356m shares to 470m. Advances overwhelmed declines by 785 to 258, with 127 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 18.59 to 1,414.02 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 7.12 to 1,129.91. The dollar firmed Y1.22 against the yen, closing at Y117.15. US economic figures announced overnight encouraged hopes of a strengthening American economy, and the currency closed above Y117 for the first time in seven trading days. Reports that a leading US securities house was advising investors to increase allocation to Japanese stocks also encouraged buying by institutional investors. Yesterday's gains were led by a rise in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which closed up 18,000 to Y828,000 in active trading. Telecommunications related issues were also strong, with Fujikura up Y82 to Y760 and Furukawa Electric gaining Y100 to Y607. High-technology exporters were higher on the lower yen. Fujitsu gained Y35 to Y640 and NEC, the most active issue of the day, gained Y63 to Y835. Some investors bought cheap large capital stocks to lock in dividends, paid at the end of the financial year. Nippon Steel rose Y8 to Y335, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rose Y14 to Y564. The forthcoming listing of JR East, expected in the third quarter of this year, buoyed railway-related issues. Keisei Electric Railway rose Y10 to Y1,090 and Tokyu Car, a rolling stock maker, Y10 to Y570. Foreign buying lifted Nomura Securities, which firmed Y80 to Y1,880. Other brokers were also strong with Nikko Securities up Y23 to Y850 and Daiwa Securities advancing Y20 to Y1,060. Food shares were lower on profit-taking. Ajinomoto fell Y10 to Y1,250 and Kirin Brewery fell Y10 to Y1,160. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 218.59 to 19,659.09 in volume of 124.4m shares. Export-oriented issues were higher on the lower yen. Roundup AN absence of fresh incentives and holidays in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur made for a quiet day on the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG was firmer but off the day's highs as profit-taking emerged when the Hang Seng index briefly topped the 6,300 level. At the close, the index was 34.78 ahead at 6,246.97 as turnover climbed to HKDollars 3.7bn. Property stocks, the star performers of the previous two days on hopes of a higher mortgage ceiling, saw strong profit-taking but most shares still finished higher. Sun Hung Kai Properties closed up 50 cents at HKDollars 32.50 after touching HKDollars 32.75 and Hysan rose 20 cents to HKDollars 14.10. Jardine Matheson rose 50 cents to HKDollars 47.25 after better than expected 1992 profits. AUSTRALIAN stocks edged down with the All Ordinaries index shedding 2.4 to 1,660.7 in weak turnover of ADollars 260.1m. However, the gold marker rose 16.3 to 1,140.0, aided by uncertainty over the outlook in Russia. In the banking sector, Westpac fell 4 cents to ADollars 2.98 in volume of 4.6m shares amid speculation about further property write-downs, involving as much as ADollars 900m. NEW ZEALAND was unperturbed by a cabinet reshuffle and shares were firmer with the NZSE-40 index 6.76 ahead at 1,560.01. Fletcher Challenge, which cleared the way for the sale of its methanol operations, gained 5 cents to NZDollars 2.45. TAIWAN was mixed after late profit-taking cut early gains and the weighted index, which rose more than 50 points at one stage, ended 2.0 lower at 4,652.68 in turnover of TDollars 51.2bn. Formosa Plastics added TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 45.10 on reports that it would soon start building its long-delayed naphtha cracker plant.</p>

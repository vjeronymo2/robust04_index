			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Benson doubles to Pounds 1.92m with help from acquisitions ACQUISITIONS helped Benson Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, double annual profits but Mr Richard Phillips, chairman, warned that although there had been some upturn, the pattern of demand was uneven. Pre-tax profits over the year to May 31 were Pounds 1.92m, against Pounds 915,000. Turnover increased to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 12.6m). The sharp rises reflected the purchase in March 1992 of the Thama group of companies, a move which effectively doubled the size of the group. Earnings per share of 1.45p showed a 33 per cent increase. The proposed final dividend is 0.2p, bringing the total to 0.3p (0.1p). Earnings were sustained by a low tax charge, following on the tax losses which have been carried forward since Mr Phillips and his management team took over three years ago. Benson carries forward into its new year Pounds 7m of tax losses. The main thrust to increased profits came from the engineered components division, but the performance of the environmental control and vehicle engineering division was slugg-ish. During the current year, this pattern is likely to be repeated although Mr Phillips said he expected margins would improve in the environmental control and vehicle engineering divisions. He noted that the group was not heavily exposed to continental European markets. Since the year end, Benson has sold Wolverhampton Pressings to Ralph Martindale for Pounds 450,000.</p>

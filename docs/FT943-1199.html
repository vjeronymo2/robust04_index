			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (19): PC Express provides analysis tool - Case study When Bulmers decided to change its focus from being a volume-driven business to a profit-oriented company, it realised that it would need new analysis tools. It wanted its 40 national account managers to be able to get up-to-date information on profitability by customer (for example, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury) and by brand. And it wanted its 12 brand managers-planners to be able to look at the make-up of a brand and all its associated costs including marketing, packaging and distribution. Two years ago, the company began to look for a suitable product. Today it is using PC Express, a multi-dimensional Olap database from US-based Information Resources (IRI). The database  - used in conjunction with IRI's Financial Management System (financial planning software)  - helps the company analyse its data from many different perspectives (or dimensions). Dr Martin Wynn, head of information technology at Bulmers, says 'previously we could get data on sales volume and value, but not profitability.' The PC Express database sits on a pentium server (a powerful PC) and is updated every 24-hours with the latest information from the company's existing Oracle database. PC Express indexes the data it receives by all conceivable dimensions, such as by customer, by product and by date. Because the data is already indexed, PC users can get fast replies to any ad hoc queries that occur to them. The project to introduce a new system began two years ago. At present the system has three Bulmers users. But, in the next six to nine months, it will be given to its national-account and brand managers, and to a handful of its financial controllers and directors. Including hardware, software and staff time, the project has cost almost Pounds 1m. It is expected to yield hard benefits of Pounds 450,000 a year and another Pounds 200,000-Pounds 250,000 in soft benefits. Tim Furse, the company's commercial director, believes the hard benefits will include cost savings. 'We will be able to track the effectiveness of our spend whether it be on distribution, packaging, promotion or producing our products,' he says. 'We can then take out cost where necessary, for example, in packaging.' The system is also expected to improve profitability. The plan is that Bulmer's account managers will be able to take into account the full costs of dealing with a particular customer. They will also be able to look at the mix of brands sold to each account, noting those which are most profitable for the company. Using the financial management software, account managers will be able to produce monthly forecasts of the profit contributions of their accounts  - and brand managers will be able to predict the likely progress of their brands.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Minkin: "Mail: Criminal Candor"] </F>   [Text] On Wednesday evening a package containing the  note published below and a personal letter from its author, the  editor in chief of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, was delivered to the  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA editorial offices. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  traditionally offers its readers the opportunity to express  themselves freely on its pages, especially if there is a  suspicion that the other pluralistic domestic press is not  pluralistic enough, so that the invective the author holds dear  will still be published somewhere. For example, during the first  days after the August putsch in 1991 when the communist press  was banned, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA published Mr. Limonov. But there  is no need to attach personal letters. Everything is clear  without them.    Monday on television M. Poltoranin stated: "Journalists use  the language (not Russian) which I call `camp Hebrew.' It is the  language of lies, Russophobia, and contempt for the people. The  journalists do not understand that they are evoking a wave of  anti-Semitism in response."    So this is the language in which the newspapers are  published  in Russia.    What comment can be made here, how can this be interpreted?    Poltoranin could have called the camp language "jargon,"  "criminal talk," or "perverted Russian." He called the language  of journalists "camp Hebrew."    Hebrew is the ancient Jewish language. "Russophobia" is a  word put into the chauvinistic article by the same name by the  magazine NASH SOVREMENNIK. And in order to make sure there were  no doubts, Poltoranin added the bit about the "wave of  anti-Semitism in response." It was clear that only Semites could  cause such a wave.    We did not learn anything new about Poltoranin. But this was  the first time he was so candid. Like DEN, Pamyat, and Mr.  Zhirinovskiy.    For the candor--thank you.    If M. Poltoranin, the chairman of the State Duma Committee  on  Mass Media, will allow us, we will teach him some pure Russian.  For it was not in vain that he wrote in ROSSISKAYA GAZETA: "The  average statistical journalist is an ordinary person who does  not always understand the deep processes in the change of  formations. He, too, needs guides to the roads of reform."    Now I know precisely who our Guide is. And, of course, I  want  always to understand the deep processes.    In the summer of 1950 Comrade Stalin wrote the work of  genius  "Marxism and Questions of Linguistics."    The entire country learned by heart the Discovery that  language is neither a base nor a superstructure. So many people  who understood poorly went to the camps--may God remember their  names!    Poltoranin is a continuer of the great cause. He learned, he  understood, and he did not forget. By adding to the word Hebrew  the adjective "camp," Poltoranin, it seems, was also hinting at  our future destination.    Deep processes are frequently reflected in folklore. And we,  over a bottle, for many decades have sung accompanied by a  guitar:    Comrade Stalin, you are a great scholar.    In  linguistics you are simply a luminary.    But I am a  simple Soviet prisoner--    Not a Communist and not even  a Jew.    We sing it in chorus--Russians and Jews and Tatars (we have  all kinds of journalists). We sing in Russian because they did  not teach us Hebrew.    We sing and we look at how, shuffling along with a party  gait, the solid member of the State Duma goes to the podium.  Chairman of the mass media, Russia's Choice, M. Poltoranin.    It is difficult to reproach a person for both anti-Semitism  and Russophobia at the same time. But I have to say that you  rarely hear such malicious Russophobery as comes from that same  Poltoranin. On that same television program he stated: "The  Russian idea is coming to a head, like a boil."    Is it not painful for you to sit down, Mikhail Nikiforovich?    P.S. I have no questions for the new procurator general. He  already knows (from experience from Stepankov) that it is better  not to disturb Poltoranin. Kazannik understands that fanning  ethnic dissension at such an altitude--is not even criminality,  it is not Article 74 of the Criminal Code of the Russian  Federation, but--it is politics! Our native domestic politics.  Because for a Western politician such a statement would be  tantamount to suicide.    The only person to whom (without any special hope,  incidentally) one can ask a serious question is Gaydar.    Yegor Timurovich, you are the leader of Russia's Choice.  Poltoranin is in your ranks. If he says such things and you  remain silent--does this mean that you have ripened? You are  already a real 100-percent Soviet politician. You could be  stamped as such. If there were a free space on you for the stamp.</p>

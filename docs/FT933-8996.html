			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Bank eases grip on settlement of gilts THE BANK of England, in a move to widen the appeal of UK government bonds to overseas buyers, will allow investors to hold and settle gilts using the two international clearing systems, Cedel and Euroclear. At present, investors have to settle gilts through the Bank of England's Central Gilts Office (CGO). However, discussions are taking place between the Bank, Cedel and Euroclear to establish a link with the CGO, allowing investors to hold and settle gilts through Cedel and Euroclear. For international investors with a range of European government bonds and eurobonds in their fixed income portfolios, it may be more convenient to keep all their holdings under one roof and settle in one currency. The CGO provides an efficient electronic system for investors to hold stock, and allows institutional investors or gilt-edged marketmakers who have accounts there to transfer UK government stock easily. The CGO was set up by the Bank in 1986, the year of Big Bang, to provide investors with a speedy settlement system. However, investors argue that if they want, for example, to move out of UK gilts and switch the proceeds into French or German government bonds, it is more convenient to do so using one system - whether that be Cedel or Euroclear. 'Settlement at the CGO is extremely efficient, but some investors prefer to use an international settlements system,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. Overseas investors have been keen buyers of gilts in recent months. Many were attracted by sterling's weakness against the D-Mark earlier this year, and were looking for a sterling appreciation of their assets and a further rally in the gilt market.

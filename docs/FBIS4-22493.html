What are the results?    [Petrov] A year is not too great a period to build up a  serious organization. We have obtained the money to create the  charter fund with great delay and the total amount of the funds  we have received comes to about 10 percent of that envisaged by  the Russian Federation President's decree about forming the  corporation. That is why, based on the actual amounts which we  managed to nevertheless obtain with great difficulty, we did not  set ourselves the goal of investing it in projects right away  since we understood perfectly well that their implementation  would not have been able to have had any substantial influence  on the structual reorganization of the economy. That is why the  main attention and efforts were concentrated on the working out  of economic and legal mechanisms ensuring an inflow of domestic  and foreign investments into the economy of Russia. Strictly  speaking, precisely this goal was pursued also in the creation  of the corporation.    [Yakushev] What sort of mechanism do you have in mind?    [Petrov] The question is one of creating an integral system  capable of mobilizing and optimizing financial flows and of  achieving the concentration of resources in the most important  directions, of ensuring effective control and, what is the main  thing, of protecting investments from risks. Probably not  everybody knows, but based on the degree of political risk for  the investor, Russia occupies 50th, and based on the degree of  economic risk, 53rd place among 54 countries of the world.    We have done all the necessary work to inspire the  confidence  of foreign investors that their capital is protected. Literally  a few days ago the Russian Investment Insurance Company  (Rossiyskaya kompaniya po strakhovaniyu investitsiy) was  registered abroad. Its assets have also been invested abroad.  The goal of the company is to secure the insuring of the foreign  investments from political risks (war, expropriation, currency  inconvertibility, the alienation of property rights, etc.). As  yet the company's charter capital is relatively small and is  capable of ensuring the protection of investments in the amount  of US $350-400 million. And this is no longer a little.  Moreover, the organization of insurance will give rise to an  "avalanche" effect and the example will indicate also Russia's  concrete steps in creating real guarantees for Western  investors. The most important world insurance companies have  already expressed a readiness to associate themselves with our  insurance fund.    We propose to insure the commercial risks of investors  through our insurance company currently being established in the  territory of Russia.    [Yakushev] What could you say about the structure of your  organization and its associates?    [Petrov] From the very beginning we set a goal of taking on  only the strictly necessary number of associates. That is why  the entire central staff of the corporation numbers a little  more than 40 persons. Most of them are highly skilled  specialists.    Besides the central staff a number of subsidiary khozraschet  enterprises, such as Gosinkor-trast, Gosinkor Torgovyy Dom, and  Gosinkor Lotereya have been established. The regional  representatives of the corporation are beginning to work more  actively. We have been the founders of such financial structures  as the inter-bank investment association Invest-kredit and the  Entrepreneurship Development Bank. Gosinkor will become a  powerful financial holding company in the future.    Expert appraisal and project financing groups have gradually  been formed in the corporation. Work in training personnel for  Russian institutions related to the investment process is  expanding. About 2,000 projects have been certified and the data  base is steadily being enlarged. The Partners of Russia  investment fund has been created jointly with the OPIC (an  American foreign private investment corporation). Moreover, we  have paid in $5 million and issued insurance for $20 million.  The total amount of the fund will come to about $100 million,  which will permit the attraction of almost $1 billion in  investments into the Russian economy. This is already quite  decent. We are participating in the creation of several more  such funds.    All these are the components of a single mechanism, without  which one cannot efficiently carry on the investment process.    [Yakushev] Why wasn't the edict of the president of the  Russian Federation about alloting you the necessary monetary  funds carried out?    [Petrov] Because in the previous government there were  people  for whom a presidential edict was not a guide to action. Of  course, one should also take the difficulties which the  country's economy has faced into account. However, I think that  the government's leaders should have looked ahead. There's no  need to talk about this now. The main thing is that the  corporation is standing firmly on its feet and the battles have  only hardened us.    [Yakushev] Do you have an investment policy concept?    [Petrov] Yes, we have such a concept. In the very near  future  we intend to give a report on it to a meeting of the Commission  on Day-to-Day Problems of the Government of Russia (Kommissiya  po operativnym voprosam pravitelstva Rossii) which Vice Premier  Oleg Soskovets heads. We expect that, taking into account the  structures which have been formed and the experience that has  been accumulated, we will be able to become a serious partner,  or, more precisely, a mechanism of the government in conducting  investment policy and improving the legislative base of the  investment process.    It is my profound conviction that Gosinkor should become the  mechanism for converting from a centralized administrative  investment system to a market system relying on fundamentally  new sources and utilizing the methods of the investment banks of  the West, which have also provided the financial basis for the  prosperity of the capitalistic economy.    Analysis of the investment readiness of our plants has  revealed a paradoxical result--not a single facility is ready  for correct and sound investment. From force of habit all state  a need for money "from Moscow," and not one ponders over actual  repayment and even survival. To give them money today is to  simply mechanically continue free financing and to  irretrieviably waste the latest budget funds on potential  bankruptcy. That is why we set ourselves the goal not to delay  the tragic outcome at the price of the latest money but to  create a mechanism and conditions which will not tolerate,  first, the continuation of cost-based financing, and, secondly,  will really help an enterprise to switch over to the rules of  market investment, to adapt itself and to survive under modern  conditions. The fact is that there are not enough budget funds  and even the market theory of investing regards centralized  resources only as a component of the investment flow where the  basic accent should be put on traditional sources--the funds of  the population and of enterprises, pension, insurance and other  funds, and foreign investors.    [Yakushev] What goals are you setting yourselves for next  year?    [Petrov] Much depends on what resources will be given over  to  the State Investment Corporation for the fulfillment of its  charter tasks. In the present case I mean the financial  resources and property intended for filling up the corporation's  charter fund, centralized capital investments, as well as the  state shares of the stocks of privatized enterprises which, on  the basis of agreements already achieved with the Russian  Federation State Committee on the Administration of State  Property and the Federal Property Fund, will be transferred to  us in trust management or for sale at investment auctions.    On the whole the mechanism created by the corporation and  the  experience accumulated permits one in the shortest time possible  to expand the attraction of investments along a broad front  through insurance activity and to more efficiently manage  centralized capital investments, having ensured their maximum  use and a high return.    The creation of an investment-tender center, where, after  the  appropriate preparation, blocks of shares of privatized  enterprises will be offered, will be an important direction. The  stage of the practical implementation of an entire series of  investment projects with the participation of both the  corporation's internal capital funds and domestic and foreign  capital will begin in the current year.</p>

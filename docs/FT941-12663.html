			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: RMC hit hard The upsurge in RMC shares was abruptly reversed by a profits downgrade from James Capel, the market's leading agency broker. Capel was said to have eased its 1993 profits number to Pounds 172m, that for 1994 to Pounds 195m and the 1995 figure to Pounds 225m, because of worries about the German economy. RMC shares, among the building sector's best performers since the turn of the year, fell 33 to 993p after the Capel downgrade, although market turnover failed to reach the 1m mark. Redland, also heavily influenced by the German economy, lost 15 at 616p. The market registered satisfaction with the decision by Ofgas to implement a new gas pricing formula, which is shifted from inflation minus 5 per cent to inflation minus 4 per cent, hoisting British Gas to a day's high of 351p. It closed 4 1/2 ahead at 349 1/2 p, with turnover expanding to 16m. 'This is the first good news for British Gas for some time and should see the shares move ahead in the short term,' said one analyst. Enterprise Oil eased 3 to 458p, with dealers slightly surprised at the market's lack of response to the recent Elf presentation in London at which Elf directors said they regarded the Enterprise shareholding as a 'strategic stake'. An upbeat presentation to analysts by leisure group Granada helped the shares and also boosted television group LWT (up 18 at 706p), for which Granada has launched an all-paper bid. The presentation led to a rise in Granada shares of 16 to 585p and ensured that the LWT bid was valued at 702p a share. Analysts said that the rise relieved pressure on Granada to raise its offer following the relatively high price put on rival Anglia TV by investment group MAI. Anglia gained 3 at 658p and MAI rose 2 to 301p. After the market closed LWT hit back at Granada's move to extend its offer for the television group, saying: 'Granada's latest message to shareholders smacks of desperation.' Pearson, which has a stake in satellite group BSkyB, rose 4 to 668p on news that BSkyB is looking at ways of repaying some of the money invested by shareholders. News International, which owns a majority interest in BSkyB, added 12 at 289p. Healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman put on 6 at 680p as UBS took the stock off its sell list arguing that the shares had underperformed the broad market and the company's brand investment was poised to improve. The house also says that as a company which earns 80 per cent of its cash overseas it would benefit from a stronger dollar - UBS has a currency forecast of Dollars 1.30 to the pound for 1995. A mixed trading statement from Tate &amp; Lyle confirmed the opinion of some in the market that the stock looked overbought and the shares slid 14 to 439p. There was a big switch by one institution out of Bass, down 11 at 568p, and into Whitbread 'A', steady at 603p. Westland Group raced up 14 to 289p following a positive outlook on its prospects at a Panmure Gordon defence conference. British Aerospace benefited from similar sentiment at the same meeting and firmed 2 to 438p. Shares in British Airways fell 7 to 464p in trade of 4.8m after James Capel urged investors to switch out of the stock and into BAA, which it said was undervalued. The UK airports operator moved 8 ahead to 1032p on the advice, with volume reaching 1.3m. NFC eased 2 to 282p on hints that one of the large Scottish institutions had a big line of stock on offer.

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Top German telecom official sacked The crisis over management and regulation in Germany's telecommunications sector sharpened yesterday with the sacking of the chief architect of the government's liberalisation programme. Mr Peter Bross, the top postal ministry official responsible for strategy, tariffs and regulatory matters, was yesterday forced into 'temporary retirement' after disputes with his seniors. Mr Bross, 44, was removed by a little-used regulatory device for displacing public officials, who are commonly protected by a jobs-for-life guarantee. His departure follows the equally unexpected resignation for 'purely personal reasons' earlier this month of Mr Helmut Ricke, chairman of the state monopoly Deutsche Telekom, and last week's rejection by Mr Tyll Necker, outgoing head of the confederation of German industry, of a seat on Telekom's supervisory board. Officials commenting on the sequence yesterday suggested a crisis of confidence at the most senior level in the commitment of Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post minister, and his state secretary, Mr Gerhard Pfeffermann, to deregulation in the telecoms market. Mr Botsch has said he is committed to free competition in the German telecoms market by 1998, but 'that is not much help when no one knows what is going to be liberalised or how,' one critic said yesterday. Bankers preparing for the first tranche of Telekom's privatisation, due in mid-1996, said the disruption at management and political level was unlikely to affect the projected share sale, but it would be helpful if the government could in future make a start on preparing the new legislation necessary for supervising the telecoms market after privatisation. Mr Bross, an ardent promoter of orderly liberalisation in the telecoms market, has played a leading role in changes such as the successful introduction of private-sector competition in mobile telephones. He has often complained that present legislation is designed to turn Telekom from a state to a private monopoly without allowing the private sector a chance to compete on equal terms. Observers yesterday reported 'friction and discord' had been apparent between Mr Bross and Mr Pfeffermann for many months. 'He was one of our best people,' one said. The fact he had been removed because of a purely political decision should be seen as a sign that telecoms liberalisation was not the government's main aim,' another stated. Mr Pfeffermann, recently appointed to Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board, was also the reason for Mr Necker's rejection of a supervisory post. Mr Necker's complaint of a conflict of interest between Mr Pfeffermann's ministry role as a telecoms industry regulator and as a representative of Telekom's owners was dismissed as incomprehensible by Mr Botsch. Mr Ricke, yet to be replaced, has refused to explain his decision to quit, announced earlier this month two days after the post ministry said five politicians were to be given seats on Telekom's supervisory board.

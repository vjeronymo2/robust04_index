			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- The numerous alarming reports  coming in from the Crimea are creating an agitated mood among  the population of the Crimea itself, as well as that of Ukraine  and Russia.    Meanwhile, the summer vacation period is approaching. The  Crimea is known to be a holiday resort traditionally popular  with the residents of Russia, Ukraine, and other CIS states. If  a "frontline" atmosphere is artificially created, hundreds of  thousands of people may succumb to groundless fear and will thus  be left without a place to spend their vacation in.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed his press  service to make it clear to the public that the situation in the  Crimea is giving no cause for concern. The calm atmosphere and  the entire infrastructure required for normal peaceful rest are  being maintained in the Crimea. The president's press service  gave this message to the ITAR-TASS agency.</p>

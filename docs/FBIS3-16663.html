Lieutenant General Viktor Zemtsov, commander of the  district, told the journalists that the redeployment was of a  planned nature. Being moved together with the directorate are  some of the district's subunits. Zemtsov underscored at the  same time that all the groups of forces necessary for guarding  the state border with Turkey will stay on the territory of  Georgia. "We are not leaving Georgia and Armenia, our  directorate is simply moving over to Stavropol," said Zemtsov,  adding that the district is in charge, first, of the former USSR  borders guarded by Russian Federation border guards; second, of  the Russian Federation state border in the Northern Caucasus.  Along this border, the guards will keep tabs on the movement of  weapons, contraband, and drugs from Russia to other countries  and vice versa.    The district was created in line with the Russian Federation  president's edict of 1 March 1994. Before that there existed,  for one year, a Northern Caucasus border district, which was  known as the Transcaucasus border district until 1 March 1993.    On the morning of 17 March the commander met with Georgian  leaders, in particular with Prime Minister Otari Patsatsiya, and  expressed thanks to the Government of Georgia for understanding  and support, for kind relationships. "We don't say 'goodbye,'  we say 'see you again,' and we will continue guarding the state  border."    Talking to journalists, Viktor Zemtsov remarked that  residents of the Republic of Georgia will also serve in the  Russian Federation border troops beginning this year. As early  as this April or May, they will be first drafted for service in  the Russian Federation border troops to guard the state border  with Turkey. The number of draftees will be between 500 and 600  men. In the future, he said, nearly 30 percent of the entire  personnel of the Russian Federation border troops stationed in  Georgia will be the republic's residents. Among them, there will  be enlisted men, warrant officers, and officers. Drafting will  be effected irrespective of the men's nationality: Georgians,  Russians, Abkhaz, and others will be eligible.    Responding to questions relating to border control between  Russia and Georgia, Zemtsov said that subunits and units of  Russian Federation border troops are being deployed along the  Psou River. Their missions in guarding the state border, in  preventing the crossing from the Russian Federation into Georgia  and vice versa of any groups of people and arms, have already  been defined for them. He said he has some experience in  checking up on and detaining groups that carried weapons from  Russia to Abkhazia and back.    Thus, the district continues to perform its duties, and one  should not create a stir about the district directorate's  redeployment from Tbilisi to Stavropol.</p>

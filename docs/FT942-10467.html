			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (17): Self-sufficiency a remote goal - Bad weather and low prices have hit agricultural production Although agricultural production is expected to be a key beneficiary of the government's market-based reforms, Kenya is unlikely to recover self-sufficiency in food production in the near future. The population explosion and the scarcity of arable land mean that agricultural expansion will have to come from increases in productivity. Many believe it was the dismal performance of agriculture - mainstay of the economy and only source of livelihood for 20m people (80 per cent of the population) - that finally persuaded the government to implement reforms. Agricultural production contracted by more than 6 per cent between 1991 and 1993, the worst decline since independence. Unfavourable weather and low world prices for coffee, a significant export commodity, were partly to blame; but so, too, were policies which subsidised urban consumers at the expense of farmers, and the inefficiency and corruption within the state marketing monopolies for staple crops. When change came, it was sudden and dramatic. Until October 1993, it was illegal for private traders to import maize into Kenya; until December it was illegal to move it around the country. Both are now actively encouraged. Price controls on maize were lifted at the end of 1993, raising the cost of this foodstuff by 40 per cent in Nairobi. Contrary to government fears, there were no food riots. But economic hardship is severe, and is limiting what Kenyans can afford to eat. In the countryside, the US Agency for International Development believes most rural families are surviving on a diet of maize, tea, cabbage and potatoes or cassava. Sugar has become scarce, and when available is scarcely affordable. For city dwellers, maize flour now accounts for 70 per cent of the daily caloric intake. Bread has become a luxury, while most families are struggling to maintain their consumption levels of vegetable oil, milk and sugar. The National Cereals and Produce Board, the former grain marketing monopoly, has begun to privatise some of its warehouses. Eventually, its role will be confined to maintaining strategic grain reserves and acting as a buyer and seller of last resort. But it will remain active in the import and marketing of grain, while the private sector finds its feet in the newly liberalised environment. The price and marketing reforms were all the more remarkable, in that they were implemented during Kenya's worst drought of the past 10 years. In the heavily populated Eastern Province, the failure of the December rains wiped out half the maize crop. Maasai herdsmen in the Great Rift Valley have lost more than 275,000 head of cattle. The government says 5m people - one-fifth of the population - are in need of emergency food handouts. About 1.7m tonnes, or just over half the national maize consumption, will have to be met by a combination of commercial imports, government purchases and food donations. And although the rains returned in April, meteorologists say it is too early to assess their impact on the September harvest. Other factors have depressed agricultural production. Ethnic clashes have forced an estimated 300,000 people of the mainly Kikuyu farming community to abandon their homesteads in the Rift Valley, according to church organisations. Human rights groups have blamed government politicians for instigating the conflict between Maasai and Kalenjin herdsmen and the Kikuyu. The repercussions of the conflict go well beyond a decline in agricultural output. Many Kenyans fear the countryside could slide into civil war unless the government undertakes greater efforts to restore peace. Agriculturalists are also concerned about the marked decline in the use of fertilisers since prices were liberalised in 1992. The government is considering the reintroduction of subsidies for fertilisers and agricultural credit to reverse this worrying trend. The distribution of sub-standard planting seed by the state-owned Kenya Seed Company - another parastatal plagued by mismanagement and corruption - has also lowered productivity. All these factors are making self-sufficiency in food production an ever distant goal. The government estimates that maize production would have to rise by 4 per cent a year to eliminate the need for imports by the turn of the century. Only significant improvements in yields could achieve this growth, as Kenya's marginal agricultural land offers only limited potential. At the same time, the need to import increasing quantities of maize, wheat, rice, sugar and vegetable oil to feed a rapidly expanding population has eroded Kenya's agricultural trade surplus. The positive trade balance fell from nearly Dollars 500m in 1990 to Dollars 288m in 1992, and is estimated to have fallen further in 1993.</p>

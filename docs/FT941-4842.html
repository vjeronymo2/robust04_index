			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: FT-SE committee refuses to change Inchcape classification The FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee has again turned down a plea by Inchcape to move its shares from the vehicle distributors sector to diversified industries, writes Maggie Urry. The committee met on Monday, March 7, to discuss quarterly changes to the constituents of sectors which will take effect on April 1. The new system came into operation at the start of this year. Inchcape said the committee's decision was 'a great disappointment'. It has repeatedly argued that although 60 per cent of its 1992 profits derived from 'motors importing, distribution and retailing', only 14 per cent came from the retail side. Inchcape said it made a further submission to the committee arguing that factors which affect UK motor retailers were different to those which bear on Inchcape's activities. The group is planning to alter the split of profits disclosed when it publishes 1993 results on March 28. It will divide the motor retail profits from the importing and distribution activity.</p>

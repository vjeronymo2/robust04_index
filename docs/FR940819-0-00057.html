			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sale of Used Appliances Without Service Apertures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 82.154(j) and &sect;82.154(k) are prohibitions against the sale and distribution, or offer for sale and distribution of any appliance, unless such equipment is equipped with either a service aperture or, for small appliances, with a process stub, to facilitate the removal of refrigerant. EPA would like to clarify that for the purposes of these prohibitions, EPA will interpret sale, distribution, or offer of sale or distribution as not referring to the sale of used products. Sale of used products means a sale or distribution by a person after a period of use other than demonstration use. The Agency recognizes that there is a market for the sale of used air conditioners and refrigerators. Restricting the resale of such used durable goods before the end of their productive lifetimes would provide little, if any, environmental benefit. Indeed, the introduction of a service aperture may lead to unintentional releases by weakening the refrigeration circuit. Because requiring these goods to be retrofitted prior to resale would impose significant economic hardship on a great many consumers without providing significant environmental benefits, EPA does not believe it is necessary to ban their resale. Consequently, while EPA's interpretation of sale and distribution or offer for sale and distribution is such that the entire chain of sale and distribution from the manufacturer of a new product to its ultimate consumer is included, the Agency recognizes that in the case of durable consumer goods, resale of the product to additional consumers may occur after the original sale or distribution of the new product to the ultimate consumer after some period of use by the original ultimate consumer. In such cases, EPA will not prohibit the sale of these used products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Exceptions to Prohibition on Sale of Unreclaimed Refrigerant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibitions &sect;&sect;82.154(g) and 82.154(h) currently prohibit the sale of used refrigerant that has not been reclaimed by a certified reclaimer. EPA intended to exclude two classes of used refrigerant from this prohibition: refrigerant that was and is to be used only in an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance, and refrigerant that is contained in an appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the refrigerant. The section 609 refrigerant recycling rule, which covers MVACs, explicitly recognizes and permits the transfer of refrigerant between MVACs owned by different persons if that refrigerant is: (1) Recovered from an MVAC and returned to an MVAC by a single service entity; and (2) recycled to meet the SAE J1991 standard. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  (This provision of the section 609 rule, which is contained in the definition of ``properly using'' recycling and recovery equipment, also covers MVAC-like appliances pursuant to &sect;82.156(a)(5).) Because this standard is not as stringent as the standard that reclaimed refrigerant must meet in the section 608 refrigerant recycling rule, refrigerant that only meets this standard cannot be considered reclaimed. Thus, such refrigerant cannot be sold under the section 608 rule. However, EPA did not intend to reverse the position that it took in the section 609 rule regarding the transfer of refrigerant between MVACs owned by different people. For instance, one of the primary arguments made in support of the reclamation requirement in the section 608 rule, that no less stringent recycling standard currently exists (58 FR 28679), clearly does not apply to MVACs and MVAC-like appliances, which are governed by the less stringent SAE J1991 standard. EPA is therefore amending the prohibitions to exclude the sale of refrigerant transferred between MVACs or MVAC-like appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the section 609 rule states, ``service establishments owned by a single owner may recover refrigerant and send the refrigerant to a central location for recycling to the SAE J1991 standard for CFC&hyph;12'' (57 FR 31246). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another primary argument made in support of the reclamation requirement, that transfer of refrigerant between different owners can contaminate appliances, clearly does not apply to refrigerant that changes ownership solely because it is contained in an appliance that changes ownership. If refrigerant remains within a single appliance, it obviously cannot introduce contaminants into another appliance. Thus, EPA is also amending the prohibition to exclude the sale of refrigerant that is contained in an appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the refrigerant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): Chilling commercials do not help - Tourist industry now offers too many attractions for too few tourists On September 22 a small, narrow-gauge steam train will make its last journey around Lord O'Neill's Shane's Castle estate on the shores of Lough Neagh in County Antrim. Lord O'Neill, who installed the railway in 1971, says that with only 30,000 passengers each year, it did not pay its way. Northern Ireland now offers too many attractions for too few tourists. 'Unless peace breaks out, some of them won't be sustainable. We need to watch the total number and we have to go for quality, not quantity.' He is himself a former chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB). His remarks strike a chord in the industry. Promotors and proprietors bemoan Ulster's wettest, most sunless summer since reliable records began. Thousands of what would have been the industry's home-trade visitors scrambled for last-minute bookings to seek sunshine elsewhere. Has the province, in a frenetic burst of development activity enthusiastically supported by the NITB and funded with big subventions from both the EC and the International Fund for Ireland, over-catered for the level of tourism it can reasonably expect while its external image remains so poor? Presenting his 1992 annual report, Mr Hugh O'Neill, the present NITB chairman, unabashedly announced that the board was currently involved in the development of some 350 projects. The NITB has just published a brochure on no fewer than 24 developments either just opened or to open by the end of this month. They include multi-million pound 'star attractions' such as the Pounds 4.5m interpretative centre at Navan Fort outside Armagh - the Emain Macha of Gaelic legend, seat of the ancient kings of Ulster. Then there is the Tower museum in Londonderry, which capitalises on the rich history of western Europe's last fortress city with ancient walls intact. A big 'discovery centre' on Lough Neagh will be a success if it does not drive the ambient bird life away. Carrickfergus, on the Antrim coast, hid its magnificent Norman castle behind a screen of enormous oil tanks and paid scant regard to its archaeological heritage - until recently. In July this year the innovative Pounds 2.5m 'Knightride' monorail opened, carrying visitors through tableaux of Carrickfergus's history from 531 AD almost to the present day. Northern Ireland's 26 district councils, deprived of most of the powers enjoyed by their mainland counterparts, have clamoured for grants to exercise their muscle in one of the very few sectors where their writ can run. The upshot is that while the province is not exactly rich in 'heritage and interpretive' centres, provision is unbalanced and some long-standing Ulster assets are ignored. (It remains very difficult, for example, to find a public slipway giving a boat owner easy access to the tidal waters of the 18-mile long Strangford Lough.) With an 80 per cent increase in inquiries this year compared with 1992, the NITB is forecasting an all-time high of 1.5m visitors against last year's total of 1.255m - which itself was a 6 per cent increase on 1991. These figures include business visitors and what the trade calls VFR (visiting friends and relatives) traffic, with the number of purely discretionary 'real' holidaymakers in the minority. In this category, visitors from both Britain and the Republic declined by 7 and 17 per cent respectively last year. Ulster's tourist trade pales into insignificance beside that of competing regions. Its estimated tourism earnings of Pounds 162m last year accounted for just 2 per cent of Ulster's gdp. Scotland's accounted for 9 per cent of regional gdp against an estimated overall figure of 5 per cent for Great Britain. The Republic's tourist industry contributed 7 per cent to the Irish gdp. If its image were not such a depressant, on a pro rata basis Northern Ireland could reasonably expect more than 5m visitors a year. If there is little recovery in the numbers of visitors originating from or passing through the Republic of Ireland this year, the Northern Ireland Office should take some of the blame. In an astonishing display of what some tourist interests call witlessness, the Northern Ireland Office began running a series of chilling commercials on Ulster Television, featuring make-believe terrorist murders (ironically, filmed in Scotland), in the hope of persuading more Ulster people to become police informers by means of the confidential recording telephones. 'Don't suffer it. Change it', ran the punchline. Transmission began just as the NITB launched its most ambitious high-season TV advertising campaign yet: two handsome commercials transmitted throughout the Republic of Ireland and Scotland. But the terrorism commercials - designed purely for Northern Ireland consumption - would have been received and viewed by millions in the larger, more populous part of the Republic. The deterrent effect on intending visitors can only be imagined. It may not have been quite as bad, however, as the effect of this year's appalling summer. 'Trade from the Republic is particularly susceptible to the weather. We have reports of people booking and not showing up, or leaving early because of constant rain,' says Hugh O'Neill. As Mr Geoff Hill, travel editor of the Newsletter, a Northern Ireland morning paper, wrote recently: 'Booking an Ulster summer holiday has always been like looking for a job in the tourist board. 'Wimps' need not apply.'</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Motoring: VW updates little and large AS THE major international motor shows in Frankfurt, London and Tokyo draw near, the steady trickle of new models turns into a flood. The latest are the Volkswagen Passat and Golf cabriolet. Britons will have their first chance to see them at the London show (October 21-31) some weeks after they have made their debut at Frankfurt, which opens to the public on September 11. Neither car will go on sale in the UK until early next year. When the Passat appeared in the mid-1980s, it was bigger and heavier than any previous Volkswagen car. At its launch in Britain, VW made the point amusingly in a television commercial: a Passat fell through a floor that had supported a Golf. Owners, however, have appreciated its solid construction and, in the case of the Variant estate, massive carrying capacity. It is a worthy car; so worthy that I have always felt guilty at finding it rather dull. If the present Golf cabriolet - still one of the darlings of the young and trendy - was a person, they would call it a wrinkly. It is based on the original Golf and has been around since 1979. But it has proved highly successful; Germans alone bought 100,000 last year. The Cabrio was tough and, by open car standards, very safe. The body shook far less than any contemporary's on imperfect roads. A stout roll-over bar protected occupants if it overturned. Its down-side was a minute boot, cramped rear seats and a soft top that, while made beautifully, stood as high from the body when folded as that of a second world war German staff car. The new Cabrio, based on the latest Series III Golf, still has a roll-over protection bar (VW says it would not make an open car without one). Boot and rear passenger space is more generous and the body feels even more rigid than before. The hood sticks up hardly at all when folded and power operation is an extra-cost option. Driving it in Germany this week, I was impressed by the lack of wind noise or buffeting at quite high speeds. The Cabrio comes with 75, 90 and 115 horsepower engines and a five-speed gearbox with a shift matching the highest Japanese standards of delicacy and precision. Britain will have only the 90 and 115 hp versions, which will be available with four-speed automatic transmission, but the two-pedal, 115 hp Cabrio was my favourite. Its probable cost will be close to Pounds 17,500 against a manual 90 bhp version's Pounds 14,500. The Passat for 1994 has had a mid-life face-lift. A proper radiator grille has re-appeared by customer demand. But while styling changes make it look a little curvier, it is still too bland to turn many heads. Enhanced passive safety features include air-bags for driver and front passenger and seat-belts that tighten on impact, both as standard equipment. Two of the most interesting features of the new Passats are the availability of Sycro four-wheel drive (initially, only in a 115 hp Variant estate) and a 90 hp, direct-injection turbo-diesel. This engine, first seen in the Audi 80, cannot equal the near-silence at low speeds of a Citroen Xantia's or Peugeot 306's indirect-injection turbo-diesel, but it is a spirited performer which is quiet over about 30 mph (50 kmh) and promises class-leading fuel economy. The Passats, which have a pleasing, solid feel, can have anything from 75 hp petrol or diesel four-cylinder engines to a 174 hp petrol V6. Right-hand drive models arrive in Britain next January at forecast prices in the Pounds 13,000-Pounds 22,000 band.</p>

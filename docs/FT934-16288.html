			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Mercury wins government phone contract MERCURY Communications, the main domestic competitor to British Telecom, has won the contract to manage the government's long distance telecommunications network. The network, tendered as part of the government's contracting-out programme, is one of the largest private telecoms networks in the UK, serving about 250,000 civil servants in 550 government offices across the country. Mercury won the contract against strong competition from Telstra, the Australian state-owned operator, which recently gained a government licence to operate in the UK. Both BT and Sprint, the US carrier, withdrew at an early stage. The contract, for five years from next April, is for services including telephone, video-conferencing and mobile communications. The government network links offices of central government departments across the country, as well as a range of defence, health, education and security services institutions. The contract, which generated revenue equivalent to Pounds 13.5m last year, is significant for Mercury, a subsidiary of the UK group Cable and Wireless. Its other large contracts include the Trustee Savings Bank, General Electric Company and Sedgwick Group, the insurance brokers. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said: 'Our understanding of government requirements, outsourcing expertise and breadth of communications services will ensure that central government has access to the latest telecommunications solutions, offering value for money.' Mr Graham Markey, Telstra's UK director, said he believed Mercury had won the contract largely on price. 'But we intend to look for other opportunities in the UK, and are keen to build up our offshore business,' he said. Telstra faces strong competition in Australia from Optus, a newly-licensed operator which is also part-owned by Cable and Wireless.</p>

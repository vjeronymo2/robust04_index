			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle took part in the  Radio Villa Opicina contact program last night, answering  questions on relations between Slovenia and Italy and analyzing  the political situation in our country. Here is a short report  by Andrej Pirkovic:    [Begin Pirkovic recording] When asked whether  Slovene-Italian relations could be complicated with the possible  appointment of the new Italian Prime Minister Designate  Berlusconi, Minister Peterle replied that one should first wait  for the official stance of the new government. He is convinced  that it would not be in Italy's interests to strain the mutual  relations.    We shall see it as an act of goodwill, Peterle said, if  relations will develop the way we want them to, which is  something we have been striving for all the time. In his words,  Slovenia will insist on the observation of the legal bases that  have already been laid and here the Osimo agreements are a fact  that cannot be negated. He assessed positively the work of the  negotiating teams for the update of the Osimo agreements.    The fact is that Slovenia and Italy need each other in this  region and that this is the only way in which we can envisage  the realization of the plans for Trieste and the border  provinces.    Regarding Slovenia's integration into the European Union,  Foreign Minister Peterle stated resolutely that we would not  tolerate any possible Italian blackmail.    Asked about the protection of the Slovene minority in Italy,  he replied that our state will continue to take care of the  Slovene minority and demand the observation of the European  standards by Italy.

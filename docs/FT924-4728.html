			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The ball is still in the air: Deals cut at this week's Congress of Deputies will determine the fate of Russia's reforms The Russian Congress of People's Deputies, which begins today, will be a forum concerned with power: who wields it, and for whose benefit. The underpinning of this struggle, however, is the economy: and it is this which gives the battle its present urgency. For this is a society and an economy in transition, and thus the way in which its economy develops will determine, to a much larger extent than in a settled country, who wins and who loses; who gets rich and who gets poor; who is the boss and who the worker. The Congress, with 1,045 deputies, meets in the trough of reform. It meets when the pain is intensifying and little medicine is available. It meets to hear its leading members, most of whom belong to the smaller, permanent parliament, tell the less experienced parliamentarians how best to vote - recommendations which will be based on the deals and agreements which they themselves have cut with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's advisers, or the government. The most important deal is that between the government and the Civic Union, the centrist grouping led by General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, Mr Arkady Volsky, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists, and Mr Nikolai Travkin, the leader of the Democratic party. The Union's economists have agreed a document on 'urgent measures' which represents substantial concessions on the government's part to the industrial lobby. But no more general agreement on the pace of reform or the shape of the government has been concluded and none is likely to be so, at least not explicitly. It will, it seems, be left to those deputies who support the Civic Union to determine for themselves how far the government has moved towards its positions. The president and the government must decide how far they have to change, how many ministers must be replaced with representatives of the industrial lobby in order to get a majority, possibly on a day-by-day basis. 'We have gone part of the way towards the industrialists,' said Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, yesterday. There is something familiar about the current crisis: it is rather like the political crisis at the beginning of this year. Then, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the parliament, was calling on the government to resign, and Mr Yeltsin was standing behind it ('Anyone can have an emotional outburst,' said Mr Yeltsin of Mr Khasbulatov's call). Then, prices had just been liberalised, and people were saying they did not know how they would live: now, prices continue to go up and people say they do not know how they will live. Then, Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister, said that privatisation was 'the basis of the long-term strategic direction of a profound structural reform'. Now, acting prime minister Gaidar says privatisation (only just begun) makes the fury of his conservative industrialist opponents the more furious because they know it will dislodge them from their positions of power over the economy. In fact, though much has not happened that the government would have wished to happen, this has been a tumultuous year in which important shifts are being registered. The longer-term outcome of the political struggle which will find noisy expression in the Kremlin today depends ultimately on quite how big these shifts have been: how far has the economy of Russia changed, how far is a new market-oriented class in place or hoping to find a place? The economy is awful. The monthly inflation rate is between 20 and 30 per cent, the budget deficit is subject to so many different accounts that no single figure can be given - but it is probably more than 15 per cent of gross national product. The rouble, which stood at about 170 to the dollar at the beginning of the year, has seen its value fall to about 500 to the dollar. There is no agreement between Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union on a common rouble zone, and no agreement between the Russian government and the central bank on the granting of credit. Production continues to fall, and is estimated to be about 20 per cent down on last year. This is fuel enough for the anti-government deputies today and for the rest of the Congress session. The government's supporters have thinner gruel from which to make a meal, but they can say this: privatisation has been started and, judging from the increase in the resale price for the Rbs10,000 privatisation cheques which are being issued to all Russian citizens, it seems to be gaining in credibility. Russian bankers talk of investment projects, even though they are strapped of funds. The queues are few and (for Russia) short because there are goods in the shop - as the government noted recently in an internal document, the verb dostat, a peculiarly Russian word which means to get with difficulty, has been replaced with the verb kupit, to buy. Above all, the march to the market has begun: it is sometimes violent, often criminal. But that open markets exist, and that market behaviour is being studied, adapted and adopted, is now beyond question and probably beyond suppression. 'No one talks about non-market reform now,' said Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister, recently. 'That's one of our achievements.' Politics, too, have changed. Mr Yeltsin's popularity appears, on anecdotal evidence (there have, mysteriously, been few polls recently) to have fallen. He remains dominant but probably no longer unchallengeable: perhaps knowing that, he is working to increase the scope and depth of his authority. His security council, a committee of senior officials run by the tough Mr Yuri Skokov, gradually increases its powers over more and more functions of the government, from defence to the economy. He has been pressed, most of all by the governors he appointed to be his representatives in the various regions, to introduce presidential rule to bypass parliament: he has so far refused to do so. At the weekend, he proposed to a gathering of his followers that a party should be formed to support reforms: he would be 'with this party and in this party'. Mr Gennady Burbulis, his perpetual aide, was given the task of organising it. As Mr Burbulis conceives it, it seems to be a party of 'the most professional people in every sphere of life'. This, in essence, is what the Communist party was - the party of the bosses. No wonder the daily newspaper Izvestia ran a headline yesterday, saying: 'Burbulis to become GenSec?' (the familiar shortening of general-secretary, once the supreme Soviet post). Mr Yeltsin's acting prime minister, now said to be enjoying his arduous job, remains protected. In talks between Mr Gaidar's representatives and those of the Civic Union, the government side has made several concessions, such as extending support to large industrial enterprises. But Mr Yeltsin and his advisers are adamant that they will not surrender the basic philosophy of reform: they will keep their eye steadily on the goal of an open, liberal, largely privately owned economy. Any account of the past year must reckon that Russia itself has largely been peaceful. It is important to say so, since a year ago the Russian and western media were full of forecasts of civil strife and worse. There have been many alarms - in relations with Ukraine over the ownership of Crimea and the Black Sea fleet; in relations with Moldova over the continued presence of the Russian 14th army on the left bank of the River Dnestr; in relations with the Baltic states over the pull-out of troops. There are wars in the Caucasus (including in the Russian Caucasus) and in Tadjikistan in which Russian troops are engaged. But these conflicts have either been damped down or are controlled: what has not happened is a Russian army trampling on the rights of other countries. Like the British, the French and other imperial forces, Russia is taking a while to leave the former colonies: so far, it is doing it, and doing it in peace. Normal economic relations are beginning to be formed between the former Soviet states though Russia has no firm agreements with them on the use of the rouble, on banking or on inter-enterprise payments. It now seems that, wearied after a year of fruitless negotiations on these issues, the Russians are putting up the shutters: from January 1, Mr Gaidar said last week, the Russian rouble will become essentially Russian only; customs posts are already up all round the border; and payment in advance is demanded for supplies of oil. Mr Nazar Suyunov, the deputy prime minister of Turkmenistan, complained last week that 'Russia is pushing the CIS apart . . . there is not, or there soon will not be, one economic space'. Most Russians would regard this as a good thing. Beyond the former Soviet borders, the world now trusts Russia less than it did. A sharper note creeps in to the discussions and the intensifying contacts with world financial institutions. The Dollars 70bn to Dollars 80bn foreign debt is barely being paid back: contracts are constantly being changed: political instability remains high. In spite of the best efforts of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, hired to assist the Russian government to find investors, no one but the energy companies are excited about the place. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, one of the government's first foreign advisers, has upbraided western governments and institutions for their lack of vision in seeing Russia and other republics as essential cases for aid if breakdown and security risks and refugees and conflict are to be avoided. The IMF and the World Bank respond that they have done and are doing a great deal: that most of the Dollars 12bn government-to-government credits which made up half of the Dollars 24bn IMF package agreed by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in the summer has been sent; that the IMF itself has put in Dollars 1bn; and that the bulk of the rest, the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund, cannot be given because the rouble is too weak and inflation-prone to be stabilised. Yet for the average Russian, and the average Russian deputy, the Sachs point is the more persuasive (if for different reasons): they think the westernisers in the government have been let down by their beloved west. All they got was to be told to have a nice day. Until Russian politics produces parties and representatives who speak for real interests in society the political scene will remain dominated by personalities and in-fighting. This is not yet a civil society: representative government is weak and the concept of government-in-waiting is barely known. How will the Congress 'go'? With fury; with passion; with anger: but probably without too much effect.</p>

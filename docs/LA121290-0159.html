			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE GAMES  </P> <P> Tony Meola, whose goalkeeping helped the United States advance to soccer's  World Cup finals earlier this year, is moving from England to France.  </P> <P> The U.S. Soccer Federation requested that Meola be released when his work  permit in England expired at the end of November. He had joined Watford after  the World Cup but did not get the playing time he had hoped for. Meola has  begun working out with Toulouse F.C., and a USSF official said the federation  "expects to announce that Tony will be with another professional club."  </P></p>

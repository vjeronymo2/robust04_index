			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Autolatina blames state and strikes for 75% fall AUTOLATINA, the Brazilian holding group for the Volkswagen and Ford marques, blamed state measures and a crippling strike for an inflation-adjusted 75 per cent fall in net profits for last year. Net profits dipped to 11.6bn cruzeiros (Dollars 45m) which represents just 3.5 per cent of sales. In 1989, the group's return on sales was 15 per cent. The numbers reflect the operations of Volkswagen for the first 11 months of the year and include the December profits of Ford, following the group's merger. According to the company, production capacity was down to 60 per cent with the group operating for little more than 10 months of the year. The company halted production for a month after the the government's anti-inflation measures were put into effect last year. Subsequently strikes, both at Autolatina itself and among suppliers of parts, further interrupted production. As well as sending profits into steep decline, the difficult economic situation has pushed Autolatina heavily into debt. At the end of 1990, the group's ratio of liabilities to net worth ratio had risen to 78 per cent. However, despite its financial troubles, the group plans to push ahead with substantial capital spending. This year alone, Autolatina will invest Dollars 550m.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Pay deal for NHS blue-collar staff NATIONAL Health Service blue-collar workers have accepted an offer worth 4.9 per cent on the pay bill. The 180,000 workers, who include domestics, porters and catering and laundry staff, will have their increase backdated to April 1. The lowest-paid will receive increases of up to 6.7 per cent. The settlement is consistent with a recent pay increase for white-collar NHS workers but below the average of 6.5 per cent awarded to doctors and nurses after pay-review recommendations earlier this year.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Egyptians protest at Israeli air strikes EGYPT yesterday called on the US, Russia and the United Nations to press Israel to end the air strikes on guerrilla targets in south Lebanon which continued yesterday and which have sharply raised tensions in the region over the past week. In an unusually strong statement, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry condemned what it called Israel's 'flagrant aggression' against Lebanon and called on it to 'desist immediately'. It said the UN and the two sponsors of the Middle East peace negotiations - the US and Russia - should intervene with Israel to prevent any damage to the peace process. Shortly after the Egyptian statement Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, expressed concern that the escalation of violence could jeopardise Middle East peace efforts. He deplored the loss of innocent life and urged restraint. Egypt, the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel, is worried that the violence in south Lebanon could escalate out of control. Fears have been expressed of a clash between Syria and Israel, although Israeli leaders yesterday signalled that they did not expect such an outcome. Israel launched repeated rocket strikes yesterday morning on positions held by Hizbollah, the Iranian-backed Moslem fundamentalist militia fighting Israel's occupation of a 'security zone' inside Lebanon. Four guerrillas and one civilian were wounded. It was the third wave of air attacks carried out by Israeli forces since a Hizbollah force last week overran a post held by the South Lebanon Army, Israel's surrogate militia, which polices the zone. In one attack on a Hizbollah leader's house, his wife and two small daughters were killed. The attacks included strikes on positions in areas under Syrian control. Syria was reported to have boosted its troop concentrations in Lebanon after the attacks and its foreign minister, Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, said Syria would have 'no option but to fight' if Israel 'imposed war'.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTORS SWALLOWING UP SHARES OF BRITAIN'S PRIVATIZED WATER INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Like nomads at a desert oasis, investors here and abroad are gulping shares of  Britain's newly privatized water industry, lifting prices to unexpected highs  but raising fears of foreign control over a necessity of life.  </P> <P> The government sold 10 water utilities in England and Wales for $8.4 billion  earlier this month. It was the latest in a series of privatizations and  surprisingly successful in an otherwise sluggish stock market.  </P> <P> The government offered 2.183 million shares at the equivalent of $3.84 each.  The shares, which began trading Dec. 12, quickly rose in price and by Friday  were up about 50% on the London Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> "They have done fairly well," said Stephen Doe, a water industry analyst at the  London investment firm Smith New Court PLC.  </P> <P> British investors weren't the only ones to perceive the water industry as an  opportunity. Foreigners, including a French water company, also were aggressive  buyers of the stock.  </P> <P> Within less than a week of the trading launch, the French group Lyonnaise des  Eaux announced it acquired stakes in three water companies -- 9% in Anglian  Water, 6% in Wessex Water and 2% of Severn Trent.  </P> <P> France's two other big water companies, Generale des Eaux and Societe  d'Amenagement Urbain et Rural, are also expected to be big buyers of the  British shares.  </P> <P> There's no immediate takeover threat to the big water utilities because the  government retained "golden shares" limiting holdings in them to 15% for five  years.  </P> <P> However, Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley recently has expressed reservations  about this limitation, suggesting it might be lifted.  </P> <P> The French water companies are keen to invest because they believe the British  water companies are undervalued and offer good prospects for earnings growth,  analysts said.  </P> <P> The French companies have the expertise and technology to capitalize on the  opportunities, which aren't available in other European countries where the  water industries are mostly state-controlled.  </P> <P> But some Britons oppose foreign control of their sources of water, particularly  if the owners are French, a historic British rival.  </P> <P> The resentment has been suggested in Britain's financial press, which has  quoted critics of the water privatization as portraying the French water  companies as raiding opportunists.  </P> <P> But the Times of London wrote in an editorial: "While the government might have  preferred to see British rather than French predators, it can hardly object  when it is committed to a level playing field in the takeover game in Europe.  We are all good Europeans now."  </P> <P> The water shares are popular with other investors for other reasons. They are  considered recession-proof because water is a vital commodity. Built-in price  increases in the form of rate hikes virtually guarantee good profits for at  least the next few years.  </P> <P> Nigel Hawkins, water industry analyst for Security Pacific-Hoare Govett Ltd.,  said the water shares' average yield is attractive at 7%, a 50% premium on the  average market yield.  </P> <P> The shares have been boosted by speculation about the French companies' buying  intentions.  </P> <P> There had been concerns that the water sale would fail because it followed the  sharp drop in world stock markets a few months ago. But demand for the shares  greatly exceeded the supply.  </P> <P> "We have proved our critics wrong," Environment Minister Michael Howard said.  </P> <P> The water sale is the first privatization since the government's divestment of  its one-third stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC, which was a failure because  it coincided with the October, 1987, stock market crash. Many brokers suffered  severe losses from the BP fiasco.  </P> <P> The water privatization also faced stiff opposition from critics who believed  such a vital utility should remain in state hands for reasons of security and  water quality.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's critics said she was becoming too extreme  during her third term, taking a privatization program too far. But she is  proceeding.  </P> <P> The government also plans to sell the country's electricity industry by  mid-1992. That sale could raise more than $32 billion, dwarfing the other  privatizations.  </P> <P> Thatcher's Conservative government has sold $53 billion worth of state-owned  companies in the past decade as part of a broader economic policy of  encouraging private enterprise and investment by British citizens.  </P></p>

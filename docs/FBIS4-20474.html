These highlighted fields will see increased government  funding after technological sectors as well as more scientific  aid from the State.    Government officials yesterday called the fields vital to  China's economy in the remaining years of this decade and into  the 21st century.    They cover the following fields and technologies:     -  Agriculture: improving crop quality and two technologies  of breeding crops and tackling problems in low-yielding crops.        -  Energy and Environment: nuclear, oil extraction and coal  industries.        -  Transportation: high-speed railway system, high-grade  roadways and inland water transport.        -  Raw Materials and Resources: iron-smelting, refined  chemical products and engineering plastics.        -  Information and Communication: integrated circuits,  computers, software, electronics, automation and fiber-optics  communication.        -  Manufacturing: digital-control, laser and the  manufacturing of equipment used in large-scale thermal power.        -  Biotechnology has also been selected as a key technology  in the 1990s.       These were jointly selected by the State Planning  Commission,  the State Science and Technology Commission and the State  Economic and Trade Commission.    Officials from the State Planning Commission said that China  will concentrate on tackling technological problems which are  linked closely with the country's economic development.    The technological applications expect to promote industrial  adjustments, intensify economic strength and improve  international competition.    These key technologies have been included in State-level  scientific development projects, including the State Science  Research Project, the High-tech Development Project and the  State Industrial Experiment Project.    Local government as well as enterprises, colleges and  research institutes have also been urged to supporting the  application of these technologies.</p>

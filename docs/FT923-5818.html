			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz lifts German stock market DAIMLER-BENZ yesterday gave the German stock market a much-needed fillip by reporting a 16 per cent rise in net profits for the first half to DM1.02bn (Dollars 640m), reflecting lower taxes and the first-time inclusion of earnings from Airbus. However, Germany's biggest industrial concern was muted about prospects in the second half, referring to a 'subsiding boom' in Germany and uncertainties about export markets. The company's shares, buoyed by the higher earnings, closed DM20 higher at DM610.80. Pre-tax operating profits were 3.25 per cent lower at DM2.02bn. The group said that while export business and sales of the more expensive Mercedes-Benz cars increased, car demand in Germany weakened. It plans to reduce car output to 543,000 cars from 578,000 in 1991. In the first half, production was 284,500 against 297,000 cars. Group earnings benefited from the rise in financial profits to DM518m from DM318m partly reflecting the first-time inclusion of Daimler's 80 per cent share in Deutsche Airbus. Lower taxes, with Daimler now able to offset some divisional losses against tax, also helped the net result. Daimler-Benz said group net income in the whole of 1992 should reach last year's level, and repeated its forecast that turnover should exceed DM100bn. In 1991, after the group had also forecast same-again earnings at the halfway stage, earnings were 8 per cent higher at DM1.9bn, with turnover up by 11 per cent to DM95bn. It raised its dividend for the first time since 1986 by DM1 a share to DM13. Daimler, whose activities also include aerospace, electrical and electronics products and systems, and financial services, said turnover in the first half increased by 9 per cent to DM46.3bn. Sales to the rest of the EC rose by 5 per cent to DM90bn, with a 20 per cent jump in US business to DM6.6bn. The Mercedes car and truck operations accounted for 74 per cent of turnover, with a 9 per cent improvement to DM34.9bn. Because Mercedes' new luxury S-class model was available for the whole period, car revenues advanced by 11 per cent to DM21.2bn. Unit sales were slightly down at 288,000 cars. In Germany, car registrations of 138,400 were also down marginally on last year's high level. Markets where unit sales showed marked gains were the UK, Belgium, and Spain. In the US, volume was 23 per cent higher. On the truck side, turnover was 7 per cent higher at DM13.7bn, with output 4 per cent higher at 150,500 units. New registrations rose by 7 per cent. In North America, the Freightliner truck operation raised unit sales by 35 per cent. With a market share of 23 per cent, it became for the first time the leading manufacturer in the US heavy duty truck market. World stock markets, Page 29</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vittorio Testa: "Institutional Government: </F> Berlusconi Now Says `Yes'"]    [Text] Rome -- Mr. Berlusconi [Forza Italia leader], have  you heard what [Northern League leader] Bossi is saying?  Berlusconi grew angry yesterday morning when he arrived from  Arcore at his Rome house on via dell`Anima and heard people  repeating Bossi's contemptuous litany of the previous day.  Bossi is saying that from now on he will call you "Berluscone"  or "Berluscaz"; that if there is an institutional government,  you will disappear; that he allied with you because, as  Machiavelli taught, if you cannot defeat an enemy directly it is  better to ally with him, "to embrace him in order to hit him  later"; that when he talked to you about antimonopoly measures  you replied evasively that the matter will be examined by  committees.... "Oh, yes? I have never talked to Bossi about  antimonopoly measures or committees. But that is enough, I do  not feel like discussing Bossi," Berlusconi said, waving his  hand like someone trying to swat a fly.    In the evening the news agencies reported other, even more  sensational, political broadsides: "Berlusconi's opinion polls  are false," Bossi shouted, going on to attack "the RAI-Fininvest  duopoly," and accuse Berlusconi of having attacked Confindustria  [General Confederation of Italian Industry] "in order to confuse  matters within the pole [for freedoms]. But he cannot be the  representative of economic liberalism, of small and medium-sized  enterprise." And still it was not over: Bossi's big guns fired  again: "Within Forza Italia there is something of the recycled  Five-Party coalition; behind it there is [former Socialist Party  Secretary] Craxi, `fatso.'" Bossi urged League supporters to  plan their defenses: "Raise your guard! Because after the  Bribe City farce, those people will return. They say that we  use strong language: Yes, and we do so because we are working  class people. We must not speak with affected voices, wearing  toupees, in fluting tones, and surrounded by pink clouds. No!  Beware, people, they are deceiving you because they are trying  to return in disguise."    It was an evening for Berlusconi to vent his anger. Now all  that is lacking is for Bossi to urge League members to vote for  the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] rather than for Forza  Italia. But Berlusconi let it be known that he had taken his  telephone of the hook -- no comment, nothing to add to what he  said in the morning, namely, the following regretful  consideration: "I console myself by thinking about [PDS Deputy  Secretary] D'Alema. I see that he is saying that if I lose the  elections I will have to pack my bags and go abroad. That is  progress, in view of the fact that hitherto he has been saying  that he wants to see me in the street begging for charity. He  must have been magnanimous enough to grant me a passport."    But apart from a few reluctant comments and some  compassionate head shaking, Berlusconi, who took part in "Nuccio  Fava's Election Platform" on television channel one last night,  explained his political strategy. His strategy is based on the  belief that Forza Italia will emerge from the elections as  "Italy's prime political force." "So it will be impossible to  form any government without Forza Italia," Berlusconi said,  issuing the following warning to Bossi: "League candidates  elected partly thanks to Forza Italia's votes would never accept  the idea of a government alliance that excluded us. Because  that would violate their honest relationship with their own  voters."    So would Forza Italia join an institutional government if  there were not a sufficient majority for a "full" government?  Hitherto Berlusconi has refused even to consider the  possibility. Now, under attack from Bossi, that is, his main  ally, and therefore under attack from everyone plus one, he  started by saying that he considers an institutional government  "what the country needs least at present, in view of the very  serious issues that it has to tackle vigorously, starting with a  new boost to the economy and the struggle against unemployment."  But then he decided to take the big step: "Yes, an  institutional government comprising all the political forces. A  transitional government to enable parliament quickly to draw up  new electoral rules -- a single-candidate system in one round  and, we say, also the direct election of the president -- and to  hold another election as soon as possible, very soon."    So Berlusconi is willing to support an institutional  government. But he is nevertheless convinced that he will emerge  from the electoral contest as the absolute winner. Although in  the past few days he has realized that the "uninominal" contest  in his own constituency, against Spaventa and Michelini, is full  of dangers. "The voters will decide which force and which prime  minister must have the leading role in the government,"  Berlusconi said confidently. He repeated this on RAI's  "Election Platform", which set three National Alliance  representatives (Maceratini, Ramponi, and Fisichella) against  three of the Forza Italia pole (Berlusconi, Maroni, and  Taradash). It was basically a debate between "separate" allies,  since Berlusconi is linked to [National Alliance coordinator]  Fini in the center and south and to the League in the north.  Though Maroni repeated that the League rejects any possibility  of an agreement with Fini, Berlusconi said that he is  "optimistic" and put himself forward as the guardian of a huge  single party in the near future. Yesterday evening's debate was  not a very lively one, Berlusconi having again refused one with  the representatives of the progressive forces.</p>

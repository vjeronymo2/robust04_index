			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> ABC has agreed to buy rights for the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana for $9  million, but the deal needs U.S. government approval because of a trade  embargo.  </P> <P> ABC, which in the last year failed to gain rights to the 1992 Winter and Summer  Olympics and lost its share of the rights to major league baseball, bid about  three times as much as CBS paid for rights to the 1987 Pan Am Games in  Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Barry Frank, a senior group vice president with Trans World International,  confirmed that ABC had reached the agreement with his company, which represents  the Cuban organizing committee.  </P> <P> Frank said that TWI had discussions with all three networks during March and  reached the agreement with ABC about six weeks ago. He said the application for  U.S. government approval was made about three weeks ago and that TWI's lawyers  told him they expected a decision would be made shortly.  </P></p>

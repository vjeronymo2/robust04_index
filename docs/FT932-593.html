			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Hard to justify PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's weekend raid on Baghdad was a classic exercise in the art of soliciting domestic support by running up the flag and demanding that everyone salute it. It is hard to justify in terms of international law, or any conception of a new world order. But it can most readily be explained by reference to what is expedient in US politics. In that sense it may be effective. The initial reaction in the US suggests that the expenditure of 23 Cruise missiles, and an unknown number of Iraqi lives, on Sunday morning's missile attack may increase popular support for a president whose first few months in office have been marred by dither in the White House, and whose authority over a Congress nominally controlled by his own Democratic party has been shown to be tenuous. Americans traditionally respect decisiveness in their chief executive. They are conscious of the standing of their nation as the world's sole remaining superpower. They may be expected to rally round on an occasion like this, as they did when President Ronald Reagan sent F-111s to bomb Colonel Gadaffi's home in Libya. Many of them are naturally irritated by the fact that, in spite of the victory of the US-led coalition in the Gulf war, President Saddam Hussein has survived for longer than most of them expected when the ceasefire document was signed. That being the general sentiment, evidence that there was a terrorist plot to kill former president Bush during his visit to Kuwait in April will be regarded by US politicians of all parties as ample justification for the action taken by Mr Clinton. Provocation The US argument, put to the Security Council yesterday, is that this kind of provocation could not be allowed to go unanswered. Washington has a point here, albeit a harsh one. The raids on Libya were followed by a reduction in terrorism emanating from that quarter; perhaps, it is reasoned, the Iraqis will be similarly cowed - a view apparently shared by the British and other governments. Yet it is highly questionable whether the missile raid can be justified in law. President Clinton is relying on Article 51 of the UN charter, which preserves the inherent right of any state to act in its own self-defence. But can this be used to justify a punitive attack on a city centre in response to accusations of an assassination plot as yet unproven in any court? Principles More to the point, there is no moral justification for the raid. On the facts as presented by the US, the president should have waited for the completion of the trial of 11 Iraqis on terrorism charges in Kuwait before contemplating action against their headquarters in Baghdad. Any punitive action should be sanctioned in advance by the Security Council. If it is to involve risk to the lives of civilians, a question must be asked about what principles the administration applies in deciding who and where to attack. The question is painfully obvious. Why will the US bomb Moslems in Iraq and Somalia, but take no action against Serbs who are slaughtering Moslems in Bosnia? One answer is that it is only in the latter case that US troops would have to be deployed; another, already put forward yesterday, that lives in the third world are regarded as expendable. However unjustified, such suspicions will ensure that the US relationship with the Islamic nations, scarred by many historic wounds, will once again suffer as a result of the weekend action. There should also be, to say the least, a sense of discomfort in Europe, which is witnessing the carve-up of former Yugoslavia by the Croats and Serbs at a time when disagreements among the members of Nato over the use of force against the Bosnian Serbs have prevented the US from taking a leading part in bringing the Balkan conflict to a conclusion. As Mr Bush showed in the Gulf, a president experienced in international affairs, and therefore able to bring both his Nato allies and the UN (plus several Middle Eastern states) into a grand coalition, could offer at least the hope that the US might help to create a new world order. Mr Clinton has failed to create an alliance over Bosnia, and has not yet made a convincing case under international law for his actions in Iraq.</p>

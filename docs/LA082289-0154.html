			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT, ARAFAT SAYS;  </P> <P> WARNS THAT PLO MAY REEVALUATE MODERATE POLICY  </P> <P> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today challenged President Bush's commitment  to human rights and said the PLO might rethink its peace drive if the United  States and Israel fail to respond to it.  </P> <P> He said he might convene the Palestinian parliament-in-exile to consider the  results of its decision in November to pursue a moderate policy based on a  Palestinian state coexisting with Israel.  </P> <P> Arafat said Israel had intensified what he called oppression against the  Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slain Palestinians  </P> <P> He named six Palestinians he said had been killed by the Israelis in the  occupied territories in fewer than 24 hours. Eighteen had been killed since  Saturday, he said.  </P> <P> Arafat waved a magnetic identity card, introduced by Israel on Friday, that  must be carried by more than 60,000 Gaza Palestinians who work in Israel.  </P> <P> "These six new martyrs are an example of Israel's iron fist policies. The  magnetic cards are another example of Israeli discrimination against  Palestinians," he said several times.  </P> <P> "I would like to ask Bush, who keeps defending human rights, what he thinks of  these cards and of the killings," Arafat said.  </P> <P> "Where is the American position on human rights? Or does that . . . stop when  it comes to talking about rights of the Palestinians?"  </P> <P> Arafat said the PLO raised Israel's measures against Palestinians at every  meeting it had with the Americans. "The only reply we get from them is to focus  on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's (election) plan," he said.  </P> <P> "Patience has limits," Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation  Organization, told a news conference. "At the end I am obliged to call for our  PNC (Palestine National Council) . . . and they will decide what policy they  are going to take."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Civil Disobedience  </P> <P> He said the PLO might call for full-scale civil disobedience to step up the  20-month-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and was considering  other tactics that he declined to discuss.  </P> <P> "I am not going to deceive my people. They have the right to know the facts. .  . . They have to understand the Israeli policy, Israeli crimes and the  conspiracy they (Palestinians) are facing," Arafat said.  </P> <P> The PNC approved a peace strategy in November calling for an independent  Palestinian state to coexist with Israel in its pre-1967 borders.  </P> <P> In December Arafat met U.S. conditions for a dialogue with the PLO when he  renounced terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist.  </P> <P> The PLO has complained that the talks with Washington have moved too slowly and  have not addressed PLO ideas on peace.  </P></p>

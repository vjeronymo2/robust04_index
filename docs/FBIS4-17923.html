			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 26 April TASS -- President Yuriy Meshkov of  the Republic of the Crimea, Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of  the Black Sea Fleet, and Viktor Semyonov, chairman of the  Sevastopol City Council of People's Deputies have issued a joint  statement urging the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to resume  the interrupted Russo-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet and  "to act as the guarantors of peace in the Republic of the  Crimea," a spokesman at the fleet press centre told ITAR-TASS by  telephone.    The authors of the statement expressed utter regret and  concern over the frustration of the Russo-Ukrainian talks on  dividing the fleet. They believe that the "struggle for  political power and the presidency of Ukraine becomes a factor  which can turn the process of negotiations on the problems of  the Black Sea Fleet into a military conflict."    Attempts are being made to lay the blame for a possible  break-up of Ukraine's statehood on the Republic of the Crimea  and severely punish it for that. It is no problem by means of  provocations to bring about an unstable situation in the  republic and, making use of that, introduce a state-of-emergency  regime, putting Russia-Ukraine relations on the brink of war,  the authors of the statement maintain.</p>

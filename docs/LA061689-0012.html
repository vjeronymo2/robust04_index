			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: WHILE DOGS CHASE THE FRISBEES, TURTLES WILL BE CONTENT TO TAKE  THINGS SLOWLY  </P> <P> Torrance will host the quick and the quiet of the animal kingdom this weekend.  </P> <P> On Saturday, leaping Labs, gyrating shepherds and other agile canines will  catch Frisbees for fun and prizes starting at 10 a.m. at Torrance Park, 2001  Santa Fe Ave.  </P> <P> "We want people to bring their dogs out and throw a few Frisbees around for the  dogs to catch," said John Jones, a city recreation supervisor. "People like to  watch it because it's a great spectator sport."  </P> <P> On Sunday, tortoise and turtle fanciers will take over the Torrance Recreation  Center, 3341 W. Torrance Blvd., at 10 a.m. to show off the attractions of  keeping the slow and quiet critters as pets.  </P> <P> "They're clean and low-maintenance," said Betty Chambers, who has kept  tortoises in her back yard for 15 years since the first one wandered in. "They  don't have fleas, they don't bark, and you don't have to walk them."  </P> <P> The Torrance Parks and Recreation Department has staged the free dog  Frisbee-catching contest for 10 years as part of the nationwide Ashley Whippet  Invitational competition.  </P> <P> It's named for a celebrity dog who could leap 9 feet in the air, run 35 miles  an hour and catch Frisbees at sports and charity events. Ashley -- who even  played the White House during the Carter Administration -- died in 1985.  </P> <P> Jones said 25 to 30 dogs usually turn out in Torrance, competing for T-shirts  and Frisbees. Dog owners may register at 9:30 a.m. before the contest, which  lasts until 1 p.m.  </P> <P> One event is judged on the basis of how many plastic discs a dog can catch in  90 seconds, while the other is judged on style.  </P> <P> "That's where things get real fancy," Jones said. "A lot of times, the owners  will do throws from behind their back and the dogs will turn in midair to make  a catch. The best catch is when the dog is completely off the ground."  </P> <P> He said up to 150 people turn out to cheer on their favorite dogs and snap  pictures.  </P> <P> Things will be a little more down to Earth the next day when the turtle and  tortoise show focuses on these reptiles who love to burrow -- and aren't seen  for weeks while they hibernate.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who come to our show are already interested, but some are  walk-ins who discover a new hobby," said Cathy Berrett, president of the  Westchester Chapter of the California Turtle and Tortoise Club. It is  sponsoring the event that lasts until 4 p.m. Donations of $2 for adults and  $1.50 for senior citizens are asked.  </P> <P> Turtles from around the world will be shown, including one from Africa that is  spotted like a leopard, a rare land tortoise whose shell pattern suggests a  star, and a matamata from India. "It looks like a leaf, which is perfect  camouflage for a damp, foggy area," Berrett said.  </P> <P> Incubators containing turtle eggs will be on display, along with hatchlings. At  the other end of the spectrum will be mature turtles over the age of 50.  </P> <P> Although the terms turtle and tortoise are interchangeable, tortoise is more  commonly used for the land animal, while turtle is associated with the reptile  who swims in the ocean or freshwater.  </P> <P> Experts will be on hand to provide information about housing and feeding  turtles and tortoises and coping with their ailments, which can run from  viruses to malaria. A turtle boutique will sell such things as turtle hats and  hand puppets, mugs and magnets with turtle decorations and T-shirts.  </P> <P> People who want to begin a collection will have it easy on Sunday. Turtle  fanciers often have surplus animals and the club has an adoption service for  those needing homes. "It's a very inexpensive hobby," Berrett said.  </P> <P> Turtle collectors concede that some of their friends think it's strange to make  a pet out of a turtle. After all, turtles can't even begin to catch Frisbees.  But their owners say they enjoy their animals, which crane their necks out of a  great sense of curiosity, sometimes follow them around in their yards and have  a peacefulness that smoothes out the worst days.  </P> <P> "They're a calming thing for me," said Diane Brouhard, who has 20 turtles.  "When I'm stressed from the day, I hang out with the turtles and watch."  </P> <P> Berrett said turtles have a way of living that their owners get to know.  </P> <P> "They mate quite freely and you can watch them dig and burrow," she said. "They  all learn to know you and know when it's time to eat."  </P> <P> One of her desert tortoises is a crusty old fellow with a cracked shell. Old  Timer, as he's called, is about 90, Berrett said.  </P> <P> "I love his majesty," she said. "I look at him and know that he was on Earth  before the automobile was (common). I think of how life has changed. It makes  you feel humble."  </P></p>

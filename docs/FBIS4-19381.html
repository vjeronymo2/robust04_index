			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Mentese] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that  everyone has the right to organize meetings and demonstrations  in line with the freedom of expression and of thought, adding  that, however, this should be done within the framework of the  law.    Mentese issued a statement in connection with demonstrations  held in certain cities in recent days disrupting public order.  He said that marches and rallies might be curbed with the aim  of securing public order and preventing the disruption of city  security. Pointing out that the way in which rallies and  demonstration can be held are stipulated by the Constitution and  the law, Mentese said: Everyone should be aware that the rights  and freedoms granted to individuals and democratic organizations  through the law, can be curtailed or banned -- without damaging  the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms -- in the  event laws are trespassed or crimes committed while these rights  and freedoms are being exercised.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RACE IN 76TH HAS BEEN FAR FROM ORDINARY  </P> <P> Under normal circumstances, her victory in August's special primary in the  heavily Republican 76th Assembly District would have left GOP candidate Tricia  Hunter with little to be concerned about as next week's runoff approaches --  except, perhaps, finding an apartment in Sacramento.  </P> <P> The consensus in political circles is that Hunter -- whose pro-choice stance on  abortion drew national attention to the race after last summer's U. S. Supreme  Court ruling on the volatile issue -- will, indeed, need to turn her attention  to such domestic matters after Tuesday's runoff against Democrat Jeannine  Correia and two write-in candidates.  </P> <P> However, the fact that there is any doubt about the outcome of the election in  the conservative San Diego-Riverside County district reflects the peculiar  nature of a race that has been anything but routine since its inception.  </P> <P> Though Hunter is widely viewed as a prohibitive favorite to win the seat  vacated by the June death of Assemblyman Bill Bradley (R-Escondido), many  Republicans are discomforted by the write-in candidacy of Dick Lyles, a  longtime GOP activist who finished a close second behind Hunter in the  eight-candidate primary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Divisive Thing'  </P> <P> In particular, Republican leaders lament that Lyles' write-in bid -- and its  potential for splintering the GOP vote -- gives at least a glint of hope to  Democrat Correia, whose chances normally would be negligible. The other  write-in candidate, Lakeside accountant Kirby Bowser, also is a Republican, but  he is a political unknown expected to have little impact on the outcome.  </P> <P> "This is a very divisive thing for the party," said San Diego County Republican  Chairman Bettie Kujawa. "The 76th is so strongly Republican that I don't think  we have to seriously worry about keeping the seat. But what Lyles has done is  create a little doubt where there should be none. I can't help but feeling that  Dick's just a sore loser."  </P> <P> The infighting within the Republican ranks escalated last Thursday when Hunter  accused the National Rifle Assn. and the National Right to Life Committee of  spending $163,000 between them in a series of last-minute "political hit  pieces" that were scheduled to blanket the district on Lyles' behalf this  weekend.  </P> <P> Source of Hunter's consternation was a purported schedule of 11 mailings,  listed under the letterhead of the National Right to Life Committee. Spokesmen  for the two organizations said they planned no such last-minute mailings, and  the right-to-life group said the schedule was a fraudulent use of its  letterhead.  </P> <P> For his part, Lyles said he welcomed that level of support, but knew nothing of  it and doubted it would materialize. If it did, Lyles said laughingly, it would  be nothing short of a miracle in what had otherwise been a "grass-roots  campaign."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Still Very Confident'  </P> <P> Like Kujawa, Hunter attributes Lyles' write-in candidacy to electoral sour  grapes and his refusal to accept defeat in a race that he began as the clear  front-runner after having spent nearly four years preparing for it.  </P> <P> "I'm still very confident, but by putting himself above the voters, Mr. Lyles  is hurting the district and his own party," said Hunter, a 37-year-old Bonita  nurse. "It's a small problem as far as I'm concerned. But it's a situation that  shouldn't even exist. He claims to be a loyal Republican activist. But loyal  Republicans don't do what he's doing."  </P> <P> Refusing to be put on the defensive by Hunter's characterization of his  candidacy, Lyles argues that he decided to continue his race beyond his primary  loss in part because Hunter is "less the nominee of the Republican Party than  she is the favorite" of pro-choice activists, many of them Democrats.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's any doubt I got more Republican votes than she did,"  said Lyles, a 42-year-old management consultant from Poway. "When you figure in  the other Republicans in the primary, you see that Hunter actually received a  rather small minority of the (GOP) vote."  </P> <P> The district's demographics, combined with several other factors -- notably,  the primary's unusual format and the abortion issue's skewing of typical  political alliances -- support that interpretation of Hunter's narrow 197-vote  victory over Lyles, 14,885 votes to 14,688.  </P> <P> Though the district has a 55%-32% Republican registration edge, the primary  vote was divided among six Republicans and two Democrats, as well as two other  GOP candidates who withdrew but whose names remained on the ballot. Moreover,  with Hunter's pro-choice stance attracting traditional Democratic support, she  was able to draw crossover votes because of unorthodox procedures governing  special elections, in which all candidates of all parties appear on a single  ballot.  </P> <P> Hunter, however, has little patience with such analyses, saying simply, "All  that matters is that I ran in the primary. I got the most votes. I won. Period.  It's time to move on."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modest Local Coverage  </P> <P> Emboldened by the Hunter-Lyles split, Correia optimistically argues that  Democrats have reason to regard her campaign as more than just the "usual lost  cause." Conceding that Lyles' write-in bid is a boon to her own candidacy,  Correia added: "I guess this is one time I'm rooting for a Republican -- up to  a point!"  </P> <P> During the frenetic primary, the 76th District contest drew extensive national  news coverage as one of the first tests of the political fallout from the  Supreme Court's July ruling giving states new powers to regulate abortions.  </P> <P> In contrast, the runoff has been rather somnolent, generating only modest local  coverage as Lyles' longshot write-in candidacy -- combined with Hunter's and  Correia's pro-choice agreement -- downplayed the philosophical split on  abortion that made the primary so compelling.  </P> <P> As a result, there have been few forums or other public events in the two  months since the primary, a fact that has done nothing to enhance voter  interest in an election expected to draw a turnout even lower than the  primary's dismal 20% figure.  </P> <P> Perhaps the person least bothered by the race's diminished public profile is  Hunter, who contributed to that shift by refusing to participate in any forum  to which Lyles was invited. Faced with Hunter's intransigence, a number of  community groups scrapped plans for debates, with one notable exception being a  KPBS-TV forum whose producers proceeded with the three other candidates.  </P> <P> "Dick Lyles doesn't deserve to be up there with the Republican and Democratic  nominees," Hunter said. "I already beat him. There's no point to continuing  that part of the race. Besides, we debated often in the primary, and on 99% of  the issues, we stand exactly the same."  </P> <P> Though Hunter has drawn criticism for what some see as an undemocratic posture,  her stance appears strategically unassailable in a district that stretches from  the South Bay to northeastern San Diego County and into the desert communities  of Riverside County. Having benefited from the saturation publicity that  allowed her to catapult out of the middle of the pack in the primary, Hunter  now stands to benefit more from a quiet runoff that dampens passions on all  sides and by dismissing Lyles as an insignificant interloper.  </P> <P> But, even as Hunter tries publicly to ignore Lyles, her campaign strategists  have clearly treated him as a serious threat. A recent Hunter mailer harshly  attacks Lyles, describing him as "the choice of the gun lobby, anti-choice  extremists and the Sacramento Cavemen," with the last phrase applying to  arch-conservatives in the Assembly Republican caucus. Another Hunter brochure  pointedly reminds voters that Lyles was accused in the primary of overstating  his educational and professional background, and concludes: "Don't be fooled by  what Dick Lyles and his extremist supporters are trying to tell you."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Core of 200 Volunteers  </P> <P> "What Hunter is saying and what her people are doing are two different things,"  said Lyles aide Doug Perkins. "You bet they're worried. It's a horse race."  </P> <P> Lyles himself, who began his write-in campaign by declaring his readiness "to  climb a political mountain," professes to believe that "the summit is in sight"  as the race enters its final days.  </P> <P> "It's still going to be very tough, and a write-in campaign is always sort of a  wild card," Lyles said. "But I think it's clearly do-able."  </P> <P> As of Sept. 16, Lyles had outspent Hunter, $288,888 to $244,391, although most  of his money was spent in the primary, and Hunter also benefited from a  $100,000 independent expenditure by the California Nurses Assn. Hunter is  president of the state Nursing Board, a body to which she was appointed by Gov.  George Deukmejian in 1983.  </P> <P> Since the primary, Lyles has focused almost exclusively on the grass-roots  organizational work that, although always essential, is even more critical to  the hopes of a candidate whose name does not even appear on the ballot. Backed  by a core of about 200 volunteers, Lyles' strategists, patterning their  campaign after the historic 1982 write-in victory of Rep. Ron Packard  (R-Carlsbad), have directed an extensive telephone and mail blitz aimed at  reminding voters that Lyles is still in the race and how to write in his name  on Oct. 3.  </P> <P> Like Hunter, Lyles concedes that the two Republicans hold similar positions on  most issues, with abortion and Hunter's support for a ban on assault rifles  marking their two major ideological distinctions. However, Lyles also has  sought to expand the abortion question into a "family values" issue that he  argues crystallizes the candidates' differences.  </P> <P> "While the family values I represent begin with my pro-life position, what I'd  like to do in areas such as drugs and crime and education reinforce that,"  Lyles said. Among his proposals are ones calling for restructuring of school  financing and withholding drivers' licenses from teen-agers convicted of  drug-related offenses.  </P> <P> Noting that she and Lyles hold "overlapping positions" on most such issues,  Hunter says: "I'd gladly measure my values against his anytime. How can someone  who likes to talk about fighting crime and respect for life reconcile that with  selling assault weapons?"  </P> <P> Largely because of her isolated liberal positions on high-profile issues,  Hunter has been forced to fend off accusations that she is, as the conservative  Young Americans for Freedom puts it, "a liberal wolf in sheep's clothing." Last  summer, Republican Assembly Leader Ross Johnson, who sent out a primary  fund-raising letter on Lyles behalf to GOP contributors, implied that Hunter  was linked to "liberal special-interest groups and labor unions with close  ties" to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Solid GOP Credentials  </P> <P> In fact, with the exception of abortion and the assault weapons issue, Hunter  hews to fairly mainstream conservative Republican positions, as illustrated by  her support of the death penalty, opposition to public employee strikes and  backing of a constitutional amendment outlawing the burning of the American  flag. Since her primary victory, most local elected Republicans have endorsed  Hunter, including even Johnson and others who opposed her or kept her at arm's  length in the August race.  </P> <P> Although Hunter may have had trouble convincing some of her fellow Republicans  of her solid GOP credentials, Democrat Correia, a 46-year-old instructor of the  retarded, is gladly willing to concede the point.  </P> <P> "Tricia and I agree on two things -- pro-choice and banning assault weapons,"  said Correia, a Poway resident who finished fifth in the primary behind four  Republicans but, because of the race's peculiar format, nevertheless qualified  for the runoff.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, on social, economic and other issues, she's a solid Republican,"  Correia added. "One advantage I'd have is that I could go to Sacramento and  work with the Democratic majority in a much more effective manner."  </P> <P> Acknowledging that her slim chances hinge on a badly divided GOP vote, Correia  has been unable to get Democratic leaders to share her perception that  Tuesday's election represents "probably the best chance we're ever going to  have in this district." With the party unwilling to commit scarce financial  resources to what most regard as a long shot even with multiple Republicans in  the race -- if not on the ballot -- Correia expects to spend only about $10,000  in her campaign.  </P> <P> The fourth candidate in the race, write-in Bowser, is a 29-year-old accountant  who ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in Washington but was unknown to  local Republican officials before his surprising entry in the runoff.  </P> <P> Arguing that the primary's low turnout reflects voters' dissatisfaction with  the three other candidates, Bowser, who describes himself as a "progressive  conservative," says he hopes to "get people interested by giving them a choice  they didn't have" in August.  </P></p>

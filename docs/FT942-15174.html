			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Further stinging accusations at Regina The battle for the bees at Regina took another surprise turn with revelations that the royal jelly company paid consultancy fees to Major Ronald Ferguson, father of the Duchess of York, as part of its costly foray into polo sponsorship. The information was provided in one of two letters sent to shareholders over the extraordinary meeting on April 23 which will dictate board control. Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor - the spurned former head-of-the-hive who is aiming to get voted back - hit out at the stings of the current board. He claimed that the battle started over unwarranted pay rises demanded by his detractors. Mr Paul Geoghegan, chairman, and Mr Tony Shakesby, finance director, attempted to push through 20 per cent pay rises on their Pounds 50,000 salaries. Mr Malik-Noor, then earning Pounds 77,000, succeeded in restricting the rise to 2 per cent. Mr Malik-Noor also defended his track record in developing international contacts. He is attempting to reinstate himself on the board, and appoint new directors who would ensure his control. By contrast, Mr Geoghegan's letter points to the 60 per cent fall in turnover since Mr Malik-Noor took control. It compares the Pounds 218,000 spent on US marketing against a corresponding 84 per cent drop in US sales. Shareholders have succumbed to Mr Geoghegan's chain of letters (three so far). He has received 99.6 per cent support from the 765 proxies that have arrived to date. However, Mr Malik-Noor, the major shareholder, claims support for up to 40 per cent of the shares. The only certainty is that there will be a sizeable bun fight at the jelly company's EGM.</p>

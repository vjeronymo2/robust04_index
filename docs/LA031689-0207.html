			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS RESUME AIRLIFTS TO AFGHANISTAN  </P> <P> A Soviet official today said the Kremlin has resumed military airlifts to  Afghanistan in response to a guerrilla offensive around the strategic city of  Jalalabad.  </P> <P> Muslim guerrillas today claimed that they shot down two more aircraft in heavy  fighting for Jalalabad, Afghanistan's third-largest city. The government  claimed that 470 insurgents were killed in fighting in the last 24 hours.  </P> <P> Soviet Ambassador Yuri Vorontsov said Moscow resumed airlifting arms to Kabul  on Wednesday, one month after the Red Army withdrew from the war-torn nation.  </P> <P> Vorontsov said the weapons included medium-range Scud B missiles, which have  reportedly been fired from Kabul at guerrilla positions around Jalalabad, 75  miles to the east and 40 miles west of the Pakistan border.  </P> <P> Sources said at least 40 Ilyushin-76 transport planes have landed at Kabul  airport since Wednesday, carrying military supplies and food.  </P> <P> Vorontsov accused Pakistan of sending hundreds of its soldiers along with the  guerrillas in the 10-day battle for Jalalabad, which has been among the most  intense in Afghanistan's civil war.  </P> <P> "We have discussed the situation with the Pakistanis, and they know what our  reaction will be if their involvement continues," Vorontsov said. "We are not  threatening the Pakistanis, but they must stop."  </P></p>

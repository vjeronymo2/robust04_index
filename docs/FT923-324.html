			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Louise' in Geneva - Opera Has Louise, the teenage dressmaker from Montmartre who defies her parents to follow her lover into the Paris of the 1900s, lost the power of pulling in the public? I never thought, in the well-behaved Grand Theatre at Geneva, of all places, to see so many people fail to return after the interval or steal quickly out during the performance. Stranger still, many of them were of the age when one would expect to enjoy this well-tried tear-jerker, offering as it does operatic slumming on a luxurious scale. Have the attitudes of Louise's parents and their daughter's once-scandalous reactions become incredible? Has the pendulum swing to the other extreme and stuck there? It can hardly have been the staging and performance, which with a few reservations were on the serious, intelligent level one expects in this theatre. Gustave Charpentier's 'musical novel' has shown a surprising capacity to split opinions through succeeding generations. But, though I remember seeing the late Peter Heyworth white with barely suppressed rage during the ENO production some years back, such a general show of thumbs-down, as one saw the other evening in Geneva, came as a shock. Christian Aeby's production is set in a striking decor by a young French designer new to opera, Elsa Pavanel. A three-sided metal gallery is suspended behind and above the low, brown walls enclosing the parents' depressing apartment. Louise's writer friend Julien has a vantage point from which his serenades can be seen as well as heard. In the scene on the Butte, a central staircase leads up to the platform. On it, halfway to heaven against a starry background, Louise sings 'Depuis le jour' and her passionate duet with Julien. The revellers, bringing lanterns, flags and streamers in bright primary colours, swarm over gallery and stairs for the crowning of Louise as their Muse. The effect, though it might as well be Peking as Paris, adroitly freshens a potentially embarrassing episode. Down the staircase, a few minutes later, advances the accusing figure of the mother. At the end of the opera, when Louise runs away for the second time, the apartment walls vanish, carnival figures dance in silhouette on one platform and there is a glimpse of Julien already chasing another bit of skirt. The last (silent) word is mimed by the insufferable Noctambulist who has flitted on and off during the previous act. Charpentier, his own librettist, chose a simpler, less melodramatic, more pathetic ending. The American soprano Mary Mills was making her European debut as Louise. A pretty, pouting, puppy-face with a promising voice of considerable power when required, Miss Mills has still to learn how to project the short, conversational phrases which for this role are just as important as the long lines. The producer wisely refrained from making Julien anything more than a cheerful proletarian playboy. Gregory Kunde dealt ringingly with his opening solo and with the duet. Unfortunately, having some of the best music doesn't make Julien a believable person. Jean-Philippe Courtis is really too distinguished in manner for the father, but he is a fine, cultivated singer. His physical portrayal of the man's illness in the last scene was exaggerated. The mother was Maureen Forrester, a senior artist of great experience who coloured her phrases with subtle indications of the woman's dreary past and future, and her bitter jealousy not only of Louise's chance of happiness but of her husband's slightly ambiguous love for the girl. The excellent chorus singing almost made up for the under-singing, under-playing and under-lighting of the minor roles in the tedious scene of the dawn street cries. Near-inaudibility here was not the fault of the conductor, Armin Jourdan, who drew velvety but discreetly balanced playing from the Suisse Romande Orchestra - one can see why Mahler enjoyed conducting this score. Jordan enjoyed himself so much that the pace became soporific at those sticky moments when Charpentier shows that, whatever else he learned from his teacher Massenet, it wasn't knowing when to move the drama on.</p>

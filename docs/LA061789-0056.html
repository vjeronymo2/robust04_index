			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREVIN'S HISTORY  </P> <P> If music director Andre Previn's biggest problem with the Los Angeles  Philharmonic was lackluster attendance, then I have to wonder if Philharmonic  executive Ernest Fleischmann or the board of directors know anything about  conductors or records or compact discs or who's hot and who's not.  </P> <P> Any classical record freak knows what kind of conductor Previn is from his long  history of his recordings with the London Symphony: He is a laid-back,  understated conductor who loves leisurely, thoughtful readings of long works  and who has built a whole career conducting Walton and Elgar and Vaughan  Williams.  </P> <P> If audiences here want to listen to Schumann's Fourth Symphony and if they  don't want to hear Elgar's "Enigma" Variations, then Previn should never have  been offered the music director's position.  </P> <P> From Previn's cold reception here, it should be obvious that Lorin Maazel and  Christoph von Donanyi shouldn't even be considered to succeed Previn, since  they are even more laid-back and more thoughtful than Previn, having been  successors to George Szell in Cleveland.  </P> <P> The search for a new conductor in Los Angeles sounds less like the search for a  Scarlett O'Hara and more like a group of guys (Fleischmann and the board of  directors) who are trying to run a doughnut shop when they don't know what a  doughnut should look like or what a doughnut should taste like, let alone how  to market a doughnut.  </P> <P> I wonder if Fleischmann has ever even walked into a record store or if he ever  listens to KFAC. If he did then he wouldn't be faced with such a ridiculous  guessing game of who should lead the Philharmonic.  </P> <P> MATTHEW OKADA  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Morten Fyhn: "Big European Economic Area Package </F> Ready"]    [Text] Brussels--There has been a breakthrough in the tough  negotiations between the European Union (EU) and the European  Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries on a big package of  supplementary regulations that will be included in the European  Economic Area (EEA) agreement.    Completely overshadowed by the negotiations on EU  membership,  the EFTA countries and the European Commission have now reached  agreement on the big package of approximately 400 EU directives  that will become part of the EEA agreement. The so-called EEA-II  agreement can now be submitted to the EU and EFTA countries for  final approval before it goes into effect, probably on 1 July of  this year.    "We feel very relieved," Foreign Ministry Deputy Secretary  Per Ludvig Magnus told AFTENPOSTEN. He stressed that the  commission and EFTA now have the final political framework for  EEA-II ready, but that nothing will be settled until the  countries have debated the matter. The supplementary package  must receive final approval from the EEA Committee on 8 March  before it is ratified by the European Parliament and the  national assemblies in the EFTA countries.    EEA-II consists of all the new directives the EU has adopted  between 1 August 1991 and the end of this year. The EFTA  countries will not really be able to reap the benefits of the  EEA agreement until this package has received final approval,  the EFTA pointed out. Norway has been particularly concerned  with shipping and the rules on harmonizing standards for plant  and animal health. EEA-II also, however, involves free market  access for large parts of the service sector, transportation,  and mutual approval of qualifications and job training  certificates for nonacademic occupations.    Norway and the EU have still not resolved the remaining  problems connected with transporting fish and antidumping, while  Austria lacks agreement on the transit of heavy vehicles.  <H5>  Timetable </H5>   Having a complete EEA agreement in place appears  increasingly  important as a result of new signals that the EU membership  negotiations will probably take longer than planned. Hans van  den Broek, the European Commission's foreign affairs  commissioner, has now said openly that the European Parliament  cannot count on being presented with the full text of the  agreement with the applicant countries by 1 March.    He hopes the parliament will agree to begin its  deliberations  on the basis of a general summary of the results of the  negotiations so that the finished texts can come at a later  date. The European Parliament must approve the agreement with  applicant countries by 4 May at the latest. If this deadline is  not met, the debate will not take place before fall with the  result that new members cannot be accepted before the summer of  1995 at the earliest.</p>

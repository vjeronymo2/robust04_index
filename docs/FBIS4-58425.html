			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Concluding remarks by President Husni Mubarak at the </F> signing ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement  at the International Convention Center in Cairo -- live; Mubarak  speaks in English with simultaneous translation into Arabic]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, today we are witnessing a  historic event that is likely to influence the fate of our  region for decades and centuries to come. It marks the  realization of a great dream and a unique vision by the  peacemakers, who kept their faith, under difficult  circumstances, in the noble goal of peace.    Their participation in this occasion is living testimony  that  the world is fully committed to this great issue. It is also a  recognition of the wisdom of those who made this achievement  possible.    We are looking forward to further support. Let us extend to  them all material and moral support so that the agreement the  Palestinians and Israelis have signed can be implemented. They  took no chances or risks when they opted for peace. Let us  prove to the critics of both sides that none of their fears were  founded. Let us continue our efforts with the same will and  determination to achieve the same success on the other peace  tracks. This is the essence of the comprehensive settlement to  which we are committed.    Finally, we must waste no effort to achieve a global peace.  We must also turn our attention to the tragedies taking place  in many regions. It is our common commitment to unite against  any violation of the dignity of man. God bless us and may peace  prevail on earth. Thank you.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead FYFFES, the Irish-based fruit and vegetable distributor, is heading for a modest increase in pre-tax profits on Tuesday, having weathered recession in Europe and ERM currency upheavals during its year to end October 1992. Profits of IPounds 28.5m are expected against IPounds 27.1m last year, with the dividend likely to rise to 0.8939p (0.8126p) after the interim was upped to 0.3549p (0.3226p). Earnings per share, diluted by issues in 1992, are likely to fall to 5.7p from 6.73p. Expansion into continental Europe has come at a difficult time. The group's year-end coincided with sterling's 15 per cent decline in value against the Irish currency, with 50 per cent of turnover coming from UK operations. Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, is expected to produce results on Monday in line with its December profit warning of a slump from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 8.5m in pre-tax profits for the year to October 31. Earnings per share are likely to be between 4.5p and 4.6p (11.55p), with the dividend held at 6.05p. Profits this year could rise to Pounds 12m, confirming the group's position as a potential recovery stock.</p>

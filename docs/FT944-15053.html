			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Blair 'war footing' pledge Mr Tony Blair yesterday sought to put Labour on a 'war footing' against the 'ruthless and unprincipled' Conservatives in his first speech to MPs since becoming party leader. In a morale boosting address to a crowded meeting at Westminster Mr Blair promised 'inclusive' leadership in return for strong support and strict parliamentary discipline. In a clear appeal for party unity, Mr Blair told MPs: 'The only divisions are between those who want to win and those who don't want to win. And we must all be on the winning side.' Acknowledging fears among leftwing traditionalists about the growing domination of the party by the modernisers, he called for an end to conflict between 'cliques and cabals, left and right, modernisers and traditionalists'. Mr Blair also urged Labour MPs to spend more time communicating the party's message to voters, especially those who might not have voted for the party before. He said the party should make more use of regional television programmes, and 'worry less about getting a few paragraphs in The Guardian, and try to get more positive coverage in the Daily Mirror, The Sun and the Daily Mail'. Labour had to develop a strong message, a clear identity and high-quality organisation, he said. People must know what they were voting for in the polling booth, and must trust it. He told MPs that the approach to the general election had started, and warned them to avoid complacent acceptance of the party's lead in the opinion polls. In a clear indication of his confidence in the party's ability to take the fight to the Tories he said there were 'no no-go' areas, even on issues not traditionally regarded as strong Labour territory. 'We are up against a ruthless and unprincipled party. We need to be principled, but as determined as they are,' he said.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Windy City likely to absorb jobless blow THE closure of the catalogue and the 50,000 new layoffs at Sears nationwide is expected to cause barely a ripple in the economy of the Big Store's home town, Chicago. 'It's kind of an irony,' said Ms Diane Swonk, regional economist at First Chicago. 'If this had to happen it's better to have happened in Chicago than in New York or Los Angeles.' Metropolitan Chicago has weathered the recession better than those cities, she said. Other retailers are entering the Chicago market and should absorb the estimated 4,500 area employees the restructuring will make jobless. The Dayton-Hudson-owned discount chain, Target, plans to open stores, while electronics retailer Best Buy and Texas-based Nordstroms are also expanding.</p>

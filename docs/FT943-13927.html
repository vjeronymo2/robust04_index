			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Four Weddings and a poem - Anthony Curtis on the work of the suddenly voguish WH Auden Once before, a film turned a poem into a best-seller. In 1945, when John Pudney's RAF poem 'Do not despair/For Johnny Head-in-Air' was included by Terence Rattigan in his screenplay for The Way To the Stars, Pudney's sales shot up from hundreds to thousands. Now Richard Curtis has done it again with Auden's 'Funeral Blues', 'Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone . . .' in Four Weddings and A Funeral. Faber have re-printed 'Funeral Blues' with some other Auden favourites in a handy pamphlet (Pounds 2.50, 32 pages) that has already sold 40,000 copies and featured in a reader's offer in The Sun, a tabloid newspaper not previously noted for its commitment to poetry. Curiously, Auden and Pudney were at school together, pupils at Gresham's Holt in Norfolk in the 1920s. Auden a couple of years older than Pudney, had rather a crush on the younger boy. When Auden threw a batch of his poems into the school pond, saying that he had abandoned poetry for science, it was Pudney who helped him fish them out. At Oxford in 1925, Auden read Natural Science before switching to English. He published poetry in Oxford journals, edited Oxford Poetry with Day Lewis and had his first homosexual affairs. All the while he continued to write enormous quantities of poetry and he sent copies of them all to Pudney, who was still at Gresham's. Auden's undergraduate poetic output was staggering. No wonder he got a Third in his finals. The Pudney collection is one source for Katherine Bucknell's timely edition of Auden's Juvenilia 1922-28 (Faber Pounds 25, 320 pages). Other sources are poems preserved by Auden's mother, and those given by Auden to other friends of his youth, among them the painter Robert Medley, Christopher Isherwood, Tom Driberg. The typescripts often show several variants of a single poem. Most are now safely lodged in the Bodleian and other libraries but the Isherwood collection, the largest, is still in private hands. There are many lines and whole verses that were re-cycled into later poems in his published work. Dr Bucknell (who runs the Auden Society's Newsletter) notes all this in a running commentary of considerable fascination. Altogether she has assembled more than 200 poems written by Auden between the ages of 15 and 22. Most of them have never been published before. A few were published by Stephen Spender in an edition on a hand press limited to 30 copies as Poems (1928). It was Auden's first book. Most of the copies have disappeared. Dr Bucknell re-prints everything that was in it. From the start the young Auden was able to assume the manner of well-known poets he admired with amazing assurance. We can watch him restlessly trying on poetic styles until he found one that really suited him. He goes through a Georgian phase based on Edward Thomas, Walter de la Mare, where the imagery of disused mines, kestrels and the Midlands rural landscape of his childhood, is already obsessively captured. Then he has a pessimistic Hardy and Wilfred Owen phase that lasts until he works his way through to the moderns, Edith Sitwell, TS Eliot, Hopkins. Here is Auden at 20 becoming Gerard Manley Hopkins in a poem called Aware: 'Bones wrenched, weak whimper, lids wrinkled, first dazzle known,/ World-wonder hardens as bigness, years; brings knowledge, you.' More typical, however, than this denseness is a playful poem structured like a game of Consequences: 'She said: 'How tiring the lights are]/' I said 'How noisy it is]' So up we scrambled/ Into the loft which smelt of hay/. 'Supper]' they said, all too soon.' Auden later called this phase a process of 'literary transference'; by assiduously copying the style of a master the novice-poet discovers his own voice. Certainly by the end of the volume Auden has done that. There is a sequence called The Megalopsych (Aristotle's Great-minded man) that shows him maturing almost over-night. As Bucknell says, as soon he had finished it Auden began to iron out its pomposities and simplify. That simplicity was second nature to him by the time he came to write 'Funeral Blues'. In its 30 pages, Faber's new slim volume amply reveals Auden's power to haunt us with memorable lines, also his stunning versatility: it has a ballad, 'O what is that sound that fills the ear'; a calypso 'Driver drive faster'; a lullaby 'Lay your sleeping head my love'; an exhortation 'Lover sulk no more' (for Britten); a couple of Cowardy cabaret songs, and a clutch of love-lyrics in which complex metrical problems are solved. For those who wish to read 'Funeral Blues' in the context of Auden's entire poetic output, the Collected Poems (edited by Edward Mendelson Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 928 pages) contains 'all the poems that WH Auden wished to preserve'. He did not, however, wish to preserve the juvenilia but, as an insight into the development of a great poet who has become unexpectedly voguish, we are grateful to Dr Bucknell for the trouble she has taken to let us have them.</p>

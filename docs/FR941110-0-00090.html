			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The qualifications for surveyors, other survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel, and HCFA trainers, we believe, are already high.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our operating experience, we have seen no reason to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe otherwise. Even if we required that each team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a physician, as some commenters recommended, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not certain that some providers would be any more pleased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the survey results than they are now. We remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unconvinced that one must be a physician or an acknowledged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expert in a clinical specialty in order to perform a valid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey. We believe that the heart of the survey process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consists of clear guidelines and a detailed review of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suggestions that survey training materials be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published for public comment are addressed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Determination of a Deficiency'' section of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suggestion that providers be permitted to attend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey training courses at their own expense has merit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Traditionally, we have had no provisions for accommodating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all providers interested in attending: our resources are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxed enough by simply trying to provide timely training for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universally to providers at their own cost may help improve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding and cooperation between surveyors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers. We are therefore seriously considering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in law necessary to allow this.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not accept the suggestion that surveyors present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers with proof of the successful completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyor training. The fact that a surveyor is sent by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or HCFA is, in itself, evidence that the bearer meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements to be a surveyor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of the commenters did not make any suggestions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to the proposed rule. Instead, their comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were in the context of denigrating surveyors with whom they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had had unpleasant experiences, declaring that running a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is costly, frustrating, and unappreciated, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protesting the whole survey process in general. Because no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific suggestions were made concerning the proposed rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are unable to respond to these kinds of broad complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters suggested revising the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sentence at proposed &sect;488.164(c) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> *&blank;*&blank;* completed the required training and competency testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.'' Another said that, at the onset of each survey,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities should be told which surveyors are serving as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observers, and regulations should stipulate that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals should be excluded from active participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some other commenters said that surveyors-in-training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be allowed to participate in the survey process as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long as they are appropriately supervised. They said that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historically, these individuals have been used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``*&blank;*&blank;* collect information to be used by qualified surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the deficiency decision making process.'' Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two commenters said, not allowing surveyors-in-training to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observe would mean that new surveyors would face significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods of nonproductive time while waiting for courses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that surveyors must not only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete the required training, but the competency testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program as well. However, paragraph (c) already requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a surveyor successfully complete ``*&blank;*&blank;* a training and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing program.'' We do not agree that the survey team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should, at the outset of a survey, identify which of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members (if any) have not yet completed the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training and competency testing program. We also disagree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that surveyors who have not yet completed the training and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing program should ``be excluded from active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation.'' We do not want to prohibit the ``historic''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> role of observers mentioned by two of the commenters, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, to ``*&blank;*&blank;* collect information to be used by qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors during the deficiency decision making process,'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forbid individuals from making valuable contributions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey process if they are in a position to do so. We are,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, amending this section (&sect;488.164(d) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule) redesignated as &sect;488.314(c)(3) in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, to provide that the survey agency may permit an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual who has not completed a training program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in a survey as a trainee if accompanied onsite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a surveyor who has successfully completed the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training and testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

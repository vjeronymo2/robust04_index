			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (4): Two cheers for competitive bidding - New EC power plant rules raise US fears of 'Fortress Europe' ON JANUARY 1, a new era will begin for the power generating equipment industry and its clients in Europe when the European Community's controversial Utilities Directive comes into force, opening up public procurement contracts in the energy sector to competitive bidding. Most European suppliers believe the changes will, ultimately, sweep away the sometimes cosy relationships between EC utilities and domestic suppliers. US suppliers, however, remain deeply worried by the Directive, and particularly its so-called 'Fortress Europe' provisions. Certainly the long-standing links between customers and heavy plant suppliers, often encouraged by national governments which saw heavy engineering as an integral part of industrial policy, are unlikely to disappear overnight. The pace of change and the need for it may also vary considerably from one country to another. The Utilities Directive was pushed through by the European Commission in autumn 1990, in the face of considerable opposition by some national governments. Removing obstacles to transparency and fairness in public procurement was identified as a key prerequisite for a properly functioning Single Market. Electricity supply is an important area of public procurement - spending on energy and water-related contracts accounts for 17 per cent of EC public procurement as a whole. The Commission sees a clear link between the historic lack of intra-EC trade in power generating equipment and procurement practices. The basic rules of the Utilities Directive seem plain enough. Any supply contract worth Ecu400,000 or more (other than for telecommunications) and any works contract worth Ecu5m or more fall within the scope of the Directive, which sets strict rules for the publishing of the contract, the tendering process, and the criteria for the award of the contract - whether on lowest price or as the most 'economically advantageous' for the customer. Utilities can also decide to use one of three contract award procedures: an open method where all suppliers or contractors can submit tenders; restricted procedures for candidates invited by the customer; and negotiated procedures where the customer consults suppliers or contractors of its choice and negotiates with one or more. In both the restricted and negotiated procedures, however, there must be enough potential suppliers to ensure adequate competition. The thorny issues of contract specification and technical standards, which have hitherto often been used by some countries as a non-tariff barrier to trade, are addressed by measures enabling potential suppliers to obtain enough information to meet the customers' requirements. By the same token, suppliers will have to pay more attention to standards than previously, and in particular to European-wide standards, because these will be used to define the technical specification to be used in the invitation to tender. Even in the final months before its implementation, interpreting the Directive is a difficult, and sensitive issue. At a recent London conference on contracting in the new power industry, Mr Ernest Walker, European adviser of the Institute of Purchasing and Supply, suggested two reasons why contractors and suppliers are unwilling to speak publicly on how they plan to respond to the procurement directives. The first was ignorance of their contents and an unwillingness to disclose this publicly, while the second was an unwillingness to risk losing a competitive advantage to others. Mr Walker also put forward two reasons why equipment suppliers should have an adequate knowledge of the procurement directives. First, a supplier might find himself in a contractual situation, such as a management contract, where he is the agent of the client, and would then have to apply the directives in the same way that the client does. Secondly, knowledge of the directives will help a supplier know if he has been wrongly treated by a client. He will then be able to seek conciliation or initiate other remedial action. This would be taken via the separate EC Remedies Directive, which will provide legal sanctions against companies - effectively, against both customers and suppliers - who fail to observe the Directive. 'Contracting entities will be exposed to financial risk if they don't comply,' says Ms Helen Charlton, a partner in the EC and Competition Group at the law firm Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens. For non-EC suppliers, the biggest problem in the Directive is two key provisions collectively known as Fortress Europe. Customers can reject a bid with less than 50 per cent of European content, and must prefer the European bid where it is no more than 3 per cent dearer than the best bid from overseas. According to Ms Charlton, the Fortress Europe provision has significant implications for non-EC suppliers. Indeed the major US suppliers, led by General Electric of the US, are deeply worried by this aspect of the Directive. In this, they are supported by the US government, which has said that it will seriously consider sanctions if the contentious Article 29 is enacted, thus discriminating against US companies. The US industry is hoping that a deal between the US and EC at Gatt level could lead to an amendment to Article 29 removing US suppliers from its scope. Ms Charlton points out that the '3 per cent' rule is itself open to different interpretations: is the difference to be based on the higher or the lower price? The UK draft legislation, intended to implement the Directive, takes the less protectionist stance by basing the calculation on the lower price. A second problem is the fact that the Utilities Directive excludes 'services,' which could cause difficulty with turnkey contracts where much of the value is based on supply of knowhow rather than equipment. The Directive applies to siting and installation services, but is to be amended to include services, though probably not by January 1. Among more general issues for equipment suppliers raised by the legislation, the extra cost of bidding is also important. Any further rise in bidding costs - which already exceed Pounds 1m for a turnkey power station or Pounds 500,000 for supplying a batch of gas turbines or boilers - increases the pressure on equipment producers to guess which projects are likely to produce real orders. A further question is the extent to which the public procurement directives cut across other trends in the relationship between suppliers and customers in the power industry, such as single sourcing or long-term partnering agreements. As usual in the power equipment industry, the introduction of the Directive will require suppliers to keep well-tuned political antennae. Dr Eugene Zeltmann, manager of trade and industry associations at GE Industrial and Power Systems, made clear at the London conference that for non-EC based suppliers, the use of strategic alliances to help break down trade barriers remains crucially important. At the same time, GE and its allies continue to seek ways to 'chip away at the bricks in protectionist walls'.</p>

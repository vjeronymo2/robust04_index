			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.K. Sharma: "Pack on Bilateral Investments: Rao </F> for Global Pressure on Pakistan"]    [Excerpts] London, March 14. India's growing impatience  with Pakistan's role in Kashmir and its tactics at international  forums was reflected here in the statements of the Prime  Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao. He reiterated his government's  determination to achieve normalisation in that state through a  democratic, political and consensual approach.    (Britain today announced a \Pten million assistance for the  World Bank rehabilitation projects in the quake hit areas of  Maharashtra, report UNI [United News of India] and PTI [Press  Trust of India].    This would be in addition to the \Pthree million assistance  already given by Britain for the purpose.    The British overseas development minister, Baroness Lynda  Chalker, conveyed this decision when she called on Mr. Narasimha  Rao here this morning.    Expressing appreciation for British development assistance  to  India, the Prime Minister reiterated New Delhi's commitment to  economic reforms.    He said his government would pay special attention to the  weaker sections of the society while initiating development  programmes.    Mr. Rao said India would welcome assistance in the  infrastructural sector particularly in the field of energy.    New Delhi is the largest recipient of British overseas  assistance for 1993-94. The UK had pledged \P239 million to  India during the period.    Later in his meeting with the secretary of defence, Mr.  Malcolm Rifkind, Mr. Rao stressed the need for greater  technology transfer as also co-production, sub contract and  joint marketing in the defence sector.    The leaders in their 30-minute meeting discussed ways and  means to increase defence cooperation between India and Britain.    Earlier in the morning Mr. Rao had a breakfast meeting with  the Mayor of London. [passage omitted]    Mr. Rao's message to his host government as well as to the  Indian community was more or less the same. He highlighted  Pakistan's role in helping terrorists and described Kashmir as  "another victim of a proxy war directed against India."    Addressing the community at Guild Hall, Mr. Rao said  terrorism in Kashmir sought to destroy India's sense of  nationhood, secularism and democracy. Misguided youths  indoctrinated, and equipped with instruments of violence from  outside were engaged in mindless violence. It was not a  religious problem and if the external factor was removed from  Jammu and Kashmir, the state could return to normalcy, hold  elections and revive economic activity.    "The world must recognise that it is this external factor of  Pakistan's instigation which keeps alive terrorist activity in  Kashmir. The only intervention that is needed is pressure on  that external factor to cease such support and enter into  serious discussions with us on a peaceful and durable  understanding. We have shown ourselves to be open to such a  dialogue in spite of the provocative and unreasonable attitude  of our neighbours, and will continue to remain so.    He reminded the world of the amusing irony that a country on  the verge of being declared a terrorist state should be able to  loftily proclaim that they could not have discussions with us  until our human rights record improved. It was because of a  massive disinformation campaign that India, a victim of  terrorism organised and financed from across the border, should  sometimes find itself subjected to unwarranted criticism. It  also found that the world was worried about the human rights of  terrorists, who massacred innocent people or used religious  places for political ends, but not of those who were being  forced out of their homes, attacked and terrorised.    Mr. Rao recalled that Punjab, after a decade-long nightmare  of terrorist violence, had been turned into a peaceful state.  The transformation was made possible by the patriotism of the  people of Punjab and their faith in democracy. "Their fortitude  and determination in the face of terrorism would be a remarkable  chapter in India's post independence history," he added.    Mr. Rao said India remained fully committed to secularism  while fully respecting all religions. Over the centuries,  minorities in India had enriched the mosaic of India's  multicultural heritage, he said.    India's economic reforms was another subject on which Mr.  Rao  addressed the Non-Resident Indians [NRI]. Mr. Rao said the  economic situation had improved tremendously. Foreign  investments had grown and there was a further role for NRIs who  would find investments in India very attractive.    India had taken several measures to remove difficulties of  businessmen and the state governments were competing with each  other for NRI investments. The NRI community was the second  largest investor in India in 1993, going by approval figures,  Mr. Rao said. The NRI community in Britain also had a role in  shaping the Indo-British relationship which had reached a very  exciting phase, he said.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (3): Lacalle's dream is shattered - John Barham notes the unpopularity of free market policies URUGUAY is riven by a vicious factionalism that contrasts strangely with the placid, somewhat complacent, conservatism of its national character. Political backstabbing, squabbling and divisiveness have shattered President Luis Alberto Lacalle's ambition of turning the country into a free market paradise. Mr Lacalle's determination to pursue unpopular economic policies has been stymied by his lack of charisma and political savoir faire. The opposition has successfully blocked his efforts to reform the state, privatise companies and revamp the bankrupt state pension fund. Coalition allies and even members of his National party (usually known as the Blanco party) deserted him in the first years of his government. Uruguay's electoral system militates against disciplined political parties which could provide governments with majorities in Congress. It combines primary elections with presidential elections. Voters select rival candidates from each party and the candidate with the most votes wins. This has led to the emergence of factions which are often as hostile to each other as they are to opposing parties. At the November 1989 election, the Blancos won less than 50 per cent of the vote and although Mr Lacalle had more votes than any other candidate, he was elected by only 22 per cent of the population. As president, he has never managed to build additional support and his positive ratings in the opinion polls rarely exceed 20 per cent. He is unable to command a solid majority in Congress to push through his reform programme. In the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, he can count on 27 out of 99 members. In the Senate only between four and seven of its 31 members back the government. Every item of legislation has to be negotiated with the opposition Colorado and Frente Amplio parties and rival Blanco factions. However, Mr Lacalle can draw comfort from the fact that the opposition is equally divided. Its attempt last month to sack Mr Ignacio de Posadas, the finance minister, failed by 36 votes to 59 - although two independent Blanco deputies voted against Mr de Posadas. Even if Mr Lacalle can negotiate in the smoke-filled rooms of Congress, he must still contend with the unyielding conservatism of the Uruguayan people. Suspicion, even resentment, of his free market policies runs deep. Uruguayans who have lived under a welfare state for almost a century are unwilling to change. Slogans like 'solidarity' and 'unity' still carry real weight. There is also a widely-felt perception that Uruguay's state companies are working reasonably well and therefore do not justify privatisation. Even a sympathetic former Blanco cabinet minister comments that Mr Lacalle has made a mistake in pursuing so fundamentalist an economic policy: 'Gradually people are recognising that things need to change, but the people do not accept radical solutions.' All this became brutally clear in last December's referendum: the electorate overwhelmingly rejected a government plan to privatise five state companies. The opposition took 72 per cent of the vote. The government has still not fully recovered from its defeat. It says the opposition campaigned for a No vote for purely political reasons, rather than on the issues at stake. Mr Lacalle said: 'All the propaganda was around 'vote against the government, vote against the government vote against the government.'' Government supporters criticise the Colorados for openly attacking Mr Lacalle, while discreetly supporting him. This is because they do not wish to be identified with his policies, but realise they are necessary. The former minister says: 'They want Lacalle to do all the dirty work.' Another important reason for the rejection of reform is that about one in four Uruguayans depends on the state in one way or another. About 450,000 people draw state pensions and a further 270,000 work for the government or for state companies. Politicians have traditionally used government jobs as a source of political patronage or to disguise unemployment. Some estimates put the number of surplus public employees as high as 80,000. Organised labour, led by bank workers and public sector unions including the police, teachers and civil servants, has called eight general strikes against Mr Lacalle's government. These strikes - the last held in May - have further damaged the president's image. Efforts to reform the pension fund are foundering in the face of determined opposition by Uruguay's pensioners' associations. Mr Lacalle's perseverance with deeply unpopular policies is remarkable. It is hardly surprising that ministers often sound frustrated and resigned. Mr Carlos Cat, the planning and budget minister and head of the Blanco party committee, comments: 'We have failed to get important structural reforms that are fundamental to modernise the country, stabilise the economy and get reasonable inflation. We are frustrated, but we are not resigned. We are not going to lower our arms. We are like Don Quixote tilting at windmills. We will go on.' The next elections are scheduled for November 1994 and Mr Lacalle is due to hand over power in March 1995. The presidential campaign is already beginning to warm up. There are two leading candidates. The Colorado's Mr Julio Maria Sanguinetti, Mr Lacalle's immediate predecessor, is a strong (though undeclared) candidate. Mr Tabare Vazquez, the charismatic socialist mayor of Montevideo, has yet formally to toss his hat into the ring for the left-wing Frente Amplio. The neatly groomed Mr Vazquez, a practising oncologist, is clearly moving to the right to broaden his appeal. He says the left has adopted conservative ideas such as the importance of low inflation, strong public finances, an efficient civil service and acceptance of private enterprise. He argues that telecommunications and other strategic state companies should never be privatised and that the state should retain a strong regulatory role to guide the market. He says the Blancos are 'also seeking this but with a dehumanised concept that says 'we have to adjust employment, the balance of trade and debt and discusses numbers,' without looking at what is happening with the people. If the government can get a Dollars 300m Inter-American Development Bank loan to set up a financial system, why can't it get a Dollars 30-40m loan for emergency housing?'</p>

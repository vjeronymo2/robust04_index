			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The People's Liberation  Army [PLA] has been told by the communist party leadership to  step in line behind the ideals of socialism.    The PLA's powerful political department has issued a  circular, published on the front page of newspapers here Monday,  calling on the military to stand four square behind current  economic reforms. The call for loyalty follows a series of  similar appeals to rank and file party members and leading  social figures issued by senior leaders during last week's  national conference on ideology and the media.    The meeting was the most important since 1957 which led to  purges against rightists.    Emphasising that the "new situation had created new  problems"  -- an implication that accelerated economic reforms this year  could bring the risk of social instability -- the circular  called on all army units to back the programme and to work to  strengthen the "socialist spiritual civilisation." The text  called on soldiers to be in the "forefront of patriotism," to  study the works of Deng Xiaoping and publicise the Communist  Party central committee's decisions.    The party also called on soldiers to follow the example of  soldier Lei Feng, a legendary hero of the 60s who devoted his  life to the motherland and the party before his death aged 22.  The military should study the spirit of Lei Feng and improve  their ideological knowledge, it said.    Last week, before an assembly of PLA veterans, party chief  Jiang Zemin told the armed forces to remain united behind the  party.    Chinese leaders are visibly concerned about the threat of  social, or even political unrest this year as economic reforms  speed up, somewhat unevenly. Deng also celebrates his 90th  birthday in August this year. Many foreign and Chinese analysts  fear his death could bring chaos to the country. In the event of  unrest, the party leaders want to be able to count on the armed  forces to ensure the system does not collapse around them.</p>

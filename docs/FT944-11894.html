			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (6): How to beat the swindlers - Car fraud / A look at steps being taken to reform the industry Purchasing a second-hand car can be a risky business. According to HPI, the vehicle credit information organisation, as many as one in three cars sold privately may have been written off by an insurance company, reported stolen or may be subject to a finance agreement. A potential buyer is unlikely to be aware of any of this. The fraudulent sale of vehicles still subject to finance agreements is increasing. According to a survey conducted by the Finance and Leasing Association, its members reported 9,500 cases of such fraud, which cost them more than Pounds 45m between February 1993 and February 1994. The incidence of such fraud has increased over the past few years as more buyers use a form of financing to purchase cars. According to HPI, more than 55 per cent of all new cars are now bought with the aid of a finance agreement. Six years ago, that figure was closer to 25 per cent. Finance and leasing car fraud can be conducted in several ways. Perhaps the most common swindle is when a car owner sells a vehicle subject to a finance agreement without informing the buyer. If the first buyer of the vehicle used a contract hire, contract purchase, lease purchase, or any other form of lease finance - all of which have become increasingly popular forms of finance - the new buyer does not inherit good title and is legally liable for the debt, while the finance company would be entitled to take remove the vehicle. If, however, the car was originally bought with a hire purchase agreement and the second-hand buyer does not know about the financing, the new buyer is guaranteed some protection under the Hire Purchase Act of 1964. The act says that innocent buyers of cars subject to hire purchase agreements receive good title to the car and are not responsible for the remaining debt on the vehicle. But while the consumer is protected, the finance company loses out because it is unable to repossess the car or demand repayment from the new owner. Frank Layborn, chairman of the working party on aprotection of title initiative at the FLA, says the 1964 Hire Purchase Act is tantamount to a 'villain's charter' because of this loophole in the law. He says fraudsters can orchestrate a transaction that is completely protected by the law. 'You now have the situation where person A, for example, buys a Ford Mondeo on a hire-purchase agreement. Person B buys another car. Then they meet in a pub and they exchange the cars without telling each other about the hire-purchase agreements, and they both get good title,' he says. 'Neither of the finance companies can collect the money or their property because both buyers have good title.' To combat these various forms of fraud, the FLA, supported by the Consumers Association, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Retail Motor Industry and the Driver Vehicle Licensing Association, has proposed a statutory car ownership register. All manufacturers and importers would have to register with a centralised service which would keep track of all subsequent changes in ownership and finance agreements. It would also store information about insurance write-offs and keep records of mileage and cars reported stolen. Each car would be registered by its vehicle identification number (Vin), a 17-digit number allocated at the point of manufacture. Unlike a registration number, which can change if licence plates are changed, the Vin is set by a worldwide standard and would remain constant throughout a car's life, making it difficult for fraudsters to disguise a car's identity. Anyone buying a used car privately would be legally required to consult the register to check the vehicle's ownership. Since a finance company owns a car until the debt is paid off, such a register would immediately reveal any finance agreements. The loophole in the 1964 Hire Purchase Act which protects 'innocent' buyers of cars subject to hire purchase agreements would be eradicated. 'It would be the buyer's responsibility to take sensible precautions before parting with their money,' says Mr Layborn. 'So, for example, the two guys in the pub would not have good title because they would be construed to have knowledge of the hire purchase agreements under the law. They would be liable if they did not check the register.' HPI already provides a register service, but because it is not enshrined in legislation, Mr Layborn says it is not sacrosanct. 'If a finance company does not want to register it does not need to,' he said. HPI is helping the FLA with its legal proposal, and hopes to bid for a tender to provide the national service. In the meantime, it collects data for seven registers that 18,000 subscribers in the motor trade and 1,100 in the finance industry use on a regular basis. The outstanding finance register, for example, contains details of the finance arrangements on 5m vehicles listed, and the vehicle identity register provides confirmation of the make, model, colour, engine size, transmission and fuel type for all vehicles registered with the DVLA since 1986 - now numbering about 19 1/2 m. In addition, HPI's services are available to members of the public. For Pounds 25, a customer can access any of the HPI databases and make sure the car they intend to purchase is clear of finance agreements. They can also check that it is not stolen or written off by an insurance company and make sure the previous owner has not changed registration plates or misrepresented the car's age. Consumers who check the HPI register are technically giving up their legal protection. 'Once you use our service it could be argued that you are no longer an innocent purchaser,' says Nikki Websper, marketing manager at HPI. 'But you would be daft to buy a car that had an outstanding finance agreement.'</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLUS FOR NEGATIVE  </P> <P> Benny L. Kass' Jan. 27 column seriously misinforms readers about  adjustable-rate mortgages with a deferred interest option. He stated: "Under no  circumstances can I recommend the negative amortization mortgage."  </P> <P> This is poor financial advice.  </P> <P> The best designed ARMs provide for the deferral of interest. The  deferred-interest option is, perhaps, the most important consumer protection a  well-designed ARM can offer because it helps the borrower to avoid payment  shock. The alternative would be a sharp increase in the monthly payment. In  some cases, borrowers might be forced to move or default.  </P> <P> Contrary to the myth that negative amortization is something bad, home loans  with the deferred-interest option give most borrowers a better deal. Borrowers  with the deferred-interest option will pay lower total mortgage payments, lower  monthly payments and still build up substantial equity. They will not lose  ground if their home appreciates as little as 3% or 4% per year.  </P> <P> KEVIN HAWKINS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P> <P> Hawkins is assistant vice president public relations for Great Western  Financial Corp.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> 4 ARRESTED UNDER JOB-SOLICITING LAW  </P> <P> A crackdown on day laborers who seek work on street corners and in parking lots  began Thursday as four workers were arrested for violating a new city ordinance  that makes it illegal to solicit jobs on the street.  </P> <P> Police issued citations to four Latino men, checked their identification and  determined that they were not legal residents, Mayor Don E. Smith said. The men  were then taken to the U.S. Border Patrol station near San Clemente for  deportation, Smith said. A fifth man picked up for jaywalking was also taken to  the station.  </P> <P> The maximum penalties for violating the ordinance are a $1,000 fine and six  months in jail. Illegal immigrants also face deportation.  </P> <P> The ordinance, adopted by the City Council last September, went into effect  Wednesday. On the first day of enforcement, police delivered flyers explaining  the ordinance to workers congregating along the commercial strip of East  Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> No one was arrested for job solicitation on Wednesday, but two men were  arrested for other violations and delivered to border officials, police said.  </P> <P> Street corners have been quiet since the ordinance went into effect. "There's  not near as many walking the streets," Smith said of the workers.  </P> <P> In 1988, immigrant-rights groups protested city measures to control job  solicitation by dayworkers when, in response to complaints by local merchants,  police stopped scores of men along East Chapman Avenue for violations such as  jaywalking, littering and driving vehicles with expired registrations.  </P> <P> Those who could not provide identification were handed over to immigration  officials for possible deportation.  </P> <P> So far, there has been no protest of the new ordinance.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, business was brisk at the city's hiring hall, with twice the average  number of workers placed in jobs, a spokeswoman said. During the hall's first  month of operation, there was an average of 12 employer-worker matches daily,  but on Thursday, 24 men and women found work through the center.  </P> <P> The number of workers and employers using the hall was also above average on  Thursday, with participation by 274 workers and eight employers compared to a  daily average of 230 workers and five employers.

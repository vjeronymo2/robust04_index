			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: APV dips to Pounds 21m and warns on first six months SHARES in APV fell 11p to 101p after the food processing equipment specialist announced a drop in profits and warned that pressure on prices would affect its results for the first half of this year. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 21.1m in the year to December 31, on sales up by 8.4 per cent to Pounds 947m. APV sells about 80 per cent of its products overseas and suffered from generally poor economic conditions worldwide. The profit figure was depressed by an exceptional charge of Pounds 6.3m. The net profit on disposal of discontinued operations, less amounts provided for losses on operations to be discontinued, was Pounds 13.7m. In addition, Pounds 20m was charged in respect of ongoing business reorganisations. Mr Clive Strowger, appointed chief executive in June, has started extensive restructuring to focus the group and increase profit margins. The balance sheet was strengthened by the Pounds 56m sale of Vent-Axia, its fans and hand drier business, to Smiths Industries in December. APV's workforce fell by 1,000 to 11,600 at the year end, not counting the 400 employees who moved with Vent-Axia. That disposal and reductions in working capital helped cut gearing from 42 to 12 per cent. Mr Strowger said the group had been reorganised to align its businesses more closely with customers and markets. It would also seek to broaden its customer base more towards industrial sectors. Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said: 'We enter 1993 with orders 9.3 per cent lower than a year ago but the board is confident that good progress is being made with repositioning the group for future profitable growth. In spite of a drop in earnings per share from 5.4p to 3.4p, the final dividend is held at 3.4p to maintain the total at 5.4p. COMMENT The new management team have a big job on their hands, but seem to be setting about it with a will. APV made a lot of acquisitions in the eighties, but did little to integrate the businesses - or even impose uniform financial reporting. In spite of strong market positions and sales, the group has seen profits melt away as recession increased pressure on prices. These figures were at the low end of expectations, and the share price also responded to the group's caution over the immediate trading outlook. Forecast profits of Pounds 27m put it on a multiple of 17.5. APV continues to be seen as a candidate for takeover - but that should support its share price, as will the group's strong recovery potential and determination to maintain the dividend, giving a high yield.</p>

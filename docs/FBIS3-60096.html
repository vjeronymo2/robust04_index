Their official name is "Turk-islam Federasyonu" or "Belcika  Turk-islam Kultur Dernekleri Federasyonu," which can be  translated as "Turkish-Islamic Federation" or "Federation of  Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations of Belgium." The Belgian  headquarters of this federation is in Beringen, and its European  headquarters are in Frankfurt. It is also supported actively at  international level by the Turkish Government, which denies  this, as might be expected.    As an extremely dangerous extreme right movement, it is an  avatar of Colonel Alparslan Turkes' fascist nationalist party.  Highly active in the late 1970's and 1980's, its members  specialized in guerilla warfare and the murder of progressive  politicians. They also engaged in heroin trafficking in order  to finance their activities.    However, they are even better known for their direct  involvement in the failed attempt against Pope John-Paul II in  May 1981. If we are to believe the Turkish daily, MILLIYET, the  person who fired the shots in Saint Peter's square in Rome, Ali  Agca, was allegedly harbored for a while with the Belgian  representative of the "Gray Wolves," Selahattin Saygin, in  Maasmechelen.    Do the "Gray Wolves" also benefit in Belgium from the  relative leniency of the Turkish authorities? Of course: In  1986, during the third conference of "Gray Wolves" of Belgium,  the fundamentalist Turkish newspaper, DUSUNCE, reported that  apart from Selahattin Saygin, the Turkish consul from Antwerp,  Feyha Enc, and the Turkish minister of health, Halil Sivgin,  also appeared at the podium.    Belgium is also used by the "Gray Wolves" for heroin  trafficking. This information has already been published several  times in LE SOIR, but it should again be pointed out that one of  the "Gray Wolves'" most famous activists, Oral Celik, alias  Bedri Ates (borrowed name), was arrested on 10 November 1986 in  Halluin by the French customs authorities, while leaving our  country with 3.6 kg of heroin. Concealed under a false  identity, he has since admitted that he was indeed the extreme  right activist fingered by his fellow terrorist, Ali Agca.    Further evidence of the criminal activity of the "Gray  Wolves" in Belgium was the presence in September 1990 in the  Liege suburbs of Ahmet Esensoy, who was involved in heroin  trafficking and was the right-hand man of Rifat Yildirim, one of  the most famous "Gray Wolves" terrorists. Esensoy, who has  since been apprehended, was in transit. A generally reliable  source says that there are allegedly comings and goings between  Belgium and the Frankfurt "city bazaar," the preferred spot of  the "Gray Wolves."</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Cohse to drop opposition to trusts THE health service union Cohse looks likely to drop its campaign against self-governing hospital trusts, Catherine Milton writes. The move would mean the 200,000-strong union, which represents about 20 per cent of health service staff, accepting the end of centralised collective bargaining in the NHS and concentrating on local deals. It would remain opposed to the principle of trusts. NHS bargaining has traditionally been highly centralised, but the spread of trusts has led to fragmentation. The union believes that centralised bargaining will remain important for setting national minimum rates. Discussions will take place at regional and branch level in the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Arts: Reactions to chaos ARRIVING in Kassel to attend Documenta IX so long after the heavily hyped opening which drove the critics to paroxysms of spleen, what does one find? Patient queues of art-lovers waiting hours for admission to the main exhibition halls, and taking part with passion in debates about the works they see there. More than half a million visitors are expected to have come to Documenta before it closes on September 20. As the self-proclaimed showcase for contemporary art, the exhibition succeeds, and succeeds magnificently. The audience, though required to possess stamina and patience, is never short-changed: the amount of work on offer is huge - 190 artists from more than 30 countries - and the show is undeniably comprehensive. What seems to have bothered the critics so much, and also some of the viewers who have come in their wake, is the refusal of the show to make things easy. There are no pathways around this exhibition, no hierarchies to help with identification of the great and the good: they are here - but they need to be sought out. The sense of confounded expectation which some have expressed about the present show is partly due to the exhibition's historical legacy. Set up after the war on the initiative of art historians Arnold Bode and Werner Haftmann to make amends for the Nazi persecution of progressive art and artists, Documenta was intended to bring to Germany the best art by those leaders of the modern movement whose position was established before the war. As well as a recognition and reconciliation, the first show was also a triumph. That opening exhibition included Picasso, Matisse, Braque, Leger, Max Ernst and more, whose work had already set the style and standard of the other exhibitors, and several of whom continued to be represented in subsequent exhibitions (which are held every four or five years). As the decades advanced and stylistic certainties crumbled, the sense of a great presence, a unifying force, came to be centred in the work and persona of Joseph Beuys, who put his stamp upon the event from Documenta 3 in 1964 until he died the year before Documenta 8 in 1987. That year, there was talk of the exhibition having outlived its usefulness. This year's show has no overwhelming individual presence (if that of guest curator Jan Hoet, from the Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst in Ghent, is discounted). It offers instead a cornucopia of the present, and seems to have recovered enough confidence to carry through into the next decade, despite the Cassandra cries of those who have characterised this year's show as a descent into chaos. It spreads before us the myriad reactions of artists to a world which is indeed in chaos, a globe in which certainties have collapsed and the future in unclear. The desperate need manifested in the piece by Bruce Naumann in which a videotaped head repeats the commands 'Feed me, eat me, anthropology' and 'Help me, hurt me, sociology,' meets no answer. Next door, the three works by Francis Bacon which were selected for the exhibition before his death show how a lifetime's contemplation of the human condition may give no balm. These bleak canvases make plain, as did the late works of Picasso, that we are as driven by need, and as awkward in its satisfaction, at 80 as at 18. To say, as many have, that there are no politics at this Documenta is wrong. There are plenty, but they are as varied as the experiences which have brought about the artistic responses they represent. They are there in the shanty town which Tadashi Kawamata has erected by the banks of the Fulda. They are there in the piano bar built by Vera Frenkel, which is a metaphor for the fragility of human communication and the pain of displacement. They are there in the torture chamber of Mike Kelley and the car crash litter of Cady Noland. They are there because they are inescapable. In a world of individuals, of difference - which this exhibition so forcefully exemplifies - we all have the freedom of choice, to care or not to care. And people do care, very much. That is demonstrated clearly at the open discussion session which Jan Hoet, no faint-heart, holds every day. Here he answers questions and argues with visitors, stating his case, defending the show's determined variety and the responsibility it places on the viewer. This is not popular. The loudest voices in the discussion session I attended were those pleading for beauty, demanding order, upset by the lack of stylistic coherence. When confronted with work about which no line has yet been laid down, the exhibition-goer is forced to be self-reliant. This delights Hoet, who has proclaimed that this Documenta has no heroes. What he means is that this time, the heroes must muck in with the rest. Bacon, for example, is hung next to a series of photopieces by the young French artist Suzanne Lafont which hold up well in their sense of dark unease. There are no hierarchies of form, either. Paintings must struggle against installations, some of which include loud soundtracks as part of the work. Installations, too, compete against each other. Mario Merz, alloted one of the largest spaces (filled with a piece which disappoints in its empty grandiosity) is next to a clangorous bellows by Ulf Rollof and around the corner from one of a series of clever videos by Tony Conrad. Rose Finn Kelcey, one of five British artists, has a choice small space, with one glass wall giving a vista of trees and a high ceiling, on which she has placed, with a wry eye to the spectacular gestures around her, a small familiar structure; this kennel, however, is for a god. Documenta does not lack beauty: those for whom art and beauty are synonymous need not despair - but perhaps they need to be more flexible in their definitions. There is a beautiful video installation by Bill Viola, for example, and a beautiful and thought-provoking installation by Joseph Kosuth in the Neue Galerie. Perhaps most beautiful of all, in an unusual and inspiring way, are the pieces by Marina Abramovic, best known as a performance artist and a regular Documenta exhibitor. This time she is not performing, but showing a series of pieces made from amethyst crystals. One, called 'Inner Sky, for departure' set outside the Documenta Halle, consists of a row of amethyst geodes, cut in half and raised on metal tripods above head height. We are instructed to stand beneath them and to look up. Doing so, one sees, like a vista of infinite space, the perfection of the crystalline forms which the hollow centre of each geode contains. Beauty exists, order is made manifest, both in the natural world and in the continuing struggles of artists to relate to the world we have created and to help us do so: it may take effort, and trust, but the rewards are still there. Documenta IX, Kassel, Germany, until September 20</p>

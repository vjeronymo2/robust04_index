			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Six senior journalists at ATV [Asia Television]  decided yesterday to leave the station, even though the  management capitulated in a row over the screening of a film on  the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.    They had handed in their notice after the management moved  to  prevent the previously unreleased footage of the crackdown being  screened late on Saturday night, almost five years to the hour  since troops began moving against the pro-democracy movement.    After a meeting with senior management yesterday, the six  members of the News and Public Affairs Department said they  would stick to their decision to resign. They agreed to stay on  until their replacements have been hired.    The 40-minute documentary, which features seven minutes of  film taken by a Spanish news team from the Monument to the  People's Heroes in the early hours of June 4, 1989, will go to  air as they had planned. The ATV management originally ordered  the suspension of the film last week, but later suggested that  it could be screened at another time slot. On Tuesday [31 May],  it backed down amid a public outcry over apparent  self-censorship.    The company management yesterday rejected suggestions that  it  had decided to ban the film. Chief executive officer Mark Lee  Po-on and deputy chief executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who  flew from Taiwan to attend the meeting, said that no final  decision on how the documentary should be handled was ever made  before late on Tuesday.    Mr Lee said the final decision then was that the news  division could decide where to place the documentary. He said  ATV chairman Lim Poy-yen was in support of the management's  decision and was well-informed of the incident since it began.    The Governor, Chris Patten, said it was "very sad" for six  senior journalists to resign from ATV. Noting the importance of  a free exchange of ideas, Mr Patten said it was also important  to keep management and editorial functions in any media  organisation separate.    The Hong Kong Journalists' Association also expressed sorrow  at the resignations, saying that they were a result of the lack  of sincerity on the side of the management. The journalists,  all in top positions, said the conflict between their and  management's versions of the incident had made it difficult for  them to stay with the company,    "It has destroyed the basis of mutual trust and  cooperation,"  said acting news controller Poon Fu-yim. "We can see we have no  mutual trust, they are saying one thing and we are saying  another thing. They say their version is correct but we don't  agree," said Poon.    Also resigning were assistant news controller Selina Li  Yuk-lin, executive editor Lo Wing-hung, managing editor Lui  Wan-sang, assignment editor Choy Pui-ying and city editor Lau  Kok-wa.    "We feel our independence, our editorial policy, has been  tampered with that's why we are leaving," Poon said. He said  although a few more staff members might follow suit, most people  in the news division were watching developments calmly.    Speaking at a press conference, Mr Lee rejected any claims  that the management had ever come to a decision that the film  should not be screened. Mr Lee said the journalists had  submitted their resignation on a premature decision that the  film would be screened on One Day programme instead of the  current affairs programme News Magazine.    "We tried to put our suggestion to our colleagues in the  news  division that it would not be appropriate for the film to be  shown in News Magazine, which is a current affairs programme to  update the audience with the latest development of events," Mr  Lee said. "If the film is about events happening in 1989, it is  a documentary," he added.    Mr Lee denied the incident had anything to do with the  independence of ATV's news division. "We place full trust on  our colleagues in the news division. This is just a very, very  unique case."    He said it was because of the very "suspenseful" nature of  the film that special attention had been paid to it by the  management.    "We are all curious about it. It presents a theory different  from what we were told," Mr Lee said.    He denied that Chinese authorities had been informed of the  purchase of the documentary, which tends to support the Chinese  Government's insistence that no one was killed in Tiananmen  Square.    Mr Chang would not explain his views on the documentary.    "News judgment is a very subjective thing," he said.    He rejected a claim that he had stated there was no way the  company would change its mind regardless of any resignations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's indication of a  desire to reshuffle the cabinet at an early period on 14  February has also created a stir in the administration. On the  morning of 14 February, the prime minister told reporters "I  will think about (the cabinet reshuffle) after the formulation  of the fiscal 1994 budget comes to an end." He then went into  his office without confirming or denying the reports on the  reshuffle, and has since continued behind-the-scenes  coordination with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  and other parties. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, contrary to what the prime minister said, expressed a  negative view on an early reshuffle at a news conference. The  issue of the reshuffle inadvertently revealed the differences  between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary.  While the reshuffle, originally planned by the prime minister  for 15 February, has been postponed due to the SDPJ's  opposition, sources close to the prime minister claim that "this  will create serious ill feeling in the cabinet."    At a news conference on the evening of 14 February, Takemura  said "there is no indication at all" that a cabinet reshuffle  "is forthcoming," denying the reports. However, he also stated,  "(Whether or not to reshuffle the cabinet) is the prime  minster's problem. Please ask him directly."    Such a comment at the chief cabinet secretary's news  conference was very unusual. It seems that Takemura's attitude  was due to the fact that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  Komeito's attempt to "remove Takemura" was allegedly behind the  talk of reshuffle, and he was irritated with the fact that the  prime minister had not conveyed his thinking directly.    Meanwhile, the prime minister stayed in his office all day  on  14 February, although he attended a meeting of leaders of the  government and the ruling parties at noon. Queries from  reporters were met with the same reply over and over again: "I  am not thinking about it before the budget is finished."  However, he nodded to the question "are you thinking about a  reshuffle at all?" He even stressed that he was "giving  consideration" to a reshuffle on 15 February, all along taking  an ambiguous attitude in public. The prevailing view among  sources close to the prime minister is that "the prime minister  himself strongly desires to reshuffle the cabinet at an early  period; he has floated a `trial balloon' to see the reaction of  members of the administration and the ruling parties."</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (2): Beginners' bad luck - UK cash-only business loses its shine FACTORING has lost much of its shine over the past 12 months for some of the more recent arrivals. As the established firms were forecasting two or three years ago, it has been the invoice discounting end of the market where most of the problems have arisen. Invoice discounting is attractive to the newcomer because it is a cash-only service and start-up costs are low. It does not require banks of computers and armies of clerks to administer clients' sales ledgers. But precisely because the invoice discounter lacks the same close day-to-day contact with his client as the full-service factor he is more vulnerable. This has led to Schroders, the merchant banking group, shutting down its two-year old subsidiary, Schroder Discount, while Westpac Banking Corp. has closed its invoice discounting operation. But it has not only been the new arrivals which have had to contend with a hostile environment. GT Invoice Factors, a smaller company and a member of the Association of Invoice Factors, had to close when Union Discount Commercial Finance (UDCF), which was undergoing a reorganisation of its own, withdrew its financial backing. GT had what is known as a 'back to back' arrangement with UDCF for it to finance its activities. 'It was not a risk I wanted to take,' said Mr David Pretlove, managing director of UDCF. 'It puts you at one remove from the customer. If anything went wrong it would have been difficult to take action.' The funding arrangement with GT was ended as part of a general overhaul of UDCF's invoice discounting 'book'. UDCF had signed up clients for its invoice discounting service which should have really been taken on on a factoring basis where the controls are tighter, said Mr Pretlove. Some of GT's clients transferred their business to Century, a subsidiary of the Close Brothers banking group, said Mr Leslie Bland, Century's managing director. This formed part of Century's policy of expanding by acquiring portfolios from other factors. Century had earlier acquired Security Pacific Business Finance (Europe) when Security Pacific, the US banking group, decided to concentrate on its core domestic business. Century paid Pounds 662,000 for SecPac Business Finance in July 1991. With expected profits from the company, now renamed SP Business Finance (Europe), of Pounds 400,000 in the first year of ownership, Century expects to recoup its investment in 18 months. Although it has been the invoice discounters which have been particularly exposed to the problems caused by the recession, invoice discounting has remained the most buoyant part of the market. Invoice discounting overtook domestic factoring as the largest area of activity in 1989 and has remained the largest sector ever since. In 1991 it accounted for 59 per cent of the UK factoring market, according to the Association of British Factors and Discounters (ABFD). For companies which manage their exposure carefully, invoice discounting is expected to be the major growth market. Some invoice discounters believe that the invoice discount market will become more distinct from factoring. This is prompted in part by a desire on the part of the invoice discounters to distance themselves from the stigma which still attaches to factoring and in part by the problems some discounters have had with clients they now realise were more suitable for a full factoring service. 'The two markets will become more clearly defined,' said Mr Alan McLaren, managing director of UCB Invoice Discounting, part of the French-owned UCB banking group. The result of this may could well be conflicting pressures within the ABFD, which only two years ago acknowledged the role of the discounters in its title. But in the meantime the large bank-owned factoring organisations continue to provide both full-service factoring and invoice discounting side by side. For the bank-owned factors, which make up the bulk of the industry, the most intriguing question remains: how will their parent banks respond to the ending of the recession? The bank-owned factors have something of a love-hate relationship with their parents. The factors are aware that the banks' financial standing is an important asset to them yet they are conscious that bank managers will retain the best lending propositions for themselves and only refer their less than grade-A clients to their factoring arm. Some of the factors believe the balance of power may be shifting. The large provisions which the banks have had to make on their small business lending may be a sign that advances to the small end of the corporate market are better made through the factor, who has far tighter controls. 'We are seeing much better propositions come to us than we would have done a few years ago,' commented Mr Malcolm Smith, managing director of Alex Lawrie, part of the Lloyds Bank group. In competing with each other, the factors can never forget that their main rival for business is often the bank which owns them. 'I am happy having the bank behind me but I don't want it in front of me as well,' commented one.</p>

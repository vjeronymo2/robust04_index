			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / RAF threatens snub for Westland in Pounds 1bn helicopter order The Royal Air Force is pressing for its fleet of transport helicopters to be updated using only the latest version of the US-made Boeing Chinook, rather than the mixed fleet of Chinooks and Westland EH101 helicopters originally proposed. This is the latest of a series of military procurement decisions that pit off-the-shelf US products against European-developed alternatives. The European Future Large Aircraft is fighting the Lockheed C-130J Hercules for a Pounds 900m RAF order, and the US Apache helicopter is vying with the European Tiger in the Pounds 2bn competition for the British Army's attack helicopter. The RAF will argue for the Chinook when the Pounds 1bn order for up to 40 support helicopters goes to the Ministry of Defence equipment committee next week. However, the army, also represented on the committee, is thought to favour a mixed fleet of helicopters to give versatility. The Chinook can lift 10 tonnes against the EH101's 4.5 tonnes, but the EH101 is smaller and more agile with better night-operating capacity, making it more suitable for some military missions. Westland, the helicopter maker owned by GKN, has been hoping for an order for about 25 EH101s from the RAF. As well as helping to secure thousands of jobs in Yeovil, Somerset, the order would be an important endorsement from the MoD which would help the helicopter's export prospects. At present, Westland is negotiating to sell the anti-submarine version of the EH101 to several Gulf states. The equipment committee will consider the industrial and military issues before making recommendations to the Treasury and MoD ministers. A final decision is expected from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, within three months. The MoD is thought to be concerned about the cost of the EH101 relative to its carrying capacity. It is also worried that several hundred million pounds may have to be spent on development to bring the EH101 up to the required specification. The Chinook, by contrast, would not need any extra development spending. Set against that, the industrial arguments for supporting Westland's bid are strong, and the MoD is thought to be pressing Westland to cut its bid price. If Mr Rifkind opts for a purely Chinook fleet, it will be an indication that he will be prepared to take the political flak that would follow from a series of orders for foreign-made equipment.</p>

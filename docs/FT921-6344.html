			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Thais pass bill after American patent demands THAILAND'S legislative assembly yesterday passed a bill to extend patent coverage to pharmaceuticals, food, drinks, biotechnology and agricultural machinery. The new act largely complies with demands from Washington and should help Thai exports avoid punitive action under 'Special 301' provisions of US trade law. The US trade representative, Mrs Carla Hills, is due to announce a decision in mid-March. This will conclude a year-long investigation into whether Thailand's failure to provide new pharmaceuticals with patents amounts to unfair trading practice. The complaints against Thailand were originally made by US companies. However, last March Washington announced it was initiating its own investigation. Similar investigations against India and China on intellectual property rights were also launched. Critics argue that the law yields too much to the US. They would prefer to see a four-year grace period before pharmaceuticals can be patented. They warn that acquiescence will encourage Washington to raise new issues with Thailand unilaterally instead of working through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But Thai trade officials counter that the law was designed to comply with the draft agreement on intellectual property rights currently on the table in the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks and not with US demands. Their emphasis is on strengthening Gatt rules in order to reduce unilateral pressure from the US. The law gives the government some power to deal with abuse of monopoly power. If after four years the patent holder overcharges or withholds supply, the government can force the patent-holder to issue production licences to competitors. In December, the US trade representative dropped an investigation into copyright infringements in Thailand. Washington said it was satisfied that Bangkok was taking action to clamp down on illicit copying of video and music tapes and computer software. But the US said it would continue to watch the situation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Jose Gallardo appeared before the  Congressional Oversight Committee upon a request from Deputy  Ricardo Novoa to report on the death of policemen and soldiers  along the Putumayo River on 16 December 1993 and to explain why  policemen, who are tasked with domestic security operations,  were patrolling that area. The minister said they were on a  joint Army-Police control operation.    [Begin Gallardo recording] They go upstream and downstream  patrolling the Putumayo and San Miguel Rivers. They conduct  control operations along the river banks and on vessels  navigating the river in an attempt to control and detect drug  trafficking activities. [end recording].    The minister confirmed that such activities have been going  on for years, and that is why the joint patrols were deployed.  The objective is to prevent drug trafficking and guerrilla  activities in the northern part of the country, particularly  along the Colombian border. The defense minister reaffirmed  that the Colombians being held by authorities are the guerrillas  who killed the Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers. The guerrillas  were found in possession of weapons and jewelry that had  belonged to the policemen.    [Begin Gallardo recording] One guerrilla said: My  grandfather gave it to me. We went to the grandfather's house  and asked him if he had given the guerrilla the watch ten years  ago. He said no. Then the guerrilla said he bought it at  another place. We went there and he had not bought the watch  there, either. The watch belonged to one of the slain men. You  must understand that guerrillas do not parade around with  weapons and signs saying: I am a guerrilla. They hide their  weapons immediately. They wear the clothes of common peasants.  Their appearance is completely misleading. [end recording]    The minister said they look like innocent peasants, but they  are really guerrillas who operate in the northern part of the  country and who are guilty of killing Ecuadoran policemen and  soldiers.</p>

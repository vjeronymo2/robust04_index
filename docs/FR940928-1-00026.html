The NPRM proposed changing the provisions in 49 CFR Part 215, by making all maintenance-of-way vehicles subject to the Standards with the exception of stenciled cars not used in revenue service and restricted to a speed of less than 20 miles per hour. The extension is necessary to clarify initial comments received from interested parties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received no later than November 28, 1994.

The Freight Car Safety Standards, at 49 CFR 215.3(c)(3), exclude maintenance-of-way equipment from the requirements of Part 215, ``if that equipment is not used in revenue service and is stenciled in accordance with &sect;215.305.'' The proposed amendment would add to the present regulation an additional condition which must be met before a freight car in maintenance-of-way service can be operated without complying with the Freight Car Safety Standards: the equipment must be operated at a speed of less than 20 mph. FRA has received comments from the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees; The American Short Line Railroad Association; the Brotherhood Railway Carmen Division, Transportation Communication International Union; the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway Company; and the Association of American Railroads (AAR). In light of comments received, particularly from the AAR, FRA is preparing a request for clarification on some issues presented in the AAR's comments. FRA's written request as well as any written response will be included in the docket and made available for review. Based on the comments received, FRA believes it would be beneficial to extend the comment period, so that all interested parties will have ample opportunity to comment. For these reasons, FRA has determined that an extension to November 28, 1994, is appropriate. In addition, FRA has not received any requests, formal or informal, for a hearing on this matter; therefore a hearing will not be scheduled. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald M.

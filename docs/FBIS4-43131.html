			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EU Commission President Jacques Delors by </F> Guenter Schmidt in Brussels on 12 June -- recorded; Delors  statements in French with superimposed German translation]    [Text] [Schmidt] Mr. President, a great majority of  Austrians has voted in favor of the EU [European Union] entry.  What does this overwhelming Austrian support mean for Europe?    [Delors] Well, first of all I would like to welcome our  Austrian friends, regardless of how they voted in the  referendum. I would like to say that this overwhelming support  for Europe is most encouraging for our project. Austria is a  people of free citizens who have witnessed how Europe has been  built, with all the advantages and disadvantages, all nice and  not so nice sides. These people have finally decided to join  us. This has an impact that goes even beyond the decision of  the Austrian people in favor of Europe.    [Schmidt] Some have said that enlargement would obstruct or  slow down the further deepening of European integration. Do you  share this view?    [Delors] The thing is that we do not have a choice. You  will certainly remember that those who started this European  adventure were pursuing two main objectives. First of all,  there should never again be war between us. Second, they wanted  to strengthen the peace values, the values of mutual  understanding between the people through cooperation. Unity  makes you strong. So how could we limit ourselves to 12  European states, how could we be against other countries joining  us, especially a country like Austria, considering that Vienna  has always been one of the major cultural capitals of Europe, a  city that was host to great historic events so important for our  continent. The message to our generation now is: You must  extend the values of peace and mutual understanding. And  Austria can contribute to this process. Located in the center  of Europe, it is the ideal link between West and East. For all  those reasons there was no other choice. We had to discuss  Austria's membership application. We will have to see how we  can reconcile enlargement with a capacity of deepening that  reflects our ideas and desires.    [Schmidt] You have said that Austria was in the center of  Europe and that it is a bridge between East and West. You also  mentioned that the future of the European Union would also mean  securing peace in East Europe. In this connection, do you  perceive any special role Austria might play as a bridge, as a  mediator?    [Delors] As a result of the friendly relations that I have  with the Austrian chancellor and the numerous talks I conducted  with the foreign minister, I have realized how sensitive and  receptive your country is to everything that is going on in  Europe, and how much it knows about the things that might  threaten the stability of our continent today and tomorrow: the  rejection of the other -- which is the case in the tragedy in  Yugoslavia, ethnic groups that regard themselves as nations, the  religious wars, racism, populism. Austria is really in a good  situation to know all those things. I do not have to recall how  much Chancellor Kreisky fought for major issues that went beyond  Austria. Austria is a great nation, it will make its  contribution to Europe, and, nevertheless, remain Austria with  its unmistakable personality.    [Schmidt] Mr. President, looking into the future, one can  see one major economic and social problem -- unemployment. You  have suggested an initiative for more growth and the struggle  against unemployment. It looks now as if this initiative would  be further delayed before concrete steps are taken. What can be  done, what ought to be done to implement this program more  rapidly?    [Delors] Since the summit of heads of state and government  adopted my proposals contained in the white book, we have done a  lot of work. The next European Council will be held in two  weeks time in Corfu under Greek chairmanship. There we will  have to take further steps. What can prevent us from taking  those steps? Well, shortsightedness might be an obstacle, the  fact that actions are taken shortsightedly, that people might  say: Well, now that we have the first signs of economic growth  again we might as well let things stand where they are. But  this is wrong. All countries of Europe now have to come to  terms with three major changes: A change of the international  economy with the emergence of new competitors -- the East Asian  countries and, in the future, also China; then a technological  change that we have to get under control -- from economic but  also social aspects; the new technologies -- these are ethical  problems but also problems of organization for society; and a  change in the values of our society.    The advantage of the white paper is that it opened the  windows to the medium-term sphere, that it initiated a debate.  If one follows the guidelines of the white paper then one can  hope that unemployment will decrease by half at the end of the  century. I deliberately said at the end of the century. This  means that these efforts will take another five or six years.  Still, the possibilities are there, and the Commission must now  try to convince the governments and public opinions of the need  to tackle the changes. Otherwise, Europe would be overtaken by  history, and, for the first time in Europe, be marginalized --  and all this after we have contributed so much to history. For  us this is a question of survival.    [Schmidt] Mr. President, 10 years ago you brought a new  vision to Europe, the vision of the single market. This vision  of a Europe without borders has become reality. What is your  new vision today for the future of this continent and the EU, in  particular?    [Delors] As I said before, I think that we have to make sure  that in this European continent, which will soon have a  population of 500 million, the values of peace and mutual  understanding will prevail, that our methods remain valid, and  that we will continue to have cooperation, the exchange of  people, of ideas, town partnerships, economic cooperation and, I  hope, political cooperation in the near future. These are  imperatives. If we fail to put them into practice, then the  postcommunist era, the post-Cold War era will become an era  characterized by conflicts that we are unable to settle. Then  all the negative things will come to the surface -- racism,  populism, the rejection of the other, inaccessibility,  intolerance. We must together turn this Europe of 500 million  citizens into an example for peace. At the same time, we also  must not forget that some of us are seeking a political Europe.  This means that we would like sovereign states to join forces  and take actions in the world together, to protect our  interests, and to serve our ideals. This will probably make it  necessary to strengthen and change the institutions in 1996.  You have just asked me how one could make enlargement and  deepening compatible. The question will still have to be  answered. Yet, it would be bad to say that we can only have one  or the other, when we have to achieve both objectives.    Will there be one or two Europes in the future, a large  Europe in the way I have just described, or maybe even a smaller  group of countries that are moving toward political union? This  is possible. Yet, I am against saying enlargement or deepening  when we need both. After all, for me 1989 was the most important  date I have experienced apart from the war. Communism collapsed  and we must now be generous toward those who lived under the  communist yoke before, and we must be ready to accept them into  our community.    [Schmidt] Mr. President, thank you very much for the  interview.</p>

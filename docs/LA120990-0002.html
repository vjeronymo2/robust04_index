			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMER, SWEET HOMER;  </P> <P> THE ILIAD;  </P> <P> TRANSLATED BY ROBERT FAGLES INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY BERNARD KNOX (VIKING:  $35; 683 PP.);  </P> <P> THE ODYSSEY OF HOMER;  </P> <P> A NEW VERSE TRANSLATION TRANSLATED BY ALLEN MANDELBAUM WITH 12 ENGRAVINGS BY  MARIALUISA DE ROMANS (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $35; 526 PP.)  </P> <P> If you were lucky enough to be introduced to Homer in your youth without any of  the trappings of scholarship or the tempting snares of translation theory, you  know that the whole point about Homer is that he is a terrific storyteller who  has a couple of terrific stories to tell. Once you've read them -- or, better  yet, had them read to you -- you have, whether you realize it or not, a  standard against which to measure what you will probably be taught later to  call "narrative" and "character" and "descriptive action." And if you are so  rash as to attempt writing your own stories, you will almost certainly find  yourself from time to time suffering a degree of depression.  </P> <P> Luckily, you can console yourself by reflecting that you are not, after all,  able to take advantage of the far-seeing aid of some powerful divine figures  who prove to be as devious and self-serving a bunch as any latter-day crew of  con artists.  </P> <P> No matter what your age is on first reading, the chances are you will not be  too greatly concerned over whether one voice or many lie behind the stories,  but you will probably feel something of the differences between the swinging  action of the siege of Troy, with all its direct confrontations and bloody  encounters, and the wily quality of Odysseus as he takes the longest possible  way home.  </P> <P> It was this seeming contradiction that led Samuel ("Way of All Flesh") Butler  to put forward his characteristically cranky theory that whereas "The Iliad"  was clearly an active, masculine tale, "The Odyssey," on the other hand, could  have been written only by a clever, brilliant woman, laughing at all the brawny  stupid males boasting of their powerful biceps. For Odysseus -- "the man of  many wiles," as Mandelbaum chooses to translate his formulaic description --  relies more on his brains than his brawn, and though he does his best to look  after his impetuous men, he alone wins home in the end.  </P> <P> With so many translations in both prose and verse available by now, the chief  interests, particularly in verse translations, are the choices the translator  has made in undertaking what is, after all, a tremendous, daunting task. So far  as the enormous accretion of scholarship is concerned, with the endless debates  concerning the unity of voice, the influence of the oral tradition, the  patterning of fairly constricting formulas, Bernard Knox's introduction to "The  Iliad" summarizes both the history and the shifts in scholarly assumptions with  an even hand. He concludes with a persuasive presentation of Achilles as "the  model for the tragic hero of the Sophoclean stage."  </P> <P> For his handling of Homer's metrics, Fagles has worked with "a loose five- or  six-beat line but inclining more to six" that he expands "at times to seven  beats -- to imply the big reach of a simile or some vehement outburst in  discourse or the pitched fury of combat on the field." Sometimes he contracts  this "to three, to give a point in speech or action sharper stress." The result  is a heightened conversational tone than can rise to the rhetoric of:  </P> <P>  Three times the brilliant runner  </P> <P> Achilles charged him,  </P> <P>  lunged with his bronze spear,  </P> <P> three times he slashed at cloud --  </P> <P>  then at Achilles' fourth assault like  </P> <P> something superhuman  </P> <P>  his terrifying voice burst out in  </P> <P> winging words:  </P> <P>  "Now, again, you've escaped your  </P> <P> death, you dog,  </P> <P>  but a good close brush with death  </P> <P> it was, I'd say!"  </P> <P>  . . . through the conversational level of Helen's speech:  </P> <P> Homer, Sweet Homer  </P> <P>  "That's Laertes' son, the great  </P> <P> tactician Odysseus.  </P> <P>  He was bred in the land of Ithaca.  </P> <P> Rocky ground  </P> <P>  and he's quick at every treachery  </P> <P> under the sun --  </P> <P>  the man of twists and turns."  </P> <P> </P> <P> . . . to the entertainingly prosy:  </P> <P>  Seeing his anger flare, field  </P> <P> marshal Agamemnon  </P> <P>  smiled broadly and took back his  </P> <P> taunts at once . . .  </P> <P>  Mandelbaum takes up the traditional problems of Homeric scholarship in an  afterword, acknowledging his debt to the landmark six-volume edition of "The  Odyssey" published by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, remarking wryly: "Translation  exacts and invites much micro-labor, many days in the burrows. (Though the  frequency of controversy in questions Homeric often makes the burrows seem like  trenches.)" The conflict between the Dismemberers and the Unitarians continues,  and Mandelbaum is entertaining on "the wens, warts, and blebs on the body of  scholarly controversy."  </P> <P> For this translation itself, Mandelbaum has chosen to work within a quite  different pattern from Fagles', using what appears to be a more traditionally  English line, a freely handled iambic pentameter, but one that is underpinned  by the basic four-stress rhythm, frequently accompanied by the alliterative  echoes, of Anglo-Saxon verse. It is reminiscent of Pound's "making new" of a  part of Book XI of "The Odyssey" in "Canto I."  </P> <P> Mandelbaum stakes out his ground in the opening passages of Book I with an  occasional line that actually goes beyond the original model. We have, for  example:  </P> <P>  -- he still could not depend  </P> <P>  upon fair fortune or unfailing  </P> <P> friends.  </P> <P>  At the same time, Mandelbaum lets us know that even though he will make no  effort to improve upon such set phrases as "the winedark sea," he is willing to  risk using a word like "brouhaha" twice within a few pages:  </P> <P>  . . . lest his guest,  </P> <P>  in all that brouhaha, might look  </P> <P> askance  </P> <P>  at feasting with such overbearing  </P> <P> men --  </P> <P> And:  </P> <P>  Feast with pleasure  </P> <P>  for now, but let there be no  </P> <P> brouhaha.  </P> <P>  The variety that is available in this pattern can be illustrated by leaping  forward to the end of Book XX, when one of Penelope's suitors scornfully speaks  to her son:  </P> <P>  "No man is more unfortunate  </P> <P> than you,  </P> <P>  Telemachus, in picking guests.  </P> <P> Witness:  </P> <P>  You found this filthy vagabond,  </P> <P> a man  </P> <P>  who scrounges bread and wine,  </P> <P> who is unfit  </P> <P>  for work or war, a deadweight  </P> <P> on this earth;  </P> <P>  and then that other fellow, who  </P> <P> got up  </P> <P>  to prophesy . . ."  </P> <P>  Both of these translations pass the ultimate test of being read aloud, though  each produces its own distinct impression. Anyone caring to add an additional  dimension should try sounding out the original -- the Greek alphabet is, after  all, easily learned, as witness the elementary requirement of fraternal and  sororal membership -- with the literal prose translation of what Uncle Ez  called the Low Ebb Classics in hand.  </P></p>

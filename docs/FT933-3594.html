			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies It looks as though 1993 will go down in exchange market history as another year in which the pundits got the dollar badly wrong. Far from appreciating as the US economy recovered, the dollar looks distinctly sick on the basis of a weak recovery and extraordinarily low inflation. In Europe, the Bundesbank has cut rates more slowly than many expected and is under even less pressure to do so now that the ERM has moved to 15 per cent bands. Last week's cut of just 10 basis points in the money market repurchase rate is a reminder that it is keen to see policy relatively restrictive and the D-Mark strong. The result is that the transatlantic interest rate differential has failed to narrow as much as had been assumed at the start of the year. Now, with US equities looking expensive and bonds at record low yields, there is not much to attract international money into the dollar - hence the growing sense that it has room to weaken further. This will not help economic recovery in Europe, where currencies as a whole have tended to be overvalued against the dollar. The policy response will be interesting to watch. It is difficult to be sure how far the D-mark's present strength is a function of the dollar and how far it reflects purchases by central banks obliged to repay intervention. A pronounced fall in the dollar might just provoke the Bundesbank into larger interest rate cuts designed to offset the implicit monetary tightening. That would let France and other ERM countries off the hook. It is more likely, though, that they will still have to undercut German rates interest eventually. The hope would be that an inflow of foreign funds into their bond markets would provide the wherewithal to repay the intervention debt.</p>

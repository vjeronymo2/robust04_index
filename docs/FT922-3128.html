			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / People: Trading places with LDC debt if not necessarily cosy - world, it should be no surprise that Paul Luke, formerly economic adviser at Chartered WestLB, has turned up at Morgan Grenfell working for Rick Haller. The two know each other from consortium bank Libra. The puzzle is rather that Luke did not come earlier. For when Libra was wound up in 1990, most of its LDC debt-trading operation, under Haller, moved to Morgan Grenfell. Luke, however, considered joining Morgan 'the easy option' and decided to 'sever the umbilical cord', moving to the Standard Chartered/WestLB joint venture. There he fitted into another team which had left Libra in 1987. Two years after Libra's demise, Luke becomes a director and head of research and investment strategy at Morgan Grenfell Debt Arbitrage and Trading (MGDAT). Although Chartered WestLB has not failed to make its mark in the LDC field, MGDAT has done a lot better - contributing healthy profits last year in contrast to some of Morgan Grenfell's more traditional parts. MGDAT is now ranked fourth in the world after three big American banks. Its turnover for the first five months of 1992 was more than Dollars 22bn, compared with Dollars 15.9bn for the whole of 1991 at Chartered WestLB, says Luke. As a 'self-confessed professional Welshman', Luke expects his old employer to be concerned principally that it has lost the captain of its newly formed rugby team, the Chartered WestLBeasts. Chartered WestLB's new economic adviser is Peter West, who joins from the United Nations Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean after a varied career specialising in Latin America. 'He has on-the-ground experience which Paul did not,' says managing director Peter Sargeant.</p>

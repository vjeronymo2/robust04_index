			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (7): Barriers to foreign investors still in place - The Bond Market THE liberalisation of Korea's financial markets is taking a long time to reach the domestic bond market. Under the blue-print for economic reform published in June, foreigners will be granted partial access to the bond market from next year. But they will not be able to invest directly in most domestic corporate bonds until after the current five-year plan. Even then, a limit is likely to be set on the total amount of bonds available to foreigners. However, Korea's high interest rates mean foreign investors are likely to be keen to take advantage of the limited access they will be granted, particularly if real interest rates in the US, Europe and Japan remain meagre. Under the second stage of the current plan, foreigners will be allowed to invest directly in equity-linked bonds issued by small and medium-sized companies next year. In 1995 they will be able to buy domestic bonds through investment trust-type vehicles. Under the third stage, they will be authorised to invest directly in bonds issued by small and medium-sized companies in 1997. However, some analysts are cynical about how much foreign interest will be generated in smaller companies, which are unfamiliar and weaker credits. It is the large Korean companies, many of which are now seeking credit ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, which are likely to be in strong demand. One reason the government been slow in opening the corporate bond market, says Buhmsoo Choi, a fellow of the Korea Development Institute, which advises the government, is that 'we don't need a big amount of foreign capital . . . Our savings ratio and investment rates are very high'. Korean companies themselves are more interested in borrowing abroad, where rates are much lower, than in the development of the domestic market, where corporate rates are currently about 13 per cent. There are also those opposed to liberalisation of domestic interest rates - some companies pay favourable regulated rates. However, the admission of foreign investors and the creation of a more liquid market, including some longer-dated bonds, would be likely eventually to reduce the rates. The government is held back by macro-economic concerns. 'There is a 10 per cent differential between domestic and foreign rates,' says Mr Choi. The big fear is that a large inflow of money into the Korean economy could fan inflation, currently at 5 to 6 per cent. With inflation at this level, real interest rates, at about 7 per cent, are high and would therefore be extremely attractive to foreign investors. 'If we just opened up the market, it would cause a lot of disturbance,' said Chang-Yull Lim, assistant minister of the ministry of finance. 'The first job is to narrow the interest rate differential'. He believes this will happen as domestic interest rates are liberalised. Moreover, if the world economy picks up, interest rates elsewhere could start to edge up again. Korea has a history of chronic inflation, fuelled by monetary expansion in the 1980s, when the government provided low-cost funds to parts of domestic industry. The fear of inflation is the main reason behind the government's so-called 'step-by-step' approach. In fact, Mr Choi says the plan is to have raised the limit on foreign ownership of stocks to 25 per cent before opening the bond market further. Further ahead are plans to develop the government bond market. 'We are thinking of developing long-term bonds,' said Mr Lim. The Won35,000bn government bond market is highly illiquid. Much of the paper was issued at below market rates and so is not traded. Most of the paper has a one-year maturity, with some three-year bonds and some illiquid 10-year paper. But the government plans to create a liquid yield curve, with bonds at five, seven and 10 years. 'In order to issue more bonds, the government will have to respect market rates,' said Mr Choi. Korea already has an active domestic corporate bond market, but most of the bonds are issued with a three-year maturity. Here too, the plan is to develop a yield curve. In spite of being held back by restrictions, the Korean debt market has grown rapidly, with corporate bond issuance reaching Won11,155bn in 1992, from just Won963bn in 1980. The proportion of debt (including government, municipal and corporate bonds) relative to gross national product has risen to nearly 20 per cent, compared with 6.9 per cent in 1980, according to the Securities Supervisory Board. As the amount of outstanding listed bonds has grown (from Won2,500bn in 1980 to Won65,000bn in 1992), turnover in the secondary market has also increased, from Won2,400bn in 1980 to Won45,800bn in 1992. While bonds are listed on the Korea Stock Exchange, most trading takes place in the over-the-counter market. This has been a progressive trend - OTC trading accounted for over 98 per cent of total trading volume in 1992 compared with only 46.3 per cent in 1987, according to Lucky Securities. In spite of the growth of the market, it remains illiquid and bound by regulations. Nevertheless, foreign investors hungry for yield, would jump at the chance to buy top Korean corporate bonds paying 13 per cent which, with relatively low inflation, would compensate them for any foreign exchange risk. But the government is loathe to open the market until the differential with other markets - the source of attraction for foreign investors - has been reduced.  -------------------------------------------------------                OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF BONDS        (as of end of June 1993 in trillions of won)  ------------------------------------------------------- Type                   Outstanding balance   Composition National bonds                        15.7        15.68% Monetary stabilisation bonds          15.6        15.58 Bank bonds                              28        27.97% Corporate bonds                       32.7        32.67% Others                                 8.1         8.09%  ------------------------------------------------------- Total                                100.1       100.00%  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Korea Development Securities  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

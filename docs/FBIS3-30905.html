Let us hear what Vuk Draskovic stated to  POLITIKA Television after the meeting with President Milosevic:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] You were with  President Milosevic. Can you tell us what you discussed?    [Draskovic] We discussed the reasons for the delay in the  formation of the parliament, which is a peculiar form of  obstruction. I informed the president of the fact that this  obstruction cannot be overcome without a political agreement.  To the president's words that he favored a government of  national unity, I replied that, regarding the SPO and DEPOS  [Democratic Movement of Serbia], we want more than that;  national unity. However, in this, the SPO, naturally, wishes to  carry some of the responsibility for the atmosphere in the  parliamentary life of the country -- Serbia and the federal  state. Regarding government, we do not wish to take part in any  government, be it republican or federal, and this was my stance.  [end recording]</p>

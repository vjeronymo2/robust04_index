			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Document issued by the National Peasant Christian </F> Democratic Party on 13 June; place not given: "Procedure To  Suspend President Ion Iliescu -- Initiated on 13 June in View of  Gathering 167 Signatures of Romanian Parliamentarians"]    [Text] To the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies; to the  Speaker of the Senate:    The undersigned deputies and senators, on the basis of  Article 95 of Romania's Constitution, request that you commence  the procedure to suspend Romanian President Ion Iliescu from  office. The reasons we believe Mr. Ion Iliescu should be  suspended from office are as follows:    De facto:    During a recent visit to the town of Satu Mare, President  Ion  Iliescu made public statements concerning the issue of  nationalized dwellings. President Ion Iliescu asserted that,  through the court rulings that admitted the claims of the people  whose dwellings had been nationalized -- to the effect that  their properties have been restored and the tenants have been  evacuated -- "justice has outlawed itself."    President Ion Iliescu displayed revolt against the rapidity  with which certain courts ruled in favor of the owners in such  litigations, adding that the courts should wait until the new  bill [on the legal status of nationalized dwellings] is passed  by Parliament and promulgated. At the same time, President Ion  Iliescu also asserted that such court rulings should not be  carried out.    De jure:    The statements made by President Ion Iliescu are extremely  grave because they flagrantly violate several stipulations of  the Constitution and a number of laws that ensure the proper  functioning of the law-governed state. These stipulations are  the following:    1. Article 41 and 42 of Romania's Constitution refers to the  right to private property and the right to inherit such property.    2. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees free access to  justice.    3. Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, cumulated  with Article 21, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, stipulates  that no law may obstruct the right to address justice, in which  case President Ion Iliescu situated himself above the law.    4. Article 3 of the Civil Code, which terms as culpable all  judges who deny restoring justice by refusing to administer  justice, claiming that the law does not stipulate anything, or  it is blurred, or insufficient.    5. Article 123, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution and Article  3 of Law No. 92/1992 on the Organization of Justice Courts  stipulates that judges are independent and are to submit solely  to law.    6. Article 127, Paragraph 1 of the Penal Code, which  punishes the infraction of not submitting to justice court  rulings, with the application of Article 25 of the Penal Code,  which defines the way in which instigators participate, and  Article 27 of the Penal Code, which stipulates that instigators  are to be punished according to the law to the extent of real  culprits.    The significance of the president's deeds:    1. Article 95, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution stipulates  that the Romanian president may be ordered solely if his deeds  are of a grave nature.    The public statements made by President Ion Iliescu are of  such a nature, as we will prove further. By his statements,  President Ion Iliescu:    1. Disregarded two fundamental rights stipulated and  guaranteed by the Constitution: The right to private property  (Article 41) and the right to inherit such property (Article  42), as well as regulations of the Civil Code stipulating the  methods in which those rights can be exerted.    2. Disregarded the citizens' right to free access to  justice, as stipulated in Article 21 of the Constitution.    3. By asserting that justice has outlawed itself, he  situated himself above the law, which is prohibited by Article  16, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution.    4. By making the aforementioned assertion, he impeded upon  the independence of the judges, which is guaranteed by Article  123, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution and by Article 3 of Law No.  92/1992 on the Organization of the Justice Courts, despite the  fact that Article 3 of the Civil Code terms as culpable all  judges who deny restoring justice by refusing to administer  justice in the cases assigned to them, claiming that the law  does not stipulate anything, or it is blurred, or insufficient.    The aforementioned assertions of President Ion Iliescu are  able to negatively influence the proper functioning of courts  and they are an attempt to intimidate and influence the judges.    5. By asserting that such court rulings should not be  carried out, President Ion Iliescu called for the court rulings  to be disregarded, which is an infraction according to Article  25 cumulated with Article 271 of the Penal Code, in which case  Article 27 of the Penal Code is to be applied.    6. President Ion Iliescu's assertions are of an extreme  concern because they contradict fundamental constitutional  values, as well as the essential attributions of one of the  three principal state authorities. Such assertions made by the  head of the state endanger the proper functioning of the  law-governed state and they represent a dictatorial act and an  attempt upon the independence of the judges.    Thus, President Ion Iliescu has also violated Article 1,  Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Romania  is a law-governed, democratic, and social state, in which the  rights and liberties of the citizens are supreme values, which  are guaranteed.    Therefore the continuation of the office of President Ion  Iliescu represents a grave danger for the strengthening of the  law-governed state and for Romania's democratic evolution.

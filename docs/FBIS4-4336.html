			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk] </F>   [Text] A Russian diplomat in Washington said on 30 March  that if North Korea is found to have a nuclear weapon, the  Russian Government will not help North Korea militarily even if  a Western country, such as the United States, were to take  military action, such as preventive bombing, against North Korea  regardless of UN agreement.    The Russian diplomat, who requested anonymity, said this in  an interview with CHUNGANG ILBO that day. He made it clear that  if North Korean development of nuclear weapons is confirmed,  Russia will not give assistance to North Korea even if North  Korea is attacked militarily because such an attack on North  Korea will not fall under the provisions of the military  alliance treaty signed between North Korea and the former Soviet  Union in 1961.    The Russian diplomat explained that although the military  alliance treaty the former Soviet Union signed with North Korea  is still valid with Russia's succession to the Soviet Union,  Russia is not required to provide military assistance to North  Korea when North Korea provokes a war ahead of the other side.  Thus, Russia will regard confirmation that North Korea has  developed nuclear weapons as provocation by North Korea, he said.</p>

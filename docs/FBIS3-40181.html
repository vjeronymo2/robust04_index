Liu Xilin [0491 1585 2651], Standing Committee member of  the provincial CPC committee and deputy governor, and Wang Guofa  [3769 0948 4099], deputy governor, attended and spoke at the  conference. Other responsible persons of various city  (prefecture) governments and relevant departments at the  provincial level also attended the conference.    After conscientiously analyzing the new situation facing the  grain procurement work of 1994, participants at the conference  set forth a general demand for doing a good job in the grain  procurement work of 1994. That is to adhere to the open and  flexible principle, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control, pay equal consideration to the interests of the state,  enterprises, and farmers, and pushing the provincial economy to  develop still further. The general policy is to subsidize the  quota procurement price, set a protective price for market  transactions, further display the state's support for  agriculture, and make farmers the real beneficiaries.  Participants also demanded strict compliance of contracts and  policies and urged greater efforts to strive to fulfill the  grain procurement tasks by the end of December.    To do a good job in the grain procurement task in 1994, the  conference clarified the following policy-related issues:    On the issue of quota grain procurement. First we should  strictly enforce the grain quota assigned after the provincial  government implemented the policy of "steady procurement and  relaxed sale" and insist that farmers deliver the exact amount  and type of grain specified in their contract to ensure the  fulfillment of state-assigned procurement task. Second, we  should continue to implement the policy of disaster reduction  and exemption. Those who really need the exemption and reduction  may be reported by the city or county government to the  provincial government for approval in the later period of grain  procurement. Third, we should implement the policy of  subsidizing quota procurement prices. The State Council  originally decided to distribute the benefits of linking  chemical fertilizer and diesel in the form of price subsidies.  Later, it changed to distributing such benefits mostly in the  form of goods and some as price subsidies. Jilin Province has  distributed some of the benefits to farmers in the form of goods  and some as price subsidies. For instance, for 500 gram of  standard corn, the state pays 0.198 yuan and Jilin Province pays  0.03 yuan in subsidy, so the enforcing price for the quota  procurement of standard corn is 0.228 yuan. For another  instance, state price for 500 gram of standard rice is 0.351  yuan and the provincial subsidy is 0.023 yuan, so the enforcing  price for the quota procurement of standard rice is 0.374 yuan.  Fourth, we should adhere to the quota grain quality and variety  policies. In other words, all localities should strictly enforce  the quality standard for contracts on delivery of third-grade  and above corn and rice. In quota procurement, the two major  categories of rice and corn cannot be replaced for one another.  In the delivery of quota grain, water content is not limited.    On the issue of special reserve grain procurement. The  policy  and quantity of special reserve grain have not been determined  by the state. Arrangement will be made after the state makes a  decision.    On the issue of free market grain procurement. The general  principle for dealing with free market grain in Jilin Province  is to place no restriction on the variety of grain, encourage  multi-channel operation, and allow prices to float with the  market. In the meantime, we should strengthen the macroeconomic  regulation and control by the government and establish a  protective price system to prevent great fluctuation of market  price and protect farmers from low prices of grain. Concrete  requriements are: 1) The province sets a minimum protective  price, 0.21 yuan for 500 gram of standard corn and 0.31 yuan for  rice. 2) A guidance plan for procuring a total of 5.8 billion kg  of market corn should be transmitted to lower levels to satisfy  market and export needs. 3) All localities should vigorously  guide farmers in selling market grain to protect farmers'  interest from being adversely affected by funds and market  nearing the end of this year and the beginning of another year.    On the issue of grain procurement funds and account  settlement. The general demand is that funds must be provided  during contract procurement, special reserve, and market grain  and oil transactions. Giving farmers "I owe you" is absolutely  forbidden. All departments concerned must ensure timely and  sufficient supply of funds according to the fund raising task  assigned to them. When settling accounts, we must insist  settling with each and every household after delivery and  resolutely stop the practice of "general estimation." Grain  departments are not allowed to deduct any charges except for the  amount of purchase contract deposit and agricultural taxes.    On the issue of grain market management. The general  principle is to adhere to opening up and revitalizing, to  strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, to ensure that  the market is open but orderly and well managed but not stifled,  to unclog circulation, and to accelerate production. Before the  corn procurement task of a city or county is fulfilled,  individuals and units other than grain departments are forbidden  temporarily from purchasing corn. Market for other varieties of  grain is open during the period of grain procurement.</p>

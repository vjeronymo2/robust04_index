			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report NICKEL prices followed through from Friday's downturn at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. The three months delivery price added Dollars 65 to the Dollars 17 pre-weekend fall to reach Dollars 5,967.50 a tonne following talk early in the day of Chinese selling. The COPPER market was in retreat following last week's rally and the three months price closed Pounds 11.75 lower at Pounds 1,534.50 a tonne. Dealers said the New York-inspired rise ran out of steam as the market's high stocks and poor demand growth rates outside North America reasserted themselves. Japanese selling started the downturn, they added, and as buyers backed off the market became thin. The GOLD price moved slightly higher in late afternoon as the market continued to watch Russia for signs of a developing political crisis. At the London bullion market close the price was 90 cents up from Friday at Dollars 328.65 a troy ounce. PLATINUM was also assisted by the Russian situation and the London price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 325.25 an ounce, up Dollars 1. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Interest rates sap building society funds Total retail funds in building societies fell last month for only the second time in the societies' history, reflecting increased competition for savings at a time of low interest rates. Figures for November released by the Building Societies' Association yesterday show that there was a net outflow of funds from societies of Pounds 400m. This represents the largest monthly fall since September 1986, when savers withdrew money to invest in the TSB flotation. In previous months the falls in retail deposits have been more than offset by the amount of interest credited to accounts, but last month only some Pounds 262m of interest was credited. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said no permanent damage had been done to societies in spite of months of severe competition, particularly from banks, both for mortgage lending and for personal savings. He attributed the outflow of funds to a combination of low interest rates, competition from the government through national savings products, and the attractions of investing in the stock market, but said that the sector was still 'resilient'. On mortgage lending there were some signs that the societies might be beginning to regain market share from the banks, with net advances of principal at Pounds 880m, which was the second successive monthly rise. Net new commitments were Pounds 2.78bn in November, also higher than in October, when they were Pounds 2.54bn. Monthly figures issued by the British Bankers' Association showed banks' net mortgage lending at Pounds 861m in November, while their personal deposits were down by Pounds 134m. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the BSA, said that the scale of savings withdrawals was surprising, but that it might reflect 'distortions associated with the Budget and a larger than normal depletion of savings in the run-up to Christmas'. Mr Coles added that the BSA did not suggest that there would be a shortage of mortgages when the housing market recovered. Societies still had access to funding on the wholesale markets, and few were close to the regulatory limits on this type of funding. He argued also that a housing recovery tended to generate its own funds as, for example, people were more easily able to sell property they had inherited. The last time the amount of retail savings in societies had fallen against the previous month was, he added, in November 1990, when savers withdrew money to invest in the privatisation of the regional electricity companies. Societies are likely to show an increase in retail savings over the fourth quarter of the year, as even if there are further withdrawals, December is a month when large amounts of interest are credited.</p>

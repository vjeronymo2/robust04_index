			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: JACOR CHIEF DEFENDS FIRM'S BID FOR MAXWELL  LABORATORIES  </P> <P> JAYCOR President James Young on Monday described the privately held defense  contractor's unsuccessful $17-a-share bid for Maxwell Laboratories as  "particularly attractive."  </P> <P> Young, in a prepared release issued Monday, said that JAYCOR had "firm  commitment from major financial institutions" for financing needed to complete  the proposed $44.2-million deal. Young also complained that Maxwell's board has  rejected JAYCOR's request to at least open negotiations between the two  companies.  </P> <P> Maxwell's board of directors on Thursday rejected the uninvited bid, describing  it as an "unsatisfactory" and "highly conditional" bid that did not benefit the  company's shareholders. Maxwell Vice President Sean Maloy on Friday said the  offer conflicted with Maxwell's growth strategy. Maxwell is a high-technology  company that manufactures products for defense and commercial customers.  </P> <P> Industry analysts on Friday suggested that JAYCOR's unsuccessful bid would open  the door for more bids by JAYCOR or other companies. But JAYCOR Vice President  Vernon Blackman on Monday declined to comment on whether JAYCOR would make a  higher bid for Maxwell.  </P> <P> However, Blackman said that JAYCOR "is only interested in a friendly merger. .  . . We are not interested in a hostile tender offer for Maxwell. We have the  highest regard for Maxwell management and its key personnel."  </P> <P> Young "did not understand how Maxwell's board could have found the terms and  conditions of Maxwell's all-cash merger offer 'unsatisfactory' . . . (or)  'highly conditional' when the opposite was true," according to the release.  </P> <P> JAYCOR is pressing Maxwell's board to open negotiations between the two San  Diego-based companies, Blackman said. "We obviously (think) that conditions  would be altered if face-to-face meetings with Maxwell were to occur," Blackman  said. "We think there's a lot to be gained by merging these two companies . . .  and we hope conditions would change if the Maxwell board and ourselves could  start a dialogue."  </P> <P> Blackman on Monday defended JAYCOR's $17-a-share bid. "We've done an extensive  financial analysis of Maxwell, and Maxwell plus JAYCOR, and we feel that $17 is  a reasonable price," Blackman said.  </P> <P> Maxwell closed up $.75 on Monday, at $16.75.

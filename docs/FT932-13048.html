			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Calls for tighter security: Anti-IRA campaign criticised as City is bombed for second time THE GOVERNMENT faces calls to sharpen its anti-terrorist campaign after a massive IRA bomb in the City of London left one man dead and caused damage provisionally estimated at more than Pounds 300m. As thousands of City workers were confronted with the prospect of being moved into temporary office space, the prime minister will come under pressure from backbenchers for a much wider review of the government's efforts to halt the IRA's mainland bombing campaign. Senior ministers, however, were cautioning last night against any 'knee-jerk' response that would add to the propaganda value for the IRA of the latest attack. Downing Street was seeking to avoid a formal Commons statement on the bombing because of its longstanding view that government should not add to the publicity on which the IRA thrives. Two other bombs exploded on Saturday night, destroying minicabs hijacked by terrorists to attack Downing Street and New Scotland Yard. The drivers ignored instructions and alerted police. One explosion was near King's Cross station, the other in Finsbury Park. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said early estimates of the damage inflicted by the City bombing, which have run as high as Pounds 1bn, may prove to be exaggerated. It said the damage was likely to be on the same scale as last year's Baltic Exchange bombing. The government signalled last night that it was ready to pick up most of the bill for the devastation. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, sought to underpin confidence in London's position by emphasising that the government was 'playing its part' by acting as reinsurer of last resort against terrorist attacks. Sir Francis McWilliams, Lord Mayor of London, co-ordinating the effort to clear up the City and protect its reputation as Europe's leading financial centre, said as he toured the devastated area: 'The Stock Exchange will be working, Lloyd's (insurance market) will be working, the Baltic Exchange will be working, Liverpool Street station will be open and London Underground will be working.' Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of the City of London's policy committee, estimated that at least 20,000 people might need to be temporarily relocated from offices nearest the blast. Mr David Mellor, the former cabinet minister, called for a review of security policy, echoing the private view of many ministers and Tory MPs that the government's counter-terrorist effort needs to be sharpened. Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, called for extended anti-terrorist powers. He said: 'I want the power to set up road checks wherever and whenever, without specific reason for doing so.' Mr Major plans to use a speech this morning to the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to underline his government's determination not to bow to terrorism. The prime minister will emphasise also that the government will intensify its efforts to improve security against further attacks. Mr Lamont, who is hosting the EBRD meeting, said: 'I have every confidence that business will continue to locate here and work here successfully. To do otherwise would be to succumb to terrorism.' That message was echoed in private talks yesterday between the Lord Mayor and Mr Major, who indicated that the government would stick to its commitment to underwrite the insurance costs, even though legislation to set up such arrangements has not yet been passed by the Commons. Mr Major has invited Sir Francis to another meeting this week to discuss further action to tighten security in the City, particularly at night and during weekends. In the City, officials said at least two buildings would be demolished and another 20 would need important structural repairs. One man died and 44 were injured in the explosion on Saturday, for which the IRA formally claimed responsibility yesterday afternoon. The dead man was Mr Ed Henty, a News of the World photographer. The blast affected a wider area than the bombing at the Baltic Exchange in April last year - partly because Bishopsgate is a wider street - although much of the damage beyond the core area was relatively minor. The City Corporation co-ordinated the clear-up of more than 200 tons of broken glass from the streets throughout the weekend.</p>

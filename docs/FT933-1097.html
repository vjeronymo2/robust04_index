			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon to float off US assets WILLIS CORROON, one of the UK's leading insurance companies, has announced its intention to float off most of its US underwriting operations, in a move that would effectively complete the concentration on broking operations begun in 1991. The flotation of about 56 per cent of Gryphon, the holding company for Associated International Insurance and Calvert Insurance, might raise between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m, according to analysts. Mr John Robins, finance director, said the flotation would allow the group to focus on broking, consultancy and risk management. 'Underwriting is not where we want to add extra capital,' he said. Calvert and Associated, with net assets at the year-end of Dollars 71m (Pounds 46m) would be relatively small in US insurance market terms. The companies write speciality commercial and casualty insurance, particularly for small to medium-sized clients. Analysts said the sale would be unlikely to raise substantially more than book value, and would not greatly strengthen the balance sheet. It would, however, improve group liquidity. Last month Willis Corroon halved its dividend following a decision to improve its cash position. It continues to make losses on liabilities incurred by Sovereign, the UK underwriting company, before it was closed in 1991. In the year to December 31 1992, Gryphon contributed Pounds 9.9m to group pre-tax profits of Pounds 42.5m, down from Pounds 67.1m, due to a Pounds 25.7m increase in provisions at Sovereign. This provision covered claims from Hurricane Hugo and other natural catastrophes from 1989, 1990 and 1991. Willis Corroon said it expected the offering to take place in the fourth quarter of this year. Smith Barney Shearson, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers will manage the underwriting of the offering in the US. See Lex</p>

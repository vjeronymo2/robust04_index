			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> * Battle Lines: Commissioner Fay Vincent and New York Yankee owner George  Steinbrenner are bringing in heavy artillery in preparation for a July 5  hearing on the investigation into Steinbrenner's relationship with alleged  gambler Howard Spira. Vincent has put former federal judge Harold Tyler on  retainer, while Steinbrenner has hired two former federal prosecutors, Stephen  Kaufman and Dominic Amorosa, as part of his legal team. The maximum penalties  for violating the best interest of baseball are suspension for life and a fine  of $250,000.  </P> <P> * Atlanta Burning: Russ Nixon's final days as the Atlanta Braves' manager  included open warfare with several of his players and a loss of communication  with some of his coaches. The ineffectiveness of a touted young rotation and  the illness that sidelined Nick Esasky undermined what Nixon and others hoped  would be a promising season. And there was no relief anywhere. Nixon tried  seven pitchers in the closer role, and his bullpen blew 12 of 25 save chances,  earning the nickname "Ghastly Boys" from Joe Strauss of the Atlanta  Constitution.  </P> <P> * Security Check: General Manager Dal Maxvill of the St. Louis Cardinals  received a contract extension through 1992, which matches the commitment to  Manager Whitey Herzog. Only three players -- Bryn Smith, Jose DeLeon and Milt  Thompson -- are signed through '92, and 11 Cardinals can become free agents  when this season ends. "We're entering a transition period," Maxvill said.  "Some will leave by trade, some by choice, some by an infusion of young  talent." Amid the current struggle, pitcher John Tudor said the Cardinals have  been feeling sorry for themselves, adding: "We have to turn frustration into  aggression instead of more frustration."  </P> <P> * Dollar Daze: Jose Canseco's contract agreement with the Oakland Athletics  will cover five years and fall between $23 million and $23.7 million. A's  General Manager Sandy Alderson denied that the Oakland Coliseum fences will be  moved in five feet as part of the agreement. ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev met French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe at the Russian Defense Ministry  today. During their conversation the ministers exchanged  opinions on the problems of settling the situation in the  Caucasus and Bosnia, as well as Russian participation in the  American "Partnership for Peace" program. Alain Juppe showed  most interest in the Russian plan for settling the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. As Pavel Grachev stated, in  accordance with the 14 May agreement, 2,500-3,000 Russian  peacekeepers will be sent to the conflict zone. They will take  up positions along the Inguri river, Galskiy Rayon, and the  Kodorskoye Gorge.    Speaking about the prospects for joining the "Partnership  for  Peace" program, Pavel Grachev stressed that Russia is not  demanding special conditions for itself, but believes  cooperation with NATO countries must not be limited by a  framework agreement. Therefore at his meeting with NATO  leadership in Brussels he will put forward a broad package of  specific proposals on cooperation between Russia and the North  Atlantic bloc countries in the political and military spheres.</p>

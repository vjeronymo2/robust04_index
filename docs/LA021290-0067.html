			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> The World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Assn. might not know who the  heavyweight champion is, but the rest of the world does. It's James (Buster)  Douglas. . . .  </P> <P> Taking away Douglas' 10th-round knockout of Mike Tyson because of a long count  in the eighth round would be like reversing the result of a football game  because of a call made in the fourth quarter. . . .  </P> <P> Long count, short count, regular count. It made no difference. The clear-eyed,  alert Douglas would have gotten up in time because he was watching the referee  and listening to his count. . . .  </P> <P> Of course, it was the impartial promoter, Don King, who registered the  complaint on behalf of Tyson. King's good friend, WBC president Jose Sulaiman,  quaked in his boots. And the referee, Octavio Meyran, quickly entered a plea of  guilty. Oh, the shame of it all. . . .  </P> <P> What should have been one of boxing's greatest moments of the century has  degenerated into still another fiasco. . . .  </P> <P> If anything should be reviewed, it's the cards of the two Japanese judges. One  had Tyson ahead going into the 10th and the other had it even. The one judge  who was scoring the fight with his eyes, Larry Rozadilla of Los Angeles, had  Douglas ahead by six. . . .  </P> <P> Where I watched the bout on HBO, a half-dozen knowledgeable boxing observers  all had Douglas ahead by anywhere from four to six points. . . .  </P> <P> Was this the biggest upset in the history of boxing? No contest. At the Mirage  Hotel in Las Vegas, Tyson was a 42-1 favorite. According to the Ring Record  Book, the previous biggest upset in a heavyweight championship bout was  recorded by James J. Braddock at odds of 10-1 over Max Baer in 1934. Sonny  Liston was 7-1 over Cassius Clay in their first fight in 1964. . . .  </P> <P> Until Saturday night, I had been most startled by Ingemar Johansson knocking  Floyd Patterson down, down, down, down, down, down and finally out in the third  round in 1959 in New York and George Foreman demolishing Joe Frazier in the  second round in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973. . . .  </P> <P> In a refreshing change from the usual pre-fight hype, HBO announcers Jim  Lampley and Larry Merchant prepared the viewers for a mismatch. They were  right. It was a mismatch. . . .  </P> <P> The cable network didn't even bother to bring along the man who keeps its  unofficial scorecard, former referee Harold Lederman, to Japan. . . .  </P> <P> What the telecast needed was some canned yelling and screaming. I've heard more  noise in a library. . . .  </P> <P> The biggest difference between the two fighters was conditioning. Douglas had  the stamina to climb off the canvas from his knockdown. Tyson didn't. . . .  </P> <P> Douglas also had the good sense not long ago to replace Bill (Dynamite) Douglas  as his manager. Fathers just don't make good managers of their sons. . . .  </P> <P> Tyson missed his old trainer, Kevin Rooney, in his corner. For the first time  in his boxing life, he needed advice. None of any value was forthcoming. . . .  </P> <P> The first defeat may have done irreparable damage to Tyson's psyche. He thought  he was indestructible and unbeatable. So did his opponents. . . .  </P> <P> Such "invincibles" as George Foreman, Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns were  never the same after losing for the first time. . . .  </P> <P> Tyson's late manager, Jimmy Jacobs, knew he needed to fight at least once a  month on his way up to stay out of trouble. Jacobs never would have allowed him  this much time between bouts even as champion. Too much partying, too little  serious training. . . .  </P> <P> Tyson looked more disinterested than mean on his way down the aisle and into  the ring. . . .  </P> <P> It was apparent from the first minute that, unlike most of Tyson's other  opponents, Douglas wasn't intimidated. He stuck out the jab to make use of his  longer reach and often led with his right to keep Tyson from lunging in with  the left hook. And he tied up Iron Mike inside, where he still hasn't learned  how to fight. A terrific plan worked to near perfection. . . .  </P> <P> In victory, Douglas was cocky, but likable. In defeat, Tyson was cowardly,  hiding from the media. . . .  </P> <P> I would pick Douglas over Evander Holyfield. Too big and too smart. . . .  </P> <P> The economics of the heavyweight division will change drastically. No longer  will Tyson be able to command outrageous sums of money. But there will be good  paydays now for him, Douglas, Holyfield and George Foreman. . . .  </P> <P> As far as Busters go, Douglas has passed Mathis and Brown and is second only to  Keaton. . . .  </P> <P> Question of the Day: Who is going to referee the Hulk Hogan-Macho Man Savage  wrestling match now?  </P></p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / De Klerk fails to project vision of life after apartheid SOUTH AFRICAN President FW de Klerk has a winning smile and, he hopes, a winning platform for next week's referendum on the future of apartheid. But there is one missing ingredient from his campaign, which he yesterday took to the ultra-conservative Orange Free State: a persuasive and positive vision of a multi-racial future beyond apartheid. Throughout his eight-day, whirlwind national roadshow, Mr de Klerk has perfected his technique: he prolongs every kiss for a National party baby: and makes doubly sure that television cameras capture him smiling benevolently on every available pensioner. But before audiences from Cape Town to Natal, and yesterday in fiercely conservative Welkom, a mining community in the Orange Free State, he has proved short on inspiration and long on reluctant acceptance of the inevitable: an end to white rule. His public meetings are curiously flat in tone; no questions are allowed, little heckling has taken place and the applause is far from thunderous. National Party organisers worry that this reflects a large degree of voter apathy. Faced with the biggest decision of their political lives, many whites simply cannot bring themselves to choose between what they consider two equally unattractive options: the risk of civil war and international sanctions if they vote no and the risk that a yes vote would lead to economic decline. Yesterday, Mr de Klerk took his campaign to its toughest turf yet. Drought in the Orange Free State has left withered maize stalks and drooping sunflowers. As he strolled through the Liberty Centre shopping mall in Welkom, crowds pressed forward to shake his hand - but most of them were black. A handful of right-wing demonstrators clad in the khaki uniform of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement donned masks depicting Mr de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, of the African National Congress, and paraded through the mall arm-in-arm. Mr de Klerk has long rebuffed the claim that he is in alliance with Mr Mandela and his colleagues in the ANC, some of them communist. But many white South Africans worry nonetheless, about their obviously close relations. Mr de Klerk urged the shoppers to give him a chance to solve the racial conflict which has beset South Africa throughout its history. He asked for a landslide victory, not just a simple majority. He may yet get it, but the danger is that a low turnout and a small majority could leave the issue unresolved - and further weaken Mr de Klerk's hand.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Japanese Bonds: Concern mounts over trade surplus RECENT fluctuations in the Japanese government bond market have been extensive, dominated by external factors such as movements in the dollar-yen exchange rate and speculation over monetary easing in the US. A month ago the yield on the 129 10-year benchmark bond stood at 5.68 per cent; at the end of April it had risen to 5.75 per cent; on Friday it closed at 5.47 per cent. Concern is mounting over the ballooning current account and trade surplus. For the fiscal year ended last March, the current account surplus surged 167 per cent to a record Dollars 90bn, while the trade surplus reached a record Dollars 113bn. To show their commitment to reducing the surpluses, Japanese authorities are determined to keep the yen under Y130 against the dollar, ahead of this month's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers. Japan is under greater pressure from the US and Europe to stimulate slowing consumer demand to decrease exports and increase imports. Investors reckon an easing of credit in the US will give the Bank of Japan more room to lower interest rates. The short-term focus of the bond market will be next week's announcement of the tankan, or the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment. According to a survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry last month, 78 per cent of businesses perceived conditions as bad, while only 2.9 per cent thought they were favourable. First-quarter GNP figures, to be announced later this month, will also give some indication of where the economy is heading. Mr Robert Feldman at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo says weak business investment and construction figures could depress economic growth to an annualised 1 per cent. While expectations of weak growth and low business sentiment present the central bank with good reason to lower rates, concerns of oversupply due to large issues on the corporate bond market are likely to limit decline in yields of long-term bonds. With equity-linked financing at a halt due to the weakness of the equity market, and a squeeze on banks' capital-adequacy ratios curbing lending, more and more Japanese companies are dipping into the straight bond market for funds. Domestic and overseas corporate bond markets have become alternative financing sources for Japanese companies, which face redemptions of equity-linked bonds issued during the stock market boom, and those pressed for capital investment funds.</p>

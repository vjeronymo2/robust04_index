He insisted  that although the reports are not part of the  confidence-building measures package, they include promises made  to the Turkish Cypriot side by the UN secretary general and UN  experts on the benefits to the Turkish Cypriots when the  measures are implemented.    He told ANTENNA: "Naturally, we will take whatever is  included in the reports that will benefit the Turkish Cypriots.  Nobody can tell us `Don't touch.' We will not throw away the  reports. They include indications of what we can achieve  through the confidence-building measures.    "The reason the people agreed to the talks is certainly  related to what can be achieved. How can we say that the  reports are invalid? Of course they exist and of course they  are a tool that we will use."    The Turkish Cypriot leader said the reports were prepared by  the experts to be used. "Otherwise, he said, there was no  reason to prepare them." He continued: "If the reports were  irrelevant, there was no reason to spend the experts' time and  money on us. They have spent hours working with us. So, why do  you, Greek Cypriots, avoid them? I do not understand."    Discussing the time frame for Nicosia Airport to reopen and  Varosha's residents to return to the fenced off area, Denktas  said this will depend on developments. He said: "Don't forget  that the reports refer to 18 months for Nicosia Airport to  reoperate and two to five years for Varosha."    Finally, the Turkish Cypriot leader said this week's  meetings  aim to prepare an agenda for the proximity talks which will  begin on 17 February when Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's  special representative in Cyprus, will be in Cyprus. Denktas  said: "Clark will arrive in Cyprus on 17 February or a few days  earlier, and will be with us for a few separate meetings. He  will then leave us with Gustave Feissel."</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Airbus crash report published An interim report into the crash in July of an Airbus A330 aircraft on its test flight appears to point to human error as the cause. The official report, published yesterday, says the crash of the twin-engined airliner, in which seven people died, was not the result of mechanical failure. 'In the first analysis, it appears that there was no failure of the aircraft, its motors or its equipment which would have contributed to the accident,' the report says. It recommends that Airbus bring to the attention of airlines using the A330 the need to monitor aircraft speed when using the altitude auto-pilot setting. Airbus said it had already implemented the recommendations.</p>

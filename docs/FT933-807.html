			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: Auction to test strength of support A TEST of the continuing strength of the recent support for gilts from non-UK institutions will come this Wednesday when the Bank of England attempts to sell a further Pounds 3.25bn worth of the securities. The Bank's latest auction is of an 11-year stock in the part of the yield curve generally favoured by overseas investment groups on the grounds that it is easily tradeable. While foreign interest in gilts has been extremely high since the beginning of the year, some in the gilt market believe purchasing by overseas groups may wane in the coming months because of renewed concern about the UK inflation outlook. In this camp is Mr John Shepperd, a bond specialist at Yamaichi Securities, who says gilt prices 'may have passed their peak' on account of the possibilities of a stirring in inflationary pressures as the UK economy picks up. This week's auction, required to gain more cash to pay for the 1993-1994 Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement, will indicate to what degree overseas institutions agree with Mr Shepperd. In the second quarter of this year, non-UK groups including governments bought gilts worth Pounds 4.57bn after Pounds 2.1bn in the first quarter, helping the Bank to be in the comfortable position of already having borrowed around two-thirds of the money it will need for the whole of the financial year. As gilts traded quietly last week ahead of the auction, focus also turned to comments by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, sketching out a vision of pan-European co-operation based around inflation targets for individual countries. While some gilt specialists reckoned Mr George's ideas were somewhat risky - given the lack of experience in using such targets to steer policy - it was regarded as an interesting effort to fill the policy vacuum left after last month's virtual breakdown of the exchange rate mechanism. The governor appeared to be urging other countries to follow the path of Britain, which after dropping out of the ERM a year ago adopted a policy of trying to keep underlying inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments, at under 4 per cent. However, one gilt expert said of Mr George's comments: 'With the strong possibility that the 4 per cent limit may be breached over the next year or so, Britain has yet to convince the rest of Europe that ideas like this can really deliver the goods in terms of helping economic stability.' While these comments sound all the more apposite in view of the gilt's market shock earlier this month from the latest upward blip in the RPI, investors gained some comfort from Friday's survey of manufacturing trends from the Confederation of British Industry showing few companies are considering price rises. The survey of some 1,500 manufacturers showed that 11 per cent expected to reduce prices for domestic orders over the next four months while 10 per cent thought they would be in a position to increase them. This indicates a continuation of the strong competitive pressures on makers of factory goods, resulting from UK demand still being relatively weak in spite of recent recovery signs. At the retail level, Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of the Dixons store chain, said retail margins 'were likely to stay under pressure' for some time, in a comment also likely to soothe nervousness about inflation trends. Less concerned than some about inflationary pressures is Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities, who says recent economic data have generally underlined the view that the recovery is weaker than has been expected, a development that should restrain any tendency for inflation to pick up. As though confirming this view, yields for 10-year gilts over the past week have come down by about five basis points to just over 7 per cent. The gap between these yields and those for 10-year German government bonds was quoted on Friday night at about 93 basis points, underlining the better performance for gilts since roughly a weak ago when the yield spread was 110 basis points.</p>

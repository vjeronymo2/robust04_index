			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Tokyo Equity investors remain focused on movements of the yen, writes Emiko Terazono. While US government officials have called for a concerted move on interest rates along with Japan and Germany, the Japanese cabinet would not commit itself last week to lowering the official discount rate, currently at a record low of 1.75 per cent. With the US FOMC meeting and the G7 summit this week, volatility in the currency markets may increase. If the yen rises further, the Nikkei index may test the June low of 20,168.53.

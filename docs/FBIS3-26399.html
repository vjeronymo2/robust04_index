The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the  recently released U.S. "Annual Report on Human Rights in the  World" statement that the DPRK violates human rights was a  "shameless intervention" into DPRK's internal affairs.    The U.S. move was aimed at harming DPRK's image so as to  isolate the country in the international community, said the  agency.    In fact, it stressed, the government of the DPRK guarantees  genuine freedom and rights for all citizens.    On the other hand, it added, the United States is one of the  countries that most gravely tramples human rights. The KCNA  urged the United States to immediately stop activities which  attack the DPRK and socialism using the excuse of "human rights  issue."</p>

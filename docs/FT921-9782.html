			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Lord Mayor backs change for Somerset House SIR BRIAN JENKINS, the Lord Mayor of London, will tonight launch a campaign to make Somerset House a promotional showcase for London, John Willman writes. The 18th century building is the headquarters of the Inland Revenue and houses parts of the Lord Chancellor's Department. Both are due to vacate Somerset House soon. Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, has invited suggestions for an 'imaginative public use' of the building, which already houses the Courtauld Collection of fine art. Sir Brian is expected to say that London is alone among leading cities in not having a promotional centre which would provide a showcase for business opportunities, display available properties and offer information for those wishing to set up in the capital. The proposal will be backed by Westminster City Council and the London Docklands Development Corporation. As a first step, the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, is to launch an architectural exhibition in May in conjunction with the Architectural Foundation. This will display all buildings in the City. The exhibition - to be shown in the Royal Exchange - is designed to tour European cities. But Sir Brian will propose that it be given a permanent home in Somerset House and could be part of the showcase.</p>

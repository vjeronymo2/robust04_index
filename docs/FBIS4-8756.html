			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb  Parliamentary Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said on Sunday Serbs  insisted that a Gorazde ceasefire must be part of a general  ceasefire for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina and must entail the  lifting of U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro).    Speaking for the local radio in Kragujevac, Serbia,  Krajisnik  said international mediators were insisting on a separate  solution for the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia,  but the Serb side would not agree to any partial arrangements  but only to a general cessation of hostilities in all of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Krajisnik said that Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin and U.N.  special envoy Yasushi Akashi had informed the Serb side that the  Moslems wished to open talks on the problem, which was probably  a serious offer. He added however that similar agreements  reached in the past had not been honoured.    Commenting on the downing of a British NATO plane over  Gorazde, Krajisnik said: "The Serbs meant to down (NATO) planes  only if they flew over their territory" which was not the case  on Saturday, which means that the Serbs had not fired fire at  the British plane which any investigation would show [sentence  as received].    The British aircraft fell in Moslem-controlled territory.    The Bosnian Serb command said it had intercepted a message  from the Moslems in Gorazde to the Moslem command in Sarajevo  saying that they had downed the plane and were holding the pilot  who had bailed out.    The Bosnian Serb command has repeatedly warned that the  Moslems in Gorazde, frustrated by the imminent defeat of their  late March offensive on the surrounding Serb territories, might  go so far as to down NATO planes to provoke a NATO military  intervention against Bosnian Serbs.</p>

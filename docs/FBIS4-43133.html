			<p>BFN     [Text] The first part of this year's meeting of the  Western European Union [WEU] opened in Paris today. A Slovene  parliamentary delegation has also been invited to attend the  meeting as an observer. Our delegation consists of Borut Pahor,  head of the Slovene delegation to the European Council  Parliamentary Conference [as heard], and Jozef Kupse, chairman  of the Parliamentary Committee for Defense. What is above all  important for Slovenia, is to successfully present in Paris our  country's interest in acquiring the status of WEU associate  member.</p>

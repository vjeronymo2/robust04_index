			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambro to sell Londonderry Hotel THE LONDONDERRY Hotel, the central London hotel which was being redeveloped by Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, has been put up for sale by Hambro Leasing, part of Hambros Bank. A guide price of Pounds 33m has been set. Hambro Leasing bought the hotel in November 1989, arranging to lease it to Brent Walker. That company, which last year completed a financial restructuring, closed it for refurbishing in April 1991. However, Brent Walker is understood to have decided that a sale of the hotel would not cover its leasing commitment and pulled out of the arrangement. Brent Walker's liability to Hambro Leasing will be added to the group's general indebtedness. Hambro Leasing is thought to have other security on the hotel. The sale of the hotel, situated on Park Lane, is being handled by Weatherall Green &amp; Smith. When Brent Walker publishes its accounts, probably in May, they are expected to show compensation for loss of office totalling some Pounds 1.5m. These cover a number of departures including Mr Ken Scobie, until January the group's chief executive, and Mrs Jean Walker, a former executive director of the group. Mrs Walker, wife of Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive, is understood to have received a package, including pension entitlements, of about Pounds 340,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry has  announced an internal reorganization, with 17 positions at the  special grade 1 (vice minister-level) downgraded to lower levels  and six divisions closed down.    The plan was approved by the cabinet as part of the  government's overall strategy on streamlining.    Ministry officials said the restructuring does away with the  controversial attempt to amend the Diplomat Employment Law,  which initially envisioned changing the retirement age and  lowering the limit in service years to rectify a promotion  bottleneck.    The 17 special grade 1 positions will be demoted over the  next three to five years. Five of the positions will be  distributed to special grade 2, seven to grade 1 and another  five to grade 2.    Officials said this finally reshapes the structure of the  number of officials -- from an urn to the ideal pyramid.    The Ministry earlier planned to change its employment law to  achieve this effect, but the move is no longer necessary since  the reorganization will naturally lower the retirement age and  service years.    The division reorganization affects Middle East Division I  and II, which are being merged.    Africa Division I and II, Cultural Affairs Division I and  II,  Overseas Residents Division I and II, and Passport Division I  and II are all being merged into single divisions.    The reduction, the officials noted, will change the past  practice where nearly every employee served as division chief, a  necessity before promotion to director-general.    Now there will be employees who bypass the division chief  position, the officials said.    While shedding six divisions, the Ministry adds a new  division on disarmament and atomic energy.    The new division falls under the supervision of the United  Nations Bureau, which succeeds the current International  Organizations Bureau.    The present Asian Affairs Bureau is being renamed the Asia-  Pacific Affairs Bureau, while the Middle East and African  Affairs Bureau will be called the Western Asia and African  Affairs Bureau by taking over operations in Southeast Asia.    U.N. Division I, U.N. Division II and International  Organization Division will be known as U.N. Policy Division,  Human Rights Division and U.N. Economic Affairs Division.    Moving to strengthen its environment policy, the Ministry  has  separated the environment into an independent division from  technology.    In addition, 12 attaches from eight other ministries were  recalled to their headquarters, the officials said.</p>

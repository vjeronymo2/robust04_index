			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> REID: NO CHITCHAT ON THE STAGE  </P> <P> William Reid, founder of the band The Jesus and Mary Chain, said mum's the word  on stage -- unless he's singing.  </P> <P> "When you make a record, you don't introduce the songs. . . . It would break  the spell," he said.  </P> <P> "Playing on stage is kind of magical, and when people stand up there and start  saying things, it breaks the spell.  </P> <P> "If I go see a group, I want to see them playing as hard and as good as they  can. I want the music to be one intense, long flow. I don't want people to talk  to me."  </P> <P> Reid said he has broken his rule of on-stage silence only one time in five  years -- and that was because he was drunk.  </P> <P> "I was abusing them. I was insulting them," he said. "The next day I was  embarrassed. I regretted it."  </P> <P> The Scottish band, scheduled to appear in Dallas today, is touring after its  latest release, "Automatic."  </P></p>

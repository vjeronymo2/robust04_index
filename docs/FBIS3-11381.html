			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Final Approval of Accord"] </F>   [Text] Senate approval of the inspection of Brazilian  nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) puts the finishing touch on the effort by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and the Armed Forces to bring the country into  the community of nations having access to nuclear technology  while protecting the sovereign interests of national  development. The decision ratifies commitments made by Brazilian  diplomats and confirms that the national nuclear  program--recognized as a leading sector in the progress of  Brazilian industrial technology--is following rigorous  parameters in complying with international safety standards.    Besides the Senate decision, a new level in relations  between  Brazil and Argentina has been reached thanks to establishment of  the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of  Nuclear Materials (ABACC). The result is that Brazilian  diplomats now possess important trump cards for reversing  Brazil's image as an unreliable country as far as transferring  sensitive technology is concerned.    The subject of nuclear safeguards is complex and requires  exhaustive international negotiations by Brazilian diplomats.  Brazil has not signed and does not intend to sign the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it considers  discriminatory and unfair. It is, however, one of the few  countries in the world whose Constitution includes a provision  banning the manufacture of atomic bombs. Perhaps that  constitutional provision is not regarded as a guarantee, but it  shows our country's intention to use nuclear technology for  peaceful purposes.    According to the text approved by the Senate, the enrichment  of uranium will be inspected not from the standpoint of the way  it is accomplished but in terms of the quantity produced. The  Navy is thus honoring its pledge to keep uranium production at  enrichment levels not exceeding 20 percent. Brazil is therefore  providing the international community with a guarantee that its  production of nuclear power is not aimed at the manufacture of  an atomic bomb, which would require uranium enriched to much  higher levels. And at the same time, the country is protecting  the secrecy of the military program for building a  nuclear-powered submarine, a program that is being carried out  in an extremely efficient manner by the Navy at the Aramar  Experimental Center in Ipero, Sao Paulo.    It should not be forgotten that nuclear power is currently a  highly competitive international market. Indiscriminately  divulging the stage reached in certain research could hinder the  transfer of technology and the achievement of Brazilian  production levels capable of threatening internationally  established monopolies.</p>

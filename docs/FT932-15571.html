			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Fyodorov hopes aid will be disbursed quickly MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, said at the weekend he hoped the G7 ministers' meeting tomorrow would help to set up 'mechanisms' for aid to be disbursed immediately after the July summit of western leaders with President Boris Yeltsin in Tokyo. The prospect of western money flowing after July depends on a tight credit and monetary policy being in place in Russia by then. If Moscow succeeds in this policy, a promised rouble stabilisation fund could be deployed in the second half of this year, Mr Fyodorov suggested. He did not know what would be on offer at the G7 gathering, although privately he has complained to western officials that Russia has not been sufficiently involved in the elaboration of western proposals for assistance. Foreign assistance had to show visible benefits to a sceptical Russian population if it was to help promote reform, he said. 'If this is another year in which there is a lot of noise or just confirmation of aid promised earlier it would be catastrophic.' Mr Fyodorov has also proposed that the west provide a fund to help the government compensate for the consequences of financial stabilisation, such as the closure of inefficient enterprises like coal mines. A fund is being considered to promote small businesses and to help create jobs to counter rising unemployment. Russia expects unemployment to reach 1m by the summer and is predicting this could rise to 5m this year. A special IMF facility is being considered to help countries such as Russia in switching to a market economy, in addition to traditional IMF standby loans already available in return for strict conditions. The special facility, which has yet to be approved by the IMF's board, would amount to the equivalent of 40 per cent of a country's existing IMF quota. This would mean that Russia would be eligible for an additional Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn), in addition to its quota of Dollars 6bn, Dollars 1bn of which has already been disbursed. In his news conference at the weekend, Mr Fyodorov also appealed to his own president, prime minister and parliament to avoid 'destructive' populist measures in the campaigning for the April 25 referendum and afterwards. Given that the referendum would be probably be followed by fresh elections in the autumn, Mr Fyodorov warned that the chances for the situation stabilising between now and then were 'not great'.</p>

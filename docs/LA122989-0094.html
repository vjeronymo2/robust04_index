			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT ALLEGES HARASSMENT BY ROCKWELL  </P> <P> A former aerospace worker at the Johnson Space Center in Houston who blew the  whistle on alleged fraud on the space shuttle has accused Rockwell  International of a bizarre scheme of harassment, according to a court brief  filed Thursday.  </P> <P> Ria Solomon alleges in a federal suit that Rockwell security agents illegally  used information from a Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal information  computer to discredit Rockwell engineers who were corroborating her  allegations.  </P> <P> Solomon is suing Rockwell in U.S. District Court in Houston under the  Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. A fellow worker who was  a co-plaintiff in the suit settled with Rockwell earlier this year.  </P> <P> The suit brought by Solomon alleges that after she reported time-card fraud and  technical problems on the space shuttle program to a Rockwell ombudsman, the  company's security department began a campaign of harassment.  </P> <P> Solomon worked for Unisys, a subcontractor under Rockwell at the Houston  center. Rockwell manages certain functions at the Houston center for the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  </P> <P> Solomon was fired by Unisys in May, 1987, and sued later that year, naming both  Rockwell and Unisys. She settled with Unisys last year.  </P> <P> Rockwell officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In the court filing Thursday, Solomon alleges that Rockwell assistant general  counsel Bette Bardeen directed two Rockwell security agents in Houston to  gather evidence to discredit witnesses for Solomon.  </P> <P> Logs compiled by the two security agents, Danny Myers and James Roberts,  indicate that their activities were reported to Bardeen, according to Lynne  Bernabei, Solomon's attorney.  </P> <P> Myers was also a police officer in El Lago, a Texas municipality. He used that  connection to use the FBI's national criminal information computer to obtain  information about a witness in the suit, the legal brief alleges.  </P> <P> The brief also alleges that Rockwell security agents conducted physical  surveillance of a second witness in 1987 and 1988. When the witness reported  suspicious activity to the local police department, the agency notified  Rockwell of the report, according to the brief.  </P> <P> The police agency also allegedly destroyed a report identifying individuals who  were making harassing telephone calls to the witness.  </P></p>

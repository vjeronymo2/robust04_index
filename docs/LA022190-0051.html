			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE MYTHIC MADNESS OF MICHAEL SARGENT'S 'I HATE!'  </P> <P> Playwright Michael Sargent is developing a mythic anti-hero for the '90s. The  protagonist of "I Hate!" at the Cast Theatre is certainly a further blossoming  of the central figure in Sargent's "Big Boy," presented by John Steppling's and  Bob Glaudini's Heliogabalus company a couple of seasons ago at the Cast  (Sargent emerged from Steppling's workshop).  </P> <P> Sargent's mythic hero is young, monolithic, oblivious to the outside forces  which shape his life, and revels in a state of undress which comments wryly on  his intellectual impact on society.  </P> <P> In "I Hate!" the blank-eyed figure is again, like Boy in the previous play,  passively engaged in a way of life that eventually ends in self-destruction.  After his three years in prison, his vindictive mother kicks him out of her  home, and he rents a cheap room in the faded mansion of a faded silent screen  star.  </P> <P> Sargent's unfailing sense of humor has taken a glance at "Sunset Boulevard" for  the set-up, along with a long look at "Sweet Bird of Youth" (the boy's name is  Chance). The difference is that the faded star is Sanchez, Latin lover rival of  Valentino. Sanchez, who claims Ramon Navarro was weird, wears a flimsy Oriental  dress and is never without his parasol. And he's never without a hungry leer  when Chance is within grabbing range.  </P> <P> Maud, a drunken barfly, is the derelict Chance passes off as a nurse to help  baby-sit Sanchez. She completes the unholy triumvirate as it spins itself into  disaster.  </P> <P> The wicked humor Sargent displayed in "Big Boy" is evident here. If the  production isn't as striking as its predecessor, it might be because the  playwright directed this one himself, while "Big Boy" was guided by Lee  Kissman. Kissman is present in a subtle, quirky performance as Sanchez but the  wit and originality in his staging of the earlier play is missing. Director  Sargent takes playwright Sargent a little too seriously.  </P> <P> But playwright Sargent has hit on something with his mythic character (played  properly by Jason Reed like a puppy stunned at his first spanking for missing  the papers). Chance is as strong a comment on the disenfranchised young male of  the '90s as Sam Shepard's comic book pseudo cowboy was of the '60s. It's a  kinky, unsettling image.  </P> <P> Shawna Casey is also a little unsettling as sleazy Maud. She captures the  thoughtless evil of the character without totally giving away her game too  quickly. Tina Preston, who can make the most outlandish characterization seem  perfectly normal, does so as both Chance's mother and Maud's mother.  </P> <P> Courtenay Marvin's set and costumes and Don Preston's 1940s-tuned sound design  blend in perfectly with the "Sunset Boulevard" ambience and have some of the  humor of the writing. Sargent's mythic hero deserves more of that humor in the  playwright's direction.  </P> <P> At 800 N. El Centro Ave., Hollywood; Thursdays and Fridays,8 p.m.; ends March  9. Tickets: $5; (213) 462-0265.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Pensions row faces second Commons probe The government is to come under further pressure in the growing row over personal pensions advice after a decision by a second body of MPs to investigate the subject. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, looks set to be dragged directly into the firing line, with the social security committee expecting to call him to answer questions before Easter. The social security committee inquiry will begin as the government's approach to financial regulation - particularly in the context of advice offered to people to take out personal pensions - comes under scrutiny from the Treasury and civil service committee of MPs. The Treasury committee is to begin its investigation later this month by taking evidence from two of the most vocal critics of the plan for self-regulation through the Personal Investment Authority. Its first witness is to be Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, who has called for statutory regulation. The views of the Consumers' Association will also be sought early on, as will evidence from Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, who resigned from the PIA last month in protest that the planned composition of its board membership did not amount to self-regulation. Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for financial regulation, is likely to come before the committee early in the summer. In the case of both inquiries, MPs' interest has been intensified by a series of revelations that have raised strong concerns about the quality of advice on pension-related issues. The Treasury committee announced its inquiry after the publication of a study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. The study suggested that in nine out of 10 cases where someone transferring out of an occupational pension scheme was sold a personal pension, the sale did not comply with regulators' requirements. The focus of the new inquiry - soon to be announced officially - will be on advice given to people who transferred out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps). MPs on the social security committee argue that figures showing that a considerable number of these people are now unemployed or on low incomes give grounds for believing the advice they were offered was inadequate. Statistics released by the Department of Social Security in December showed a significant number of personal pension sales to people contracting out of Serps involved people who could not benefit from tax incentives and so might well be worse off as a result of contracting out.</p>

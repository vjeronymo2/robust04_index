			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Book Review: The government as a 'stationary bandit' Dictatorship, Democracy and Development By Mancur Olson American Political Science Review, Sept 1993 A great deal was written, especially in the 1970s, on the economic tensions affecting democracy. Competition for votes tended to generate unrealistic expectations, contributing to the notorious overload on government. Moreover, democratic government was infested with interest groups which badly affected economic performance. The more careful writers in this vein did not say that dictatorships would perform better or as well as democracies. An American economist, Mancur Olson, who himself pioneered much of the earlier interest group analysis, has now gone on to analyse the endemic weaknesses of dictatorship. But, first, he makes important observations on the advantages of one type of dictatorship over another and of most types over anarchic violence. His starting point is the same as that of the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes: the need to prevent anarchic violence at almost all costs. The victims of violence and theft lose not only what is taken from them, but also the incentive to produce any goods for exchange with others. The worst curse that can be suffered by a society in Olson's view is 'roving bandits'. Where these are prevalent no security of property exists. It is just as bad for the bandits; and one of the biggest gains in human history is when a bandit leader seizes a given domain, becomes a 'stationary bandit' and himself begins to expel all other roving bandits, as did the successful Chinese warlords of the 1920s. The rational stationary bandit will acquire a monopoly of theft, which he will call taxes; but the taxes will be extracted in such a way that the society still has some incentive to produce. For the stationary bandit will be able to take more if he leaves his subjects with the means to generate taxable income. 'Thus we have the first blessing of the invisible hand: the rational self-interested leader of a band of roving bandits is led, as though by an invisible hand, to settle down, wear a crown and replace anarchy with government.' Eventually the bandit establishes a dynasty and acquires respectability. 'History until relatively recent times has been mostly a story of the gradual progress of civilisation under stationary bandits interrupted by occasional episodes of roving banditry.' More needs to be said, however, on the difference between autocrats, such as the Bourbons and the Habsburgs, and the rule of the mafia. The word 'legitimacy', which Olson does not mention, must come into a full explanation. Simply because it has been established for generations, a dynasty acquires some basis of consent even if people are not fooled about its origin. There are other elements too. A successful legitimate government has more undisputed control over its territory than mafia leaders, who are often at loggerheads with each other as well as the official government and are less able to protect the population. Thus mafia leaders have more of the characteristics of roving bandits. Yet, if one leader comes out on top and his family rules for generations, he too will establish a legitimate dynasty. Olson comes into his own in analysing the difference between the tax behaviour of stationary bandits and democracies. A dictator or bandit will want to maximise his own revenue and not care about the effect on the national income provided that the tax-take is as high as it can be. However modest his own needs, he has an unlimited stock of prestige projects or wars of conquest that he wants to finance. A democratic government will care about the effects on the population and not just on the government's takings. Of course, a democratic government might try to buy elections by transferring income from a minority to a majority. But the majority will still have a substantial market-generated income and thus care more for the productivity of society than would an absolute ruler. Olson has a less clear-cut theory of how democracy emerges. He falls back, perhaps rightly, on accidents of history, such as occasions when an individual who orchestrates the overthrow of an autocracy is not strong enough to set up another autocracy of his own. This may leave a stalemate and the need to work with other groups. But the danger surely is that such a stalemate will produce not constitutional government, as in the case of the English Glorious Revolution of 1689, but a weak state in which rival violent groups flourish, as in Russia today. Some pessimists have concluded that the autocrats who rule China and until recently ruled Chile were right; and that the development of a flourishing market economy must precede civil liberties and constitutional rule, whatever the distortions and disadvantages. But there are other morals too. The more successful record of the Czech Republic suggests that a rule of law tradition, covering property rights as well as safety of the person, can enable a constitutional democracy to preside over the re-entry to capitalism. Although Olson does not provide all the answers, he provides much more stimulus and understanding than many holders of Nobel prizes and takes us beyond the stale arguments on which so many social scientists are still impaled.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Books: Democracy rules - OK ATHENS ON TRIAL by Jennifer Tolbert Roberts Princeton University Press Pounds 25, 391 pages RECASTING CONSERVATISM by Robert Devigne Yale University Press Pounds 20, 268 pages When Chinese students occupied Tiananmen Square in 1989, they raised a statue they called 'the Goddess of Democracy'. In 1979 their older siblings turned a length of Peking brick into 'Democracy Wall', where freedom of expression briefly flourished. In both cases the name and spirit of democracy were summoned to oppose the geriatric tyrants in the Forbidden City. China still waits for democracy, but Tiananmen Square did much to make possible the 1989 revolutions in Eastern Europe. The crowds there likewise invoked democracy, and we here applauded. 'Democracy' is a feel-good word; it is what the west officially stands for and defends. Who would now dream of saying that oligarchy or plutocracy or dictatorship is preferable? It was by no means ever thus. In her absorbing book Jennifer Tolbert Roberts traces the history of anti-democratic sentiment in western civilisation from classical Athens to today. It is a chastening tale. Until recently, democracy was vilified as the despotism of poor, ignorant majorities over better-off and better educated minorities. Since most of those able to record their opinions belonged to the latter class, history resounds with their condemnation of any political arrangement that allows the Great Unwashed a say in affairs of state. Athens in the fifth and fourth centuries BC was not a perfect democracy. Women, slaves and aliens had no say, and men only reached adulthood at 30. But at its height under Pericles the Athenian democracy produced art, architecture, drama and philosophy of such power and excellence that they continue to shape western civilisation. Yet even then democracy had its opponents. The aristocratic Plato attacked it for putting management of the state into the hands of ignoramuses. He blamed it for making the citizenry 'idle, cowardly, loquacious and greedy' and for devouring those - Pericles, Miltiades, Themistocles - who had promoted it in the first place. With the philosophers of Athens against it, democracy had little chance among later thinkers. Renaissance writers were convinced it meant constant tumult. Enlightenment moralists saw it as a threat to virtue. America's founding fathers believed it led to the equalisation of property. And when the grudging shift to something approaching democracy happened in Britain between 1830 and 1930, its opponents claimed they were being sold to the rabble. What has lately made democracy not just respectable but something to die for? Roberts answer is: 19th century historians, who rescued Athenian democracy from the opprobrium of earlier historians. In associating democratic ideals with the glories of Periclean Athens the theory of democracy was at last made respectable. But for how long? In his scholarly book about recent conservatism in Britain and America Robert Devigne says something of more than merely theoretical importance: that whereas conservative theory and practice in America has resulted in devolution of political authority, British conservatism has effected a rapid centralisation of power. Devigne sees Britain's swing to right-wing authoritarianism as the alarmed reaction to perceived national decline. British political institutions have always been carefully arranged to dissipate the effects of democracy, a fact as welcomed by Labour politicians when in office as by Conservative politicians at all times. But if Devigne is right about the contemporary British Conservative Party, it would seem that it is less than ever disposed to keep private its hostility to democratic ideas. Roberts shows how ideas have their day. When time next brings in its revenges, what kind of -ocracy or -archy will be the flavour of the epoch? And how shall we like being even less in control of affairs than we now are?</p>

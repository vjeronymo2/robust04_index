			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UN urges action to stem Iraqi brutality VIOLATIONS of human rights by the present Iraqi regime are so grave and so widespread that few parallels can be found since the Second World War, a UN human rights report says. Presenting his report yesterday to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Mr Max van der Stoel, the special rapporteur for Iraq, said exceptional measures were called for. 'Every day, Iraqi citizens are in danger of losing their lives. Scarcely a day passes without executions or hangings. In such a situation, mere condemnations are not enough.' British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned last night that the Gulf war allies would not 'stand idly by' while President Saddam Hussein continued to repress Iraqis and violated UN resolutions. He said: 'Still he cheats: UN inspectors have found huge covert programmes for weapons of mass destruction. 'Saddam's inner circle prevent supplies from reaching the Kurdish population in northern Iraq, or the Shia in the southern marshes. The blockade of the North is a clear violation of the Security Council that demanded an end to repression in Iraq.' In his UN report Mr van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister, urged the dispatch of a team of human rights monitors to Iraq which would remain as long as necessary. 'A resolute effort must be made to save human lives,' he said. The report catalogues summary executions, arbitrary detention of political and religious opponents, enforced disappearances, and routine use of torture to extract confessions. 'The number of victims  .. is certainly in the hundreds of thousands,' it says. Replying to Mr van der Stoel's remarks, Mr Mohammed Al-Douri, Iraq's chief representative to the 53-member Human Rights Commission, said Iraq strongly rejected the report as part of the west's propaganda campaign against the country. A commission established by the UN Security Council to determine compensation payable by Iraq to victims in the invasion and occupation of Kuwait is recommending surprisingly low ceilings - only Dollars 30,000 per individual and Dollars 60,000 per family, Michael Littlejohns reports from New York. The Commission reported last night that the Iraqis want a five-year grace period before making any payment into the UN fund to which claims will be addressed. Officials said these were bound to run into thousands, but they did not have a precise estimate. In seeking a delay, Iraq said it must have time to meet its essential domestic needs, including repairing an estimated Dollars 194bn of damage done by the coalition forces.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 4TH QUARTER MOSTLY WEAK FOR JUNK BONDS  </P> <P> Corporate high-yield junk bonds posted a loss of 2.53% in the fourth quarter of  1989, their weakest performance in five years, according to a report from  Salomon Bros. Inc.  </P> <P> Salomon said the market's softness, which began in late summer, culminated with  a selloff in October, as investors were rocked by a series of negative news  events capped by the failed UAL Corp. buyout.  </P> <P> The brokerage noted that the market's weakness continued for the remainder of  the year, with selective "bottom fishing" providing some support.  </P> <P> For the year, junk bonds, which are high-risk securities below investment  grade, posted only a 1.84% return, according to Salomon's index, compared to  14.44% for investment grade bonds.  </P> <P> Junk bonds became popular in the mid-1980s when they were used to finance a  series of spectacular, high-profile corporate buyouts.  </P> <P> But the $200-billion market fell apart in 1989, particularly in the banking and  retail sectors, according to figures provided by Salomon.  </P> <P> In the troubled thrift sector, junk bonds posted a loss of 9.77% for the fourth  quarter of 1989 and a loss of 21.49% for the year. In the financial sector,  junk bonds posted a loss of 5.7% for the fourth quarter and a loss of 18.66%  for the year.  </P> <P> In the retail sector, where the empire built by Canadian Robert Campeau began  to crumble, junk bonds posted a loss of 12.91% in the fourth quarter and a loss  of 13.86% for the year, Salomon said.  </P> <P> But the report said there were some bright spots in the picture for the  selective investor.  </P> <P> In the utility sector, junk bonds posted a return of 4.02% for the quarter and  18.83% for the year. Automotive products was another strong sector, with junk  bonds posting a return of 4.04% for the quarter and 14.65% for the year.  </P> <P> Salomon said investment-grade bonds, which are considered less risky but less  potentially lucrative than junk bonds, posted a 3.11% return in the 1989 fourth  quarter. It said the bank sector of that market, hindered by the deteriorating  real estate market, turned in the lowest sector return of 1.31%.  </P></p>

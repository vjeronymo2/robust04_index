			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Stepanov of the </F> Ground Forces Press Center: "Alarming Housing Situation"]    [Text] The state of and prospects for work to sell  released military property and practical measures to maintain  law and order and military discipline among troops were  discussed at a Ground Forces Military Council session 27 January  this year.    It was noted there that last year there were great hopes for  increased social protection for servicemen, and in particular  for at least a partial solution to the housing problem, thanks  to the possibility of using High Command resources, which it was  intended to obtain by selling released military property. But  rampant inflation, bureaucracy, and payment delays reduced the  results of this work to virtually nothing. People lost interest  in it. In addition, the Ground Forces are the only branch of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces not to receive 20 percent of  the money earned from the sale of military property, to which it  is entitled under a defense minister's order. This is at a time  when a most alarming situation regarding the provision of  housing for servicemen is being noted right here. The families  of officers and warrant officers have been waiting no less than  five to seven years to receive apartments. Thus, there are now  over 200 officers without apartments in the High Command  apparatus.    It is therefore no accident that the second of the questions  discussed was considered closely with the social aspect. An  officer without an apartment, who feels that he is not shown  respect by the state and society and who has extremely limited  material means is hardly likely to be in a position to  unreservedly give his all to the service. Can he really be  expected to take resolute action to strengthen military  discipline and law and order in a subordinate unit or subunit if  he himself is experiencing an infringement of his civil rights?    The results of the Military Council session were summed up  by  Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of Ground  Forces.</p>

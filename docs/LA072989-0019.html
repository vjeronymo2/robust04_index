			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIGHT BROUGHT HAPPINESS TO EVERYBODY BUT FANS  </P> <P> So, the over-hyped Tyson-Williams "fight" is officially over -- and everybody's  happy! Right? Wrong!  </P> <P> Promoter Don King is happy: another rich purse.  </P> <P> Atlantic city host Donald Trump is happy: He was introduced to the crowd before  the charade.  </P> <P> The referee now has 39 fights in his resume. We still don't know how many were  championship caliber; this one sure wasn't.  </P> <P> Challenger Williams spent 93 seconds in the square circle and left a  millionaire.  </P> <P> Champion Tyson leaves the ring as a multimillionaire, plus a $100,000 cash  bonus from Don King for the controversial knockdown.  </P> <P> Everyone's happy! Right? Wrong! The crowd had every right to jeer and boo -- it  was a ripoff.  </P> <P> Add the jeers and boos from the HBO audience, and the decibel count goes off  the meter.  </P> <P> DAVID C. PHILLIPS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

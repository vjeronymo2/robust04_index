			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (XINHUA) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began routine safety checks at  nuclear power facilities in South Korea Monday [18 April].    Two IAEA inspectors, Bodadilla Muchino of Mexico and I.  Acquah of Ghana, arrived here Sunday for a week-long inspection  of nuclear reactors as well as nuclear processing facilities.    They started their official duties by examining documents  and  records on management and storage of nuclear fuel and comparing  them with on-the-spot field studies.    The inspectors will change the batteries and film of  surveillance equipment and seal some areas where necessary.  Storage of used nuclear fuel will also come under investigation.    The IAEA conducts routine inspections every two months of  the  heavy-water reactor at wolsung and every four months of the  other eight light-water reactors, according to official sources.    At present, nine nuclear power stations are operating in  South Korea.</p>

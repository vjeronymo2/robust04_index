			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos has said  that at the Corfu summit the Greek Presidency will promote the  beginning of negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European  Union [EU]. He described the recent EU Council of Foreign  Ministers's evaluation as particularly encouraging. According  to the evaluation, the Twelve blamed Turkish intransigence. EU  Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek reiterated this position in  Ankara.    Venizelos said it is becoming a common view that the  procedure for Cyprus' accession to the EU and the speed of this  procedure cannot be held hostage by the Turkish occupation of  the island and by Turkish Cypriot and Turkish intransigence.    Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will meet European  Commission President Jacques Delors and Cypriot President  Glavkos Kliridhis tomorrow night.</p>

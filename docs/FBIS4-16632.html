			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior member of Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk's staff said Kravchuk's possible decision to put the  extent of his authority before a national referendum would be  "logical" and "absolutely constitutional."    "Since parliament has not solved the problem of presidential  powers, Kravchuk will appeal to the people," Nikolay  Mikhalchenko told INTERFAX on Monday.    Earlier Kravchuk said he would not stand for the next term  of  presidency in the June 26 elections because the future  president's powers had not yet been delineated. Last month,  parliament passed a law, which would give local councils to be  elected on June 26 all executive authority in their respective  regions and would dismiss regional presidential envoys.  Kravchuk believes the president would then effectively cease to  be head of the Executive Branch.</p>

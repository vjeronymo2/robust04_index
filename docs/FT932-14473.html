			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Management: The rise and rise of profit-related pay - Carrots for employees Britain's workers are increasingly involved with their companies through government-backed financial participation schemes. An estimated 3m of them are covered by various forms of profit sharing and are in receipt of shares or options worth around Pounds 10.2bn. The most spectacular growth, however, has been in the area of profit-related pay (PRP). Figures due to be published by the Inland Revenue tomorrow will reveal that about one in 20 workers - 1.3m people - are now covered by 4,500 PRP schemes. Introduced in the 1987 Budget, PRP only really took off after Norman Lamont, the chancellor, doubled tax relief on the scheme two years ago and the government published model rules to help employers. Since 1990 the number of PRP schemes has tripled. PRP provides all full-time employees in a company with tax-free payments worth up to Pounds 4,000 a year or 20 per cent of salary, whichever is the lower. The scheme has to be registered with the Inland Revenue and is subject to detailed regulations with the 20 per cent part of the worker's pay 'profit related'. 'PRP is not an incentive system but deliberately designed to make basic pay more variable,' says Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting. 'It provides employees with tax-free money equivalent to a 7 per cent pay rise,' he adds. 'PRP has become a major attraction of profit sharing over the past year because it can boost net pay at a time when the cash for normal pay awards is not available,' explains David Shonfield at Incomes Data Services. Gallaher, the tobacco company, Norwich Union, an insurance concern, and Nationwide Anglia, a building society, were among the early converts to PRP. The growth has come despite last August's move by the Inland Revenue to close a tax loophole that had enabled companies to link their annual calculation of what was profit pay to other factors, so allowing an annual bonus to be paid tax free. Experts thought this might slow down the spread of PRP, but that does not appear to be the case. Up until now the vast majority of PRP schemes have provided workers with a tax free bonus on top of their basic pay. But there are signs of a change, particularly since the Revenue's tightening of the rules. Some companies in the current pay round are offering PRP's as part of the basic pay offer. Others are introducing the concept of salary conversion. 'This is much closer to the original intention of PRP', admits Friedman. Clearly companies in financial trouble are unlikely to win much support from their employees for PRP, but the size of the tax advantages do provide some flexibility for companies whose profits fall. PRP is not the only government scheme on offer to companies which want to involve their employees more directly in their financial performance. And in a show of the broad industrial and political consensus on this subject a joint bid to encourage their spread will be launched tomorrow by Lamont, Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, and Howard Davies, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. According to the recently published official 1990 workplace relations survey, 55 per cent of trading sector workplaces are covered by some form of worker financial participation scheme. The first scheme, a profit-sharing trust scheme, was introduced in Denis Healey's 1978 Budget and came into force a year later. It enables companies to provide a discretionary allocation of shares to full-time employees of more than five years' standing. The maximum value of the shares that can be given to one worker is Pounds 3,000 or 10 per cent of earnings, whichever is the greater, up to an Pounds 8,000 ceiling. The shares are held in trust by the company for at least two years before they can be sold, but workers must wait a further three years before they can sell their shares without tax liability. The latest statistics show there are 1,012 such registered schemes in existence covering 800,000 workers. In 1980 came the Save As You Earn Option Scheme. This also covers all employees in a company. They pay monthly contributions of between Pounds 10 and Pounds 250 for a five-year period into a bank, building society or national savings account. The eventual lump sum can be used to acquire shares at a 20 per cent discount to the current market price prevailing at the outset of the scheme. No income tax is payable on the options exercised at the end of the five-year saving period. There are now 1,058 such schemes covering 470,000 workers. The Discretionary Share Option Schemes under the 1984 Finance Act is confined to an elite of managers and directors. Options can be granted to a full-time employee over shares worth up to four times the individual's annual earnings, or Pounds 100,000, whichever is the greater. If options are exercised more than three years but no more than 10 years after they are granted, the proceeds will be tax free. According to today's Institute of Management Survey the number of managers and directors covered by share option schemes rose to 34.7 per cent of the sample survey from 29.2 per cent in 1992. Less popular in Britain because of the meagre tax benefits are Employee Share Ownership Plans. Under these, companies establish a trust elected by the workforce, which acquires and distributes shares to workers. A recently published government survey suggests the majority of the above schemes would never have been created without the lure of tax relief. But it also points out that competitive pressures, rapid technological change and the need for more employee flexibility have all encouraged companies to introduce financial participation schemes.</p>

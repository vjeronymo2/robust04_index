			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY TO PAY BUILDER OF JAIL $2.2 MILLION TO SETTLE LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors agreed Tuesday to pay $2.2 million to settle a  lawsuit brought by the company that built the newest jail at the Peter J.  Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic.  </P> <P> The Boise, Ida.-based contractor, Morrison-Knudsen, contends that the county  was responsible for delays in completing the 1,600-bed medium-security facility  that ultimately required the company to devote more time and work to the  project. The $16-million jail was finished in October, 1987, 96 days behind  schedule.  </P> <P> Morrison-Knudsen blamed the delay on faulty designs and claimed that the county  owed it $7 million more for additional labor and overhead not included in the  original contract. A lawsuit to recoup the money was filed in September, 1988.  </P> <P> In a report to supervisors last month, Internal Services Department Director  William F. Stewart said a detailed analysis by his department, a construction  management consultant, county counsel and a private law firm representing the  county showed that Morrison-Knudsen's claim had some merit. Negotiations to  settle the lawsuit out of court have been under way for about a year.  </P> <P> Morrison-Knudsen's attorney, Jack W. Fleming, could not be reached for comment  Tuesday, but the report to supervisors notes that both parties agreed to settle  the case for $2.2 million.  </P> <P> Jim Abbott, the Internal Services Department's senior deputy director for  construction, said the design phase of the project, which normally takes up to  one year, was completed in several weeks because the county was under a court  order to relieve overcrowding at its downtown Los Angeles jail.  </P> <P> Had more time been available to review the drawings, errors would have been  found and corrected before the construction phase of the project, Abbott said.  </P> <P> The design problems were compounded by a change in project managers during the  third month of construction, Abbott said. The county's original manager died.  </P></p>

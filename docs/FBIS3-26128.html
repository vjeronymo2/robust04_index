So far, some 100 citizens have made purchases under the new  credit system, buying color televisions, air conditioners and  refrigerators. After paying one-sixth of a product's purchase  price, customers should pay off the balance owed within a year.    The service is staged by Shanghai Yintong Trust Ltd.,  jointly  funded by the Shanghai Investment and Trust Corporation and  other local and Hong Kong partners.    It is stipulated that customers with monthly incomes above  600 yuan can apply for the installment plan. They may begin to  buy goods on credit after passing a Yintong Ltd. capital and  credit assessment.    Shanghai First department store, which experimented with  installment sales last November, has offered consultancy to more  than 2,000 interested customers.    Many consumers think that the plan can help them make  reasonable family economic arrangements and relieve their  worries over price hikes.    This month, three other shops in the city have also adopted  the measure.</p>

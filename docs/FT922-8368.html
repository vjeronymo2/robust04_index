			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Observer: Sour note While we're talking about interfering newspaper barons, Lord Stevens's annual bash for the great and the good at the Savoy Hotel yesterday wasn't quite up to scratch. There was nothing wrong with the guest list. Everyone from the Daily Telegraph's Conrad Black and the BBC's Michael Checkland to Chris Patten and Kenneth Clarke turned out to listen to the United Newspapers' proprietor. But why was Stevens handing out free copies of the Pick of Punch? Not only has he himself just closed the 150-year-old satirical magazine, but the book is published by one of his arch rivals, Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins.</p>

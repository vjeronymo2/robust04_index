			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Cardenas fails to inspire, but is still a threat on poll legitimacy: Trailing third, the left's man talks of civil protest if there is electoral fraud - Mexican Elections He campaigns tirelessly around Mexico's countryside and cities, going to as many as 10 rallies in a 14-hour day. He almost never smiles, his face deadly earnest as he relentlessly criticises the governing party and what he sees as the country's deteriorating economic and social conditions. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of Mexico's leftist Democratic Revolutionary party, was for a long time considered the most serious threat to Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) in the election next month. He came close to winning the presidency in 1988, is the son of Mexico's most revered president, and offers the clearest alternative to the PRI. But with less than a month to go before the election on August 21, Mr Cardenas is now trailing a distant third in the opinion polls, and victory looks beyond his reach. Unlike in 1988, his campaign has generated little excitement, and his calls for social justice and democratic transition have largely fallen on deaf ears. His solemnity and lifeless style contrast sharply with the fiery Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential candidate of the centre-right opposition and at present the main, if distant, threat to Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling party. Even some aides to Mr Cardenas admit their disappointment with his campaign, and despite the recent moderation of his economic polices, his inability to appeal to younger, middle-class voters. 'The government has convinced the upper and middle classes that Cardenas would be disastrous for them.' says Mr Adolfo Aguilar, Mr Cardenas's spokesman. 'We have failed to come up with a strategy to counter this.' Mr Cardenas's popularity, which had steadily fallen since the 1988 election, plunged after the first ever television debate held between the country's main presidential candidates more than two months ago. He failed to respond to harsh attacks on his record as governor of the state of Michoacan, and was widely perceived as weak and inarticulate. But even in third place, Mr Cardenas represents a threat to the ruling party's hopes of taking power in a peaceful environment. While the other opposition leaders appear ready to accept a PRI victory, Mr Cardenas has been adamant in his refusal to legitimise an electoral system he believes is biased in favour of the governing party. Last week Mr Cardenas refused to sign a pre-electoral pact of civility with the PRI, saying he would await the outcome before agreeing to sign any accord. Recently he has attacked Mr Jorge Carpizo, the interior minister, for being too partisan to the PRI, and was alone in rejecting the government's appointment of a new special prosecutor for electoral affairs. He says that if there is fraud in the election, he will mount a campaign of civil protests - as he did in 1988. Although he denies that a threat is intended, he has agreed to send observers to attend a convention on democracy next month hosted by rebel Zapatistas in the state of Chiapas, raising fears of possible co-operation between his party and the Mayan insurgents. 'He could get up to 7m votes,' says one official from the PRI. 'If he can mobilise 5 per cent of that after the election then there could be trouble.' Since the debate Mr Cardenas has focused his campaign on poorer agricultural parts of the country. His hope is that the steady fall of incomes and impoverishment of most agricultural workers over recent years will loosen the ruling party's hold on the rural vote. On the stump, Mr Cardenas attacks the government's policies of reducing agricultural subsidies and allowing communal farmers to sell their plots to private landowners. He said in a recent interview that subsidies and land reform enabled agriculture to prosper for so long and could do so again. Mr Cardenas's electoral strategy is risky because the PRI traditionally has dominated the rural areas, winning more than 65 per cent of the vote in more than 80 of the 110 rural districts in the country in 1988. Mr Cardenas, perhaps because fraud was more prevalent in the countryside, won the overwhelming majority of his votes in the cities in 1988. But with Mr Zedillo and Mr Fernandez clearly ahead in the cities, Mr Cardenas has decided to gamble on a change in traditional voting patterns. 'We are hoping for a high proportion of the votes of farmers who have been hurt by the current administration,' he said. 'I expect that we will have a better chance of defending the vote this time in the countryside.' If Mr Cardenas has his eyes on circumstances after the election, he may be calculating that disgruntled peasant sympathisers will be ready to demonstrate in his favour. Some Cardenas aides reckon the peasant revolt in Chiapas at the beginning of the year may inspire poor farmers to join Mr Cardenas in protests against electoral fraud. Mr Cardenas is adamant that he will not endorse violence. But there seems little doubt that if he believes fraud has robbed him of votes, he will protest the result and challenge the legitimacy of the victor. What is uncertain is how much support he will have.</p>

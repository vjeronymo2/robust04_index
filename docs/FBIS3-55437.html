Found Themselves Faced With the Market"]    [Text] The first week of the new year has literally made  every inhabitant of Kazakhstan face up to the market. The  policy pursued by the republic's government last year of  artificially containing inflation and the attempts to protect  the population by means of the usual "socialist distribution  methods" ended in failure. Kazakhstan has adopted extraordinary  measures to regulate the funds channeled into consumption.    Journalists have called the decree of the State Commission  for the Introduction of a National Currency, published here  during the first days of January, "the first dose of shock  therapy" in the republic. According to this decree, wages and  all forms of remuneration will now be coordinated strictly with  the amount and quality of work done. So Kazakhstan's experiment  in "distributive entry into the market" is over. What is  essentially the first attempt, founded on market laws, to lay a  reliable foundation for increasing the amounts of output, goods,  and services produced has begun.    The aim set by the Kazakhstan Government is more than  obvious, although the local press is in no hurry to comment on  the deep-seated reasons for what happened. Moreover, the true  dynamics of the inflation which gripped the republic were  persistently concealed from the republic's inhabitants for many  months. It is vexing that the unprecedentedly large increase in  food prices announced 5 January also passed without comment in  the press. For example, the cost of one liter of milk increased  sixfold! This means that one more good intention of the  republic's government -- that "everything will be settled as  before" -- has burst. The fixed prices introduced by the  republic's government two months ago in connection with the  switch to a national currency have failed to withstand the  pressure of inflation. All fixed prices, with the exception of  bread prices, were abolished as of 5 January. This means that  Kazakhstan is the first country in the Central Asian region to  abandon regulated food prices and has been forced to let them  float freely.    "Russia has survived a price shock, and Kazakhstan will also  cope with it," local journalists sympathizing with the  parliamentary bloc of optimistic marketeers commented on the  present situation.</p>

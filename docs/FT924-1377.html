			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Arts: Janice Watson - Recital Unfair penalty is paid by singers whose recitals are timed to fall in the closing days of the Edinburgh Festival, as visitors already tend be leaving the city. I missed Janice Watson's recital there this year and was doubly sorry when she went on to win several awards for it - a particular distinction, given that 1992 was such a good year in that department. Whether her programme in the Purcell Room's Song Series was the same, we were not told. But it was so well tailored to what this young singer does best that one imagines some of the items at least must have travelled down from Scotland. As we know from her operatic appearances, Janice Watson is a soprano who has a warm lyric voice with plenty of appeal on its own account and this recital, by and large, was used to put it in the limelight. In the opening group of Liszt songs those awkward German consonants which can get in the way of a singable vocal line were surreptitiously tucked aside. This is one way to sing a piece like 'Kennst du das Land?' (not the favourite version, but its alternative) though Goethe's poetry gets rather short shrift. It was on the level of pure singing that she was operating and the choice of the Three Petrarch Sonnets to follow confirmed that priority. For these are technically demanding songs, which stretch the voice. The young Margaret Price used to sing them with a fearless, shining beauty; Miss Watson is a less individual talent, but she has the fullness of emotion in her voice and hits a particularly well-controlled area right up on the top notes where other singers struggle. The close of the first song soared to its apex with grace, leaving her time to make music as well as get the notes. That was a facility which came in useful for her Russian songs after the interval, notably a delectable Rakhmaninov 'By the window', given a properly sensuous piano accompaniment by Iain Burnside. Here and in the Tchaikovsky items a heart really started to beat in words and music alike. Janice Watson will be singing Tatyana in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin for Welsh National Opera next year and the character was clearly in embryo already here.</p>

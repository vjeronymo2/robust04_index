			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Lamont rules out early cut in interest rates: Treasury report notes flickers of recovery MR Norman Lamont, the chan-cellor, yesterday ruled out an early cut in UK base rates after a Treasury report noted flickers of recovery in the UK economy. In the first of its monthly monetary reports, the Treasury highlighted a string of positive signs for the economy, including stronger retail sales and money supply growth, but said these stood in contrast to depressed consumer and business confidence. The report, part of an initiative to reduce secrecy in economic policymaking, said consumer spending showed no signs of weakening following sustained growth in the money supply since July. After it was released, Mr Lamont said it was right to be cautious on interest rates while the economy was showing 'encouraging signs', but warned against over-optimism. 'It is always extremely difficult to spot the turning point and we have had some false dawns before, as the world well knows,' he said. 'We have seen narrow money move to the top of the target range and I think it is right to be cautious.' The report pointed to upwards trends in retail sales, car registrations, exports and imports. It also highlighted less promising signals. Unemployment would continue to rise for the near future, it said, and the housing market showed no sign of a recovery. Although the report drew no conclusions on whether the economy was recovering, Mr Lamont said he had 'no doubt' the country was benefiting from recent interest rate reductions. The full effect of cuts in mortgage interest rates would become apparent in January when reduced charges would apply for owner-occupiers whose repayments change on an annual basis. However, the Treasury is expected today to receive a downbeat view about growth next year from its economics prospects panel, set up earlier this year to improve contacts between the Treasury and the business world. According to the report, world inflationary pressures remain subdued. Underlying inflation and earnings growth continue to decline, it said, even though October saw the first effects of sterling's depreciation in higher import prices and a pick-up in producer input price inflation. Mr Lamont emphasised that recovery was 'strongly under way' in the US and said a bigger proportion of British exports went to that market than those of any EC country. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'Buried in the Treasury's new report is the admission that unemployment is rising and the property market still declining. The chancellor must now admit that unless action is taken, 300,000 more jobs are at risk.' Economists, who had been hoping for more commentary and analysis, said they were disappointed with the report. 'It doesn't really get us any closer to Treasury thinking,' said Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu.

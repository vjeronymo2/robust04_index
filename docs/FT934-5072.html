			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Few tax changes but 20% band extended - Allowances THE MEASURES The chancellor left unchanged the personal allowance for income tax, the threshold for higher rate tax and the income limit for the age-related allowances. He did not make any changes to the inheritance tax threshold and the exempt amount for capital gains tax. Lower, basic and higher rates of income tax remain the same as before, but the 20 per cent lower band will be extended by a further Pounds 500 next year to Pounds 3,000, as announced in March. The blind person's allowance, frozen for the last four years, will rise next April from Pounds 1,080 to Pounds 1,200. Tax relief on the married couple's allowance (and the other allowances and reliefs linked to it) is already due to be limited to 20 per cent with effect from next April (1994), but Mr Clarke said yesterday he will reduce it still further to 15 per cent from April 1995. The lower earnings limit for Class 1 National Insurance contributions is to be raised to Pounds 57 a week and the upper earnings limit to Pounds 430 a week, from April 1994. The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with tax relief rises from Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 76,800 from April 1994. IN DETAIL Personal tax allowances have been frozen at Pounds 3,445 for those under 65 years old, Pounds 4,200 for those aged 65 to 74 and Pounds 4,370 for those aged 75 or more. The threshold for capital gains tax stays at Pounds 5,800, while inheritance tax comes into force at Pounds 150,000, as before. The lower rate tax of 20 per cent will apply to the first Pounds 3,000 of taxable income, while the higher rate (40 per cent) threshold remains at Pounds 23,700 for the fourth year. THE BACKGROUND There had been plenty of speculation that the Chancellor might either make quite radical alterations to the income tax structure, or else raise the appropriate thresholds in line with inflation, now at 1.4 per cent. However, he left the personal taxation position largely unchanged. Next year (1994-95) will be the third year in a row that the personal allowance has been left at Pounds 3,445. Mr Jeremy Hancock, senior tax manager at Price Waterhouse, said: 'The freezing of the higher rate tax band since April 6 1991 is equivalent to erosion in real value terms of between 7 and 8 per cent, while the freezing of the personal allowance for the last three years is equivalent to erosion in real value terms of 3 to 3.5 per cent.'</p>

Official results issued by  the Supreme Court on Monday [14 March] gave the Action Committee  for Renewal (CAR) 36 seats, making it Togo's leading political  party after last month's two-round vote. Seven seats went to  its ally the Union for Democracy (UTD), giving them an absolute  majority in parliament which has 81 members. The Togolese  People's Rally (RPT) supporting military ruler Gnassingbe  Eyadema got 35 seats, and another pro-Eyadema movement, the  Union for Justice and Democracy, won two.    CAR chief Yao Agboyibor immediately hailed the result as a  victory for the Togolese people and said he was sure Eyadema's  consultations on the appointment of new government leaders "will  lead to choices in line with the voting. Any other outcome  would be a scandal."    Agboyibor, 51, a lawyer, was widely expected to be Eyadema's  choice as premier, since under the Constitution the head of  state has to pick a prime minister from the parliamentary  majority. But UTD leader Edem Kodjo sent shockwaves through  opposition ranks within hours of the results being announced  when he repudiated a mid-election pact with the CAR. He  reopened the bidding by stating flatly that nobody could claim  the 41-seat absolute majority in Parliament without his  movement, and the UDT was not simply to be accounted part of  just any coalition. "We want our friends in the CAR to take us  seriously," he said. "We are a pivotal party and intend  remaining so." [passage omitted]    Agboyibor and Kodjo had a meeting scheduled for Monday but  it  was cancelled.    Eyadema, who took power in 1967 as army chief of staff after  leading a coup in 1963, accordingly began consultations with all  party leaders on Tuesday with his supporters in an upbeat mood.  They remembered their forecast when the two main opposition  parties set up a joint front last month that it was only a  "facade of a coalition and will break up at thefirst  opportunity."    The opposition split has given him more freedom of manoeuvre  and he may well push for a government of national union. He has  argued for such a system as a cure for the tiny West African  state's economic ills and tribal strife since his re-election as  president last August. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Iva Toncheva report] </F>   [Text] Sofia, January 31 (BTA) -- For nearly an hour and a  half, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and his  Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati who this afternoon  arrived on a three-day formal visit here, conferred on  bilateral, regional and international issues. "Bulgaria and  Iran have traditionally friendly relations," 'Ali Akbar Velayati  told the press after the meeting. The ministers agreed to  continue to promote bilateral relations in trade, economy and  culture. "We firmly believe Bulgaria and Iran can further  strengthen relations," the Iranian minister also said.    Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov said the sides paid  special attention to economic relations, as lately bilateral  trade and especially Bulgarian exports have seen a significant  decline. Bulgaria reaffirmed interest in the construction of a  transport corridor linking Burgas (on the Southern Bulgarian  Black Sea coast), Poti (Georgia) and Iran. "We agreed on more  intensive contacts between the economic ministries," said  Daskalov. The Iranian delegation includes the first deputy  minister of trade who will tomorrow hold meetings at the  ministries of trade, finance, transport and at the Bulgarian  Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During Velayti's visit the  sides are expected to sign a Bulgarian-Iranian trade and  economic Accord. On Wednesday morning Daskalov and Velayati  will sign a protocol on cooperation between the two foreign  ministries.    Daskalov denied a report in a Tehran newspaper that Velayti  would raise the issue of announcements that Bulgaria violated  the Yugoembargo. "We briefed the Iranian side on the Bulgarian  stance on the Yugoconflict, which is well-known, on Bulgaria's  relations with its neighbours and on Black Sea economic  cooperation. The Iranian side reiterated their stand on the war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on relations within their region,"  said the Bulgarian foreign minister. The sides also discussed  the killing in Sofia last December of four Iranians, two of whom  illicit drugs dealars, who confronted the police. Two Bulgarian  police were also killed. "We raised this issue and the two  sides reaffirmed their interest in clarifying the case. I  think, the investigation will make things clear," said Daskalov.    In response to a question, Velayati reaffirmed the Islamic  nations' stance in favour of a deployment in Yugoslavia of  peacemaking troops under UN auspices. "This is our stance taken  at the meeting in Pakistan, and we've been closely adhering to  it," said the Iranian foreign minister.    'Ali Akbar Velayati tomorrow will be received by President  Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and National Assembly  Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov.</p>

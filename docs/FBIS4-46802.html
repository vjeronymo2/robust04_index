			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Alexandr Lebed by Viktor Perushkin; </F> place and date not given: "`Russia Would Not Survive Another  War'"]    [Text] The eighth round of negotiations between  Russia and Moldova on the withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army  contributed no appreciable changes. The presence of the Russian  military in the Dniester region is, as before, exasperating the  leadership of Moldova, whereas General Lebed, commander of the  14th Army, continues to exasperate the leadership of the  Dniester region. There has long been talk in the republic about  the speedy posting of the army commander to a new assignment.  All this was discussed in an interview given to our special  correspondent Viktor Perushkin by General Aleksandr Lebed.    [Perushkin] Has it not become tedious for you being a  general  in an out-of-the-way place? You once studied with P. Grachev,  after all, and together with him fought in Afghanistan and  defended democracy in August 1991. Have you not been offered a  general's position in the "Arbat Military District?"    [Lebed] There never have been and never will be such offers.  I have never stooped and have never served either general  secretaries or the president but have served, am now serving,  and will continue to serve the Fatherland. My current  appointment is entirely suitable for me personally. And in  Moscow I might not blend in with the capital's generals. None of  this is up to me, nor am I fit for the role of entourage man. I  am used to being myself and walking alone.    [Perushkin] Aleksandr Ivanovich, a truce has held in the  Dniester region for two years now. Is such a method of conflict  settlement possible in Abkhazia, say?    [Lebed] In the Dniester region, as distinct from Abkhazia,  the conflict was not of a national coloration. Moldovans,  Russians, Ukrainians, and Bulgarians took part in the war on  both sides. The similarity, however, is that in both places  people fought and continue to fight for their rights, which, on  a wave of pure nationalism, are being flouted in the most  loutish fashion. It is sufficient to say that the cause of the  conflict here was the Language Act. More than 30 percent of the  Russian-speaking population living on the territory of the  former Moldavia had to speak Romanian.    [Perushkin] But today, Chisinau maintains, Moldova's policy  has changed for the better. How far does this correspond to  reality?    [Lebed] At first sight, truly, common sense would appear to  be starting to conquer. But all is not that simple. The result  of the war in the Dniester region (and this was a real war) was  a deep rift between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Only time can smooth  over it, and trust will be restored very slowly. That  commonsensical people have entered the parliament of Moldova is  a first step toward this.    [Perushkin] So Moldova has taken it. The Dniester region?    [Lebed] The leadership of the Dniester region has expressed  its readiness for negotiations, but in practice nothing has  changed. Nonetheless, the visit of V. Vasev, authorized  representative of the Russian president, whose purpose is the  rapprochement of the positions of Moldova and the Dniester  region, should, I believe, produce positive results in the very  near future. Adopting a combat posture forever is impossible.  Unless radical measures are adopted, no good will come of this.    [Perushkin] The truce that set in two years ago is linked  with your arrival. Your appearance in Abkhazia, let us suppose,  would produce a similar result.    [Lebed] Let us start with the fact that the 14th Army has  been here since 1956. I was sent here at a time when the war was  in full swing. I lay claim to no laurels in this situation. The  sole thing I have understood in going through Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia is that in all such situations tough  measures need to be adopted instantly. This is a guarantee that  blood will not be shed for any length of time. You can fight for  two years and lose five to 10 persons a day. Not many, it might  seem, but in a year the number of those who have perished  amounts to 3,650. And this matter can be settled once and for  all, with a loss of 100 men, with one brutal strike. I am a  supporter of this policy here, in the Dniester region, also, and  I have been able to prove its soundness. But it cannot be said  that the same tactics are suitable in just any instance,  including in Abkhazia. It is always necessary to proceed from  the situation, but spinelessness in policy always has severe  repercussions.    [Perushkin] Judging by your approach to conflict solution,  you are a hard man. Is this actually the case or is it a  defensive reaction?    [Lebed] I derive absolutely no pleasure from being forced to  adopt harsh measures since I am one of those officers who has  had in their life their fill of fighting--this is as far as it  goes. It is simply essential to settle all political  disagreements at the negotiating table, but there are moments  when words are left hanging in the air. It is then that the  moment for decisive actions comes. But this does not mean that I  am a supporter of war. The point is that our state would not  survive a third war in one century. We have lost a substantial  part of our gene pool as it is, and if this continues, the  nation will perish.    [Perushkin] It is a poor soldier that does not dream of  becoming a general. You have become one. What next?    [Lebed] This saying continues. It is a poor soldier that,  having become a general, stops being a soldier. I will say one  thing: Several years ago the Afghan mujahidin would not have  dared think even of attacking the USSR, today they are preying  on its borders. Our state has become an ailing emaciated  elephant that all kinds of rats and hyenas have begun to bite.  The state has always been associated with a potent army. It is  by no means necessary to wage war, but the presence of such an  army is a guarantee of the security of the Fatherland. And as  long as the world has existed and continues to exist, there has  always been and will always be respect for the strong. I  subsequently see it as my mission, therefore, to strengthen the  Armed Forces in the interests of our state. I will look like a  dumb cook praising his own broth, perhaps, but the best minds  and the best workers will be bought or destroyed unless a  professional army is created.    [Perushkin] Is this the explanation for your reluctance to  play politics?    [Lebed] Absolutely right. I have never set myself the goal  of  ascending to some political heights. But today's situation in  the Dniester region forces me to look into all matters. I cannot  switch the points anywhere. There is a Russian Embassy, but it  is in Chisinau. Of course, the ambassador and the consul are  regularly in Tiraspol, but questions arise daily, and they have  to be tackled.    [Perushkin] You have not developed a relationship with the  leadership of the Dniester region. Who does not suit whom in  this situation?    [Lebed] There is total reciprocity here. Perhaps internal  matters should not concern me, but my army, which has to live,  is in the republic. A great deal of matters arise in this  connection, and this is, naturally, disliked.    [Perushkin] When will the question of the withdrawal of the  14th Army be decided?    [Lebed] The point is that when an army of one state is on  the  territory of another, this is always bad. Should this army be  withdrawn? Undoubtedly! But when this army is withdrawn will  depend on the political and economic conditions for its  withdrawal that have been created. At this stage these  conditions have not been created. I do not, therefore, have an  official decision on the withdrawal of the 14th Army.  Consequently, the army will be here a while yet.</p>

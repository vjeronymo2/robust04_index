			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: CSR surprises market with ADollars 558m assets writedown CSR, the Australian building and sugar company, yesterday surprised the markets by announcing a ADollars 558m (USDollars 419.50m) asset write-down. Mr Alan Coates, chairman, said the write-down, representing about 10 per cent of total non-current assets, was in line with a subdued outlook for the company's businesses. He said it followed an extensive asset review 'imposed on directors' by revised Australian accounting standards. The relevant standard, AASB 1010, obliged directors to ensure that non-current assets were not recorded in accounts at amounts exceeding recoverable values. CSR's stark interpretation of the revised accounting standard raises the possibility of a series of large write-downs by other leading Australian companies. With an offsetting upward revaluation of ADollars 186.4m on CSR's land and buildings, the effect will be to reduce shareholders' funds by ADollars 372m, or 46.5 cents a share. The company showed shareholders' funds of almost ADollars 3.2 in its March 1991 balance sheet. Announcement of the write-downs initially sent CSR shares tumbling by 14 cents to ADollars 4.68 on the Australian Stock Exchange, but they later recovered to close at ADollars 4.76. Mr Coates said the write-downs came from independent valuations, where appropriate. 'The company's drive for continuous improvement in the production and distribution of its products, as well as the recession-induced reduction in demand, have led to the closure of a number of plants, requiring reduction in their value to that of their estimated worth on disposal,' he said. 'There has also been a considerable fall in the value attributed to the goodwill and trademarks of some CSR activities. 'Recent changes in perceptions of economic growth in the countries in which CSR manufactures and/or sells its products have added greatly to the uncertainty attached to the value of the company's assets, particularly where significant intangibles such as goodwill are involved.' Almost ADollars 216m of the write-down came off goodwill, with another ADollars 120.6m off patents and trademarks. The next biggest item was a ADollars 193.5m reduction in plant and equipment values. Mr Coates said one positive outcome would be to improve CSR's future profitability by around ADollars 15m a year through lower depreciation and amortisation charges. He indicated that, under the accounting standards, the upward valuation on land and buildings would go into capital reserves. The ADollars 558m write-down of other asset categories, however, must be dealt with through the profit and loss account. 'Without other action, the write-down would leave a negative balance in the retained profits of the company, which would preclude payment of a final dividend this year and seriously impair the ability to pay future dividends,' Mr Coates said. 'CSR's directors consider this is not justified. To remove this constraint on CSR's capacity to pay future dividends, we propose seeking court approval to use ADollars 558m of the share premium reserve to offset the loss and so reinstate retained profits to their previous figure. 'Even after using this ADollars 558m, the share premium reserve will exceed ADollars 900m.'</p>

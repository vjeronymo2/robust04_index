			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARL'S JR. TO BEGIN TV ADS IN SPANISH  </P> <P> The Carl's Jr. smiling star will soon greet guests in Spanish.  </P> <P> A new Spanish-language TV campaign will be launched this week to reach Latinos,  primarily in Southern California. Even the chain's founder, Carl N. Karcher,  will test his Spanish skills in the ads, when he signs off with: "Los  esperamos." Translation: "We're waiting for you."  </P> <P> Certainly, Carl's Jr. waited a long time before aiming directly at the Latino  market. This marks the first time the Anaheim-based fast-food chain has  targeted Latinos in TV ads, even though Latinos account for more than 40% of  its business. Rival chains such as McDonald's and Burger King -- which have  much larger ad budgets -- have advertised in Spanish for years.  </P> <P> "We couldn't afford to advertise to this market until now," said Bob Wisely,  group vice president of marketing at Carl's Jr. Now, the company has  discovered, it can no longer afford not to.  </P> <P> The chain, which is owned by Carl Karcher Enterprises, will spend about  $800,000 on the Spanish-language campaign this year -- a fraction of its  $20-million ad budget.  </P> <P> But ads on Spanish TV stations are relatively inexpensive, Wisely said. The TV  ads, which generally feature families eating at Carl's Jr. restaurants, will  appear locally on stations KMEX-Channel 34 and KVEA-Channel 52.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, workers at about one-third of the chain's 540 units will soon be  wearing smiling-star buttons that say: "Bienvenidos a la estrella." That means  "Welcome to the star."  </P> <P> Menu boards at many locations also will be translated into Spanish.  </P> <P> More than half the chain's hourly workers are Latino, but none of its officers  or board members are, Wisely said. "That's obviously something we need to work  on," he said.  </P> <P> Marketing experts generally say that Carl's Jr. is making a good, albeit tardy,  move.  </P> <P> "Their competition has been at it for a while," said Ray Durazo, partner at  Moya, Villanueva &amp; Durazo, a Los Angeles research firm specializing in the  Latino market. "But if their campaign is unique enough, they might be in a  position to rise above the background noise." One recent survey indicates that  Latinos in Southern California are very aware of Carl's Jr. Some 200 heads of  Latino households were recently asked to name their favorite fast-food  restaurant. A total of 70% named McDonald's, but the same number that named  Burger King -- 8% -- also named Carl's Jr. "Considering they haven't been  advertising to Hispanics," said Roger Sennott, general manager at the San Diego  research firm Market Development Inc., "that's pretty remarkable."  </P></p>

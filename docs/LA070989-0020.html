			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE EVOLUTION OF SPIKE LEE;  </P> <P> 'DO THE RIGHT THING' IS A TRIUMPH OF FILMIC MATURITY FOR A YOUNG  WRITER-DIRECTOR-EDITOR  </P> <P> In his pungently funny trailer for "She's Gotta Have It," Spike Lee, its  mosquito-legged writer-director-editor, was discovered on a street corner in  his trademark baseball cap, hightops and oversize glasses, peddling "Tube  socks, tube socks, three for fi' dollahs." His rap was simple: You bought a  ticket to his movie, you kept Lee off the streets and maybe he could stop  selling these tube socks.  </P> <P> With the arrival of his preternaturally assured "Do the Right Thing," Lee's  third feature, even those whom the movie riles up will have to concede one  thing: Spike Lee is safely out of the tube sock business.  </P> <P> Each of Lee's films has been a progression, however nothing he has done before  quite prepares us for the richness of "Do the Right Thing," for the  picture-puzzle interlocking of its characters, for their organic, explosive  humor or for Lee's enormous assurance. It is one of those leaps that are  sometimes called quantum, but may be simply the broad strides of a man born to  make movies, which Lee, quite clearly was. The leap that "Do the Right Thing"  represents from the two earlier features is roughly equivalent to the one  Martin Scorsese made from "Who's That Knocking on My Door?" to "Taxi Driver."  It was only eight years in time, '68 to '76, but light-years in the director's  power, his focus, his visual and story-telling sophistication.  </P> <P> Scorsese? Spike Lee? The accepted comparison, I suppose, would be to Melvin Van  Peebles (the early 1970's Van Peebles of "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song")  or to Woody Allen, for their comic stance and their work as writer-directors,  or writer-director-actors. Yet there's something seditious and Scorsese-like to  "Do the Right Thing," something about heat and intensity and a purely New York,  faintly surreal vision. And something in the beautiful camera work of Ernest  Dickerson, Lee's customary cinematographer, may recall the opening of "Alice  Doesn't Live Here Anymore," or moments from "New York, New York."  </P> <P> What is stunning to consider is the speed with which Lee's technique has  matured. Certainly having more money to work with is part of the equation, but  Lee's control seems to have increased a hundred-fold with each film. It seems  impossible that "She's Gotta Have It," shot in 12 days in 16mm black and white,  was made only three years ago.  </P> <P> A brash sex comedy, it made money for its distributors, which, considering the  fact that it had cost $175,000 to make and had been invited to the New  Director's corner at Cannes, shouldn't have been hard.  </P> <P> To look at it in the light of "Do the Right Thing" is to to wince at some of  the other male performances, to groan at that dud color dream dance sequence  and to see how Lee sometime killed his own jokes with undue fussiness.  Nevertheless, some of his concerns were already in place: he was interested in  different types within the same strata, and humor was clearly going to be his  weapon.  </P> <P> "School Daze" (1988) was set in a college not unlike Lee's own Morehouse. It  took on color and class, apartheid and divestiture; perceived caste differences  between dark- and light-skinned blacks; skirmishes between the college kids and  townies, and political differences between young radicals and faculty members.  It was a lot to do in a light vein, and it confused some audiences.  </P> <P> But its final dreamlike sequence, in which all segments of a divided campus are  brought together by an alarm bell and told to "Wake up!" "School Daze" was a  clear precursor to the issues of "Do the Right Thing."  </P> <P> "Do the Right Thing" is certainly about the black community's need to come  together, but Lee wants everyone, not just the black community who knows it by  heart, to understand the simmering mess that race relations are in right now.  It's a situation that has been papered over, avoided, denied or lied about  during eight years under the Reagan Administration. The inner cities seem a  remote part of the Bush agenda.  </P> <P> So Lee's way of ringing that alarm bell is a 24-hour visit to the  Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the year, shot in  colors that look like a reflection from hell itself.  </P> <P> "Do the Right Thing" is complex, bravura movie making. It is also hugely  entertaining, since fortunately for us, Lee's seditious method is to use humor  to carry his biting message. The film's enormous amount of humor is satiric,  physical, sometimes inside, sometimes throw-away, but pervasive. It is attitude  as much as anything else; a wry philosophical bent that has let more than one  race get the best of the seemingly unendurable.  </P> <P> As he has before, Lee works with a cross-section but, more ambitiously this  time, he writes from different ages, voices, races and attitudes. What gives  the film its flint is watching those attitudes strike up against one another.  </P> <P> Lee forces us at every point to readjust our opinion of characters, to question  them, to see that within even the most seemingly simple person are  contradictions and shadings. The pizzeria's Sal (Danny Aiello), so proud that  over 25 years, the kids in this neighborhood have grown up on his food, can be  looked at as solid and sincere in what he says, or, I suppose, as a man  paternalistic as a plantation owner, whose slaves fed at his table, too.  </P> <P> Ossie Davis' unofficial Mayor and Ruby Dee's Mother Sister are the block's  sages -- yet the Mayor, who's also a genial alcoholic, is not exactly revered  by a quartet of teen-agers on the block. In reply to an almost sentimental  speech by the mayor about the pain of listening to his hungry children cry (its  written sentiment stripped away by Davis' innate power), one of the teen-agers  tells him it isn't gonna be that way for children of his, because he's going to  have a job.  </P> <P> Mother Sister can, for one instant, be caught up by the excitement of a looting  spree, and in the next, screaming in soul-deep pain over what that really  means.  </P> <P> Mookie, much of whose appeal comes from the fact that Lee plays him, is at the  same time a lover and an absent father, a calming presence in his job at Sal's  Famous Pizzeria . . . and the igniting factor in the riot. And even there, his  actions can be interpreted two ways. Sal might believe that Mookie's lobbing a  garbage can through his plate-glass window just at the moment when a mob was  advancing on Sal and his two sons was diversionary. Mookie might see it as his  expression of pure fury over the death of his friend, minutes before. If "Do  the Right Thing" is about racism, it's pan-racism. This once-Italian  neighborhood is now mostly black, partly Puerto Rican; it has a pizzeria built  and owned by Italian-Americans and a flourishing fruit and vegetable deli owned  by recent Korean immigrants. Least we look on this as the melting pot in  action, about mid-way through the heat-wave, everyone suddenly lets loose.  </P> <P> In one of those customary Lee moments when characters address the camera  directly, there's suddenly an orgy of invective: a black slanders Italians, an  Italian turns on blacks, Puerto Ricans defame Koreans, a white lets loose  against Puerto  </P> <P> Ricans and a Korean derides Jews. The effrontery of it will remind you of Lenny  Bruce, Lee's use of it is almost calmly reportorial. You think things are going  well here? Think twice.  </P> <P> In Lee's view, there are no clear-cut heroes or villains, only multi-layered  men and women with intensely human frailties, a point that reportedly worked  against the film at Cannes with the jury's president, Wim Wenders. Frankly,  having seen (and hugely admired) the Cannes winner, "sex, lies and videotape"  and "Do the Right Thing," the scope, the complexity and the accomplishment of  the two films is in no way comparable. "Do the Right Thing" wuz robbed.  </P> <P> Some people are complaining that Lee should be less ambiguous than he is with  his film's last 10 minutes. Well, defending "Da Butt," a dance number in  "School Daze" that cheerfully celebrated pride in anatomy, Lee replied to his  critics at that time with a prickly open letter printed in Harper's Magazine,  the most moderate part of which read: "Just because I present problems, some  people expect me to solve them. That's really unrealistic. It's a burden I  won't assume. I am 30 years old. I don't have all the answers, and don't  pretend to. That's not my job. We intended this film to provoke discussion,  which is what it's doing. . . . If we don't address problems, they don't get  talked about and solved."  </P> <P> At the very least, "Do the Right Thing" is going to get important things talked  about. It would be a shame if, in the process, people lost sight of the fact  that it is also blisteringly fine film making.  </P></p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Euro-commercial Paper: Diversity hampers liquidity growth THE Euro-commercial paper market may have failed to fulfil ambitions of matching the Dollars 500bn US CP market for size and liquidity, but it can at last claim to be a reasonably profitable market for participants, and an efficient source of funds for rated borrowers. The level of outstanding Euro-commercial paper is close to Dollars 90bn, having grown slightly in the last year or so, according to bankers. Mr Len Harwood, head of capital markets at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects the market to benefit from a shift of investors towards the short end of the yield curve. 'The market could grow by around 20 per cent over the next year,' says Mr Harwood. However, the lack of a homogeneity, as in the US market, will continue to hinder the development of a large, liquid Euro-CP market. Although most programmes are still denominated in US dollars, multi-currency programmes have become increasingly common. In particular, the portion of the Euro-CP market denominated in Ecu has risen substantially to around 15 per cent and is set to expand further. At the same time, the liberalisation of regulations has allowed active domestic commercial paper markets to develop in a number of European countries, such as France. Although such diversity could be said to fragment liquidity, it also increases the market for borrowers. The Euro-CP market has also become increasingly credit-sensitive, so the bulk of outstanding paper is rated A1/P1 or above. This has limited the size of the issuer base, while some borrowers' problems in rolling over commercial paper has encouraged companies to establish stronger back-up lines. However, Mr Warren Spar, managing director at Lehman Brothers, says 'companies are refinancing more expensive, Libor-plus, bank debt in the commercial paper market'. The trend is selective, though, since 'the importance of credit rating continues to grow'. Structural changes have diverted the market from a self-destructive path. The departure of a clutch of market participants, such as Merrill Lynch and Warburg, has helped ease excessive competition. Also, the application of a commission-based structure, similar in concept to the fixed-price re-offer mechanism in the Eurobond market, has helped restore margins. Fees for placing commercial paper now average around five basis points. For large European companies, the US commercial paper market still offers greater flexibility, because it is bigger and more liquid. The US CP market is 'an easier market in which to write big tickets,' according to David Sloper, manager of Abbey National's dollar portfolio. In the longer term, the trend most bankers hope to see, as deregulation accelerates, is for the border between US and Euro-CP to blur so that a global commercial paper market develops.</p>

AFRICA POLICY REVISED  </P> <P> The city's South Africa purchasing policy, adopted in May, has been revised  after city staff members experienced problems implementing it.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Board of Directors adopted revisions suggested by Directors  Chris Holden and William Paparian. Among the revisions:  </P> <P> Cash purchases under $500 are exempted. Originally, the policy involved all  city money.  </P> <P> City staff members are allowed to buy products from companies doing business in  South Africa if all suppliers of the product conduct business there.  </P> <P> Purchases without which the delivery of city services would be seriously  impeded are allowed.  </P> <P> Even with the revisions, Director Paparian said the city has one of the  strictest South Africa policies in California.  </P></p>

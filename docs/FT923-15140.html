			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (8): Much lost time has to be made up - Poland The most successful part of the country's privatisation drive has been through liquidation. Since 1990, some 540 state sector businesses employing 180,000 people have taken this path The lions and other animal acts performing in Polish circus arenas this summer will be privately owned, for the first season in over 40 years. It may not seem much to get a trained seal off the state's books. But the state circus occupied a special place in the communist propaganda armoury and its change of status is a landmark of sorts on Poland's faltering path to a market economy. In past months such landmarks have been few and far between as the previous government headed by Mr Jan Olszewski dithered and allowed the process to slow. The new government will have to appoint a strong political personality to head the privatisation ministry and give his programme top priority if the lost time is to be made up. Mr Jan Ledochowski from SG Warburg, the London-based merchant bank, which is the main adviser to the Polish government on privatisation says that the legislation for mass privatisation and the creation of investment funds to manage the newly privatised share portfolios is ready and awaiting a government decision. The main problem is that forming a government could still be a lengthy process, and even after government approval the legislation could still face a possibly lengthy and tormented passage through parliament. The most successful part of the privatisation drive has been through liquidation. This is the process under which the ZPR circus, for example, was privatised last autumn. Since 1990, some 540 state sector businesses employing 180,000 people have taken this path. In essence, it marries a leveraged management buy-out with an employee equity stake and sometimes an outside investment from small private business. The snag for the government is that most of the 540 privatisations under the liquidation scheme are small units such as industrial design bureaux where capital equipment requirements are low and the value lies in the expertise of the staff. This illustrates the general rule that privatisation has gone quickest wherever capital requirements have been low and skills developed in the past could be easily redeployed. This explains the speed with which domestic and foreign trade has been privatised. Some 80 per cent of the country's retail outlets are in private hands, most of them family businesses in premises rented from local councils. Some wholesale sectors have been privatised. For example, 80 per cent of domestic trade in steel products and 40 per cent of all registered imports were run by private traders. The main difficulties concern sales of industrial assets especially the large factories. Initially, it was thought that speedy disposals could be achieved by sales of shares through public offers to domestic investors and trade sales to foreign companies. But investor interest has waned in line with a steady decline of share prices on Warsaw's stock exchange and the failure of most of the 13 quoted companies to pay a dividend this year. Foreign investment last year trickled in through a succession of trade sales which raised about Dollars 150m and transferred relatively modern plants such as Pollena Bydgoszcz, a detergents plant, to Unilever or domestically recognised brand names such as Wedel, a chocolate manufacturer, to PepsiCo foods. This year, however, the upheaval at the Privatisation Ministry which accompanied the change of government last January delayed talks on further sales with foreign investors. Prospective clients held off to see how the situation would develop. At the same time, Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, the new minister instituted a network of consultation procedures down to the shop floor which delayed sales decisions. Meanwhile, opinion polls show that opposition to privatisation is growing. In September 1990, CBOS, the government's own polling unit, reported that 43 per cent of the population said privatisation would serve the interests of the economy. Last month a mere 18 per cent were still convinced. Against this background, privatisation through foreign investment this year has been meagre. ABB, the Swiss Swedish power plant producer, bought 51 per cent of the equity in the Elta transformer factory in Lodz for Dollars 10.4m, and CPC, the US company which produces Knorr and Marmite, bought Amino, a dehydrated foods processor in Poznan for Dollars 8.8m. The biggest deal to date has been Fiat's Dollars 2bn stake in the FSM plant in southern Poland. FSM produces Fiat's new Cinquecento model and the latest deal should bring in further foreign investment by Fiat's own suppliers keen to have a cheaper production base from which to serve the Cinquecento assembly line. Several large deals are in the pipeline and ministry negotiators remain optimistic. 'Most of the 30 trade sales we were expecting in the first half of this year are going to happen,' says Mr Michal Rusiecki. He points to pulp and paper, power engineering, edible oils and possibly telecommunications as areas where sales are expected. All this will not be enough to achieve the target of placing most of the economy in private hands by the middle of the decade. Hence the need for the ambitious mass privatisation plan which aims to put some 400 companies representing 25 per cent of industrial sales under western management through a framework of investment funds. The funds could well be established in the autumn according to Mr Jerzy Thieme, at the Privatisation Ministry who with help from SG Warburg has designed the plan. Mr Thieme reports that interest by prospective western managers is still there and initial financing has been promised by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. However, the scheme could be subjected to a reappraisal by the incoming government as well as delays from the most unexpected quarters. President Lech Walesa, a keen advocate of privatisation, has his own plan which includes a projected 10-year interest-free loan worth Dollars 10,000 to every citizen in the form of coupons which would be repayable after 20 years in cash. The president, apparently unaware that there is a shortage of funds to cover such a loan, recently suggested that the sum should be increased five fold. His aim is to lift the privatisation programme as well as bolster his support in the country. But if he persists the most likely net result would be to hold up the mass privatisation programme on which so much time and ingenuity has already been expended.</p>

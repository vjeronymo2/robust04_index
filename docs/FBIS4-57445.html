			<p>BFN     [Text] Manizales -- The National Coffee Growers Association  received with satisfaction and moderate optimism the report that  coffee prices had closed at $1.45 a pound on international  coffee markets.    The Association believes the government should take  advantage  of those circumstance to adjust coffee prices to a point more  equitable than that existing when the world quota agreement was  interrupted.    Association sources reported Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes  as saying that if this price holds for at least 30 days, the  government would consider a new adjustment.    In addition, the Cooperative of Caldas Coffee Growers has  reported a drop in local reserves and that the marketing of the  mid-season crop has been reduced by 500,000 arrobas compared to  the same period last year.</p>

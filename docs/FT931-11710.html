			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Spain's government bonds top performance league EUROPE'S higher-yielding government bond markets topped the bonds performance league in January, according to figures from JP Morgan Securities, helped by the relative stability within the European exchange rate mechanism. Spain was the top-performing government bond market last month in both local currency and US dollar terms, with a return of 3.29 per cent in pesetas and 3.56 per cent for dollar-based investors. Italy was the second-best performing market in local currency terms with a gain of 2.82 per cent, followed by the Ecu market with a return of 2.46 per cent. 'The higher-yielding European markets . . . outperformed other government bond markets during January, pointing to the fact that high-yield investment strategies may be coming back into fashion,' according to JP Morgan. The Bank of Spain cut its intervention rate from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent in January, helped by the combination of economic weakness and the stability of the peseta. 'In both Italy and Spain, restrictive fiscal policies continue to weigh on economic activity, and Europe's recession has dampened the positive effects on trade position resulting from the recent currency devaluations' (of the peseta and lira), according to JP Morgan. Most of the European central banks lowered interest rates, either through the official interest rate or by indirect market intervention, last month. The US dollar depreciated against the Canadian dollar and most European currencies, helping to enhance foreign bond returns for US-based investors.</p>

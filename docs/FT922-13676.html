			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Observer: Up and away Shareholders of SmithKline Beecham who wept for the fate of chairman Henry Wendt under a prospective Labour government can dry their crocodile tears. His pay has just been upped by a healthy 93 per cent, taking his reward for his efforts at the drug company last year to a round Pounds 1.8m. Amid the uproar at this generosity,accountancy firm Grant Thornton was rude enough to point out that under a Kinnock government Wendt could be Pounds 272,000 poorer than if the Tories were returned to power. What everyone has neglected to consider is that Henry Wendt is domiciled in America. Observer hopes he slept well last night.</p>

Calibration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA has proposed a requirement that trustee officials calibrate WTP values derived from CV studies to ``actual'' WTP. The Department is aware of a number of studies examining the relationship between ``hypothetical'' WTP and ``actual'' WTP. In this work, an effort is made to calibrate hypothetical WTP values derived from CV studies to actual WTP. The results of this work are not definitive and are based on CV studies of a lower quality survey design than would be required under NOAA's proposed rule. However, because of uncertainty associated with CV estimates, the Department is soliciting comment on whether the calibration requirement in NOAA's proposed rule should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language requiring calibration is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The survey instrument or analysis method shall provide a factor for calibrating hypothetical WTP to actual WTP. The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected calibration factor. If the survey instrument or analysis method fails to provide such a factor or the trustee(s) fails to document the rationale for the selected factor, actual WTP shall be presumed to be one-half of stated WTP. 59 FR 1183. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As NOAA's preamble recognizes, the proposed default factor was included for the purpose of soliciting comment. 59 FR 1146. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department seeks comment on a number of questions regarding the calibration of CV results. Is a calibration requirement necessary in light of the other proposed standards for survey instrument design and development, survey administration, and nature of results? Is a calibration requirement warranted given that, but for the difficulties in elicitation, willingness to accept (WTA) would be a more appropriate measure of damages than WTP? The economics literature concludes that, for changes in the provision of a public good, the difference between WTA and WTP depends on the availability of substitute goods. The fewer substitutes available, the greater the difference between WTA and WTP. See W.M. Hanemann, ``Willingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept: How Much Can They Differ?'' American Economic Review, vol. 81, pp. 635&hyph;647 (1991). This result suggests that WTP may significantly understate WTA, the more appropriate measure of damages for natural resource injuries. The Department also seeks comment on: The rationale for calibration or the justification for assuming that hypothetical WTP equals actual WTP; the appropriate default, if any, for a calibration factor; whether a calibration requirement should be included in a technical information document rather than in the rule; and whether inclusion of a calibration requirement is consistent with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision upholding the inclusion of all reliably calculated values in a damage assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Department solicits comments regarding whether marketing research which attempts to establish relationships between stated intentions to purchase and actual purchase behavior for private goods is relevant to the calibration of CV results for natural resource damage assessments. If commenters believe that research to be relevant, additional comments are solicited regarding the appropriate actual behavior with which similar relationships could be established the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies. Commenters should explicitly state the behavioral links between the suggested actual behavior and the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department wishes to emphasize to those who support the use of a default calibration factor that they should supply specific information to support whatever factor they believe the Department should adopt. The adoption of a definite calibration factor would have to be supported by information in the administrative record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Reporting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA has proposed a standard for reporting the results of CV surveys. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standard should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering for its type B rule, is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting.

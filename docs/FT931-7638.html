			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Thais to cut Middle East dependence THAILAND YESTERDAY outlined long-term plans to reduce its dependence on oil shipments from the Middle East, both by buying surplus energy from its neighbours and by building oil storage tanks and refineries in the south of the country. Mr Savit Bhotiwihok, the minister responsible for energy policy, told a meeting of the Petroleum Institute of Thailand that the government would focus on developing domestic and regional energy supplies to meet electricity demand which is growing by an annual 10 to 15 per cent - or by roughly 1,000 megawatts a year. He said he expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month with the government of Laos on the purchase of between 1,000 Mw and 1,500 Mw of electricity from proposed hydro-electric and coal-fired power stations in that country. By the end of this year, he added, Thailand and Malaysia could have completed negotiations on the sale of Malaysian gas to feed a power station with a capacity of about 1,800 Mw on or near their common border. A pipeline to the frontier area is already under construction on the Malaysian side. He said other possible sources of energy for Thailand included the offshore exploration zone shared by Malaysia and Thailand, the hydro-electric potential of the Mekong river, Burmese gas, and hydrocarbons from Cambodia and Vietnam. Mr Savit acknowledged that Thailand would continue to import oil from the Middle East but he raised the possibility of a European-style regional gas network and said: 'A lot of our effort nowadays is spent on studying the integration with our neighbouring countries'. The Thai government would vigorously support exploration and development of oil and gas fields in Thailand, and study the possibility of establishing a nuclear power industry. Development of lignite resources would also probably continue, but the government was unlikely to proceed with building new dams solely for the purpose of generating electricity. Mr Savit said that the Petroleum Authority of Thailand would be assigned to explore the possibility of building export refineries and establishing a 'huge' oil storage capacity in southern Thailand to 'stabilise' the regional oil market.</p>

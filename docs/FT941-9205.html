			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / SIB asks if market practice is sharp practice Last summer investment bank SG Warburg outraged institutional investors when it asked the Stock Exchange to prevent big shareholders driving down the price of British Telecommunication shares just before it auctioned the government's final stake in the company. The Stock Exchange considered the request but backed down after institutions accused it of helping to create a false market in BT shares. The dispute illustrates the problems confronting regulators eight years after the institution of benchmark legislation for the securities industry and for investor protection. Since then dramatic changes have overtaken the UK equity markets. There has been explosive growth in the use of derivative instruments; new techniques for raising equity finance have been adopted; foreign participants now play a leading role in market making and new trading systems challenge the traditional monopoly of the Stock Exchange. Yesterday the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, released a discussion paper asking whether some market practices, while aiding the profitability of some participants, were undermining the market. In particular, SIB is asking whether there is enough transparency of transaction for investors to know whether they are paying the right price for shares. It also asks whether there is enough transparency for derivative instruments based on those shares to reflect their value accurately. The paper asks whether some of the exchange's potential competitors, such as Tradepoint, benefit from the centralised market which it creates and ought to be required to contribute to its costs. Mr John Kemp-Welch, who will become chairman of the Stock Exchange in July, has identified such competition as the single greatest challenge facing the exchange. SIB's paper asks whether the sort of short selling that institutional investors engaged in before the BT3 offering is a form of market manipulation and whether measures should be introduced to limit the practice or make it more visible. Mr Andrew Large, SIB's chairman, acknowledges that significant commercial interests are at stake. For instance, marketmakers are not required to disclose the prices at which they agree to buy and sell large blocks of shares to each other via inter-dealer brokers' screens, to which access is restricted. Mr Roger Barton, managing director of business development at the London Financial Futures Exchange, said SIB's suggestion that those screens should no longer be restricted 'is the most important part of the SIB report'. He said Liffe had pressed the Stock Exchange in recent months for access to those prices. While the number of transactions made through the inter-dealer brokers' screens was not great, the value was significant. Without access to those prices, which tended to be inside the prices quoted on the exchange's own Topic screen, derivatives could not accurately reflect the cash markets they were intended to mimic. Another Stock Exchange rule which allows marketmakers to obscure the true value of securities is one which allows a 90-minute delay before the publication of any transaction in any stock which is three times its 'normal market size'. Marketmakers have argued that they should be allowed to hide the prices for the largest share purchases they undertake until they have reduced their risk either by selling the shares to a third party or through the use of derivatives.</p>

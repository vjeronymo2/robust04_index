			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Starting remarkably early at 6.30 (though admittedly it goes on until 10.30) Radio 3 relays a live concert performance of Lulu, from the Royal Festival Hall, London. This last opera of Berg's was unfinished at his death and completed by Friedrich Cerha. Lulu is a femme fatale who eventually comes to London as a prostitute and is killed by Jack The Ripper. Andrew Davis conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Patricia Wise is Lulu, and Wolfgang Schone plays the two roles of Doctor Schon and Jack The Ripper. BBC2 mounts a 50-minute documentary which agonises over the way that people have traditionally told jokes about mothers-in-law. Should we expect companion prog rammes about Irishmen, Newfoundlanders, and golfers? Take My Mother-In-Law starts at 9.30. Three old movies start at around midnight, the best being Elia Kazan's 1951 version of the Tennessee Williams play, A Streetcar Named Desire. Marlon Brando gives his famous 'method' performance as the boorish Stanley who rapes his sister-in-law (12.15 BBC2).</p>

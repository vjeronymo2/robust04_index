			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NHL PLAYER O'CONNELL SET TO COACH IHL TEAM  </P> <P> Mike O'Connell, a 12-year NHL defenseman, is expected to sign a one-year  contract today to coach San Diego's International Hockey League franchise after  being released from the remaining year on his contract with the Detroit Red  Wings.  </P> <P> Don Waddell, director of hockey operations for the unnamed San Diego Hockey  Corp. team, said Tuesday that the clubs have reached a financial agreement on  O'Connell and that he plans to introduce O'Connell, 34, at a press conference  today at the San Diego Sports Arena. Jim Devellano, Detroit's senior vice  president and former general manager, confirmed that it's almost a done deal.  </P> <P> "The whole thing took about one minute," said Devellano from Lake Placid, N.Y.  "I knew (Waddell) needed a coach. Mike was coming to the end as a player, and  it was an opportunity for him to continue on with the game. We didn't want to  stand in the way."  </P> <P> Waddell had narrowed his coaching choices to O'Connell, who has no coaching  experience, and Bob Hoffmeyer, a former coach in the New Jersey Devils  organization.  </P> <P> O'Connell played in Chicago and Boston before spending the last four years in  Detroit. He interviewed late Saturday in San Diego, and Waddell offered him the  job Monday.  </P> <P> "I was leaning toward him," Waddell said. "I decided who I felt was the No. 1  guy, and I wouldn't fly the other one out."  </P> <P> Waddell said he was impressed by O'Connell's work ethic and perseverance.  </P> <P> "He came highly recommended by numerous personnel in the NHL," Waddell said.  "He's a hard-nose, blue-collar worker. No one expected him to play even one  season. He's 5-feet-9. For defense, that's small, but he uses his smarts. You  don't play 12 years in the NHL if you're dumb."  </P> <P> Neither team would say how much it cost to settle the remaining year on  O'Connell's player contract. Waddell said the average salary in the NHL is  $200,000 and that a player of O'Connell's level would probably command at least  that much.  </P> <P> "We're not in a position to buy out his whole contract, but the difference of a  few thousand isn't going to keep me from hiring him," Waddell said.  </P> <P> It may be a good deal more than that. Waddell said he had originally budgeted  approximately $50,000 for his coach, but the IHL team will have to absorb part  of his player contract and also compensate the Red Wings.  </P> <P> "It's getting up there," Waddell said. "It's more than I had planned."  </P> <P> Said Devellano: "I don't want to get into dollars, but there was an  accommodation made between San Diego's and Detroit's hockey clubs."  </P> <P> O'Connell was in San Diego looking at homes but was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> The search for a name for the team has been narrowed to three -- the Gulls,  Sharks or Breakers -- and they have been submitted to an artist for logo  considerations.  </P></p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Amsterdam Equities have managed to remain resilient to the turbulence in Europe over recent months. With the reporting season due to begin next week - DSM results are expected on August 3 - it is possible that strength will be maintained. However, Kleinwort Benson forecast last week that it was difficult to see the market continuing to outperform the rest of Europe. 'The limited cyclicality of the index and the fact that only a modest economic recovery is expected in Holland is likely to become a drag on performance,' it said. Maintaining a neutral weighting, Kleinwort's noted that the expected strong growth in corporate earnings had already been discounted. 'We remain of the opinion that the current enthusiasm for the market's defensive qualities will be short-lived, as investors are likely to turn their attention towards more cyclically geared markets in the coming months,' it said.

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHWALD LAYS CLAIM TO CHUNK OF 'NET PROFIT' ON 'COMING TO AMERICA';  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE HUMORIST SAYS THE EDDIE MURPHY FILM EARNED $39.8 MILLION EVEN BY  HOLLYWOOD'S UNIQUE DEFINITION. HE AND HIS PRODUCER WANT UP TO $14.6 MILLION.  </P> <P> Preliminary audit figures released Wednesday by attorneys for columnist Art  Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim suggest that, far from losing $18 million  on the hit Eddie Murphy comedy "Coming to America," Paramount Pictures Corp.  earned a "net profit" of $39.8 million as of last December.  </P> <P> Buchwald and Bernheim's share of that net ought to range between $6.9 million  and $14.6 million, Pierce O'Donnell, their attorney, asserted in documents  filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> "You've got to misread the agreement to get to those figures," said Robert  Schwartz, an attorney with O'Melveny &amp; Meyers, which represents Paramount  in the case. "The studio's reaction is that their claims are baseless and  unfounded. The studio is confident that (the trial judge) will see this as a  transparent attempt by Mr. Buchwald and his attorneys to walk away from an  agreement negotiated by his agent who, by the way, was the head of the William  Morris Agency.  </P> <P> "As to the auditor's claims regarding 'Coming to America' expenses, they're  meritless." The humorist and his producer blamed the $58-million gap between  what Paramount says the picture earned and what they believe that it earned on  radically different methods that Paramount accountants and Buchwald's own  auditor, Philip Hacker &amp; Co., used to compute production costs, interest  expense and income on the motion picture.  </P> <P> Paramount, for example, puts a $58.5-million price tag on the production, or  so-called negative, cost of the movie, while Buchwald's calculations allocate  only $22.9 million to make "Coming to America." Payments of $1 million for  Eddie Murphy's entourage, $900,000 for excessive fringe benefits and a uniform  15% "overhead" charge assessed to the entire production budget -- amounting to  $8 million of the negative cost all by itself -- should not be included in the  cost of making the movie, O'Donnell said.  </P> <P> The brief points out that $1.65 million of the $8 million in overhead "was  merely for writing gross participation checks to Eddie Murphy and (director)  John Landis."  </P> <P> Paramount has maintained for months that, contractually, it owes nothing to  Bernheim or Buchwald because the movie has earned no "net profits," as those  profits are defined in their contract.  </P> <P> Until last January, Paramount executives held that neither Buchwald nor  Bernheim had any contractual claim at all to the 1988 box office hit. Buchwald  sued, charging that the movie was based on an eight-page treatment that he sold  to the studio in 1983 about an African king who comes to the United States.  </P> <P> In the film's credits, the screenplay for "Coming to America" is said to be  based on a story written by Eddie Murphy, not Buchwald.  </P> <P> In the first phase of a two-phase lawsuit tried in December, the 63-year-old  humorist proved to the satisfaction of Judge Harvey Schneider that he, not  Murphy, wrote the story upon which "Coming to America" is based. As a result,  the 1983 contract -- which calls for a payment of between 19% and 40% of net  profits to Buchwald and Bernheim -- is binding, Schneider ruled.  </P> <P> Paramount has said it will appeal Schneider's decision, but in the meantime  Buchwald's auditing team has been poring over the Paramount books to prepare  for a July 9 trial on the accounting for "Coming to America" -- the second  phase of Buchwald vs. Paramount. Wednesday's brief is the opening salvo in a  barrage of charges and countercharges that the studio and the Pulitzer  Prize-winning columnist are expected to level at each other in the weeks  leading up to that trial.  </P> <P> Buchwald auditor Hacker said the studio continues to withhold details of key  expense and income items, such as a breakdown of foreign box-office revenue and  videocassette sales. Given those figures, according to O'Donnell, his estimates  on the net profit total for the $300-million box-office winner could be even  higher.  </P> <P> But the biggest disparity between Buchwald's and Paramount's bottom line lies  in how the humorist and the studio define the term "net profit." O'Donnell's  114-page brief, which outlines a full-scale legal attack on the studio's  accounting procedures, didn't confine himself to criticism of Paramount's  bookkeeping. The brief took on the entire Hollywood studio accounting system,  as it has evolved over more than half a century.  </P> <P> The seven major film studios -- Columbia/Tri-Star, Disney, MGM/UA, Paramount,  20th Century Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. -- have employed a  "take-it-or-leave-it standard profit participation agreement" that makes it  nearly impossible for most creative personnel involved in a film's production  to share in the profits, according to the brief.  </P> <P> "These agreements are 'standard' because you cannot negotiate them, you cannot  get better terms elsewhere and your guild has been unable to get the studios to  make them a subject of collective bargaining," the brief reads. "Literally, you  can take it or leave it."  </P> <P> Such agreements, which writers in particular must sign as their entree to  Hollywood, define net profit participation in such a manner that even the most  successful motion picture rarely goes into the black because of expenses that  the studio purposely charges to the movie to maximize its own bottom line while  minimizing the writer's, director's, actor's or producer's return, according to  the brief.  </P> <P> The studio "exploits . . . ambiguities (in its own standard profit  participation contract) to the great financial detriment of profit  participants" and "abuses its awesome power and unconscionable contract terms  to manage the venture by making hidden profits, charging exorbitant interest  and utterly destroying any hope of 'net profits' by self-interested acts,"  according to the brief.  </P> <P> "Is Paramount right that Buchwald and Bernheim get only the leftovers -- a  worthless share of an $18 million deficit -- while Paramount reaps a financial  bonanza of at least $55.3 million?" the brief asked.  </P> <P> "Is Paramount right that under the applicable law, the court is powerless to  look behind the words of the form contract, which is the same one used by every  studio, to scrutinize how it was unilaterally imposed upon Buchwald and  Bernheim on a take-it-or-leave-it basis?"  </P> <P> DUELING AUDITORS  </P> <P> Auditors for Art Buchwald claim that the Eddie Murphy hit "Coming to America"  had a $39.8-million net profit, not an $18-million loss as Paramount Pictures  claims.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.43IN:2.55IN:2.99IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> ITEM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PARAMOUNT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> BUCHWALD/BERNHEIM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $125,300,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $160,600,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Distribution fees  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 42,300,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 54,800,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Distribution expenses  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 36,200,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 43,100,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Interest  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6,300,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Production costs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> ("negative cost")  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 58,500,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22,900,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> NET PROFIT (LOSS)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($18,000,000)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $39,800,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Buchwald attorney' brief  </P></p>

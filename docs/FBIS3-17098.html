It will help  Russian enterprises to survive.    On his return from Washington, where he signed an  appropriate  document with the U.S. secretary of commerce, Nikolay Yegorov  disclosed that over the next two years Russia will now be able  to supply the United States with up to 3,000 tonnes of uranium  concentrate and a considerable quantity of enriched uranium  worth a total of $150 million. Previously there were no  deliveries in view of the agreement imposed on Russia in 1992  whereby the export of Russian uranium was authorized only at  prices that were effectively 1.5 times the world prices, the  deputy minister emphasized.    Now an opportunity is opening up to resume sales on U.S.  markets, which will help Russian uranium-extracting enterprises  to improve their position. A special feature of the new  agreement is the establishment of a procedure for joint sales  whereby 50 percent of the Russian deal is combined with a  similar quantity of American sales, and this mixed uranium is  sold to consumers.    "The next two years will be especially difficult for  Russia,"  Nikolay Yegorov said. "So the extra sources of freely  convertible currency will come in very handy."</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Venezuela's GDP declines by 1% Venezuela's central bank has said that gross domestic product shrank by 1 per cent in 1993, compared with real growth of 6.8 per cent last year and 9.7 per cent in 1991. The large oil sector grew in real terms by 3.4 per cent thanks to large capital spending by PDVSA, the national oil company. However, the rest of the economy contracted by 1.7 per cent, the bank said. Inflation topped 45 per cent for the year, according to early estimates, against 32 per cent in 1992. The government's gross international monetary reserves now stand at Dollars 12.5bn, down 4 per cent from a year ago. This decline was quite small for a year marked by the removal of an elected president to face corruption charges, national elections earlier this month, a wave of bombings in the capital and general political tension created by two failed coups in 1992. The central bank estimated 1993 exports at Dollars 14.2bn, up slightly from the previous year, and imports of Dollars 11bn, down 10 per cent from 1992. The current account showed a deficit of more than Dollars 1.8bn, against Dollars 3.4bn in 1992. The public sector deficit was 3.6 per cent of GDP, an improvement on the 5.8 per cent deficit last year.</p>

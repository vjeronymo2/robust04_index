			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Forget the big motor - Diary of a Private Investor By Kevin Goldstein-Jackson ALTHOUGH a number of things in Norman Lamont's Budget were commendable, it was not enough to make it a 100 per cent guarantee of a Conservative victory at the general election on April 9. However, the introduction of a 20 per cent rate of tax on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income is a good hook with which to catch voters, especially with the lure of further reductions in income tax in the future. The proposals for extra support for poorer pensioners should be especially welcome. Pensioners on income support will receive an increase of Pounds 2 a week for single people and Pounds 3 for pensioner couples. As a private investor, I was rather disappointed that the capital gains tax threshold will be increased only from Pounds 5,500 to Pounds 5,800. This is less than was available in 1987/88 to single investors, who could then make capital gains of Pounds 6,600 before being taxed. Although married couples later were given their own individual capital gains tax allowances, rather than being taxed jointly, the maximum capital gains tax in 1987/88 was 30 per cent. Now it is 40 per cent. I was also disappointed that the chancellor did not abolish stamp duty on share transactions. Business expansion schemes will be abolished at the end of 1993. I will not mourn their loss. When they were introduced, I had hoped they would attract BES sponsors to find the next Body Shop, Pentland, Kalonor or ICI. Instead, few of the schemes backed people with innovative ideas and/or manufacturing activities. A number of schemes have lost all their investors' money. Others have produced a mediocre performance. Even some of the property-backed schemes are now having to pray for an upturn in the property market. Although some schemes did perform well for their investors (myself included), the disadvantage of having to tie up money for at least five years made me normally prefer to invest instead in quoted companies, where it was possible to 'get out quick' should there be signs of trouble. As I still have a few BES investments I will no doubt remain on the mailing list of BES sponsors for their 'last opportunity to make tax-free gains' promotions. I shall view these prospectuses with caution: they will have to offer something genuinely unusual and/or attractive to make me invest. The proposed changes in inheritance tax have made me look at some of my small company investments in the hope that people who are likely to inherit large stakes in those companies will have to sell them in order to pay inheritance taxes. Such sales might then have attracted a predator to the company, thus leading to an increase in their share price. The Budget proposed exemption from inheritance tax of holdings of more than 25 per cent in companies quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market and an improvement in the tax-free element of controlling interests in quoted companies. This could mean that some directors - who should hand over to innovative, non-family directors - will now cling on or pass control to family members who might be better suited to other activities. Some smaller company investments are thus less attractive than previously, although some might move into USM shares as a means of avoiding IHT. As a private investor, I wholly agree with Lamont's statement that 'savings are a passport to personal independence and security.' In the wake of Barlow Clowes, BCCI, the Maxwell pension funds and many other examples, I hope the government will announce proposals to increase security for investors by abolishing all the existing costly, bureaucratic City regulatory authorities and replacing them with a new, independent body which has very sharp teeth. My wife claims that as a result of the Budget she can now save me Pounds 5,000 by purchasing a very expensive car, since the 10 per cent car tax has been reduced on all cars to 5 per cent. I am not impressed by this claim, as I suspect that many dealers will simply reduce their current trade discounts and pass on perhaps only half the tax cut. The chancellor's removal of the Pounds 3,000 limit on the amount that can be invested in a unit or investment trust within a Personal Equity Plan is worth a cautious welcome - although it really just encourages increased collective investing rather than direct investment in shares by private investors. There are still uncertainties over the outcome of the election. Labour could still win and there might be a hung parliament. Now is not the time to invest - except in a few 'speculative opportunities'. Nor is it the time to spend money on a large car - we may need the money to emigrate, instead.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH WINDS TOPPLE TRUCKS, KNOCK OUT POWER, FAN FIRES  </P> <P> Strong Santa Ana winds raked Southern California on Tuesday -- particularly in  San Bernardino and Orange counties -- toppling big rigs on freeways, knocking  out electricity to tens of thousands of homes and fanning brush fires.  </P> <P> Just after dawn, gusts up to 50 m.p.h. prompted closure of Interstate 15  between Highland Avenue and Interstate 215 near Devore in San Bernardino County  for more than three hours.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol reported that wind blasts tipped several  high-profile vehicles on their sides in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.  Two were house trailers and the others were commercial tractor-trailer rigs.  </P> <P> "It's blowing like mad," said CHP Officer Dale Clark in San Bernardino. "The  Santa Anas are back with us again."  </P> <P> The National Weather Service reported sustained winds of 43 m.p.h. in Fontana  and up to 39 m.p.h., with gusts to 51 m.p.h., at Sandberg in the Tehachapi  Mountains. Sustained winds of 40 m.p.h. and gusts in the 60-m.p.h. range were  recorded at Laguna Park, east of Point Mugu.  </P> <P> Drivers of high-sided campers and trailers from Santa Barbara to Orange County  were warned to proceed with extreme caution. Motorists in the southern San  Joaquin Valley were warned of the additional hazard of blowing dust.  </P> <P> One of the more unusual wind-related events of the day occurred on California  60, west of Riverside, where a wind-driven rock crashed through the rear window  of a CHP car.  </P> <P> "The officer was just driving along on the freeway, and all of a sudden,  kathunk, a rock came through his back window," said CHP spokesman John Anderson  in Riverside. "The window's shattered, but the officer's fine."  </P> <P> Wind-related power outages affected an estimated 40,000 Southern California  Edison Co. customers from early Monday to Tuesday afternoon, according to  utility spokesman Kevin Kelley. Most of the outages were in the San Bernardino  and Ontario areas, in Orange County and in the Simi Valley and Oxnard areas of  Ventura County, he said.  </P> <P> About 5,000 customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were  blacked out Tuesday, with a heavy concentration of outages in Sylmar and  Chatsworth, according to DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen.  </P> <P> Downed lines sparked a brush fire in the Chatsworth area.  </P> <P> There were also three brush fires near San Bernardino, two minor blazes in  southwest Riverside County, three small fires in Ventura County and a large  fire in San Diego County.  </P> <P> By late Tuesday, firefighters had contained a blaze that scorched about 3,000  acres 20 miles north of downtown San Diego. Several ranch homes were evacuated  as more than 300 firefighters battled the flames with the aid of water-dropping  helicopters. But no homes were damaged, fire officials reported.  </P> <P> In San Bernardino, Battalion Chief John Benfield said the most troublesome  blaze burned about 120 acres on Little Mountain, about five miles north of  downtown. Thick smoke from the fire, which was controlled by 100 firefighters  after several hours, swirled across Interstate 215, impairing visibility for a  time and causing traffic tie-ups.  </P> <P> In Riverside County, 15 engine companies battled a 20-acre fire burning in  heavy brush and bamboo in the Santa Ana River bottom in the Mira Loma area  Tuesday evening. Fire officials said no structures were threatened.  </P> <P> In Orange County, the winds uprooted trees, caused sporadic power outages and  fanned a fire that broke out in a manure pile near a riding stable.  </P> <P> At the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro, winds were blamed for causing  "spontaneous combustion" in piles of horse manure belonging to a fertilizer  firm. Marine Corp Maj. Jim McClain said the fire broke out about 3:15 a.m. near  the base's riding stables, creating a heavy pall of smoke that blew directly  into a nearby housing project.  </P> <P> Some residents were evacuated to the El Toro Marine School until the blaze was  extinguished about two hours later.  </P> <P> The hot, dry winds were also blamed for a roof fire that caused $50,000 damage  to a house in Yorba Linda. Burning embers from the chimney ignited the shingles  of a residence in the 4500 block of Plumosa Drive, fire officials said.  </P> <P> In Mission Viejo, the planned groundbreaking ceremony for the start of the  $15.5-million Oso Parkway extension was canceled because of high winds. Plans  called for shuttling guests up to a hilltop vista to view the 1.7-mile route.  </P> <P> "The caterer suggested that there have been gusts up to 40 m.p.h. in the area,"  one organizer said. "You just got a lot of loose dirt in the area, and it would  have been difficult to have any formal ceremony under the circumstances."  </P> <P> Prospects for almost everything affected by weather should improve today,  according to weather forecasters, because the high winds are expected to taper  off.  </P> <P> Meteorologist Rick Dittman of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for  The Times, predicted that the high-pressure area over the Great Basin that  created the rush of winds toward the ocean will start to weaken.  </P> <P> The mercury reached a high of 75 at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Tuesday.  Relative humidity ranged from 51% to 15%. Forecasters said the high should  reach 80 today.  </P></p>

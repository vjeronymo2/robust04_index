			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gy. Attila Fekete: "It Was an Accident, </F> According to the Police"]    [Text] Police Lieutenant General Sandor Pinter, national  police commissioner, announced at his news conference that Gyula  Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, suffered a  traffic accident on 5 May, between Nyekladhaza and Emod on  Highway 3. The police investigation has been unable to confirm  rumors of foul play. After the news conference the defense  attorney for Horn's driver said that the police had not ruled  out foul play definitely.    As we have reported several times earlier, a Saab 9000 car  (registration number DFG-070) transporting Gyula Horn from  Miskolc to Budapest collided with a disabled IFA  [Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau] truck that was parked in the left  lane of the 159.7-km section of Highway 3, between Nyekladhaza  and Emod. The occupants of the Saab were: Gyula Horn, chairman  of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]; his driver Istvan  Mosolygo; and Horn's bodyguard, retired Police Major Jeno  Zsidei. All three suffered serious, but not life-threatening,  injuries.    According to the official police report on the inspection of  the scene of the accident, the disabled IFA truck had been  parked in the left lane--relative to the direction in which  Horn's car was heading--between 0.7 and 1.2 meters from the  road's center line.    In his statement to the police, the truck driver said he had  not parked at the side of the road to change tires because the  truck was hauling 80 quintals of canned food, and he was afraid  that the vehicle might overturn. In addition, it would not have  been possible to change tires on the road's soft shoulder. The  technical experts confirmed the truck driver's arguments. They  established that the truck did have a flat tire. In other words,  the truck had not been positioned there intentionally for the  subsequent accident. The tire on the right rear wheel of the  truck's trailer had a 46-cm rip that had been caused by fatigue.  By the weak light of a flashlight, the truck driver was just  loosening the nuts on the wheel when the Saab crashed into the  truck.    Two technical experts presented their findings at the news  conference. They had established beforehand, in agreement with  the Saab factory's experts, that the structural deformations of  the car's body and frame indicated an absorption of kinetic  energy equal to the energy generated by the car at a speed of 55  to 60 km per hour [kph], which in practice means that the damage  was what would have occurred had Horn's car crashed into a  concrete wall at a speed of 55 to 60 kph.    Of course, the truck's body likewise suffered serious damage  in the accident, and the Saab's kinetic energy slowed down  significantly also during the breakup of the truck's body. After  impact, the car kept skidding for about 40 meters and then  stopped. Technical expert Gabor Meleg concluded from all this  that, at the time of impact, the car's speed must have been  between 98 and 102 kph. Laszlo Vincze, the other expert,  estimates that the car's speed must have been between 85 and 109  kph. The car was equipped with an automatic braking system;  therefore it was impossible to determine at what speed the car  had been traveling before impact, and whether and when the  brakes had been applied before impact. However, reconstruction  of the accident on a computer excludes the possibility that the  Saab might have been traveling substantially faster than 100  kph. At a speed of 140 kph, the car would have landed in the  ditch on the right side of the highway, relative to the  direction in which it was heading. The investigation determined  that the Saab had just been returning from the left lane when a  third of its front end crashed into the truck. The police were  unable to explain why the Saab had been in the left lane. The  highway along the given section was straight, and the  possibility of drifting was ruled out. The police likewise found  no clue indicating that somebody on the side of the road might  have startled the car's driver, and that might have been the  reason why he wrenched the steering wheel to the left and  crashed the car. The police established that the flashes of  light Jeno Zsidei mentioned in his statement may probably have  been the glittering street lights in Emod.    The defense attorney for Istvan Mosolygo, who in the  meantime  has become a defendant, attended the news conference and  listened to the reports. Afterwards, with Police Lt. General  Pinter's consent, he outlined the line of defense his client  would offer. The gist of it is that from the very beginning the  police had regarded the crash as an accident and had not  investigated the possibility of foul play.    The police have recommended that the public prosecutor  charge  Mosolygo with causing a traffic accident through negligence. At  the end of the news conference, Sandor Pinter announced that,  until the end of the second round in the elections, he would  maintain his offer to provide a Mercedes--complete with  communications equipment, a driver and a bodyguard--for each  major political party, upon their request.</p>

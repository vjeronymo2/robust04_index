			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Equity Issues: Investors more choosy about buying US shares INVESTORS are getting increasingly choosy about buying US shares, if the results of some recent issues which had an international element are a guide  -a sure sign that the mass of US equity issuance that accompanied the stock market rally at the turn of the year is running out of momentum. Earlier this week, a planned sale by Phillips Petroleum, the US energy company, of shares in a gas subsidiary, GPM Gas, failed to get off the ground. That followed similar failures within the past month to launch share issues for Gulfstream Aerospace, Regency Health and Uniroyal. The lack of support for issues has revealed that investors are no longer prepared to take everything thrown at them from across the Atlantic. 'It's become a much tougher market,' one syndicate manager in New York commented yesterday. 'Investors are questioning whether or not the recovery is taking place. And with the sheer volume of deals there are, it is almost humanly impossible to assess them all.' The failure to find support for new issues of shares manifests itself in different ways. Some proposed issues are postponed from week to week, looking for the right moment to be launched. Others have emerged at prices well below those initially indicated. In spite of this, there are still some large US transactions emerging internationally. Earlier this week, for example, shares in Waste Management, the US waste disposal company, were priced, with about 26m shares placed in the UK (worth more than Dollars 260m). Next week, a Black &amp; Decker roadshow arrives in London to promote a near-Dollars 500m offering, Dollars 100m of it targeted at international investors.</p>

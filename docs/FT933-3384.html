			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pendragon shows 42% improvement to Pounds 3.07m PENDRAGON, the dealer in luxury and executive cars, yesterday reported a 42 per cent gain in interim profits, mainly reflecting higher margins. Pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds 3.07m in the six months to June 30, from Pounds 2.17m in the year-ago period, on sales which grew by 18.3 per cent to Pounds 119.6m (Pounds 101.2m) including Pounds 1.24m from acquisitions. Operating profits increased to Pounds 3.57m (Pounds 3.12m) and interest payments fell to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 949,000). Earnings per share came out at 6.1p, a 27 per cent rise on the 4.8p reported in 1992, after adjusting for the effects of the group's recent Pounds 16.6m rights issue. The interim dividend is being increased to 2.4p (2.2p). Despite this, Pendragon's results were less sparkling than some had expected and the stock closed 7p lower at 277p yesterday. Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said that although the overall new car market grew by 9 per cent in the first half, volume brands showed greater gains than the more expensive brands which comprise the majority of Pendragon's portfolio, and the registrations of some prestige marques, including BMW, Mercedes Benz and Porsche, actually fell. He said that although Pendragon's new car unit sales increased, profit growth was due mainly to increased margins. New car sales generated Pounds 4.6m in gross profits compared with Pounds 3.8m in the 1992 period, despite a small loss in the group's two dealerships in Frankfurt. Used car margins were at a similar level to the previous year, but profitability improved to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.6m) as a result of an increase in volume. Income from after sales operations increased again to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 8.1m), mainly due to the contribution from recent acquisitions and greenfield developments. However, the contract hire operations showed little change over the year-ago period with their profit contribution unchanged at Pounds 900,000. The group intends to use the Pounds 7m balance of of the rights issue proceeds to fund further expansion. In the meantime the funds have been temporarily used to pay manufacturers for deposits on new stock, thereby avoiding stocking loan interest but leaving the group with net borrowings of Pounds 4.73m. COMMENT Pendragon is expected to continue the selective acquisition programme which has transformed its franchise portfolio over the past three years. It now has its first Rover franchise and wants to add both Ford and Vauxhall to the list. The second half bias in results will be further emphasised this year because the upturn in the luxury market has lagged the general improvement, and because of other factors including the launch of Mercedes' new small car next month. Overall however, full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 7.25m are likely, producing earnings of 13.5p and a prospective p/e of about 20.5.</p>

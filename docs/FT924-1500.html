			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (7): Committed approach - Privatisation NO AFRICAN government is tackling privatisation with the enthusiasm demonstrated by the MMD administration. As a government of businessmen it has a strong ideological commitment to the programme underpinned by the more pragmatic consideration that subsidising inefficient parastatals is no longer viable. Within five years, the government plans to sell more than 150 state-owned enterprises, accounting for 80 per cent of economic activity. 'Almost everything you touch in this country is government-owned,' says one businessman. There are no sacred cows, although the minister responsible for privatisation, Mr Ronald Penza, attracted considerable flak, especially from the unions, when he announced that government would not retain a majority stake in either the copper mines or the public utilities. This stance may have to be revised since it might be impossible to sell the railways or Zesco, the Zambia Electricity Supply Co. Should it prove impossible to find buyers, on satisfactory terms, the Zambia Privatisation Agency, set up in August, will have to fall back on commercialisation. But its remit is clear: to get the government out of business and its board and officials are determined to do that. Nineteen small parastatals are currently under the hammer - with a combined turnover of K1.8bn - with competitive bids for 17 enterprises opened this month while the ZPA is negotiating the sale of the other two with minority shareholders. The initial 17 have a combined turnover of K1.8bn, although three are dormant operations and one, Prime Marble Products, is in the development stage. They include a dry cleaning business, a travel agency, vehicle spares and tyre firms and manufacturers of hardware, tin cans, plastics and pharmaceuticals. ZPA officials describe the response as 'overwhelming'. Over 180 tender packages were sold for the 15 companies about 15 per cent of them to foreign-owned firms. A total of 37 bids was received for the first six companies offered, including bids from Botswana, South Africa and a Swiss-French firm. In all six cases, management and employees submitted bids to buy-out the firms. While some would have preferred a bolder strategy, ZPA officials say the decision to launch the programme with small, easily saleable enterprises was not a 'soft option' strategy. 'We wanted to demonstrate beyond any possible doubt that we really are serious about privatisation,' says one official. This is in marked contrast to the previous administration's on-off approach. In any event, it was necessary to push ahead with relatively simple sales in order to satisfy donor pressure and comply with World Bank conditions. The July 1992 legislation to set up an independent privatisation agency to implement the programme - replacing the Technical Committee on Privatisation created by the Kaunda administration - has shifted it out of the political arena and into the hands of the technocrats. The agency will need to refer major policy issues - such as the timing and method of privatising ZCCM - to the cabinet, but operationally it is on its own. The parastatals will be sold as they stand. The government has no intention of investing in any restructuring programme arguing instead that this should be left to the new owners. This is a sensible counter to 'selling the family silver' critics, since buyers will be forced to inject new capital into the enterprises to turn them around. A number of grey areas are still to be cleared such as whether and how the government will retain control over strategic enterprises, such as the oil refineries. This could be done on a 'golden share' basis or by retaining enough equity to guarantee effective control. One thing is clear. The government wants to see ownership spread among ordinary Zambians through public share issues and employment share ownership schemes. Although no stock exchange is in place yet, the ZPA is determined to float at least one of the 32 firms scheduled during 1993. The prime candidate is almost certainly Zambia Breweries, in which Anglo American is the largest private sector shareholder, although others, such as Zambia Sugar Refineries, Chilanga Cement and the milling companies, could also qualify. Under the new banking act, the banks will able to operate as stockbrokers, trading shares for their customers. But commitment is not everything. The ZPA, whose top managers have been in place less than two months, is short of skilled personnel. It will not find it easy to market some 50 companies within the next year, especially since Zambia has no domestic capital market while bank liquidity is under pressure as part of the anti-inflation programme. A worry is whether enough buyers will materialise to keep privatisation on track. 'It will be interesting to see how the 37 who submitted their bids plan to finance the takeovers,' says a banker, warning that 'they don't qualify as bankable prospects'. Lurking in the background are familiar political worries. Drought, recession and the restructuring of the economy has led to large scale retrenchment in a country in which only 360,000 people are employed in the formal economy. The parastatal sector employs 95,000 of these and as many as 40 per cent could lose their jobs once the new owners take control. This has the hallmark of political dynamite which is why a the ZPA will next year be marketing not just the companies but also the concept of privatisation.</p>

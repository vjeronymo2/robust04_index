			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Compagnie des Eaux sees earnings up 17% COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the largest of France's two water distribution companies, yesterday estimated that profits rose 17 per cent last year, slightly better than most analysts were expecting. The group said it expected net profits to rise to around FFr2.6bn (Dollars 460m) from FFr2.22bn in 1990, on turnover up by just over 15 per cent to about FFr135bn. Cash flow was unchanged at FFr9bn. Of total sales, FFr36.5bn were made abroad. Within that, FFr25bn was in Europe, up from FFr18.7bn in the previous year, said the group. The rise in European turnover came mainly from growth in the group's German construction activities and in its British urban cleaning business.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS STEREOTYPES  </P> <P> I am writing in response to Gerald Peary's March 4 article on the movie "The  Handmaid's Tale."  </P> <P> I was appalled by his embracing of stereotypes of fundamentalist Christians.  </P> <P> Of course there are extremist and hypocrites in all religions, but what this  movie does is depict fundamentalist Christians as tantamount to Nazis. American  media would not tolerate doing this to any other religion or race.  </P> <P> T. SOLLIDAY  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

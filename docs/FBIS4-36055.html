			<p>BFN     [Text] Abha, Saudi Arabia, June 5 (AFP) -- Five Gulf Arab  states on Sunday [5 June] implicitly recognized the breakaway  southern state declared after the outbreak of Yemen's civil war.    Foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  termed as "a fait accompli the declaration by one of the parties  of the Yemen Democratic Republic and the return to the  situation" before the country was unified in 1990.    Only Qatar voiced reservations on the statement issued in  the  Saudi town of Abha by its partners in the GCC -- Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

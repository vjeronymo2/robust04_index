			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Personal View: A blueprint for quality quangos The number of quangos in the UK is increasing at a significant pace, taking more and more power away from local government. The trend is at odds with the renewed interest in local accountability, as manifested in the work of the Local Government Commission and urban partnership projects such as City Pride. Health authorities, training and enterprise councils (Tecs), development agencies and housing trusts are all quangos that operate at a local level with substantial budgets and powers. But all are nationally appointed by the relevant secretaries of state, and, as a consequence, have doubtful credentials when it comes to accountability and legitimacy. Few wish to see such bodies again run directly by local authorities. But there is a widely recognised need for reforms to make such bodies more accountable and more responsive to the main users. What is needed is better accountability and more efficiency, both of which can be nurtured by more 'contestability'. It would involve two innovations: first a new approach to appointment; second a new public power of dismissal. Appointment of bodies such as health authorities would be the responsibility of an 'appointment commission' representing the set of democratically elected institutions with a legitimate interest in the make-up of the relevant organisations. This could take the form of one-third national government, one-third local government and one-third other stake-holder interests agreed by both groups. The appointment of a new board would be announced publicly, with a six-month lead-in time. Their first budgets would also be made public, providing a transparent framework for potential bidders. It would then be open to any group to apply to become the board, just as a contractor would bid to run a local service. These bidders might range from companies or groups of local government officers to campaigning organisations. Bidders would be required to set out their plans: the targets (if any) they aim to achieve; their management approaches; their business plan; and how they would meet their goals within the stated framework budget. The 'appointment commission' would then, by successive rounds of elimination, choose a winner. This model has several virtues. It would encourage creative 'coalition building' - for example, between groups of doctors, administrators, health activists and general practitioners. It would be difficult for a board to represent only a narrow range of interests, and almost impossible for it to be used as an arm of party patronage as is often the case at present. It would encourage the evolution of more co-operative structures - strategic alliances between different kinds of intermediate body would probably result. And it would make criteria of evaluation transparent, since each bidder would set out what it aimed to achieve and could be called to account at a later date. The second requirement is to inject a credible competitive threat: a mechanism whereby a board can be removed if it under-performs. This could work very simply. If a board is deemed to be acting against the public interest, the relevant electorate would be able to petition for its removal. Five per cent of the population covered by a particular body - whether a Tec, health authority or urban development corporation - could sign a formal petition to demand a referendum on whether to retain the current board make-up. Ideally this would coincide with a local or national election. If the referendum went against the incumbents, by a simple majority, the appointments procedure would be set in motion to choose an alternative group. The approach would mimic purer democratic forms, but would only need to be used in extremis, given the difficulties involved in mobilising 5 per cent of any population. Such a power of removal could dramatically influence the behaviour of such boards. The idea has an interesting parallel. The task for public policy makers in monopolistic industries has been to replicate some of the effects of competition by making market entry easier. In the utilities the regulator's task is to ensure that, even without the reality of competition, the threat  -termed contestability - of competition forces managers to behave more efficiently. In governance, too, there is now a need for more imaginative mechanisms which can marry accountability and efficiency and an appropriate level of public involvement. Contestability offers a good alternative to Whitehall patronage on the one hand and Town Hall patronage on the other. The author is director of Demos, an independent think tank</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UN to enter uncharted territory in Somalia: Multinational force will have to impose law and order in a political vacuum UNITED NATIONS troops preparing to take over command from the departing US Marines in Somalia in May face a near-impossible task. With most of the country still at the mercy of warring clans and armed bandits, the 28,000-strong multinational force will be required to impose law and order in a political vacuum. This is uncharted territory for the UN. The mandate of the new operation, code-named Unosom II, will have to go beyond the first small 400-strong task force, sent to monitor a non-existent ceasefire in Mogadishu, and even beyond the US-led military intervention in December, which secured a short breathing space for aid agencies to reach starving Somalis outside the capital. Commanders of Unosom II are pressing to be given active rules of engagement to disarm warlords and bandits, who continue to loot and pillage with impunity. However, they are aware that military intervention is not a panacea for the inability of Somalis to start the painful process of national reconciliation after the traumas of dictatorship and a two-year civil war. 'If you pulled out the foreign troops and tanks, this place would fall apart,' says Gen Imtiaz Shaheen, the departing commander of Unosom I. 'Unless the Somalis begin to address their political and social problems, UN intervention will lead to a new form of colonisation.' The absence of a Somali government has already created a de facto administration run by the UN and US task forces and the international aid agencies. A 'cabinet' meets every morning at 8am at the fortified Unosom compound in Mogadishu to discuss the security situation and plan relief work. The collapse of the economy has also transformed the aid agencies into the country's main employers and benefactors. The UN's World Food Programme estimates that more than 2m Somalis, one third of the population, are dependent on relief agencies for food, water, health care, seeds for planting, and agricultural tools. And while the presence of the US-led joint task force afforded military protection for immediate famine relief work, it has also created a new security problem for aid agencies. They have become soft targets for bandits who used to be employed in the protection racket business before the US Marines put an end to this lucrative source of income. 'Before the US Marines landed,' says Mr Rhodri Wynn-Pope, relief co-ordinator for southern Somalia with the international agency Care, 'we were being absolutely ripped off'. Care was paying Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 106,000) a month to security gangs to guard its food stocks at the port. Other 'contractors' had to be paid to guard food convoys, to negotiate road blocks, and to prevent food from being looted at its destination. Military intervention broke the cycle of extortion, but created an underworld of armed thieves who have murdered three foreign aid workers in the past two months. 'We feel less secure now,' says Mr Ian MacLeod at Unicef. 'Aid agencies were not targets last year.' Aid workers, he explains, cannot venture outside their compounds without armed escorts. All agencies have imposed a 6pm curfew. Aid agencies believe that Unosom II's mandate is doomed unless it tackles the problem of disarmament and rehabilitation simultaneously. 'The banditry and lawlessness in Somalia is a social problem,' says Mr Wynn-Pope. 'Warlords can talk their men back to the barracks, but bandits need to be given productive jobs to give up their guns.' With Somalia's famine emergency over, the UN and aid agencies are beginning to concentrate on the daunting task of resettling almost 2.5m Somalis displaced by the civil war. Of these, 1m people are sitting in refugee camps outside Somalia. Neither the military nor the humanitarian agencies of the UN have ever undertaken a logistical task of this size. Relief agencies, critical of the UN's performance in Somalia before the arrival of the US-led task force, fear that the country will slide back into anarchy with the pull-out of US troops. 'The US armed forces have a cohesive administrative and logistical command chain that the UN finds difficult to match,' says Mr Wynn-Pope, himself a former British army officer. 'US troops were seen as the tough guys with big guns, whereas the UN has little credibility with the Somalis.' Mr Jamie McGoldrick, deputy field director of Save the Children Fund UK, goes further: 'The UN does not understand the scale or the complexity of the Somali problem. They think it is a six-month job, whereas it may take 10 to 15 years to restore peace to Somalia.'</p>

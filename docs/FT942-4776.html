			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Arts: The Chicago, Mullova and the LSO - Concerts On Saturday the Chicago Symphony hit town, with their usual loud report. A special attraction was the local premiere of the Partita commissioned from Elliott Carter (at 85 indisputably America's grandest old composer), but a more general attraction must have been its famous brass. And on Sunday, Kent Nagano conducted the London Symphony in the first of three concerts featuring Stravinsky's three great Diaghilev ballets. There, however, the special attraction was Viktoria Mullova in Berg's Violin Concerto, more 'advanced' music than any we have heard this ex-Soviet virtuoso attempt. In both concerts, as it turned out, the less special pieces proved the most satisfying ones. Mullova's Berg was no more than a thin, uncommitted pencil-sketch, technically superb but devoid of any Expressionist feeling. Along with the Lyric Suite and Lulu, the Concerto represents Berg's genius for making Schoenberg's abstract dodecaphonic methods serve passionate, post-Mahlerian ends. It was sad to hear its solo role reduced to grey note-spinning. If Miss Mullova thought her cautious first draft ready for public performance, her Soviet training must have left her innocently deaf to Berg's expressive climate. I felt much the same about Daniel Barenboim's swift, unbending Chicago version of Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel. Before Till there had been witty music for centuries (Scarlatti, Haydn, Mozart), and a sprinkling of 'jokes'; but for Till Strauss devised a new comical-musical body-language - jaunty, wriggly, mock-explosive: like a puppy doing practice growls and pounces - which needs room for expanding and rollicking. On Barenboim's tight metronomic leash, it sounded stiff and steely. We had to be content with brilliant execution, mostly at forte and upwards. All that was unsatisfying about Carter's Partita was that we were hearing it for the first time. Experience says that the grand plan of any substantial Carter work comes into focus only with longer acquaintance. Here the old master's music dances and dazzles in profuse variety, more leanly scored than most of his earlier orchestral stuff. He plays the distinct instrumental families off against one other, each with their own prickly material - upper and lower strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion - in cyclical juxtapositions which never come out in the same way. Barenboim ran through the ingenious patterns tautly and urgently. Sprightlier and less brittle would have been better (and will be, when other orchestras take the piece up). For the strings, the music needed more playing in: their subfusc sound indicated a collective uncertainty about pitching and phrasing. Though the Chicago Brahms' Second had similar failings, it was impossible not to respond to its big, confident sound and glorious brass-chordings. The LSO played young Stravinsky's complete Firebird - the luxuriant 1910 original, with quadruple woodwind (including two contrabassoons), three harps and lashings of magical pianissimo - even better. It is always a pleasure to be reminded of the rich, cogent interconnections that the familiar Suites miss out; but here Nagano treated the ballet-pantomime links with such searching sympathy, so vividly detailed, that the score seemed a rousing, integral whole. His Petrushka and Rite of Spring with the LSO, Thursday and Sunday next, should be terrific.</p>

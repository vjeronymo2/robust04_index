			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MERRILL LYNCH CUTS S. AFRICA TIES  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. is banning all business related to South Africa,  including trading or researching South African securities, it was reported  today.  </P> <P> The move by the country's biggest brokerage goes further than similar policies  of other securities firms and could encourage others to take a tougher stance  to protest South Africa's practices of racial separation, the Wall Street  Journal reported.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch's move, announced in an internal memorandum to employees,  reflects a growing public outcry that Wall Street firms continue to maintain  ties to South Africa, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> But some other financial firms, such as Shearson Lehman Hutton, already have  ceased doing business with South Africa, its corporations and individuals.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HENNING LIKES LOOK OF NEW PUNTER  </P> <P> As recently as Monday, Charger punter Lewis Colbert received a vote of  confidence from Coach Dan Henning. Twenty-four hours later, Colbert was gone.  </P> <P> Canadian import Hank Ilesic became the second candidate to fill the shoes of  perennially successful Ralf Mojsiejenko, and Henning gave him a rave review  after seeing him punt for the first time in practice Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Ilesic really looks the part," Henning said. "He has as quick a get-off time  as I've ever seen. His average for 16 kicks today was 1.8 or 1.9 seconds. He  even has room to slow down. He stands in a crouch and moves into the ball."  </P> <P> Henning added that Ilesic might kick off as well as punt when the Chargers meet  the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> "He had a 62-yard average kicking off in the Canadian League," Henning said.  "Figuring in onside kicks and popup kicks, he's probably a goal-line kicker.  </P> <P> "We won't practice kickoffs until tomorrow, and we'll decide then about Sunday.  He's a straight-on kicker and we have to get him a square-toed shoe. It's  possible he'll even kick long field goals. He kicked 30 one year in Canada. We  want to utilize him to the fullest."  </P> <P> Ilesic, 30, who is of Austrian-Yugoslavian descent, averaged 45.4 yards per  punt in the CFL. He is the only player in the NFL without college experience,  having joined the Edmonton Eskimos in 1977 after his junior year in high  school. He spent six seasons with the Eskimos and was in his seventh season  with the Toronto Argonauts when he obtained his release last week, clearing the  way for him to switch to the NFL.  </P> <P> "I've wanted to be in the NFL for many years," Ilesic said. "The problem is,  the CFL likes to keep its own people, especially kickers and high-profile  players."  </P> <P> Ilesic noted that players can't play out their options in the CFL as in the  NFL.  </P> <P> "You're always under contract," Ilesic said. "I had a contract dispute with  Edmonton in '82, and Dallas wanted to sign me. We had a deal worked out to get  me out of the league but it fell through and I wound up in Toronto.  </P> <P> "I was very persistent, and I persevered. The Argonauts finally came up with an  agreement to release me."  </P> <P> Colbert averaged only 33.3 yards, last in the AFC, in his two games as the  Charger punter. Mojsiejenko, traded to the Redskins at cutdown time for a  seventh-round draft choice, is tied for second place in the NFC with a 44.8  average.  </P> <P> Still, Charger kicker Chris Bahr said Colbert was treated unfairly.  </P> <P> "I would have liked to see him get a better shot," Bahr said. "It seems to me  that an awful lot was written about the punting, and there are a lot of places  where we need to improve."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Running back Marion Butts (knee) and defensive end Burt Grossman (foot) were  listed as questionable on the Chargers' injury report. Both worked out, but  Coach Dan Henning said he was less optimistic about Grossman than Butts for  Sunday's game against Kansas City. Grossman said he would be ready. . . .  Quarterback Jim McMahon (groin) was listed as probable and took most of the  snaps Wednesday. Also probable are linebacker Jim Collins (toe and knee), guard  Dave Richards (concussion), safety Vencie Glenn (concussion), cornerback Sam  Seale (concussion), cornerback Gill Byrd (ankle) and linebacker Gary Plummer  (neck). The Chiefs' injury report: linebacker Angelo Snipes (knee), out;  running back Kenny Gamble (foot and shoulder), linebacker Derrick Thomas  (groin), linebacker Dino Hackett (ankle), defensive end Leonard Griffin (knee)  and running back James Saxon (shoulder), questionable; tackle Irv Eatman  (shoulder), guard Dave Lutz (hamstring), center Mike Webster (ribs), center  Michael Morris (groin), wide receiver Carlos Carson (groin), wide receiver Robb  Thomas (neck), tight end Jonathon Hayes (shoulder), defensive end Mike Bell  (calf) and cornerback Alfred Lewis (ankle), probable. . . . Chiefs Coach Marty  Schottenheimer, who was considered last winter for the San Diego coaching  vacancy, said in a conference call Wednesday, "We had some dialogue on a couple  of occasions, but the job was never offered to me by the Chargers. It became  clear that they obviously had made another decision."  </P></p>

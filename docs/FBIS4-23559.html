			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The residents of Zambezia Province's central  Mocuba District have reinstated order following a wave of  violence caused by government soldiers confined in the capital  of the district. This happened on 6 June when the former  soldiers mutinied and abandoned the assembly area, demanding an  immediate demobilization and a speedy return to their homes.  The police failed to control the situation, much less the UN  personnel stationed in the area. The mutineers inundated the  city, blocking the main road and exit of Mocuba both in the  north and south. They destroyed a private vehicle, burned three  houses, and disrupted the central market, causing considerable  losses to the vendors. The wave of violence did not last more  than an hour, because the population, seeing that the security  forces were unable to contain the disturbances, organized itself  and wielding hatchets and sticks, responded in kind. One  soldier was killed and others seriously wounded, according to  official reports. Meanwhile, unofficial reports say that two  soldiers died and dozens others were wounded. In less than an  hour the situation was under control and life returned to  normal. Our reporters visited Mocuba 24 hours after the incident  and the atmosphere was good. It was as if nothing abnormal had  happened. [passage omitted]</p>

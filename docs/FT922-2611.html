			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Emu faces testing time on technical and political fronts EFFORTS to establish European economic and monetary union by the end of the century are likely to run into technical difficulties, according the BIS. In its report the bank voices doubts about whether EC economies can move close enough to make Emu feasible, without unacceptably large fiscal transfers or high unemployment. In remarks written before the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty earlier this month, the bank says the goal of a single monetary policy for Europe could be hindered by a lack of political consensus across the continent. Another problem is the rapid pace of financial deregulation since the 1980s. This could over the next few years lead to large transfers of money across national borders in response to economic shocks, so making the goal of fixing exchange rates ahead of a monetary union more difficult. The sceptical comments underline uncertainty about Emu which, after the Danish decision, appears increasingly unlikely to become established as planned by 1999. The report says efforts to engineer a convergence in inflation and interest rates across Europe - a necessary condition for union  -could lead to 'large adjustment problems'. While not all Community nations would necessarily have to enter Emu at the same time, attempts to ensure that a large enough number of nations met the convergence criteria 'could render exchange rate and, perhaps, budgetary policy in some countries too rigid in the next few years'. The creation of high unemployment and low growth in countries which attempted to bring down inflation to German-style levels could trigger demands for richer nations to transfer money to the poorer ones, in the form of social security payments or schemes to boost industrial development. But 'achieving political consensus to release the necessary resources will not be easy'. In a passage indicating that large fiscal transfers of this kind could damage competitiveness and lead to higher taxes, the bank warns that experience in Europe with agricultural and industrial subsidies and support for people on low incomes 'may not seem encouraging'. As for the operation of the proposed European central bank, the report says '(pan-European) monetary policy decisions may be difficult to agree upon and defend, particularly as levels of structural unemployment will continue to differ from country to country'. It also warns that any tendency for equalisation of wage levels that ignores productivity differences 'could have unwelcome unemployment implications'.</p>

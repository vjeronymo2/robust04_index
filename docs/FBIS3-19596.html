			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Correspondent Claudio Rinaldi published  a commentary in the Rome weekly L'ESPRESSO entitled "Ten Good  Reasons Not To Trust Berlusconi" in which he outlines the main  reasons why he thinks voters should not elect Forza Italia  leader Silvio Berlusconi to head the next government.    Rinaldi cites Berlusconi's claim that popularity polls  currently give him 36 percent of the votes as a good reason to  focus attention on the man who may well become prime minister  after the 27-28 March general elections. Attention should turn  especially to Berlusconi's "most hidden characteristics,"  Rinaldi adds, because Berlusconi has claimed that his success is  due to the trust he inspires in people. Rinaldi presents 10  reasons why he believes that trust must be denied.  <H5>  1. Too Much Power </H5>   Should Berlusconi win, Rinaldi writes, he would at the same  time hold political power as head of government, economic power  as owner of Italy's fourth largest private business group, and  cultural power as the owner of three private television channels  and of Mondadori, Italy's largest publishing company. Should a  Berlusconi government decide to cut the number of state-owned  RAI television stations or ban them from advertising, the  question would arise whether this had been done for the good of  the general public or for the good of Berlusconi-owned stations.  The same question would be asked about privatizing the  state-owned GS supermarkets, currently in direct competition  with Berlusconi's Standa supermarkets, and about appointments to  head government-owned banks that, Rinaldi claims, have  overextended credit to Berlusconi.  <H5>  2. Habit of Circumventing Law </H5>   According to Rinaldi, Berlusconi has repeatedly violated the  laws on telecommunications. On 28 February he was accused of  violating television regulations for election campaigns. The  Editors' Federation produced evidence that Channel 5, one of  Berlusconi's main television outlets, almost always exceeds the  daily advertising quota established by the Mammi Law.  Berlusconi's brother, Paolo, who was recently arrested on a  bribery charge, has alleged that in the past, Berlusconi's  construction company, Edilnord Commerciale, received unbilled  materials. Berlusconi's "pseudo- sale" of the daily IL  GIORNALE, Rinaldi writes, is now being investigated by the  authorities responsible for press affairs.  <H5>  3. Deceitfulness Charged </H5>   Regarding the sale of real estate property in the exclusive  Milano 3 residential section of Milan, Paolo Berlusconi said  that he had accepted a low offer made for the property because  the Berlusconi concern "needed to sell." However, Silvio  Berlusconi had given a different explanation, that the decision  had been made so that Milano 3 should not be a city just for the  rich. As a result of the sale, Berlusconi claimed, some of the  property was sold to public associations so that less wealthy  families could occupy the apartments. Rinaldi writes that, in  Berlusconi's mind, "the need to sell" had become a philantrophic  decision in favor of the less fortunate.  <H5>  4. Over-reliance on Polls </H5>   Noting Berlusconi's claims that polls show him leading with  36 percent of the votes and Italian Popular Party secretary Mino  Martinazzoli trailing with only 3 percent, Rinaldi finds three  problems with what he calls this over-reliance on polls. First,  he questions the honesty of a candidate who celebrates his  constant rise in the polls and prophesizes doom for his  opponents by passing off data that no one can verify as  indisputable truth. The second is a legal problem. The law  prohibits any polls from being published 15 days before the  elections, but also states that from 30 to 15 days before the  elections, only polls that include all the pertinent data and  methodology may be published. Rinaldi indicates that polls  commissioned by Berlusconi may not meet that legal standard.  The third problem is political, Rinaldi writes. Berlusconi's  decisions, Rinaldi maintains, are totally founded on poll  results, including his choice of candidates, the direction of  the party's program, and the timing and methods of his  propaganda. Even if the polls were honestly conducted-- "and  that's doubtful," Rinaldi adds--a government official should not  follow the public's every mood. "The idea that decisions would  be made on the answers provided by [public opinion researcher  and Forza Italia candidate] Gianni Pilo is enough to make one  shiver," Rinaldi writes.  <H5>  5. Helped Legitimize Neofascists </H5>   According to Rinaldi, Berlusconi did everything possible to  legitimize Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the neofascist Italian  Social Movement (MSI), recently renamed National Alliance.  Rinaldi cites a series of Berlusconi statements on the subject:  "I would vote for Fini in the Rome mayoral elections." "There  is a real effort at renewal." "Those who wave the scarecrows of  fascism show their moral baseness." "I don't believe a movement  such as National Alliance can be said to belong to the extreme  right." "National Alliance members have been converted to  liberal-democratic ideas." Rinaldi finds it strange that  Berlusconi believes that former communists have remained  communist but that former neofascists have been converted to  democracy. By opening the doors to the neofascists so quickly,  Berlusconi has forced the country to "play with fire," Rinaldi  writes.  <H5>  6. Indebtedness Problem </H5>   Rinaldi notes that Berlusconi has indebted his conglomerate,  Fininvest, and that his explanation that he was forced to go  into debt to compete with RAI is not plausible. No one forced  Berlusconi to compete with RAI, Rinaldi writes, adding  ironically that he could well have borrowed another 20 billion  lire and competed with Fiat. Beyond the debts themselves,  Rinaldi criticizes Berlusconi's way of dealing with his debt  load by cutting expenses. Berlusconi does not plan to give up  any of his subsidiaries or inject fresh capital into Fininvest,  says Rinaldi, and believes his indebtedness is quite normal.  Rinaldi wonders whether Berlusconi would handle Italy's huge  deficit in the same manner: "Will he trust in God, as he now  does, trusting in his creditors' patience, or will he make  things worse by reducing taxes, as he is promising?"  <H5>  7. Lack of Transparency in Business Arrangements </H5>   Although Berlusconi insists he believes in the free market  system, he often excludes his businesses from free market  practices. Except for Standa and Mondadori, he avoids listing  his other companies on the stock market. Fininvest is headed by  "22 strange holding companies named First, Second, Third, etc.,"  Rinaldi claims. While Berlusconi swears that he and his family  own all 22 companies, documentation to that effect has never  been made public. Berlusconi once explained that he was advised  to organize Fininvest that way in the 1970s because there had  been kidnapping threats against his son and this arrangement  would help hide his assets. Rinaldi counters that this does not  explain why there are 22 companies when just a couple would have  served the same purpose. Even though the kidnapping threat is  over, Rinaldi adds, Fininvest's organization has remained the  same.  <H5>  8. Allied to `Provincial' Forces </H5>   Berlusconi insists that the economy can be savied only by  beating the Democratic Party of the Left, arguing that if the  leftists entered the government many businessmen would move out  of Italy. However, something very different has happened so  far, Rinaldi observes. Since a Berlusconi victory at the polls  has become a possibility, the stock market has steadily  dropped--while, on the other hand, the same stock market rose in  December when many leftists won in local elections.  Berlusconi's enthusiasm and ability to improvise are not  sufficient to succeed in international economic competion,  Rinadldi concludes, especially when the Italian magnate allies  himself with forces such as the "provincial Northern League and  the antiquated, nationalist MSI."  <H5>  9. Intolerant of Disagreement </H5>   Rinaldi reports that when asked whether it is true that  Berlusconi suffers moments of depression, one of his  collaborators replied, "Only when someone does not agree with  him." When Berlusconi was asked whether he was always right, he  did not deny it, Rinaldi writes, and when asked to name some of  his defects he could not name even one, replying, "I nominate  myself for sainthood."  <H5>  10. Surrounded by Yes-men </H5>   Berlusconi has been accused of running his party like a  business. While he has rejected the accusation, many of Forza  Italia's candidates, such as Antonio Martino, Vittorio Dotti,  and Cesare Previti are Berlusconi's long-time business  consultants and advisors, Rinaldi writes. Forza Italia's 14  billion lire expenses are guaranteed by Berlusconi himself--a  unique case in the political world, according to Rinaldi. The  only reason Forza Italia exists, Rinaldi continues, is because  one day Berlusconi decided he would create it and pay for it.  It is a one-man party, and those surrounding Berlusconi are  people on his payroll who do nothing more than follow their  boss's wishes, Rinaldi maintains. If everything goes according  to Berlusconi's plan, Rinaldi concludes, "we will soon have our  one-man government."</p>

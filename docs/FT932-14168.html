			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Bank of France's rate cuts help lift European prices THE decision by the Bank of France to cut its key interest rates yesterday morning provided a welcome boost for many of the European government bond markets. The French central bank cut its intervention rate from 9.10 per cent to 8.75 per cent and lowered its five to 10-day securities repurchase rate from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent. The five to 10-day rate, which provides a ceiling rate, was cut by *something in here (HP) * 2 percentage points from 12 per cent last week. French government bonds rallied on expectations of further interest rate cuts. The French franc strengthened against the D-Mark, reflecting the view that lower interest rates will encourage economic growth. The franc moved from 3.3785 to the D-Mark to 3.3766, before ending at around 3.3780. Short-dated bonds showed the strongest gains on the day, and the one-year yield spread over comparable German government paper fell from 95 basis points to 87 basis points. The 10-year yield spread slipped from 53 to 52 basis points. Cash bonds and futures gave up some of their early gains on profit-taking and the Matif futures contract, which closed on Friday at 118.12, rose to a high of 118.32 before ending the day at around 118.12. THE French rate cut helped to pull up German government bond prices in early trading, and dealers said the French move had revived hopes of an easing by the Bundesbank. Bund market participants expect the Bundesbank to lower the rate by a few basis points at this week's repo tender from last week's level of 8.11 per cent, and there are hopes the German central bank may lower its Lombard rate  -possibly as early as this Thursday, at the Bundesbank Council meeting. The Liffe June bund futures contract ended at 96.35, against its previous close of 96.28 and after a high of 96.53. Details of the Treuhand privatisation agency's new bond issue are expected to be announced today, dealers said. LANDSLIDE support for electoral reform in the Italian referendum prompted a strong rally in the Italian government bond market yesterday, although profit-taking later in the session wiped out most of the gains. The Liffe futures contract, which closed at 95.68 on Friday, climbed to a high of 96.45 before dropping back to close at 95.85. Dealers said investors were still waiting for further news on the political front, following prime minister Giuliano Amato's offer of resignation. FRIDAY'S adverse reaction to news of rising UK inflation continued to affect early trading in UK government bonds, but the longer end of the gilt market rallied later to close about  1/4 -point higher. Dealers felt the disappointment at the RPI figures - up to 1.9 per cent in the year to March from 1.8 per cent in February - had been overdone. The shorter end of the market remained weak ahead of details, due today, of the next gilt auction on April 28. The market is expecting a further tranche of the 7 1/4 per cent bond due 1998. Estimates of the amount to be raised vary from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn. The price of the existing bond slipped  3/16 to 101 1/32 . Hopes of a further cut in base rates were checked by comments from Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, during a meeting of EC finance ministers, that he regarded the present level of interest rates as compatible with recovery. THE Japanese ministry of finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of 10-year bonds with a 4.5 per cent coupon today in a reopening of last month's No 157 bond issue. Although there was concern that the new supply would weigh on the market, dealers expect the auction to go moderately well. The prospect of the auction may have had a limiting effect on the cash bond market. The benchmark No 145 issue showed little change, closing at a yield of 4.255 per cent, compared with an opening of 4.25 per cent and a day's trading range of between 4.24 per cent and 4.27 per cent. The positive effect of the yen's continuing strength against the dollar, in the wake of the Miyazawa-Clinton trade talks in Washington, helped to lift the futures market, and the contract rose to 108.72 from 108.59, after reaching a high of 108.87. US Treasury prices firmed at the long end yesterday in light trading as dealers and investors waited patiently for the next raft of economic data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 105 1/8 , yielding 6.721 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.756 per cent. After opening with a firm tone due to buying by Japanese investors, the market came under pressure in early trading from two sales of Treasury futures by primary dealers, which brought prices down from their overnight highs. After the futures sales, however, the market settled down, and longer-dated prices crept steadily upward throughout the afternoon amid some short covering by dealers. The absence of new economic statistics contributed to the downbeat nature of trading. The next set of data will come today with the publication of the March housing starts. Analysts are expecting the figures to show a slight decline, attributable to the affect on housebuilding of last month's winter storms.</p>

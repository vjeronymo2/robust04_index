			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, 7 Apr -- In response to claims by the Yemeni  paper AL-HIWAR, which stated that Saudi forces had penetrated  five kilometers inside Yemeni territory, an official source at  the Ministry of Defense, Aviation and the Inspectorate General  said: The entire report of this paper is fabricated and has no  foundation of truth. Yemeni officials themselves are aware of  the extent of the falsity of the content of the newspaper's  report.    The source added: As regard the other topics created by the  said paper, they are, in our view, unworthy of any mention or  consideration.    At the end of the statement the source said: While we are  clarifying the truth to refute these claims, we underline the  strength of the relations that link the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  and the Yemeni Republic.</p>

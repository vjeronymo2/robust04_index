			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with Lieutenant General </F> Chettha Thanacharo, First Army Region commander, by Ubon  Chanprichasamut; place and date not given -- first paragraph is  THAILAND TIMES introduction]    [Text] The First Army Region, one of four Army Regions, is  the most powerful force, with headquarters in Bangkok and the  most important role in national defence. Clearly, every coup  attempt would have been successful in their operations if the  leaders controlled the First Army Region.    For example, the successful case of the last coup staged by  groups from the now-defunct National Peace-keeping Council  (NPKC), led by former Armed Forces commander Gen Suchinda  Khraprayun was a result of his being able to control the First  Army Region.    The First Army Region Commander, Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo,  presenting an exclusive interview to THAILAND TIMES, said the  overall view of its yearly operation was satisfactory.    The most important thing, he said, was that they had fully  met the policy of the Army Commander-in-Chief, Gen Wimon  Wongwanit, both in man power and public assistance.    This year, the Army Commander-in-Chief voiced concern mostly  about the drought crisis, said Chettha, adding that the drought  crisis will reach the critical stage next summer.    "It was an urgent matter for the First Army Region to  coordinate with the other three Army regions to map out  assistant measures for those affected by the drought. The  manforce and a variety of equipment are prepared to help the  people."    The First Army remains on alert for the coming drought  situation, coordinating with three main agencies concerned,  namely the Provincial Electricity Authority, the Department of  Mineral Resource and the Army to mobilise equipment and funds  for those adversely affected areas.    "One agency alone can not tackle this serious problem, and  the joint cooperation was a need to mostly benefit the people."    Currently, the country is peaceful, without serious  problems,  only problems along the border which affect the nation, such as  Khmer bandits and stolen car gangs smuggling cars to Cambodia.    "The cars must run on the roads, and they will not be  allowed  to cross to Cambodia. War weapons and ammunition, such as were  described to me, are the most serious problem, and serious  preventive measures must be implemented as much as possible to  prevent bringing them into the capital city and other cities.  The violence and crime can not be eliminated if the problem of  these fatal arms is not tackled first."    The Army has tried to do its best to suppress the arms, Lt  Gen Chettha said, adding that the Suranari Task Force has been  successful in arresting countless numbers of them.    The soldiers and the policemen also have tried to do their  best to intercept those arms, he said. Lt [as published]  Chettha also admitted that it was impossible to be 100 percent  successful, and that 95 or 98 percent was satisfactory.    As to the problem of drug smuggling along the border zone,  Lt  Gen Chettha said the problem still existed but has been greatly  reduced. The area where culprits seek to smuggle drugs is along  border points where the fighting still remains active, as the  smugglers know the situation well, and know the correct time to  smuggle drugs. However, smuggling is very rare at border points  right now as soldiers have been alerted to the situation and can  prevent the smuggling.    Regarding the war weapons and ammunition found in  Chanthaburi Province, Gen Wimon said the matter had been  concluded without any problems. Every side understood one  another, whether problems with soldiers or with police, or  soldiers with the Khmer. He said the soldiers clearly explained  the situation. There was no conflict or uncertainty on this  matter. We have to help each other for the benefit of the  nation as a whole, Wimon said.    As for the incidents along the border zone, the Army has  continuously trained border villagers to defend themselves from  the enemy when facing a problem. The training courses go back  to the period when Vietnam invaded Cambodia. The border needed  to be trained to defend themselves or they would be affected by  the fighting.    Lt Gen Chettha said the Army has continuously and  successfully trained the people living along the border zone  regions to love the nation, and to defend themselves and their  villages. It was not difficult for them to help society when  they were well trained by government authorities, he said.    Apart from this, he also expressed his ideas over the  conflicts between permanent officials and politicians, saying  that he did not consider it as a problem. It was normal to have  conflict in a democracy where everyone has the right to express  their ideas.    Even opinions of three people on the same thing are not  always the same, but rather definitely different. The thoughts  and actions must not be against democracy, he said.    "Every side must find the best resolution on matters of  conflict, by discussion the issues with reason, but not  emotions, for the benefit of the real happiness and prosperity  of our nation."    "I view everything as normal in a democracy. Nobody can  force the idea to be the same thing or the same idea. We need  excellent and clever ideas but they must be in the scope of  democracy and responsibility," said Lt Gen Chettha.    The First Army Commander said the people must be patient,  even though they are bored with conflicting ideas expressed by  the permanent officials and politicians. It was against  democracy if people are blocked in their ideas. So every side  has to be based on reason, listening to the truth. He said  clear policies have been drafted for each agency, and that they  should abide by the rules in order to implement the policy.    Every society and group has done things for the benefit of  the common people. It is normal to have a variety of ideas, he  said. In a democratic society, a variety of ideas are considered  a core factor in fostering democracy.    Everyone must be a dedicated democrat and his actions has to  be within the scope of democracy, said Chettha.    Chettha said he himself was optimistic about the image of  the  soldiers, although many people were pessimistic, saying, that he  was ready to listen to the voice of the majority.    The people would judge it on an individual basis, not  relating the mistake to the institute. Whoever was found  violating the rule of the soldier must be punished without  exception.    "I was surprised by the criticism hurled at the image of  soldiers claiming a soldier was nobody else but the one carrying  out his duties to defend the nation. It is impossible for every  soldier in the Army to be good since each comes from a different  family."    Everything must be based on fairness, and violators must be  face the punishment, said Chettha, adding, everyone must follow  their commanders.    "Every soldier must act like a hero with a compromising  mind,  and keep calm when people when with many problems turn to them  for help," Chettha added.    National politics, with the soldiers in 1994, is very strong  and stable. It is considered the best of all ages of the Army  institute. He added that the military will not be involved in  national politics. The Army was to follow all governmental  policies.    Even if political uncertainties exist, it must not affect  the  Army. In principle, government must work for prosperity, peace,  and the well-being of the people. If it strictly follows the  regulations, problems would not occur.</p>

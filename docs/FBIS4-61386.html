			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "We Look At the West </F> Without Suspicion"]    [Text] We were moving to the European Union very slowly.  Belarus could have become a member of this international  organization as early as two years ago. This opinion was  expressed by Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb,  upon his return from Strasbourg, where he met with  Europarliament members. The legislative speaker held a press  conference devoted to the results of the visit.    Mr. Hryb said that during the meetings with the  Europarliament members, the Belarusian delegation participated  in a discussion about issues related to the development of  political and economic links between our Republic and member  states of the European Union. Examined were forms of technical  assistance for Belarus dedicated to disarmament and liquidation  of Chernobyl accident consequences. In the words of the  speaker, negotiations were difficult on recognizing Belarus as a  Republic with a transition economy, which could provide our  country with certain economic privileges.    It is a pity, Mechyslaw Hryb noted, that many participants  in  the meetings had one-sided information and only a vague notion  about Belarus. This resulted in their lack of trust in us,  creating obstacles in the way of foreign investments.    To strengthen ties with Europarliament members and provide  them with more information, it was decided to send a Belarusian  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to this  international organization.    Mechyslaw Hryb said that the Belarusian delegation members  also participated in a forum (Crance-Montana) devoted to current  political and economic issues that was held in Bucharest. The  forum was attended by more than 1,000 participants from 45  countries. The Belarusian delegation head delivered a report on  economic development at the plenary meeting. Mechyslaw Hryb  also met with Romanian President Ion Illiescu.</p>

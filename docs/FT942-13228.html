			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pilkington and Gobain in Dollars 130m S American expansion Pilkington and Saint Gobain, the UK and French glass makers, are expanding their joint-venture production capacity in South America through a Dollars 130m (Pounds 87m) total investment. South America has been virtually the only buoyant market for glass in the world through the recession of recent years. Two new float glass lines are being built, one in Brazil and one in Chile. The latter will be the first float glass line in Chile, and will replace a sheet glass plant. The investments will be financed locally, and the funds spent over two years. Pilkington said they would have little effect on gearing which it had been trying to reduce through disposals. In Brazil, Pilkington and Saint Gobain each have a 45 per cent stake in Cebrace, with the World Bank holding another 10 per cent. Cebrace already operates two float lines and will build a third, raising annual saleable capacity from 360,000 to about 475,000 tonnes. However, Mr Andrew Robb, Pilkington finance director, said that Cebrace had no net debt and was generating cash which would fund the investment. Cebrace had some spare capacity at present but projections were that it would be fully used by the time the third line came on stream. As well as supplying the construction and automotive industries in Brazil, Cebrace will sell to Paraguay and Bolivia. The Chilean investment will be made by Pilkington's 60 per cent-owned Argentine subsidiary Vidriera Argentina (Vasa) which is 40 per cent owned by Saint Gobain. Vasa currently has a 20 per cent stake in Vidrios Lirquen, a Chilean company, and will pay Dollars 30m to take the stake to 51 per cent in June. Lirquen will use the cash to fund the float line due on stream in 1996.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Australian airlines join the rat race - The fast-changing outlook for the industry IN Australia, airline officials need to be quick on their feet, not just to react to market conditions but to keep pace with changes in government policy. Only six months ago, the federal Labor government ended decades of strict regulation of domestic aviation by opening the market to any Australian-owned entrant which could raise the capital. Now the government has announced it will go ahead with plans announced in December to privatise 100 per cent of Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic carrier, and 49 per cent of Qantas, the international flag carrier. The announcement was welcomed by Australian Airlines, which relishes the thought of life in the private sector, and predicts strong competition among foreign carriers keen to acquire a stake. But the outlook is less certain for Qantas, irreverently known as the flying rat because of its kangaroo logo, which lost a battle with the government over the terms of the sale, and will become one of the few international airlines barred from its own domestic market. There are also serious concerns over the timing of the privatisations, which is driven by the government's need to complete the process before March 1993, when it faces a general election. The industry has still not recovered from a year-long domestic pilots' strike, which was defeated early last year only with the assistance of the Royal Australian Air Force. The strike temporarily grounded both Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia, jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation; wiped out the profits of both airlines; and caused a serious dip in inbound tourism. Weakened by the strike, the airlines were forced to cope with deregulation and the advent of an independent competitor, Compass Airlines, which succeeded in sparking off a fares war. In addition, the Australian industry is suffering with the rest of world aviation from the impact of the Gulf war and economic slowdowns in the main English-speaking countries. As a result, Australian Airlines expects to do little better than break even at the operating level this year, following an operating loss of ADollars 13m last year, and Qantas will make an operating loss of between ADollars 350m and ADollars 500m, alleviated by profits of up to ADollars 400m from aircraft sales. Recognising reality, the government has abandoned plans to float both airlines this year in favour of a trade sale, which may be followed by a partial flotation next year. Interested airlines will shortly receive an information memorandum seeking bids for up to 25 per cent of either airline, subject to a total overseas shareholding of 40 per cent for Australian and 35 per cent for Qantas. The government will decide after seeing the initial bids whether to go ahead with a partial flotation of the remaining shares or place them with other strategic investors. There is likely to be no shortage of interest in Australian Airlines, which has around 43 per cent of the domestic market, and is known to have had initial talks with several overseas airlines. Air New Zealand has been trying for several years to gain access to the Australian domestic market, and several other regional airlines are believed to be interested, including Singapore Airlines, Garuda of Indonesia, and Japan Air Lines. Potential investors from outside the region include British Airways, which has strong traditional links with Australia, and United Airlines of the US. Whichever airlines eventually invest, Australian will gain from increased access to flows of inbound tourists, 40 per cent of whom use domestic airlines to travel within Australia. Not surprisingly, Mr Ted Harris, Australian's chairman, says he welcomes the government's decision to go ahead with the sales, reasoning that trade buyers will value the airline on the basis of long-term potential rather than current performance. Most of the airlines which are interested in Australian are also looking at Qantas. However, Qantas is in a much weaker position. The airline misjudged the growth of the tourist market after the boom during Australia's bicentenary in 1988, and geared up too quickly to deal with growth which has not happened. As a result, it will have to sack between 3,000 and 5,000 of its 20,000 staff to get back into line with the productivity levels of competing airlines. More drastic surgery is being considered by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, which will produce a crisis report for the airline's board in May. Qantas further damaged its image last month when details emerged of a series of secret agreements with Brierley Investments, American Airlines and Japan Air Lines hatched during the joint takeover of Air New Zealand in 1989. The agreements caused Qantas to pay a higher price than its partners for Air New Zealand shares, and committed it to subsidise dividends to Brierley and, in some cases, top up the return from future sales of shares. Qantas says the secret deal was justified because it conferred partial control of an important competitor, and blocked a rival bid which would have allowed British Airways to build a powerful South Pacific hub. Nevertheless, the episode weakened the already insecure position of Qantas management in Canberra, and helps explain the government's decision to reject the airline's plans to acquire up to 25 per cent of Australian to protect its access to domestic traffic. The decision prompted an angry response from Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, who said the airline was being excluded from the domestic market at the same time as the government was encouraging overseas competitors to buy a stake in Australian. Ironically, the explanation offered by government advisers is that allowing Qantas to enter the domestic market would make it difficult to refuse an international licence to Ansett, which would then be in a position to compete with Qantas. The value of the two airlines is unclear because of the difficulty of judging the premium which overseas airlines may be willing to pay for strategic reasons. The government has also muddied the waters by indicating that it will strengthen the balance sheets of both airlines before the sales begin. Government officials are still working on the size of the proposed capital injections, but airline executives say Qantas has debts of more than ADollars 3bn compared with equity of around ADollars 1bn, and requires between ADollars 600m and ADollars 1bn to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to more acceptable levels. Australian Airlines has debts of ADollars 1.3bn compared with net assets of around ADollars 1.7bn, and is understood to have asked the government for ADollars 300m. On this basis, analysts say Australian is probably worth between ADollars 750m and ADollars 1bn, and Qantas between ADollars 1bn and ADollars 1.5bn - assuming the government guarantees a stable environment by ruling out further changes of policy.</p>

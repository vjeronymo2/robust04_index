			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ross surges to Pounds 1.35m and lifts interim by 33% ROSS GROUP, the acquisitive consumer electronics and packaging services company, yesterday announced sharply higher first-half profits and turnover, and lifted its interim dividend by 33 per cent. The company, brought to the main market through a reverse takeover of the Whittington giftware group in March last year, reported pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 of Pounds 1.35m. This compared with Pounds 101,000 in the same period last year when profits were reduced by Pounds 400,000 of restructuring costs. Turnover jumped to Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 8.52m) and operating profits increased to Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 766,000), but were partly offset by higher net interest charges of Pounds 468,000 (Pounds 265,000). Mr Noel Hayes, chairman, said substantial progress had again been achieved despite difficult trading condit-ions. Earnings per share of 0.73p, or 0.76p per share fully diluted, compared to losses of 0.15p per share last time, out of which an increased interim dividend of 0.2p (equivalent 0.15p) will be paid. Mr Hayes said the electronics division experienced testing trading conditions because of the depressed level of high street spending, but continued to broaden its customer base and secure new product listings. The acquisition of Stellar, completed in November, which introduced car security into the group, is now 'well integrated and considerable benefits are being derived both from cost savings and ongoing investment.' Gemini Car Alarms produced another strong performance and the acquisition of Sonicare in August has consolidated car security as an important growth area for the group, as well as giving it a presence in the in-car entertainment market. The packaging division again made steady progress with the Pounds 7m modular prefabricated avionics buildings contract progressing 'on time and on budget'. Looking ahead, Mr Hayes said trading conditions showed few signs of improving, but expressed confidence that by controlling costs and marketing effectively the group will produce 'a very strong second half performance.'</p>

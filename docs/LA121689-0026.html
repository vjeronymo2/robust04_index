			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BRUNO WEIL FAILS MOZART IN PHILHARMONIC DEBUT  </P> <P> It is a truism, but one that bears repeating: Putting together a program of  masterpieces doesn't necessarily ensure success.  </P> <P> For instance: Bruno Weil, making his West Coast debut with the Los Angeles  Philharmonic this week, arranged a wonderful agenda that could have thrilled  the faithful and proved attractive to inexperienced concert-goers. It is a  handsome and cogent Mozart program consisting of the Overture to "Don  Giovanni," the Piano Concerto in E-flat, K. 271, and the "Linz" Symphony.  </P> <P> At the first of four performances Thursday night in the Dorothy Chandler  Pavilion of the Music Center, this program quite exposed Weil -- a 40-year-old  West German who has served as an assistant to the late Herbert von Karajan and  as a provincial music director in his native country -- as a conductor of  little depth, pedestrian musical aspirations and apparently small achievement.  </P> <P> He simply failed to bring this great music to life.  </P> <P> In that failure, he was assisted minimally by the sometimes helpful  Philharmonic players, who, when interested, can make an inept Mozartean seem  better (i.e., more commanding) than he is. Without in any way sabotaging Weil's  efforts, the players merely gave him what his podium manner demanded: routine,  pleasant, inattentive Mozart. The worst kind.  </P> <P> Never mind that the "Giovanni" overture ought to put the fear of God (or  whatever) into the listener from the opening D-minor chord, and assert its  seriousness in every subsequent bar. Forget that the Symphony No. 36 contains  moments of stunning beauty, wondrous wit and sunny good humor. Ignore the  seraphic youthfulness, the outpouring of melodies, the buoyancy in the Fifth  Piano Concerto. None of these qualities ever materialized in Weil's earthbound  performances.  </P> <P> And the soloist of the evening, the Finnish pianist, Olli Mustonen, added  nothing material to our love of Mozart.  </P> <P> Making his third Philharmonic appearance -- his Grieg Concerto was clunky and  inept, his Ravel Concerto merely promising -- the 22-year-old musician looked  awkward, often sounded inaudible and made a pipsqueak impression in this  cherishable and important assignment.

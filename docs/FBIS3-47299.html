The First Region Army Commander, Lieutenant General Chettha  Thanacharo, said he had not been informed of any official  claims. He would not say where the weapons were being held.    "All weapons found last December in Chanthaburi have been  put  under our control until their owners make a claim," Chettha told  AFP.    "The owners could claim for their weapons but it has to be  done in accordance with the law", he added. [passage omitted]</p>

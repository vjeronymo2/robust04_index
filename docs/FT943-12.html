			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (61): Liberal policies bear fruit - India The economic liberalisation which PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, launched three years ago is beginning to bear fruit. But without further reforms there is a danger that progress towards economic modernisation will remain slow. Together with his energetic finance minister, Manmohan Singh, Mr Narasimha Rao has dismantled much of the licence raj - the panoply of government controls imposed upon the Indian economy in the years after independence. They have cut barriers to foreign trade and investment, made the rupee convertible on the current account and started overhauling the public finances. Much of the old structure has survived this assault, notably the pervasive power of the bureaucracy and the baleful influence of inefficient state-owned enterprises. The ruling Congress (I) launched reform not out of intellectual conviction but of economic necessity - the old policies had virtually bankrupted the country. With the 1991 economic crisis becoming a distant memory, there is growing complacency about further reform. However, there is little doubt that the changes Mr Narasimha Rao has already made have opened a window of opportunity for private enterprise, including foreign business, in India. That window may widen or narrow from time to time but it is unlikely to slam shut. Mr Narasimha Rao is fortunate that his rule has coincided with good harvests. On average, the farmers, who together with their families account for about 70 per cent of the population, are prospering, though the average conceals great extremes of wealth and poverty. At least 200m Indians still do not have enough to eat. But even in quite remote villages, most of the rest are beginning to enter the consumer economy. The key test of the economic reforms is whether they permit Indians to seize opportunities to build on the bedrock of solid gains in agriculture. The evidence is mixed. The first two years of reform brought tremendous upheavals in production, as the government cut spending to reduce its borrowings, so factories supplying the state saw their sales plummet. The fiscal deficit plunged from 8.4 per cent of GDP in the year to March 1991 to 5.2 per cent two years later. But economic growth also fell from 4.7 per cent in 1990-91 to just 0.6 per cent the following year. It has since recovered to 4.3 per cent in 1992-93 and 3.8 per cent in 1993-94. But these figures compare poorly with the pre-reform 1980s when growth averaged 5.5 per cent. Mr Manmohan Singh has tried to boost industry by cutting interest rates and by relaxing curbs on public borrowing. The fiscal deficit grew last financial year to 7.3 per cent of GDP and could reach a similar level this year. With the help of this stimulus, industry is recovering sharply this year, particularly in consumer goods. Industrial production jumped 8 per cent in April year on year, the latest period for which figures are available - the highest increase since 1991. From the beginning of the reforms, the government singled out exports as a potential engine of economic growth, favouring exporters with incentives, including a sharp devaluation of the rupee. But in recent months, the annual rate of growth in exports has fallen sharply from 20 per cent in 1993-4 to 8.3 per cent in the first four months of the new financial year. The combination of reform and export growth has persuaded some foreign investors to jump at the chance of investing in India. Since mid-1991, India has approved foreign direct investments totalling Dollars 5bn, including more than USDollars 3bn in the year to March. Much of it is concentrated in power, a top government priority. The amount actually flowing into India is also growing - from Dollars 148m in 1991-92 to an estimated Dollars 600m in 1993-94. Foreign financial investment has mushroomed, since India in late 1992 opened its stock market to foreign institutions and eased rules for Indian companies to issue paper overseas. Investment from these sources has soared from virtually nothing three years ago to an estimated USDollars 4bn in 1993-94. The growth has been so fast that it has clogged the Bombay stock exchange's settlement machinery. Unfortunately, for all the progress made in the past three years, there are signs the government is not tackling obstacles on the road to modernity with sufficient vigour. First, the easing of curbs on government spending has fuelled inflation. Wholesale prices are rising at an annual rate of 9 per cent, compared with under 7 per cent a year ago. With state elections due later this year and next, and a general election by 1996, the government will be reluctant to cut public spending again. But if inflation is not controlled export competitiveness will suffer, and so will popular support for the reforms. Poor infrastructure is an even greater hurdle. While India is making progress in trying to attract private investment into power projects, it will take time for new schemes to alleviate overall shortages. The inadequacy of telecommunications is equally acute, with investment delayed by a combination of legal disputes over contracts for mobile telephone networks and political argument about privatisation policy. The government has made considerable progress in liberalising the capital markets, including Indian companies' access to the Euromarkets. However, it is reluctant to relax state control of the banking industry. The state-owned banks, which dominate the market, are being allowed to raise private equity, but the government will retain a majority stake. This will stifle competition and delay the provision of modern banking services. The inefficiency of publicly-owned services and industries remains a drag on the economy, accounting for nearly half the nation's capital but producing only about 27 per cent of its output. The government has sold stakes in leading state-owned enterprises, including banks, steel operations and electronics manufacturers. But ministers have opposed selling more than 49 per cent of a unit for fear of losing control. The government is also reluctant to liberalise India's restrictive labour laws, which seriously limit employers' rights to make surplus workers redundant. While companies can find ways around the law - through voluntary schemes and redeployment - large-scale dismissals are virtually impossible. Finally, India's progress could be held back by the low educational standards of much of its population. Only 52 per cent of Indians can read, compared with about 75 per cent of Chinese. No country, except the oil-rich middle eastern states, has modernised its economy with such high levels of illiteracy. India has the resources to tackle these difficulties. It is not short of skilled administrators, teachers or engineers. What seems to be lacking is a sense of urgency.</p>

The concerns that will be addressed involve provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need, reliability, cost, resource options, and other non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The minutes will be transcribed by a court recorder in all regional meetings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The dates of the regional meetings are: Rockville, MD, February 9, 1994; Rosemont, IL, February 15, 1994; Chicopee, MA, February 17, 1994.

The NRC published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish new requirements for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants (September 17, 1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437, a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in part 51. The public comment period on the proposed rule, the GEIS, and other related documents closed on March 17, 1992. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating capacity, and alternative energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need, reliability, cost, resource options, and other non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission instructed the NRC staff to develop options for responding to these State concerns. In developing the options the staff is to solicit the views of the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff is soliciting the views of the States through four regional meetings and a request for written comments. To facilitate discussions with the States the staff has prepared a paper, ``Addressing the Concerns of States and Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper,'' which may be either examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037, or obtained from Donald P. Cleary at the address provided above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each meeting will be conducted in a panel format with panelists representing those States that submitted comments on the treatment of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources, other interested States, electric utilities, the NRC, and interest groups concerned with the economic regulation of electric utilities. All interested persons are invited to attend as observers and time will be scheduled to take questions and comments from the floor. The meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter. Written comments on the matters covered in the staff paper and the meetings are invited. The public comment period will close on March 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each meeting will begin at 10 a.m. and, with a 1 hour lunch break, will continue until 5 p.m. if participation warrants. Registration will be conducted one-half hour prior to the meeting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 11th day of January 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bill M.

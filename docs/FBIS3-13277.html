			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Islamic  Consultative Assembly, Majles, spoke today before the start of  Friday prayer sermons in Tehran. He referred to the  magnificence of the Islamic revolution in Iran and its influence  on world Muslims. He said: By inducig a new mood in Muslims, the  Islamic revolution of Iran has brought about a great  transformation in the world. He added: By creating the  cancerous cell of Israel, the enemies of Islam had intended to  obliterate Islam from the face of the earth, in particular from  the Middle East region. However, the people of Palestine,  Lebanon, and the other Islamic lands, inspired by the lofty  aspirations of Iran's Islamic revolution, have made life  difficult for their enemies, particularly for the regime  occupying Israel. Today we clearly witness the impact of the  Islamic revolution on the lifestyle of these people and on the  tactics they adopt for their struggles.    The Majles speaker strongly denied allegations made by the  western mass media charging that the Islamic Republic of Iran is  physically present in the Islamic revolutionary movements of  Egypt, Palestine, Algeria, and other Islamic countries. He  said: What the western mass media call Iran's intervention is  in fact the presence of the Islamic revolutionary spirit of the  people of Iran in the hearts and minds of the nations or in  other words it is the export of the culture of Iran's Islamic  revolution to these countries.    Referring to the recent crime of the Zionist regime, he  condemned the silence of international forums, in particular the  United Nations and its Human Rights Commission, toward such an  atrocity. The Majles speaker then praised the people for their  extensive presence in the international Jerusalem Day rallies.  He stressed: Today all the pressures exerted by arrogance with  the aim of destroying Islam are chiefly directed against the  Islamic Republic of Iran. However, our people once again showed  today that to safeguard and defend the values of Islam and the  revolution, they intend to continue their struggle and remain  steadfast in the face of all problems.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Europe's steel industry peers into the abyss: Collapsing prices threaten to undo the gains from restructuring in the 1980s IT IS crisis time again in the European steel industry. Falling demand, lower exports and increased cut-price imports have in the past few months accelerated a gradual decline in prices that began in mid-1989. Worse is to come. The steel market, says Sheffield-based consultancy Meps Europe, is in disarray. Steelmakers are rushing to offer customers incentives on already 'incredibly low' selling prices. Some EC steelmakers, it says, are offering to sell 25 per cent of deliveries to customers as 'over-rollings,' which are invoiced at a substantially lower price than for prime material. In reality, all the material delivered is prime. Other mills are delivering on a 'pay-as-you-use basis' or offering extra rebates in return for guarantees to purchase specified quantities of steel. Last month, says Meps in a review out next week, steel prices plummeted in Germany, France and the Benelux countries as low-priced offers from steelmakers in EC countries which have devalued their currencies disrupted the market. Almost all Europe's steelmakers are running at a loss, as the downward price spiral forces them to sell below their full cost of production. 'The industry is feeling very shell-shocked,' says a consultant, Dr Rod Beddows. 'People are saying it's the end of the world.' This week, Europe's steelmakers got together to try to avert the looming catastrophe. Through Eurofer, the confederation of EC iron and steel producers, they submitted to the European Commission an ambitious scheme seeking financial support for redundancies; guidelines from the Commission on production, consumption, exports and imports to help the industry adapt to changing demand, and action against allegedly unfair imports, particularly from eastern Europe. The scheme raises a decades-old public policy dilemma that sank from view all too briefly in the boom years of the late 1980s - how to handle the long-term decline of a politically sensitive industrial sector whose importance tapers off in a developed economy. But this time the policy responses could be different. Eurofer is adamant that is not crying wolf. Without urgent help, says Mr Dietrich von Hulsen, Eurofer director general, the industry could throw away all the achievements from the restructuring of the industry in the 1980s, and risks returning to the 'unilateral financial measures' once common in the industry - state subsidies which are against EC law. Yet it is fair to ask quite how an industry which has received an estimated DM121bn (Pounds 48bn) of direct subsidies over the past 15 years, and was turned upside down in the 1980s, has got itself in its current fix. In 1988, the industry emerged from eight years under the Davignon plan, named after the commissioner responsible, and introduced under the Article 58 'crisis' clause in the 1951 European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. During that time, production capacity for hot-rolled products fell from 194.5m tonnes in 1980 to 165m tonnes and employment was slashed from 672,000 to 409,000. The steel industry emerged from the Davignon period financially stronger, helped by state aid, and apparently well positioned to make profits. But the late-1980s boom was too short for companies to benefit fully, and the subsequent recession has exposed the industry's structural weaknesses and failure to learn from past mistakes. Overcapacity is estimated at 10-20 per cent, and the industry is still chasing market share and hence depressing its own prices. In particular, it is shooting itself in the foot by matching the low prices for subsidised East European steel. The effect on overall prices has therefore grown out of all proportion to the relatively small amounts imported. Prices for flat products, for example, are now 30 per cent below 1989 levels. Earlier this month, the International Iron and Steel Institute forecast EC steel consumption at 105.4m tonnes for 1992, down nearly 10 per cent from 115.5m tonnes in 1990. The estimate, says Eurofer, is 'rather optimistic.' With little or no chance of the situation changing in the short term, Eurofer wants EC help so that the industry's restructuring can continue. Meps expects 70,000 of the remaining 385,000 jobs in the EC steel industry to go by the end of 1996, and another heavy round of mergers and consolidations is looming. While some in the industry have called for another Davignon plan, Eurofer is not invoking Article 58. It wants a large part of the Ecu750m (Pounds 590m) fund established under the coal and steel treaty used to help finance another 50,000 job cuts which the industry is planning over the next three to four years, notably in the Netherlands and Germany. Discussions with the Commission are in their early stages, but Mr von Hulsen believes the EC has a responsibility under the treaty to prevent the sector sinking further. However, the restructuring could cost Ecu4bn in total, and would almost certainly exacerbate the row between the US and the EC over steel trade. US steelmakers who have to finance redundancies themselves would complain violently, says Dr Beddows. There are doubts too, over whether the EC would any longer be prepared to intervene in the steel industry to such an extent as to draw up production and trade 'guidelines'. Whatever the result of the Eurofer plea, west European steel producers should do what they can to stabilise prices by helping their east European counterparts develop viable marketing and pricing strategies in return for agreed shipment levels, says Dr Beddows.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft to reduce foreign holdings Metallgesellschaft, the loss-making Frankfurt-based mining, metals and industrial conglomerate is to reduce two of its biggest foreign shareholdings. The sales follow agreement between the group and its bankers this week over new lines of credit to avert a liquidity crisis. Metallgesellschaft has sold the bulk of its indirectly-owned 14 per cent stake in the Brisbane-based MIM Holdings for ADollars 250m (USDollars 168.9m). It also intends to sell 11.6m directly-owned shares in Metall Mining Corporation, a Canadian mining group, for CDollars 124.7m (USDollars 94.5m), reducing its holding to 50.1 per cent. Separately, Metallgesellschaft and Deutsche Bank denied a report that Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, had come under the surveillance of a specially-created committee of senior German managers. This was alleged to be have been formed last month at the initiative of Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director and chairman of the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, but Deutsche said the report was groundless. The Frankfurt group said the sales of the shareholdings were unconnected with its current liquidity situation, and had been planned before it went into negotiations last Friday with Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. News of the talks earlier this week prompted a 12 per cent fall in Metallgesellschaft's share price on Monday. However, the stock has recovered much of the original losses following the group's insistence - backed by its bankers - that its liquidity problems are temporary. It blames them on technical aspects of futures contracts taken out to hedge its oil delivery business in the US. Although proceeds of the sale of the 11.6m shares in Metall Mining Corp will flow directly to the German parent company, the money raised in Australia on Wednesday via the sale of 100m shares in MIM Holdings will remain with Metall Mining, through which Metallgesellschaft owns the stake. However, the immediate proceeds are to be invested in the development of the Canadian company's copper activities, Mr Klaus Zeitler, the Canadian company's chief executive said yesterday. Analysts said the sale of the Australian company's shares could give rise to a book profit in Metallgesellschaft's current-year accounts, and that the German company could benefit from an increased dividend from its Canadian subsidiary. The 100m shares in the Australian company were sold to institutions by two firms of stockbrokers at ADollars 2.35 each. Bernard Simon in Toronto adds: Metallgesellschaft yesterday raised almost CDollars 70m by selling 6.4m shares in Vancouver-based Methanex, which is one of the world's biggest methanol producers, to Nova, the Canadian petrochemicals and pipeline group. Metallgesellschaft was Methanex's second-biggest shareholder with a stake of 13 per cent.</p>

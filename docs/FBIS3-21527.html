			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Galkin; from the "Voskresenye" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Baykonur cosmodrome. It was the place where the  history of Russia's military space forces started in 1955,  though they developed into an independent structure much later,  at the beginning of the 1980's. The jurisdiction of the  military space forces, if one can call it that, covers the  cosmodromes of Baykonur, in Kazakhstan, and Plesetsk, which is  in the Arkhangelsk oblast, as well as the main center of the  control and telemetry complex in Golitsino in the Moscow  countryside, and the tracking stations situated across the  country from the western borders to Kamchatka.    [Begin recording] Valeriy Grin, chief of the  headquarters of the main center of the control and telemetry  complex: It is our duty to ensure that our military and  political leadership is warned of the preparation for a possible  aggression or war by -- well, it is not the fashion now to call  them a probable enemy, but that does not matter, it is our duty  to do this.    Galkin: Well, the spy satellites, are they your  business?    Grin: It is the the state's duty to ensure its  security, including by means of intelligence work in all  spheres, both on the ground and in the air, and in space as well.    Galkin: So you manage these spheres [words  indistinct] as well?    Grin: Like any other power. Look at the United  States, and certainly China.    Galkin: One can speak about this openly now. All  the space launches, from the first sputnik to the international  teams, were done by the military. I remember with shame how we  made the officers and soldiers change their clothes because of  the censorship. How whole episodes were cut out of programs if  a service cap was glimpsed in the background. And that was at a  time when all the world knew that the military were  participating in the Soviet space programs. Today the military  space forces have dropped the masquerade, thank God. But by no  means does this mean that there are no longer any real secrets  here. Of course there are, and as usual they are being well  guarded.    The highest qualifications are needed to manage space. One  cannot achieve them in one or two years. That is one of the  main problems of the military space forces today. According to  the present rules officers are transferred to the reserve the  same as in line units, at the age of 45-50. But a  mathematician, a ballistics expert, or a programmer is at the  height of his professional skill at that age. How can this  unique system, which so far acknowledges no state borders and is  resistant to any hindrance except a political one, be preserved?  The staff problems are, of course, a difficult thing, but they  can, one hopes, can be surmounted. The cutting of funding for  space programs, however, is already being felt in carrying out  economic and military tasks. Unfortunately, our history is full  of cases where small economies led us to lose on important  things later. Space systems should not become hostage to the  ruble and society's disdainful attitude to them.    Galkin: Which arms of service will be the first to  disappear in the future and which ones will remain to the end,  so to speak?    Grin: Well, I find it difficult to say which ones  will disappear first, but I know that military space forces will  remain to the end. [end recording]    Galkin: Yes, times have changed. We have stopped  viewing the world through a vision slit. We are viewed now  without the previous suspicion. But it is premature and even  dangerous to say that there is no need for the army.

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: TIJUANA  </P> <P> Spoiled chicken is being blamed for a case of mass food poisoning that may be  responsible for the death of one man, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> Most of those affected work at border-area factories, known as maquiladoras, on  Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> According to the Mexican Institute of Social Security, the first wave of people  with food poisoning -- about 30 -- arrived at Clinic No. 20 Saturday.  </P> <P> Among those first treated was assembly worker Rosario Garcia Montoya, 26. Jaime  Miranda y Soto, an institute spokesman, said Garcia later died from what may  have been food poisoning.  </P> <P> "We will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death," he said.  </P> <P> Baja California authorities said a food-catering business, Cocinas  Industriales, which feeds many of the maquiladora workers on Otay Mesa, may  have served spoiled chicken.  </P> <P> A spokesman at Samsung Mexicana, one of the assembly plants, said several  workers at the plant started experiencing stomach aches and dizziness Saturday  morning.  </P> <P> Other plants in the area also began reporting similar cases, said the  spokesman, who identified himself as the plant's manager but declined to give  his name.  </P> <P> Miranda y Soto said Cocinas Industriales has been shut down while Baja  California district attorney's officials investigate.  </P> <P> Victor Manuel Vazquez, assistant state attorney general, said as many as 140  people may have been affected.  </P></p>

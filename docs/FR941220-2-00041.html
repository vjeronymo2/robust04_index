			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Article LI is being amended to add definitions related to the listing, trading, and margin requirements of stock index, currency, and currency index warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Part V of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Article LIII, Rule 1 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific rule in Part V applies, the provisions of the Constitution and all other rules and policies of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Article LIII, Rule 2 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase or sale of an index or currency warrant unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant to Exchange Article XXVIII, Rule 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Article LIII, Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 require that the options rules for suitability, discretionary account trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index and currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Article LIII, Rule 7 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Article LIII, Rule 8 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. In addition, with respect to warrants on the Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 400 Index, the position limit will be seven and one half million warrants covering all such issues, provided the original issue prices of the warrants are not greater than $10. Further, with respect to warrants on the Russell 2000 Index, the position limit will be twelve and one half million warrants. The rule provides that warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or more will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule gives the Exchange the authority to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in the rule, and commentary to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Article LIII, Rule 9 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options and states that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of stock index warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Article LIII, Rule 10, requires that the trading halt provisions in Article IX, Rule 10A shall be applied to the trading of stock index warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon SEC approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for specific warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option or warrant overlies a particular broad based index, the Exchange proposes it be able to list warrants on that index without further SEC review and approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'') overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the CHX and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between David T. Rusoff, Foley &amp; Lardner, and Stephen M. Youhn, SEC, on December 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1'').

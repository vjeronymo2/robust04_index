			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC;  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL SERIES TARGETS L.A. PHILHARMONIC PATRONS  </P> <P> Seeking the increasingly elusive orchestra subscriber seems to be the toughest  challenge of music administrators in the 1990s. For its 1990-91 season, the San  Diego Symphony is offering no fewer than eight series to lure patrons to  Symphony Hall on a regular basis.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Philharmonic announced last week that, after 69 years of  playing a San Diego series, it is throwing in the towel, blaming scheduling  difficulties at Civic Theatre and a serious downturn in subscribers.  </P> <P> Only a few years ago, prospective patrons to the local Philharmonic series had  to join a waiting list to purchase a subscription. The Philharmonic's April 28  Civic Theatre concert will be its swan song in San Diego.  </P> <P> Not one to overlook an opportunity, Neale Pearl, executive director of the La  Jolla Chamber Music Society, quickly dispatched his glossy brochure for the  society's 1990-91 International Orchestra series to local Philharmonic  subscribers. Pearl hopes to sign up disappointed Philharmonic fans for the  society's upcoming performances of four guest orchestras in Symphony Hall.  </P> <P> The third season of the society's series of imported orchestras will open Jan.  28, 1991, with the return of the Moscow State Symphony, under Yevgeny  Svetlanov. Duo-pianists Katia and Marielle Labeque will play the Poulenc  Concerto for Two Pianos with the Orchestra de Paris on March 6, 1991. (The last  time the sisters Labeque visited San Diego, they were memorable more for their  wardrobe than their music-making.) Maestro Kurt Masur and the Leipzig  Gewandhaus Orchestra will perform April 22, 1991. To complete the ambitious  series, pianist and conductor Philippe Entremont will lead the Vienna Chamber  Orchestra on May 4, 1991.  </P> <P> Pearl noted that the society's orchestra series is the hardest to sell. Even  with the undeniable cachet of the Philadelphia Orchestra capping the 1989-90  orchestra series, subscription sales were just under Pearl's prudent  projections.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the society's other downtown series, the tony brand-name  Celebrity Series at Civic Theatre, is a promoter's dream. Soprano Kathleen  Battle's Nov. 17 recital opens the series, followed by pianist Emanuel Ax in a  solo recital. Soviet-born pianist Yefim Bronfman, who made a strong impression  on local audiences in SummerFest '89 concerts, will return in concert with the  Guarneri Quartet on Feb. 16, 1991.  </P> <P> Violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter will play an all-Brahms recital Feb. 21, 1991. The  series winds up with the English Chamber Orchestra and violinist Pinchas  Zukerman in the dual role of soloist/conductor. Zukerman will solo in J. S.  Bach's E Major Violin Concerto.  </P> <P> SONOR kudos. When UC San Diego's contemporary music ensemble SONOR made its New  York City debut the last week of March, New York Times critic Bernard Holland  gave the group two thumbs up. Performing their most demanding repertory --  Ferneyhough, Xenakis, Reynolds, Erickson and Yuasa -- SONOR was lauded for a  well-conceived, well-played program. In Reynolds' most recent composition, a  violin concerto titled "Personae," soloist Janos Negyesy was praised for his  authority in executing the composer's bravura passages. The SONOR performance  was given at Columbia University's Kathryn Miller Theater.  </P> <P> Felix turns judges into fans. On March 29, 15-year-old Felix Fan won the grand  prize and the first prize among cellists in the National Solo Competition of  the American String Teachers Assn. The competition was held at the University  of Maryland, and Fan's awards were in the precollege division. Fan, a student  at the Bishop's School in La Jolla, was awarded $2,000 for his exemplary  performance of Bartok's "Rumanian Folk Dances" and Saint-Saens' A Minor  Concerto.  </P></p>

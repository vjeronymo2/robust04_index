For too long the stepchild and  underdog in town, they are fast approaching respectability.  </P> <P> Will attendance go up? Will they have to tear down the Sports Arena and build a  new one, like they want to dismember the Coliseum? I hope not. How much  insanity can one city take?  </P> <P> GARY TRAXLER, North Hollywood  </P></p>

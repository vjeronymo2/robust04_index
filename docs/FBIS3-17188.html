Commenting on Monday in an INTERFAX interview on the Russian  leaders' statement on the need to prepare a memorandum, the  Nizhniy Novgorod governor said in particular: "Maybe I am not  on the right wavelength, but it seems to me it is a pointless  exercise."    "We have had similar memorandums before," B. Nemtsov went  on.  "Many roundtables were held in the President Hotel (in Moscow)  in Khasbulatov's time and a memorandum of accord between the  Supreme Soviet and the government was adopted, but,  unfortunately, the political fate of these documents is well  known." According to the governor, the historical value of  these documents is "nugatory, because they possess neither  legal, nor any other status making them binding."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov, governor of </F> Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and Federation Council deputy, by Inna  Yermilova; from the "Utro" program--live]    [Text] [Yermilova] I am very happy to introduce Boris  Yefimovich Nemtsov, governor of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and  deputy of the Federation Council, who is the guest of our  program today. We know that for the past year and a half, you  have been preparing a decree on land reform in Nizhniy Novgorod  Oblast, and today I would like to find out what this program  represents, what progress has been made in general, and what the  prospects are?    [Nemtsov] Yes indeed. Last spring we began working on a  program for reorganizing the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in Nizhniy  Novgorod Oblast. So we worked on it for a year and finally the  work was completed, and during the Prime Minister's visit to  Nizhniy Novgorod we demonstrated the program's potential. After  that, on 10 March, the Prime Minister declared that on the basis  of this work, an overall national program of land reform could  be announced within 10 days. This was a very big honor for us,  the people of Nizhniy Novgorod...    [Yermilova, interrupts] In other words, it was convincing.    [Nemtsov] As far as I know, the Prime Minister was very  pleased with it and the fact that a draft Government decree has  been drawn up -- I hope it will be signed in the next few days  -- speaks for itself. Viktor Stepanovich [Chernomyrdin] did  what he promised, although he was 10 days late. But that is not  important. But I would like to...    [Yermilova, interrupts] Well, I wish you success and hope  the decree will be signed as soon as possible.    [Nemtsov] The most important thing is for Viktor Stepanovich  to sign it. In fact the program looks fairly straight forward,  and I would simply like to outline its basic principles. The  most important principle, in our view, is that the peasants  themselves should choose how to work, whether to work separately  as farmers, in cooperatives, or in joint stock associations.  This is their problem. We as bureaucrats should not interfere  with this. On the basis of this principle we proposed the  following scheme: Every peasant, including pensioners, who  worked in an agricultural establishment [khozyaystvo] will  receive a certificate like this...    [Yermilova interrupts] Let us show it. [holds up  certificate].    [Nemtsov] It is a certificate of entitlement to a portion of  the land, and a similar certificate will be issued for the right  to a share of the property. After receiving these certificates,  the peasants have the right to do what they want with them.  They can invest a certificate in a new partnership in the form  of founding capital, they can sell it, they can bequeath it, or  give it away as a gift. So what happens in practice is that  leaders, whom you can always find in an agricultural  establishment, organize powerful partnerships around themselves,  while babushkas who relinquish their certificates receive  certain advantages. For instance, they may request a daily  delivery of three liters of milk in exchange for their  certificates.    [Yermilova] This really happens?    [Nemtsov] Yes it does. An agreement on the delivery of  milk, or possibly the repair of a roof, or deliveries of wood is  drawn up.    [Yermilova] But who will do this, surely this would require  a large team of people who would do nothing else?    [Nemtsov] No, this will not be their only job, first of all  they will...    [Yermilova interrupts] But who will deliver the milk?    [Nemtsov] A new partnership which will be engaged in milk  production will take care of this. After the partnership has  been formed, its leader will submit a request to the  privatization commission asking it to consider the possibility  of purchasing the given portion of land and the property, such  as a tractor, warehouse, and so forth. Now the question of who  gets what is solved in a rather interesting way. If, for  instance, two partnerships or two individuals aspire to the same  piece of land, then an auction is held. Besides, payment is  made with these certificates -- not money, not dollars, only  these certificates. The one who gives the greatest number of  certificates for the land will get it. The same will be done  with property. For instance, if there are several prospective  clients for a tractor, it will go to the one who provides the  most certificates.    [Yermilova] So the idea is that citizens should give up  their certificates to those whom they trust -- those who know  how to work and love working on the land.    [Nemtsov] What we have in mind is that citizens will  determine for themselves what they will do with their  certificates. Experience has shown that they will give them to  the most promising people who will be able to organize the work,  who as owners of this land and property will be capable of  working efficiently and making profits, thereby fulfilling their  obligations to, say, the babushkas, right?    [Yermilova] Yes.    [Nemtsov] Now we already have this kind of experience, and  in fact, one agricultural establishment, the Pravdinskoye  establishment in Balakhninskiy Rayon, has been reorganized and  nine establishments have appeared in its place -- two farming  partnerships that produce milk, maintenance workshops, and so  forth. Besides, there were no rows and no fighting as usually  happens when people argue about who gets what. None of that  occurred because everything was done in an open and honest way.  So the main principle, the freedom of choice, was adhered to.  It is a principle which never existed in old Russia when the  land issue was being worked out.    [Yermilova] Even in the time of Stolypin?    [Nemtsov] Yes, even in the time of Stolypin, because  Stolypin sometimes broke up communes by force and people simply  left for (?remote regions). They were coerced. In fact, the  Stolypin reform was carried out by the Ministry of Internal  Affairs. Stolypin was the minister of internal affairs at one  time. Of course, he was also the governor of Saratov, but when  he was the governor, he was not involved in any reforms. He  only took on the reforms when he became a big boss in St.  Petersburg.    [Yermilova] Boris Yefimovich, how do the people in Nizhniy  Novgorod themselves view this idea? Have you made any kind of  analysis of this issue?    [Nemtsov] You know, we are carrying out our enormous  preparatory work with people. For instance, very many people  have no idea what to do with their certificates. So babushkas  are putting them under their pillows, and until things have been  explained to them...    [Yermilova interrupts] And they wait for some special  moment.    [Nemtsov] They are either waiting for some moment or for an  explanation about what they can do with them. When they learn  about their unusual opportunities, they promptly become the  major supporters of reforms. So the polls which we held in  agricultural establishments showed that most people support this  idea and consider it to be most constructive.    [Yermilova] I think the idea is simply grand.    [Nemtsov] It is particularly supported by two categories of  people: first of all the pensioners who have nothing -- all of a  sudden they have an opportunity to acquire something. The  second rather surprising circumstance is that the idea of  reorganization is supported by leaders. You often hear: Those  red kolkhozniks, those kolkhoz chairmen ruin everything.  Nothing of the sort. It turns out that they are the greatest  supporters of this idea because they are tired of forcing  drunkards and idlers to work. Secondly, because they are sick  and tired of everyone being judged equally, and thirdly, because  they want to see a return on the work that they have undertaken  so that they can exist in a normal way -- so that they can live  on their earnings, spending as much as they have earned.    So the leader is interested in these reforms because they  rid  him of drunks and idlers. For instance, if an alcoholic comes  to him and says he wants to work in his agricultural  establishment, the chairman can say: You know, dear fellow, no  thanks, go find work somewhere else. I will not employ you.  Or: I will take you, but only on the condition that I can fire  you at any moment.    [Yermilova interrupts] In other words: You have a choice,  quit drinking and start working.    [Nemtsov] Yes, stop drinking and start working. You know  there is hope, which is not often mentioned, for raising  discipline in production. Well, our agricultural enterprise  leaders nurture this hope, and it can be realized. The most  important aim of this program is to make agriculture efficient.  As soon as laborers show concern, as soon as we can get rid of  idlers and drunkards, people will become active and will start  working. In my opinion, this is the most essential circumstance  setting this program apart from all previous ones. We are not  coercing people into becoming farmers. They choose for  themselves. We do not tell them which method of production is  the best -- they can choose it themselves. Thirdly, as a result  of this reorganization, we rid ourselves of a ballast which  weighs us down and really impoverishes Russia.    [Yermilova] Boris Yefimovich, I have lots of questions to  ask you. I would like to talk about industrial loans and about  telephone loans, but we do not have the opportunity to do this  today. So I would like you to promise to reappear in our  program's studio again soon. Now, if I may, a short final  question. You are a young, presentable, handsome, and  unattached person. Does this help you or hinder you in your  work?    [Nemtsov] This helps me without a doubt. I do not entirely  agree with what you just said, but it helps me. At least, I  think it is highly fortunate to have the energy and  opportunities to implement your ideas.    [Yermilova] Thank you. All the best and good luck with this  project and decree. I hope it will be adopted soon. I would  like to remind our viewers that Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov,  governor of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and deputy of the Federation  Council, was the guest of the "Utro" program. Thank you.    [Nemtsov] Thank you.</p>

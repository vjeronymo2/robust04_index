			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Union Pounds 4m deal to aid futures Union, the financial services group, is restructuring its loss-making futures business via an acquisition which it claims will create one of the few large independent derivatives broking businesses in the UK. Union is buying CAL, a foreign exchange trader, derivatives broker and fund managers, for Pounds 2.8m in cash plus Pounds 1.4m in convertible loan stock. The complex deal in effect amounts to a Pounds 150,000 premium to net assets and a three-year earn-out. The loan stock can be converted at rates which depend on profits achieved over three years. The number of shares available for conversion is limited to 5 per cent of the enlarged company a year. Mr George Blunden, Union's chief executive, said the deal limited the downside for his company. If the maximum earnout payments were made, he would be 'deliriously happy', as this would represent a substantial jump in profits. Union would merge its own derivatives operation, which focused on low margin, high volume execution business, with CAL's higher margin broking business. The integration was expected to result in exceptional costs of between Pounds 1.8m and Pounds 2.3m. The business was expected to break even in the first half, due to restructuring costs. Last month Union issued a profits warning, due to the low volumes in its markets. Analysts, who had been expecting profits of Pounds 6m at the beginning of the year, revised forecasts to losses of Pounds 1.5m. These will now be higher due to the restructuring charges.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agreement close on Brazil's Salobo copper joint venture COMPANHIA VALE do Rio Doce, Brazil's state controlled mining company, is in the final stages of negotiations on a joint venture to exploit the 1.2m-tonne copper deposit at Salobo, in the Carajas region, in the state of Para, in the Amazon. The partnership is likely to include one foreign company, a private Brazilian mining company and CVRD. The goal is to establish an operation that would both be privately controlled and leave a majority of capital in Brazilian hands, said Mr Rubens Lima Bandeira, general manager for project development at CVRD. The official declined to name the companies involved in the negotiations but said that a hypothetical arrangement would give a 30 per cent share to the foreign partner and 30 per cent to a private Brazilian company. CVRD would retain 30 per cent, and the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) 10 per cent. Under the terms of a 1985 agreement, CVRD now has the rights to two-thirds of Salobo's minerals and BNDES the other third. Mr Bandeira said the mine should be in operation by the end of 1995. 'The copper market isn't very favourable right now,' he admitted, 'but in the second half of the decade it will be. So we have to begin implementation this year.' CVRD estimates that open pit operations for the first 15 years will result in an annual yield of 242,000 tonnes of concentrate with a 38 per cent copper content, or 92,000 tonnes of metal. Salobo's gold and silver deposits are also significant. CVRD expects to extract four to five tonnes of gold and 15 tonnes of silver annually. An investment of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 425m will be needed to initiate production. New spending can be kept to a minimum because the mine will have access to infrastructure, including a railway and electricity capacity, already installed for CVRD's iron ore operations in Carajas. The Salobo copper deposit was discovered in 1976. In addition to normal viability studies, CVRD was forced to undertake additional research to address concerns expressed by potential buyers about the material's peculiar characteristics. In particular, many were worried about its low sulphur content, which they believed would hinder its heat generating capacity in furnaces. A study by Mr Paulo Mazoni, co-ordinator of research and development projects for CVRD, found that the unusually high carbon content of the Salobo material can compensate for the lack of sulphur.</p>

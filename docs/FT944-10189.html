			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan's chemicals groups slip in first half Japan's chemical industry continued to suffer from falling prices and weak demand in the first half of this year. However, its leading companies believe cost-cutting will help them lift earnings in the current half, an example of how lower margin manufacturing sectors will continue to be squeezed even as Japan moves into an economic recovery. That was the message from yesterday's interim reports from three of the leading chemicals groups: Mitsubishi Kasei, Japan's leading general chemicals producer; Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the country's largest petrochemicals group; and Asahi Chemical, the leading maker of synthetic fibres. The two Mitsubishi companies, which merged last month to form Mitsubishi Chemical in an attempt to pool costs and achieve economies of scale, both reported losses in the six months to September. Losses rose at the petrochemical company, while the general chemicals group swung into the red from a profit in the first half of last year. Asahi only managed to raise its recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - by selling securities, a common technique used by Japanese companies to tide themselves through hard times. Mitsubishi Chemical is sticking to its forecast of a combined Y10bn (Dollars 102m) recurring profit in the full year to March. That compares with a combined loss of Y6.18bn last year, composed of a Y2.21bn profit from Mitsubishi Kasei and a Y8.39bn recurring loss from Mitsubishi Petrochemical. The merged group forecasts sales of Y855bn in its first year, 16 per cent down on its partners' combined Y1,023bn in 1993. The new group's petrochemical arm is hoping that it will be able to pass on a rise in oil prices to an increase in product prices in the current half. The bulk chemicals division is counting on a recovery in production, after having to reduce output during Japan's summer water shortage. Both expect to benefit from the cost savings achieved by reducing their combined number of divisions. Asahi yesterday upgraded its sales forecast for the full year, by Y20bn to Y980bn, a 4.6 per cent rise on the 12 months to last March. It made a Y3.8bn capital gain on securities to achieve its recurring profit of Y9.65bn in the first half, a 10 per cent increase on the same period last year. But operating profits fell, by 5.8 per cent to Y9.8bn, on sales down by 1.5 per cent. Demand for textiles and synthetic resins was especially weak, said the company. The smaller Nippon Chemical cut recurring profits to Y303m from Y941m a year ago.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERIM RESULTS TO SEPTEMBER 1994 (YBN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Sales        Recurring         Net                                           profit*      profit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mitsubishi Chemical  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994                       352.6           -4.782      -6.842 1993                       345.0            2.273       3.563 Est for year               855.0           10.000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Asahi Chemical  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994                       449.4            9.648       4.392 1993                       456.4            8.771       5.240 Est for year               980.0           24.000      11.000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nippon Chemical  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994                        14.8           -0.303       2.542 1993                        14.6           -0.941      -1.369 Est for year                31.2           -0.070       8.390  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Before extraordinary items and tax  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

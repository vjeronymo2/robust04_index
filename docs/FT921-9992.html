			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (An Adviser's View): Think hard before moving offshore - The implications of Labour winning the general election THE RUSH is on, with financial advisers suddenly in demand. Usually, there is an annual surge of activity at this time because of the coming Budget and the end of the tax year on April 5. But now there is a powerful extra incentive: the chance of the Labour Party winning the general election and changing the whole tax structure radically. Labour is thought unlikely to act retrospectively to nullify existing arrangements, except possibly to cancel any changes made in next month's Budget. So, people want to take advantage of existing tax-saving opportunities while they can - just in case. Labour's statement that it might phase-in its plan to scrap the ceiling on National Insurance contributions by employees has created extra uncertainty. What, for example, would happen to the proposed 9 per cent surcharge on investment income over Pounds 3,000 a year? This is supposed to ensure that those with 'unearned' income also are liable for the extra amount paid by workers following abandonment of the NI ceiling. But if the ceiling is retained, then surely it would be equally unfair just to add an extra tax on unearned income. There are plenty ofother questions to be answered. Personal equity plans and business expansion schemes are on the potential hit list for scrapping by Labour, and there are question marks as to what will happen to capital gains tax and pensions. Traditionally, those with accumulated wealth have looked to transfer their money abroad to try to keep it safe from the clutches of a socialist government intent on 'soaking the rich.' But times have changed and any such move needs careful consideration. Labour Party representatives, including shadow chancellor John Smith, have made clear that they do not intend to re-introduce exchange controls. For a start, such a move would be incompatible with membership of the European Community. And such restrictions would, in any case, be very difficult to enforce because of the international financial networks that now allow money to be transferred so easily and quickly. What Labour might do is use the tax system to discourage any big flow of funds from the UK. This could be achieved by using both the carrot and the stick. Either favourable tax concessions could be confined to domestic investments, or tax penalties could be imposed on money or assets being transferred, or held, abroad by British citizens. UK residents already must pay tax on their world-wide assets, including earnings from offshore investments and deposit accounts, even if no money is actually brought into Britain. Since 1989, they also must pay tax on capital gains made from switching between sub-funds in 'umbrella' funds offshore. Special action was taken in 1984 to block the tax loophole provided by roll-up, or accumulation, funds which avoided any immediate tax liability by distributing only a small percentage of any income arising from interest or dividend receipts. Instead, the value of the fund was rolled-up. It was decided that any gains from such funds would, when eventually brought back to the UK, become liable to income, rather than capital gains, tax. At that time, the top rates of income tax were a lot higher. This measure is now less punitive because income and capital gains tax rates have been equalised. But gains from roll-up funds cannot take advantage of the capital gains indexation allowance or the annual exemption, which is at present higher than the income tax allowance. Nevertheless, an excellent guide just produced by Guinness Flight and written by Donald Elkin, a long-time contributor to the Weekend FT, points out that offshore roll-up funds have special attractions for UK investors - especially those thinking about living or retiring abroad. Their main advantage is that they enable you to defer paying tax until it suits you - preferably when UK rates, or your personal tax liabilities, are at a low level. If you are planning to leave Britain, possibly on retiring, you might be able to avoid paying any UK tax at all. So, anyone thinking of moving abroad would be well advised to consider the offshore route. For those remaining in Britain, however, there is a dilemma. Would moving funds offshore before the election really be of any benefit if Labour won? If you are strongly anti-Labour, it could allow you to sleep easily at nights. You might also avoid any restrictive taxes that were introduced. But you could also find yourself in an awkward situation where your overseas investments would face unfavourable tax treatment that would cost you more in the long run. Anyone thinking about investing offshore also has to consider that, normally, there are extra costs, simply because there is an additional administrative layer. These costs are reflected in higher charges, which can negate the benefits for a fund of operating in a tax haven. Then, there is the extra risk, or inconvenience, factor. If the money is in Britain, then at least the UK regulatory and legal systems can provide some direct protection and you can even check physically on the people holding your funds. It is a different matter offshore, though. You might have no idea of where your money is being held or the workings of the local legal and regulatory systems. It will probably be much more complicated, and costly, to deal with any disputes. In some cases, it might be a lengthy process to prove ownership should the named holder of the fund or account die. If you do not like the prospect of a Labour government, there is no Berlin wall to prevent you, or your money, from going anywhere in the world. But unless you feel that moving money into an offshore fund is justified in its own right to suit your needs, there could be little to gain from anticipating an event that might never happen.

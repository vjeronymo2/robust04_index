			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / NUT chiefs urge test boycott end The leadership of the National Union of Teachers yesterday recommended that its members end their boycott of national curriculum tests after the government agreed to hold a wide-ranging consultation into the tests' educational value. The move, which may herald the end of two years' industrial action over the issue, follows a meeting last week between Mr Doug McAvoy, the union's general secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary. All three teachers' unions boycotted the tests when they were introduced to secondary schools in England and Wales last year. Two abandoned their boycott last year after concessions by Mr John Patten, then education secretary, but the NUT remained strongly opposed to them. Mr McAvoy said the union's position had been strengthened by last week's announcement that only 20 per cent of secondary schools reported the results of English tests for 14-year-olds this year. He described the agreement as a 'tremendous achievement' for the union's campaign. The deal would lead to a consultative exercise similar to that carried out by Sir Ron Dearing during his two-year review of the national curriculum, he said. Mrs Shephard, who had already announced in September a Pounds 30m package of measures, suggested the consultation would be less ambitious. 'As in previous years,' she said, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron, would evaluate the tests. The NUT leadership continues to claim that the tests are 'educationally unsound', however, and members telephoned the union yesterday to protest at the apparent deal.</p>

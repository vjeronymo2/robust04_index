			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Books: Hungarian feast THE translated English (by Imre Goldstein) of George Konrad's A Feast in the Garden (Faber and Faber Pounds 14.99, 395 pages) is rich and lively. This work is copious in every way, a magnum opus by one of Hungary's leading authors here, as he puts it on his second page, 'sentenced to examine myself. To dissect myself in the morgue of my own conscience.' The analysis is complex and difficult, full of vigorous reflections on fiction and morality, and takes the form of a kind of phantasmagoric symposium in which the author and the central figures of his world gather at a feast in his Budapest garden re-live, each in his or her own person, their lives as affected by the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Much of it is harrowing, yet the overall mood is life-affirming, and Konrad is able to luxuriate in his book's ingenious and prismatic structure.</p>

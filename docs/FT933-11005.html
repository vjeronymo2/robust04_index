			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: BHF-Bank jumps 23% despite rise in bad loan provisions BHF-BANK yesterday reported a jump in earnings for the first half of this year, but also increased its bad lending provisions to take account of the poor state of the economy. The Frankfurt-based merchant bank's group operating profits were 23 per cent higher during the six months, at DM148m (Dollars 86.8m). This was after setting aside DM67m against bad loans, up from DM58m in the same period of 1992. Partial operating profits, which exclude earnings from the bank's trading on its own account, were up 25 per cent to DM167m. Like Commerzbank, which this week reported a 16 per cent increase in group operating profits to DM392m, BHF-Bank said it was feeling the effect of Germany's weaker economic performance. Both banks, however, expect continued profits growth this year. Commerzbank reduced its loan-risk provisions by 20 per cent to DM831m. It said most of this related to domestic lending, with the recession having a serious effect on German industry. Total lending by Commerzbank remained at around the end-1992 level due to lower credit demand from companies and the bank's selective approach to lending. The latest round of German bank results are the first to include details of their financial precautions against bad and doubtful debts. Deutsche Bank has already reported a 13 per cent rise in operating profits, to DM2.6bn, the comparison being with a half of the full 1992 result. The decision by German banks to release more details of their bad-loan provisions anticipates a new EC directive requiring greater disclosure for the full 1993 accounting year. In Deutsche Bank's case, risk provisions in the first half were up from DM955m to DM1.38bn. One of the driving forces behind Commerzbank's profits rise was a sharp rise in commission income, up by 23 per cent to DM869m. The increase reflected a steep rise in securities commissions, the bank said.</p>

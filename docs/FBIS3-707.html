Mr. Taylor pledged to turn a new leaf as the  peace process moved forward at a meeting held in Gbarnga with  the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] field commander, Major General John Mark  Inienger, and the commander of the UN Observer Mission in  Liberia [UNOMIL], Major General Daniel Opande. He said he is  prepared to take risks at the election and is anxious to know  fellow contestants for Liberia's presidency. He urged other  fighters to open a new chapter in the effort to end the Liberian  crisis. The meeting with Mr. Charles Taylor preceded the  induction ceremony in Monrovia of the transitional coalition  government made up of representatives of all the warring  factions. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Gen. Inienger has begun an inspection tour of the  encampment where the fighters are being disarmed and demobilized.</p>

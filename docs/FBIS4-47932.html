			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 6 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] has declared South Africa's April 26-29 general  election substantially free and fair. Making the announcement  at Midrand near Johannesburg on Friday afternoon, IEC Chairman  Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, on behalf of the 16 commissioners,  said this was in spite of objections and complaints from  political parties.    "The election was admittedly flawed, but that is peripheral.  Some 20-million people of this land were granted a say in the  government of this country.    "The electorate was offered a reasonable opportunity to  vote.  When it came to counting, once again disaster was averted.  Alleged electoral violations occurring during the voting and  counting periods will be investigated and where appropriately  investigated.    "We were able to establish the will of the people with  reasonable accuracy," said Mr Justice Kriegler.    With regard to claims of electoral fraud in KwaZulu/Natal,  the IEC chairman said there were problems there with counting of  ballots.    Therefore, a reliable test of the vote would be to justify  it  proportionately to the proven support of the parties in that  province.    He then proceeded to announce the tally of each party  indicating the African National Congress had received 62.65 per  cent of the total number of counted ballots, with the National  Party receiving 20.4 per cent of the tally.    The Inkatha Freedom Party was third with 10.5 per cent of  the  vote, while the Freedom Front received 2.2 per cent.    Close to 20 million votes were counted, of which the ANC  received just over 12 million votes.    In terms of the National Assembly seats for each party, the  ANC has 252 seats, the NP [National Party] has 82, the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] 43, the Freedom Front receives nine, the  Democratic Party receives seven, the Pan Africanist Congress  gets five and the African Christian Democratic Party receives  two seats.    Seats for the provincial legislatures were later read out.    Concluding the briefing, the IEC noted that five parties,  the African National Congress, the National Party, the  Democratic Party, the Freedom Front and the Pan-Africanist  Congress have candidates who have been elected to more than one  house.    "They must decide as soon as possible to which house they  send the persons. The IEC will communicate with them," said the  commission.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Europe 'heads for crisis' Europe's telecommunications companies are heading for a productivity crisis which will hamper their efforts to compete effectively in tomorrow's information society, according to a leading US-based technology expert. Eric Benhamou, who chairs the American Electronics Association's national information infrastructure task-force which is assessing the implications of multimedia and the information superhighway, said that Europe lagged behind not only the US but even developing economies like China in its approach to the information society. He warned that Europe's telecommunications costs were too high and the productivity of its workers too low - leading to a vicious cycle which was hurting the competitiveness of European companies and reducing their ability to grow and create jobs. Benhamou, chief executive of the US networking company 3Com, was speaking at an AEA meeting in Brussels last week. Complaining that European telecoms costs are still two to three times higher than in the US, he warned that Europe must cut prices to stimulate market growth and create a virtuous cycle where industrial productivity would lead to new jobs and industries. He said Europe had to match or undercut US prices immediately and in one drastic move, or risk 'death by 1,000 cuts'. He said regulations requiring manufacturers of telecommunications equipment to gain approval for their products in each European country were 'regulatory sabotage', arguing that one country should have the authority to approve telecommunications equipment through the EU. By comparison, China had a pragmatic approach to building its information infrastructure. It was developing four major 'golden projects' - networks covering public economic information, national foreign trade, national finance and the value-added tax management system. 'These projects will interconnect 30-40 provincial capitals and about 500 cities to create an information superstructure for China's government and industry. Their efforts in education alone will add 20m nodes to the Internet to enable work in research and education.' In the US, surveys indicated that support for building a national information infrastructure was based on a belief that it would benefit business efficiency first, followed by business competitiveness. Entertainment came well down the list despite the media concentration on video-on-demand and computer games.</p>

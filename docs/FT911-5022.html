			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Diversity brings 5% profit rise to GE A DIVERSE mix of businesses enabled General Electric to overcome much of the impact of the recession in the first quarter, with a 5 per cent advance in net earnings and improved margins. The Connecticut-based conglomerate, whose interests range from power turbines to broadcasting, posted net income of Dollars 999m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, up from Dollars 950m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 13.3bn. Operating margins widened to 12.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent, the highest ever for a first quarter. The company said that its productivity improved at an annualised rate of more than 5 per cent. Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman, said that while the company might continue to be cushioned by its diversity, it sees no evidence that the surge in consumer confidence which followed the end of the Gulf war is being followed by any 'meaningful' pick-up in business activity. The strongest growth in earnings came from what GE calls its 'long-cycle' capital goods businesses, chiefly aircraft engines, power station equipment and medical systems. But a company official declined to give precise details of the improvement in these divisions. Earnings at GE Financial Services, which includes GE Capital and the brokerage firm Kidder Peabody, advanced by 15 per cent. GE Capital's results were tarnished however, by lower operating income in its highly-leveraged buyouts and commercial real estate businesses.</p>

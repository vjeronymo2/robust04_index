			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Leading Article: South Africa's constitution IT WOULD be tragic if the very process designed to bring peace and democracy to South Africa exacerbated rather than healed tension. Yet it is increasingly apparent that the constitutional talks at Johannesburg's World Trade Centre are fudging some of the most important issues in a way that could undermine their achievements to date. If the African National Congress and President F W de Klerk's National party are intent on an outcome that serves their de facto alliance but fails to address the legitimate concerns of other parties - notably those of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party - the constitution that emerges will be seriously flawed. Things have not reached such a pass yet. The pace has been tortuous, but South Africa has come a long way since Mr Nelson Mandela's release more than three years ago. The draft outline published this week shows just how far: racial discrimination is banned, human rights entrenched, and all citizens will be entitled to vote for a 400-member National Assembly, with a Senate elected by regional legislatures, which together will draw up a final post-apartheid constitution on principles previously agreed. Fundamental issues have yet to be properly addressed: how the executive of a new government is constituted, how it exercises its powers and precisely what powers the provincial assemblies will have. The outline constitution leaves South Africans little the wiser. The executive will comprise representatives of political parties 'occupying a specified percentage of the seats in the national assembly'. But how will this executive take decisions - by consensus, as Mr de Klerk demands, or by majority, as Mr Mandela insists? Regional powers An equally serious flaw is the failure of the draft to define the powers of regional governments - the key concern of Chief Buthelezi, who has a strong regional base among the Zulus of Natal province. The draft fudges the issue of regional powers: the buck is passed to a commission to be set up only after the first elections. It will have regional representatives - but the final say will rest with the cabinet and the constituent assembly, which are likely to be dominated by the ANC and National party. The experts who drew up the draft argue that the constituent assembly will be bound by constitutional principles agreed already, calling for significant devolution of power to regions. And they list an impressive array of areas where regions will have at least some power - health, education, housing, local taxation, local policing. But they refuse to say how these powers will be shared with the centre, while the constitutional principles are vague and open to interpretation. Moreover, asking Inkatha to rely on them misses the point. Inkatha is being asked to give up powers it now exercises in the 'self-governing' KawZulu homeland in exchange for an uncertain status in future. It is hard to see Chief Buthelezi waiting until after an election to find out what Natal's powers will be in the new South Africa. Belligerent rhetoric Until this issue is resolved, one can scarcely be sanguine about the prospects for elections next April. The trouble is, by boycotting the talks with his customary belligerent rhetoric, Chief Buthelezi is merely making it more likely that he will be dissatisfied with the outcome - and creating the risk of a further descent into violence in the coming months. He needs to understand that no resolution can come about until he returns to the negotiating table. Equally, the ANC and the National party need to look beyond short-term party objectives and consider the type of political structure that a regionally diverse as well as multiracial South Africa really needs. For all the statist, centralising instincts of the two main parties, it is not a country that can be ruled from the centre alone; its regional inequalities are too great and the regional rivalries too powerful. An attempt to impose a constitution that does not allow for sufficient regional autonomy will merely prompt demands for secession - from Mr Buthelezi's followers or from the white right. If South Africa is to have a hope of a period of stability before elections, these issues need to be settled.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--The Egyptian National  Progressive Unionist Grouping Party has warned against lifting  the Arab boycott on Israel.    A statement issued today by the party's Central Secretariat  says that with the continued Israeli occupation of the  Palestinian and Arab territories and the ongoing Israeli  policies of settlement building and violence, oppression, and  killing against the Palestinian people, the boycott is the only  remaining weapon in the hands of Arabs and Palestinians.    The statement says that the Arab League's involvement in  lifting any part of the boycott against Israel at this time,  before a just and a comprehensive peace is achieved, will  represent a harsh judgment on the future of the Arab League and  on the conduct of Arab governments.</p>

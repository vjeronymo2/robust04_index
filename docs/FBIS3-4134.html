Hsu Hui-you, SEF  deputy secretary and Taiwan's major negotiator, and his party  left for Beijing today. The Mainland Affairs Council [MAC]  under the Executive Yuan yesterday formally authorized SEF  negotiators to hold negotiations with the ARATS on repatriation  of hijackers, fishery disputes, and repatriation of stowaways.  After agreements on the abovementioned three issues have been  reached, the two sides may exchange views or hold practical  talks on other topics prescribed in the agreement reached in the  Ku-Wang talks, on protection of Taiwan investors in the  Mainland, and on other relevant economic and science and  technology issues. The following is a report by He Chien-min:    [Begin recording] Beginning tomorrow, the SEF and the ARATS  will hold the fourth round of routine negotiations in Beijing.  MAC Chairman Huang Kun-hui held a news conference and issued a  carefully-worded oral statement today, saying that there is  still a long way to go to sign an agreement based on the oral  consensus achieved in the Chiao-Tang talks. It is clear from  the way he talked that he is not optimistic about these  negotiations.    [Huang Kun-hui] You know we have already put the oral  agreement down in black and white at previous formal talks,  however, they called it off at the last minute. That is what  happened. We did not cancel it. The point is that we need to  communicate with each other and understand each other's views by  means of talking. After coming back, we continued to work on the  agreement and ask departments concerned to do their best to help  us. Because our government is a democratic one whose work is  shared and coordinated by various government departments, many  departments are involved in drawing up this agreement. This  shows our sincerity in reaching an agreement with the ARATS.    [He Chien-min] Chairman Huang emphasized that the first  thing we should take into consideration while turning oral  consensuses into a written agreement is the feasibility of its  implementation. It is reported that the MAC has made a thorough  evaluation of the consensus on the abovementioned three issues.  The MAC and relevant ministries and commissions have expressed  some opinions that articles concerning fishery disputes are not  applicable to disputes involving official boats, and articles  concerning the repatriation of hijackers are not applicable to  criminal offenders. These opinions will have an unpredictable  influence on this round of negotiations.    This has been a report by China Broadcasting Network  Corporation reporter He Chien-min from the Mainland Affairs  Council. [end recording]</p>

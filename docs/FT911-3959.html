			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Observer: Bank confidence No doubt it is just a fluke, but have you noticed that there is some sort of correlation between how well a High Street bank is doing, and the size of stake the chief executive has in the business? Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, owns Pounds 800,000 of its shares, followed by Abbey National's Peter Birch with a Pounds 300,000 holding in his company, and Barclays' Sir John Quinton with Pounds 145,000 in his. Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive, has a Pounds 75,000 stake, and Sir Kit McMahon of Midland and Don McCrickard of the TSB each have around Pounds 20,000 in their charges.</p>

How is the Term ``Native'' Defined? Are There Any Bases Upon Which Persons Who Have Not Been Born in a Qualifying Country May Qualify for Registration?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Native means BOTH someone born within one of the qualifying countries AND someone entitled to be ``charged'' to such country under the provisions of Section 202(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Applicants for DV&hyph;96 registration may be charged to the country of birth of a spouse; a minor dependent child can be charged to the country of birth of a parent; and an applicant born in a country of which neither parent was a native or a resident at the time of his/her birth may be charged to the country of birth of either parent. An applicant who claims the benefit of alternate chargeability must include a statement to that effect on the application for registration, and must show the country of chargeability on the upper left hand corner of the envelope in which the registration request is mailed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. May Persons who Are in the U.S. Apply for Registration?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Yes, an applicant may be in the U.S. or in another country, and the application may be mailed in the U.S. or abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Is Each Applicant Limited to Only one Application During This DV&hyph;96 Registration Period?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Yes, the law allows only ONE application BY OR FOR each person; submission of more than one application will disqualify the person from registration. Applicants will be disqualified if more than one entry is detected, regardless of where they are in the application process or whether the visa has already been issued; disqualification may occur, for example, at the time of registration, at the time of visa interview, or at any other time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. May a Husband and a Wife Each Submit a Separate Application?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Yes, if otherwise qualified, a husband and a wife may each submit one application for registration; if either is registered, the other would be entitled to derivative status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Must Each Applicant Submit His/Her own Request, or may Someone act on Behalf of an Applicant?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

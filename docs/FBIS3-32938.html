			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 12 Feb (EFE) -- The police reported today  that a printing shop of the terrorist Shining Path [SL], where  its clandestine newspaper EL DIARIO is printed, has been raided  in Lima.    According to the source, National Counterterrorism  Directorate (Dincote) agents carried out an operation on 6  February and captured 20 SL activists.    The detainees were involved in publishing the clandestine  newspaper and in the SL's political propaganda. The SL is still  active in Peru.    The police did not report the printing shop's location in  Lima.    The authorities believe its discovery and dismantling  represents a harsh blow against the SL because the printing shop  belongs to the SL group that has not obeyed the orders of  Abimael Guzman, the terrorist organization's leader and founder,  to reach a "peace accord" with the Peruvian Government.    Guzman was detained on 12 September 1992 in Lima and  sentenced to life imprisonment by an unidentified military  court. He asked for a peace accord in October in various  letters he sent to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.    Those imprisoned -- including most SL leaders -- have obeyed  Guzman's order, but the activists who remain free emphasize that  the man who is allegedly the Abimael Guzman who wrote the  letters, and spoke on television to confirm the contents of the  letters, is an unidentified person who was trained for one year  to impersonate the real Guzman.    The raided printing shop was under the orders of the free SL  Central Committee, which, according to the police, is headed by  [words indistinct] Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano,"  the new leader of the terrorist gang.    The SL's hard-line faction seems to be headed by Catalina  Adriansen, the wife of SL ideologist Antonio Diaz who was killed  during the penitentiaries massacre in 1986; "Feliciano;" Margie  Clavo Peralta; and Isabel Rengifo; among others.    Martha Huatay, Laura Zambrano, and Teresa Durand Araujo, the  wife of Osman Morote, who was also detained and is another top  Shining Path leader, are among the imprisoned SL leaders who  support the "Feliciano" faction.    This faction, which pursues the violent actions of the SL,  is  responsible for the latest attacks in Lima against the Air Force  headquarters and the "Barbones" barracks during which two people  were killed, many were injured, and there was extensive property  damage.    SL experts believe there is an irrevocable division within  the SL between those who approve and those who reject Guzman's  position.    The newspaper EL COMERCIO today says that SL leader Martha  Huatay managed to take from the prison a message by Guzman when  she visited the Navy prison where the Shining Path leader is  being held.    The message reportedly said: "My detention represents a turn  along the way, join the masses, the people shall win."    In 1992, Dincote agents raided another Shining Path printing  shop in Lima that was managed by Jorge Durand Araujo, who is in  prison.    Durand Araujo is the brother of Maximiliano and Teresa, who  are being described as founder members of the SL.</p>

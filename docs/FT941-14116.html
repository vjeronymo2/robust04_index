			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods US arm pays Dollars 4.5m fine Eastern Waste Industries, a US subsidiary of Attwoods, has reached a settlement which concludes the US government's investigation into its business. EWI has pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud, and has paid a Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m) fine. The position which led to the investigation was first disclosed by Attwoods itself in an internal audit from which it appeared that there had been over-billing by EWI for landfill services. This had arisen some years before Attwoods' acquisition of the business. EWI has made restitution, with interest, to every customer affected, more than 90 per cent of whom have continued to deal with the company. Attwoods said that the provision made in the accounts for the 1992 year was sufficient for both the fine and all reimbursements to customers. Legal costs are expected to total some Dollars 3m, and will be charged as an exceptional item in the accounts for the current year. Attwoods is a leading waste management group, and provides services in the UK, mainland Europe, the US, the Caribbean and Israel.</p>

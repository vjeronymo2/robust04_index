			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRAPPED, PAN AM WANTS TO UNLOAD NORTHEAST SHUTTLE;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: THE PROFITABLE LINE SHOULD BRING $300 MILLION. DONALD TRUMP IS  CONSIDERING THE SALE OF HIS SHUTTLE AS WELL.  </P> <P> Cash-starved Pan Am Corp., parent of Pan American World Airways, on Friday put  its profitable Northeast shuttle up for sale.  </P> <P> The shuttle, an airline within an airline that flies New York-Washington and  New York-Boston routes, is said to be worth about $300 million. It is just the  latest in a long series of assets that Pan Am, once a proud symbol of the  United States overseas, has been forced to sell or consider selling in order to  survive.  </P> <P> The airline company has retained the New York investment house of Kidder,  Peabody &amp; Co. to help in the sale of the shuttle, which is Pan Am's only  profitable operation.  </P> <P> A Pan Am filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said the  company is determined to pursue the "possible sale of, or other commercial  transaction involving, the Pan Am shuttle."  </P> <P> The statement added that the company is contemplating the action, along with  other asset sales, "to provide additional liquidity to support operations of  its principal subsidiary, Pan American World Airways."  </P> <P> Pan Am also reiterated in the SEC filing that it believes it must merge with  another airline in order to remain viable. "In the longer term, the corporation  believes that Pan Am must be part of a larger network in order to add traffic  to support its route structure and must obtain financial resources to support  its operation. Management . . . continues to explore possible opportunities to  address these objectives."  </P> <P> Pan Am's attempt to buy Northwest Airlines failed last year.  </P> <P> Pan Am, which has about $90 million in cash, said earlier this week that its  cash position had been halved in the first quarter of 1990. Although it had  major losses in the quarter, Pan Am expects gains during the busy transatlantic  travel season this summer. Last year, travelers avoided Pan American in droves  after the terrorist bombing and crash of Pan Am Flight 103 at Lockerbie,  Scotland.  </P> <P> The shuttle announcement creates an interesting situation. There are two  competing shuttle services in the Northeast, Pan Am's and the Trump Shuttle,  which New York financier Donald J. Trump bought last year from bankrupt Eastern  Airlines for $365 million. Pan Am has about 53% of the market on the routes.  While the shuttle operations are profitable, the business is not growing.  </P> <P> Trump, who is also believed to be in need of cash, said two weeks ago that he  would sell the shuttle if he could get the right price. He said in an interview  at the time that he would consider about $600 million a fair price, which  airline observers said is much higher than he is likely to get.  </P> <P> But with both shuttle operations on the auction block, the value of each will  decline, airline analysts said. "Whoever has an interest in buying a shuttle  operation," said Hans J. Plickert, an analyst with the Transportation Group, an  affiliate of the Paine Webber brokerage, "has a golden opportunity."  </P> <P> The sale of the Pan Am Shuttle would not include any of the leased airplanes  Pan Am uses on the routes. All that a buyer would get for its money would be  airport gates and landing slots. Pan Am has also been trying to sell its  intra-German service, which operates shuttle-type flights between a number of  German cities and West Berlin.  </P> <P> Earlier, Pan Am sold its New York headquarters building, a hotel chain and its  valuable Pacific routes.  </P></p>

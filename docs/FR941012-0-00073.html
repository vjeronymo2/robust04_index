			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bar tip guard  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (or nose tip guard) is a device that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is bolted or screwed onto the tip of the bar. Its primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function is to prevent contact with the tip of the bar from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which kickback is generated. Commenters identified three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems with bar tip guards. First, one commenter said bar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tip guards are not usable in felling and bucking of some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trees (Ex. 9&hyph;16). This commenter said forward leaning trees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually require the bar tip to fell the tree safely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, two commenters said the hazards associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bar tip guards outweigh their protective value (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 9&hyph;20). According to NIOSH bar tip guards reduce kickback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> danger only under certain conditions, that is, when the log  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or limb is elevated and does not have any off-angle to cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pinching of the bar (Ex. 5&hyph;42). NIOSH concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bar tip guard may pose greater hazards than saws without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tips because they require the bucker to maintain working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stances that are less stable. The other commenter said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bar tip can get caught on limbs. Third, the major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem with bar tip guards is that they are removable (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;13, 5&hyph;13H). According to the CPSC report, the bar tip  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guard is removed by operators because it reduces the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the saw by preventing boring and the cutting of any logs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are wider than the guide bar. Evidence in the record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that bar tip guards are being removed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant number of operators:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Only about half of the operators of saws so equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always use such guards. About 36 percent never use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them, and about 12 percent sometimes take them off the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guide bar. Thus, while nose tip guards are effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anti-kickback devices, many operators remove them from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their saws (Ex. 5&hyph;13).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (PPEMA) submitted testimony from CPSC's own proceedings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which also acknowledged the extent to which bar tip guards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are removed from chain saws:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he Commission received the benefit of a survey that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was done on the part of the NESDA, National Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Servicing Dealers Association. They on their own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyed hundreds of their dealers. *&blank;*&blank;* [T]heir  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey corroborated my own personal observations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> namely, that in real life practice users of chain saws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the droves are simply not using that nose tip, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while if it were used or if it were permanently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established on the saw, it would be a complete barrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to kickback, the fact of the matter is because it's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary and because it is removed, because in my view  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it affects in the case of the dealers, as you'll see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from their comments, it affects the efficacy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saw, it is taken off, and as a result provides no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection, zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Just to cite from the survey, 73.5 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responding dealers to the NESDA survey reported that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only zero to five percent of the chain saws brought  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into their shops for repair, of the ones that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally equipped with the nose guards, that 73.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the dealers responded that only zero to five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent had nose guards in place. Another 9.3 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported that six to ten percent of such saws had nose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guards in place, leaving only 17.1 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealers who put the figure of nose guards in place at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> something more than ten percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The unmistakable conclusion is that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overwhelming majority of consumers are removing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nose guards from their saws and not putting them on in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The survey also revealed that almost no consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are interested in replacing nose guards that are not in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place. Eighty-eight percent of the dealers, 88  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, stated that zero percent of their customers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wanted replacements, and an additional 8.9 percent put  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the replacement request at a mere one to five percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 5&hyph;13H).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are two different types of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> reduced-kickback guide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bars. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One is designed and manufactured with a taper from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the back of the bar and has a correspondingly small radius  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of curvature at the tip of the bar. This type of bar is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commonly referred to as a narrow nose bar. The other type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of reduced kickback guide bar has a reduced radius nose but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieves its taper from the fact that the top and bottom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edges of the bar a asymmetrical (the top and bottom edges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are curved and have a different radius of curvature). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type bar is commonly called a banana bar because of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peculiar shape. According to the CPSC report, both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrow nose bar and the banana bar have significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drawbacks, primarily in the useful life of the bar and chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the efficiency of the chain saw. The narrow nose bar,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of its reduced radius of curvature at the tip,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives more stress at the tip, thereby requiring more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent replacement. Because of its asymmetrical design,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the banana bar cannot be merely turned over when the bottom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edge of the bar becomes worn, but must be replaced. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of bar also reduces the ability of the operator to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the saw for boring. This disadvantage is compounded if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saw also is equipped with a low- or reduced-kickback chain.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aiwa ahead at Y4.6bn after six months Aiwa, the maker of audio and visual equipment, yesterday announced a near-doubling of recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - in spite of Japan's sluggish market and the impact of a high yen. Non-consolidated recurring profits in the six months to September rise to Y4.6bn (Dollars 47.27m) from Y2.3bn a year ago as sales rose 35 per cent to Y110.2bn from Y81.7bn. Net profit in the period surged 166 per cent to Y2.1bn from Y797m. Aiwa expects to pay a dividend of Y5, up from Y3 in the previous first half. Among Japan's troubled audio-visual companies, Aiwa, a subsidiary of Sony, stands out as a success story. For several years the company has raised its overseas manufacturing ratio to 81 per cent - a strategy which has helped it overcome the adverse impact of the high yen. Aiwa's rapid response to the impact of a high yen has enabled it to raise profits in spite of a high overseas sales ratio of 78 per cent. It has launched a series of innovative products, particularly small stereo units, at low prices which have been a success at home and abroad. As a result, its domestic sales rose 17 per cent in spite of the continuing sluggishness of the market, while overseas sales grew 41 per cent. Sales of audio equipment rose 27 per cent on popular demand for its miniature component stereo sets. Video sales surged 71 per cent due to the strength of TVs which incorporate a video tape recorder and of video recorders which offer simple functions. Aiwa is expanding its information equipment business, and strong sales of PC modems helped the division's sales rise by 75 per cent. The company forecasts full-year sales of Y229bn against Y178.7bn last year and recurring profits to climb to Y9bn compared with Y6.7bn. Net profits are forecast at Y4bn, up from Y2.4bn.</p>

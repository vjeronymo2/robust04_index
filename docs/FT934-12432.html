			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US demands could hurt rival exporters THE US is pressing Japan to make firm commitments to boost imports of US goods, potentially discriminating against European and other exporters to Japan. The US request, in the form of a written proposal, was given to the Japanese government last week in bilateral trade talks. It calls for the agreement between the two countries of what amounts to targets in increasing purchases of US cars and car parts. The nature of the proposal calls into question persistent US claims that it is neither setting targets, nor pressing US interests at the expense of other countries, as it seeks to prise open Japan's market. The proposals made by each side in the talks have not been revealed publicly. The US has indicated that it was only trying to pursuade Japan to bring the level of its market openness to the standard of other G7 countries. However, while the US proposal does not use the word target, it uses the same wording as the bilateral semiconductor arrangement which forced Japan to meet the market share for foreign semiconductor manufacturers targetted by the agreement. Furthermore, while the US also calls for agreeing effective targets for the sale of non-Japanese motor vehicles and vehicle parts, by attempting to set a separate target for US and non-US products, the US proposal as it stands in effect puts pressure on Japanese companies to purchase US products rather than those of other non-Japanese motor parts makers, including European companies. The distinction between non-Japanese motor and motor parts makers in the US proposal also discriminates against sales by foreign car makers with Japanese capital. This would include Rover, the UK company in which Honda has a stake, as well as Japanese transplants in the UK. Japan has repeatedly opposed targets for foreign product sales on the grounds this would lead to managed trade.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT BILL TO COST TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR $321 A YEAR, ANALYSIS FINDS  </P> <P> The deficit-reduction bill awaiting President Bush's signature will cost the  average family of four $321 a year, with additional taxes spread nearly evenly  among the states, a new analysis shows.  </P> <P> The average increase will range from $151 per family in West Virginia to $578  in Connecticut, according to computations by Citizens for Tax Justice, a  labor-financed research group.  </P> <P> The changes will take an average 0.6% of family income on a national basis, the  report said.  </P> <P> The bite on family income will be within one-tenth of a percentage point of the  national average in every state except Connecticut (0.8%) and West Virginia  (0.4%).  </P> <P> "Generally, states with the highest incomes will face slightly  higher-than-average . . . tax hikes as a share of income, while those with the  lowest average incomes will pay the least in additional taxes," the report  said.  </P> <P> On a national basis, the median tax increase will be $183, meaning that half  the four-member families will see tax increases of less than $183 and half will  see increases of more.  </P></p>

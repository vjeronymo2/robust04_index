			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Difficult launch for Republic of Finland issue THE Republic of Finland yesterday led the expected wave of European sovereign borrowers to come to the international bond market, only to come unstuck in the treacherous market conditions that have beset other large issues in the past month. A comment from the country's finance minister, apparently warning of the danger of bankruptcy if Finland did not take firmer control of its budget, turned what was already a difficult issue to launch into a near-impossible one. At the opening of a training college for senior civil servants, Mr Iiro Viinanen said: 'Harsh cuts in spending will always hurt, but if the cuts are delayed the Finnish national economy will soon be bankrupt.' Despite attempts by the Finnish finance ministry and its advisers to play down this comment, its timing effectively killed off much of the investor interest in yesterday's Y75bn (Dollars 625m) issue. Plans to break syndicate yesterday afternoon have been delayed until this morning to seek further interest in the Far East. Mr Viinanen's comment struck a chord among investors concerned about the credit quality of European sovereigns, particularly in the wake of last week's decision by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, to put both Spain and Sweden under review for a possible downgrade. Finland's budget deficit this year is running at around 8 per cent of gross national product, said Mr Vekko Kantola, director of finance. However, he added that total government debt, at 30 per cent of gross national product was low compared with some other European states. Finland currently has a split credit rating, with Moody's rating it AA2 compared with the higher AA+ accorded it by Standard &amp; Poor's. Mr Kantola said recent discussions with the agencies suggested that no immediate review was likely, though S&amp;P had changed its assessment of the country's outlook to negative. At a yield of 95 basis points over the Japanese yield curve, the five-year issue was widely considered before the finance ministers' comment to have been fairly priced to take into account the recent widening of spreads in the Eurobond market. However, even at that level (estimated by one banker to equate to around 50 basis points over Libor if the proceeds had been swapped) the bonds were said to be selling slowly in a very uncertain market. Mr Kantola said the deal had not been swapped, but that the money would swell the non-European currency element of the country's foreign exchange reserves, which currently stand at 17 per cent. Yesterday's issue will keep this at under 20 per cent, in line with the finance ministry's target, he said. Finland's foreign currency reserves currently stand at around FM27bn (Dollars 5.96bn), only marginally less than the FM30bn at which they are generally held, said Mr Kantola.</p>

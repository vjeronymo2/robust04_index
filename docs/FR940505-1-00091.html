			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Modifications to the method for estimating water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content. DPR is currently investigating several analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for estimating water content including both Karl Fischer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> titration and spectroscopic analysis of the vapor-phase effluent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the TGA analysis. Until adequate validation of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods is available, DPR may calculate water content based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``percentage water added'' component of the statement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation required pursuant to FIFRA (7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(1)(E)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this generally does not account for water present as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impurity, water produced in reaction, or water present as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of other raw materials, it should provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservative (i.e., low) estimate of true water content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reliance on formulation data is consistent with EPA's historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy regarding analogous coating regulations before reliable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test methods (e.g., ASTM D&hyph;4017 and D&hyph;3792) were available. <FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, for example, ``Procedure for Certifying Quantity of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted by Paint, Ink, and Other Coatings, ``U.S. EPA, EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;84&hyph;019, December 1984. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Modifications to the method for estimating exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds. Again, until adequate validation of a specific test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method(s) is available, DPR may rely on the statement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation for estimating the amount of exempt compounds present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in specific pesticides. This is also analogous to coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations which generally relied on formulation data until ASTM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D&hyph;4457 was available. <FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ibid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Modifications to address solid pesticide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in &sect;52.2960 (d) and (e), producers of affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticides must submit copies of all raw data and a summary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the results of the VOC content analyses. Distributors must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit a distributor notification and an annual report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summarizing the pesticides distributed in the affected area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the preceding year. Applicators must submit a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PUR for all pesticide applications within the affected area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pesticide producers, distributors, and applicators are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to maintain all information necessary to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the regulation for a period of five years. At a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum, this information must include copies of all reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically required in paragraph 52.2960(d), and any technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support to these reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Relationship to State rules. As discussed in sections I.D., III.J., and elsewhere in this NPRM, EPA believes that State and local agencies can adopt and implement regulations that are better tailored to the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics and needs of the affected areas. Therefore, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strongly encourages the State to continue ongoing efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt approvable rules to replace all or part of the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to &sect;110(l) of the Act, State rules are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvable if they, ``*&blank;*&blank;* interfere with any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress *&blank;*&blank;* or any other applicable requirement.'' For purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the pesticide rule, EPA intends to determine approvability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based largely on emissions. Modifications to the pesticide rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which EPA may consider approvable, if shown to result in no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant emission increases, include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Provisions for exempting de minimis use of high-VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Provisions for allowing use of high-VOC pesticides to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent overwhelming economic dislocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Provisions for allowing use of high VOC pesticides to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent harm to human health or the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Provisions for allowing use of high-VOC pesticides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during times of the year when low ambient ozone concentrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are projected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Modifications of the test method discussed in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.3.d(3) of this NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Modifications to 40 CFR 52.2960(c)(2) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, such as ranking pesticides based on emissions instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC content as discussed in section III.C.3.d(2) of this NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Consideration of the relative reactivity of different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Or, of course, the State could adopt rules based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completely different regulatory strategies that still achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent emission reductions. <FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA, for example, considered several other regulatory strategies for inclusion in the FIP, and analyzed two in detail through a contract to Midwest Research Institute (``Development of Pesticide Rules for the Sacramento, South Coast, and Ventura Nonattainment Area FIPs,'' prepared by Midwest Research Institute for EPA, April 30, 1993 draft final report). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The no-use day strategy was fashioned after existing no-burn day programs. EPA would establish meteorologic criteria for predicting unfavorable ozone conditions and pesticide use would be restricted on a day-to-day basis. A major drawback to this strategy is that postponing pesticide application for several consecutive days could result in significant crop damage and an increase in overall annual pesticide use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The users bubble strategy would be somewhat analogous to the stationary source emission cap programs proposed in this notice. Pesticide users (e.g., growers) would calculate a base-year VOC emission rate as: amount of pesticide applied times VOC content of pesticides divided by total acreage. Users would then be required to reduce their VOC emission rate a certain percentage by the attainment year. A major drawback to this strategy is the difficulty in establishing equitable baseline inventories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA selected the VOC content strategy incorporated in this notice for a variety of reasons including better enforceability, consistency with State regulatory plans, and minimization of disruption to the affected industries. EPA invites comment on mechanisms to improve the proposed pesticides rule, as well as on other strategies to reduce VOC emissions from pesticides. EPA is interested, for example, in mechanisms to encourage pesticide application technologies (e.g., electrostatic application) that decrease VOC emissions. In addition, EPA requests comment on how to optimize the interaction between the proposed FIP rule and ongoing pesticide programs and initiatives including those targeting pesticide use reduction, pollution prevention, and integrated pest management.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE GLICKMAN'S NO. 1 CREDITOR: HIMSELF  </P> <P> The bankrupt Mike Glickman Realty Inc. owes money for everything from valet  parking to tropical fish to taxes. But of 157 creditors, Mike Glickman himself  is the biggest, with $1.9 million owed to him by the failed real estate  brokerage he founded and headed.  </P> <P> According to papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles late Friday  in connection with Glickman Realty's liquidation proceedings, the Los Angeles  Times is Glickman Realty's second-largest creditor, with $137,103 owed for  advertisements. The Daily News is owed $26,498.  </P> <P> Glickman &amp; Glickman, a law firm run by Mike Glickman's father and brother,  is also a big creditor, with $43,876 in debts.  </P> <P> Glickman's highly criticized extravagance is also apparent in the filing. Among  other company debts, $18,558 is owed to Bernard Valet Service, which provided  valet parking at some of Glickman's offices. The Parties to Go catering service  is owed $11,051, and several thousand dollars in florists' bills also are  listed.  </P> <P> The only secured creditor is Imperial Bank, with $500,000 in debts.  </P> <P> The papers list total debts of $3.9 million and total assets of $2.8 million,  including $1.76 million in unpaid commissions owed to the company. However, the  debt total doesn't include claims that may be made by homeowners who listed  their homes with Glickman or claims that may arise from dozens of lawsuits  pending against the company.  </P> <P> Mike Glickman, 30, founded Glickman Realty in 1983 and quickly rose to dominate  San Fernando Valley housing sales. However, critics blame Glickman's poor  management skills and overzealous expansion for the company's troubles, which  culminated in Glickman's personal and corporate bankruptcy filings June 5.  </P> <P> The papers filed with the bankruptcy court last Friday don't itemize Glickman's  personal assets and liabilities. That information is expected to be filed with  the bankruptcy court today.  </P> <P> Among other large corporate creditors are Custom Treatment Inc., which laid the  carpeting in two of Glickman's offices; Grabiner Hall, a graphic design company  that furnished Glickman Realty with its well-known logo, and a company owned by  the former chief operating officer and in-house counsel for Glickman Realty.  Several thousand dollars is also owed to various sign companies.  </P> <P> Glickman Realty also owes $125,199 in unpaid workers' compensation insurance  premiums to the California State Compensation Insurance Fund, and more than  $5,750 in federal and state taxes.  </P> <P> The filing also says the company had $728 in cash on hand at the time of the  bankruptcy filing, not including $75,000 in uncashed checks. That would be  enough to cover the company's $345 bill for tropical fish.  </P></p>

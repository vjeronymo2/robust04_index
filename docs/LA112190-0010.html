			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISH REPORT: ANGLERS DUEL WITH BIG CATFISH  </P> <P> Bob Kazlauskas of Hemet would like nothing better than to pull a monster  catfish out of Lake Skinner for his Thanksgiving meal.  </P> <P> In October Kazlauskas, using mackerel for bait, caught cats of 23 and 27 1/2  pounds -- the latter a lake record. Then, on Oct. 31, John Norton of Temecula,  using shrimp, topped that at 31 3/4.  </P> <P> Undaunted, Kazlauskas, fishing 70 feet deep near the dam last weekend, came  back with one weighing 29 1/4. At last report, he and Norton were still out  there.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "HK's Interests Neglected"] </F>   [Text] It is rare for Hong Kong to speak out with such  passion against both its present and future sovereign nations  simultaneously. Yet the motion passed in the Legislative  Council on Wednesday calling on both Britain and China to stop  violating the Joint Declaration bore the support of all the main  parties and the majority of independents into the bargain.    Neither London nor Beijing should be under any illusion that  the criticism was not deeply felt. The vote was an important  message to both sides to remember that the point of the Joint  Declaration was more than just the transfer of sovereignty.  What was at stake was the maintenance of the welfare and the  freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. There have been times as  the two distant capitals have confronted each other over recent  years when that commitment to the people of the territory has  been forgotten. And the feeling of resentment at that obvious  neglect of Hong Kong's interest has rarely been stronger than  today, when the two sides refuse to talk to each other in public.    No doubt those at whom the motion is mainly addressed will  attempt to fob off critics with the observation that different  legislators had widely differing reasons for supporting the  censure. The democratic parties are incensed at the lack of  democratic reform, British acquiescence in China's position on  the Court of Final Appeal and the apparent threat to Hong Kong's  rights and freedoms. The Liberals fear the lack of convergence  and cooperation for a smooth transition.    But the criticisms from both sides are valid. And while  Chris Patten plays political games to keep himself in the public  eye and upstage Lu Ping, the majority wish he would buckle down  to practical governing instead.    Legislators have echoed Shakespeare's wish for "a plague on  both your houses", rejecting both sides' unconvincing excuses  for the neglect of their obligations to the people of Hong Kong.  In that they will enjoy the public's full support.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Keck Divorce Case Request Fails: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to  grant a preliminary order disqualifying a Los Angeles law firm, Trope &amp;  Trope, from representing Elizabeth Avery Keck in her divorce proceeding against  Howard B. Keck Sr., whose father founded Superior Oil Co.  </P> <P> The order was sought in a legal malpractice suit filed by the couple's son, oil  heir Howard B. Keck Jr., who contended that Trope &amp; Trope, while  representing his mother, used confidential information it learned while  representing him for 20 years. The younger Keck fears that his inheritance will  be diluted if his father loses the divorce case. (Filed April 30, 1990. Case  No. C759915)  </P></p>

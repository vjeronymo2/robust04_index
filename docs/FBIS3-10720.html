The explosion left six injured  and damaged several buildings. The area is not dangerous right  now, because the authorities have the situation under control.  Our journalist Ana Fernanda Valderrama has the report.    [Begin recording] [Valderrama] Thank you, Yolanda. At this  time the debris left by the explosion of a bottled gas cylinder  near El Brasero Dorado Restaurant, a few meters from the  Attorney General's Office, is being removed. A new tragedy has  occurred in Bogota due to lack of foresight. The authorities,  fortunately, have the situation under control. Debris is being  removed now, but earlier there was real panic, a veritable  paralysis of downtown Bogota this morning. These are the first  video clips that we have shortly after the tragedy occurred in  downtown Bogota.    Members of the Firemen's Corp, Civil Defense, and hospitals,  as well as ambulances, arrived to evacuate the persons who were  in the buildings and to try to control the situation in downtown  Bogota, which was immersed in hectic activity as it is everyday.    The authorities have confirmed that the explosion occurred  when a gas truck was supplying gas to El Brasero Dorado  Restaurant, at a time when -- this is being investigated -- a  commercial establishment should not have been receiving gas.    Authorities have confirmed that both the driver of the  vehicle that was supplying the gas as well as the vehicle are  being held, pending an investigation by the Prosecutor General's  Office.    We have the government subsecretary of the district, who  will  give us an official report at this time from downtown Bogota.  Go ahead, Dr. Beltran.    [Beltran] At 1011 this morning when the Gas Sur Company was  supplying gas to this establishment a bottled gas cylinder  exploded, causing what you see here. The authorities of the  Prosecutor General's Office have initiated the pertinent  investigations. A last-minute report indicates that 26 persons  were injured. All have been treated at various hospitals. We  learned that nine are in the San Juan de Dios Hospital, seven in  the San Pedro Clavel Hospital, two in the San Ignacio Hospital,  and eight in the Samaritano Hospital. Fortunately nobody was  killed, and the persons who were injured are not in serious  condition. There is one, however, who is being given special  treatment.    [Valderrama] Dr. Beltran, we want to clear up something that  is important. Can gas be supplied at 1000 in the downtown part  of the capital?    [Beltran] No. In fact there is a regulation issued by the  city mayor that restricts the loading and unloading of bottled  gas in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota. Necessarily, it is  prohibited to engage in this type of activity from 1000 to 1100  in the downtown part of the city.    [Valderrama] Thus, another irregularity is turned over to  the  Prosecutor General's Office, which is investigating why this gas  truck was supplying gas in downtown Santa Fe de Bogota at 1000  this morning. This has been a report from Jimenez and 4th  Avenue, where there was an explosion today in the downtown part  of the capital. [end recording]</p>

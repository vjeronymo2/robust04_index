			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Farouk Chothia and Ann Eveleth] </F>   [Text] A break has opened up between Zulu king Goodwill  Zwelithini and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as the  monarch moves to adopt a non-partisan stance in the continuining  conflict between Inkatha and the ANC in KwaZulu/Natal.    Sources close to the Royal House and the ANC leadership in  the province revealed this week that Zwelithini, freed of his  economic dependency on Buthelezi, had already taken several  concrete steps to publicly demonstrate his independence.    This puts Buthelezi's self-style role as the king's prime  minister -- and thus his traditionalist power-base in  KwaZulu/Natal -- under threat.    Sources say Zwelithini has indicated Buthelezi will not be  included in the Royal Council the king will form to advise him  on political and other issues.    Zwelithini's absence from a ceremony last Friday in Ulundi,  in which Buthelezi was to present the provincial cabinet to the  monarch, was seen as a snub to Buthelezi. The ceremony went  ahead in the presence of Prince Reginald.    Zwelithini was said to be ill. But Minister of Public Works  Jeff Radebe said the king's absence had been no accident in the  context of the ongoing cabinet crisis: Zwelithini had wanted to  demonstrate his neutrality and aloofness from party politics.    In other shows of independence, the king has also:    -- Avoided attending public functions with Buthelezi since  the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] announced its participation in  elections. While Buthelezi held a victory rally two weeks ago,  the monarch was locked in top-level talks with the ANC  leadership in Nongoma.    -- A week after the election he attended the inauguration of  a chief in Mthunzini without Buthelezi.    -- After a brief meeting with Mandela at the presidential  inauguration in Pretoria, Zwelithini held another meeting with  him the next day. The two reached an agreement which saw the  KwaZulu Police [KZP] being replaced by the South African  National Defence Force as Zwelithini's security personnel.  Sources say Zwelithini believed the KZP "were spying" on him  for the IFP.    Zwelithini's journey to Pretoria to meet Mandela without  Buthelezi was interpreted as another act of defiance. Acting on  advice from the Inkatha leader, the king had previously insisted  that Mandela meet him in Ulundi. Zwelithini had ignored  Buthelezi's appeals to him not to meet Mandela.    -- At Zwelithini's request, defeated ANC premier candidate  Jacob Zuma and other ANC leaders in the province visited the  Royal Palace in Nongoma two weeks ago. Several royal princes  were also present, although those who have played a key role  under Buthelezi's government were absent.    Sources said Zwelithini was being encouraged to break away  from Buthelezi and the IFP by several members of the Royal  House. These included non-IFP princes, some of his wives and  some of his children. The Mail and Guardian is aware of the  identities of those involved. Prince Petros Zulu, who was seen  as an ANC sympathiser, was gunned down at his home in Ulundi  last year. Sources said Zwelithini was deeply disturbed by his  death.    In his strongest statement indicating ruptures within the  Royal Household, Buthelezi appealed at last Friday's ceremony  "to members of the Zulu Royal Household not to sabotage what we  are trying to achieve for His Majesty, the institution of the  monarchy, and the kingdom. I know that it was members of the  Zulu Royal House who ended the life of our founder king, King  Shaka ka Senzangakhona.    "It is strange that throughout history there are always  coteries of the Royal House who take it upon themselves to try  and undermine what is being done for the king and the kingdom.  Your Royal Highnesses, do not allow history to repeat itself."    Two weeks ago Buthelezi said: "I am sad to tell you  concerted efforts are being made to drive a wedge between me, as  the king's traditional prime minister, and the king."</p>

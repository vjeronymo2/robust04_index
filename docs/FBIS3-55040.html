			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Vietnam by V. Konnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Konnov] A great deal has changed, both in our  own country and in the countries of the former socialist camp.  The stormy debate about who owes whom more has subsided. The  bombastic statements about proletarian internationalism and  fraternal assistance have disappeared. What remains is business  as usual. In this respect the Vietsovpetro Russian-Vietnamese  joint venture has stood the test of time. Established a decade  ago, it produced its first oil in 1986. And recently workers  were being congratulated in the terse language of posters on the  achievement of having extracted 20 million tonnes of oil. The  banner slogans may look somewhat naive and old-fashioned today,  but they must not obscure the main point: An entire community  of Russian oil workers is living and working in the south of  Vietnam. Oil extraction is helping to pay Vietnam's debts. And  yields are rising.    A new floating rig is being readied for dispatch here. It is  intended for the White Dragon deposit -- the richest oil deposit  on Vietnam's south coast.</p>

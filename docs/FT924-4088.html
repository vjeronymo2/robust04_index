			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Tougher control of City urged by Treasury TOUGHER control of City institutions by regulators able to exploit 'the power of fear' is needed to overcome short-comings in financial services laws, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. Bigger budgets, a higher calibre of people and more intrusive investigations should be used by regulators to correct weaknesses in the six-year-old Financial Services Act, Mr Nelson said in an interview with the Financial Times. He said the Securities and Investments Board, the main investment watchdog, already had the powers to take a more aggressive line, but had failed to use them. 'I am a believer in the power of fear and believe that SIB should be bolstered in that regard . . . I want it to be more intrusive, incisive, where necessary more penal,' he said. Mr Nelson is the first Treasury minister to have responsibility for the City since the supervisory functions were gathered in the department. Although he admitted the 'self-regulatory' system had faults, he ruled out bringing forward fresh legislation. 'I would prefer to see reform within the existing system, rather than starting all over again,' he said. Mr Nelson's first full interview since becoming a minister in April came amid growing criticism by City practitioners of the current system. He acknowledged that a succession of failures, including the Maxwell scandal, had 'understandably given rise to anxiety among investors and depositors'. But his refusal to order a fundamental rethink may disappoint some critics who had hoped Mr Nelson's concern over self-regulation, when a backbench MP, would lead to widespread change in the City. He moved to soothe City concern over legislation on insider dealing being considered by parliament. Although it is more broadly based than existing laws, Mr Nelson said: 'I'm not about to embark on some kind of witch hunt for insider dealers.' He also rejected calls for a public inquiry into costs imposed by banks, particularly on small businesses. He said the government would continue to draw the banks' attention to the criticisms but added: 'We have to remind people that at the end of the day they must take a close interest in the management of their own savings.' Mr Nelson said he hoped to give further details of possible City reforms after a Treasury-commissioned review by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, is completed next year. He is also lobbying financial institutions to boost the quality of people seconded to regulatory bodies. 'I'd far rather have an imperfect structure with good human judgment than poor decisions being made within a perfect structure,' he said. A move into regulation should be seen as a 'route to the top', not a career 'sidewater'. Full interview, Page 12</p>

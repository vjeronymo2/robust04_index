			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Observer: In duplicate Every Brit in business knows that the interpretation of some obscure point of UK taxation law can represent the difference between profit and loss, at least for smallish companies. But which professional body is best fitted to watch over the training of future tax experts to advise on the interpreting? To date, the top qualifying body has been the Institute of Taxation, whose members, including lawyers as well as accountants, have been generally regarded as the ultimate gurus on the subject. Now, however, it faces a challenge from within the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales whose tax faculty is proposing to set up its own examinations. The move seems to be taxing tempers. The faculty's chairman Peter Wyman has complained that institute members have been organising opposition in an attempt to nobble the faculty's exam plans. Besides denying said charge, the institute's president Jennifer Ainsworth has riposted that the duplication 'would be divisive, would increase costs, and would cause training difficulties for major employers'. Whichever side may be right, it is gratifying to see the professional experts emitting the sort of heat more usually displayed by those whose role in taxation is merely to pay it.</p>

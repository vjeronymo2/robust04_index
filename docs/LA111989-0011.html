While schlockmeisters  such as Jeff Koons and Mark Kostabi are turning the art world into a joke with  their crass commercialism, Jon Serl has been quietly making important art  solely for the purpose of spiritual release.  </P> <P> Greed and irony may be hip nowadays, but how many of these younger artists will  still be thriving when they're 96?  </P> <P> DAVID CORRADO  </P> <P> Mar Vista  </P></p>

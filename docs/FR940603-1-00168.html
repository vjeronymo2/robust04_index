The Contractor will reinstall at his own expense any other units removed by him for his own convenience. The removal units are specified by the prefix I and followed by the assembly unit designation of existing assembly unit to be removed. For example, an I&hyph;A1 signifies the removal of an A1 assembly unit. The following special notes apply to specific removal units:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Poles. All poles of the same height, regardless of pole class, are designated by the same unit. Thus an I&hyph;30-foot pole signifies the removal of a 30-foot pole of any class. The Contractor is not required under this unit to remove from the pole any ground wire or pole numbering attached to the pole. This unit includes the refilling and tamping of holes in a workmanlike manner unless they are to be reused.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Pole-top assemblies. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself, any necessary handling, resagging, and retying of conductors in those cases where an existing pole-top assembly will be removed and replaced by a new pole-top assembly and where any existing conductor is to be reused.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies also includes any holding or handling of mainline or tap conductors at tap lines, angles, and deadends where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such conductor in accordance with the Specifications; for example, an I&hyph;A5&hyph;4 will include the disconnection of the tap conductors, snubbing off the tap line at the nearest practical point and the reconnection and resagging of these tap conductors if necessary to the new tap assembly when installed. The new unit of construction, however, will be specified separately in Section N.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Conductor. The conductor removal unit covers the removal of 1,000 feet of conductor or cable and reeling or coiling it in a workmanlike manner in such a way that it can be reused by the Contractor or the Owner. The Owner will furnish to the Contractor reels if it is to be returned to the Owner's warehouse on reels. The removal unit for each size of conductor or cable is shown by the prefix I followed by D and the conductor or cable type; thus an I&hyph;D 6ACWC signifies the removal unit for 1,000 feet of 6 A Copperweld-copper conductor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Philadelphia SE rejects CBoE merger The Philadelphia Stock Exchange has rejected the Chicago Board Options Exchange's bid for a merger, choosing for the third time in as many years to remain independent. The CBoE is reported to have bid Dollars 60m for the tiny exchange, which is known for its foreign currency and equity options products. The CBoE, the world's largest options exchange, made the offer for the Phlx in early November. 'The CBoE is disappointed that the Phlx has rejected our offer,' said Mr Alger 'Duke' Chapman, CBoE chairman. 'We are convinced that in these rapidly changing times that the two exchanges would be stronger together than apart.' Mr Chapman said his exchange maintained a co-operative relationship with the Phlx, and had left the door open for further merger discussions.</p>

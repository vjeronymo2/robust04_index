			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Mucklow static at Pounds 10.9m A&amp;J MUCKLOW Group, the West Midlands-based property investor and developer, reported pre-tax profits slightly ahead at Pounds 10.9m for the year to June 30, against Pounds 10.8m. The company said that the industrial and commercial property market was weak and housebuilding showed little improvement. A revaluation of its industrial and commercial property left a reduction in the revaluation reserve of Pounds 5.47m which has been incorporated into the accounts. A revaluation of other properties resulted in a surplus of Pounds 10.4m which has not been taken into the accounts. Earnings per share were 7.66p (8.11p). A final dividend of 3.103p is proposed for a total of 5.925p (5.643p).</p>

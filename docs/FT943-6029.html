			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / County's derivatives loss fuels calls for legislation Heavy losses on financial derivatives trading by a county administration in Maryland are fuelling calls in the US Congress for legislation to tighten oversight of the derivatives market. Charles County, Maryland, said its deputy treasurer had been dismissed after the county discovered a loss of an estimated Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 850,000) on investments in derivatives, including mortgage-backed securities. The investments also tied up about Dollars 27m, a quarter of the county's annual budget, in securities, which Mr Roger Fink, county attorney, says the local government was not authorised to buy. In a move that echoes the lengthy legal battle in the UK over Hammersmith and Fulham council's investments in swaps, the Maryland county has filed suit against the brokers involved in the trades to seek the return of the money invested. The British House of Lords ruled in 1990 that local government purchases of swaps were ultra vires and thus void. Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the US House of Representatives banking committee, said the losses confirmed the need for derivatives legislation, for which he has been arguing. 'How many more firms, pension funds and counties are we going to read about losing money due to derivatives before the Congress takes action?' he asked. The addition of local taxpayers to the list of losers in the fast-moving markets for derivatives - complex securities whose return is derived from another security or index - is expected to increase concern in Congress. In earlier congressional hearings on the need for tougher regulation of derivatives, many members said they were unmoved by news that large and sophisticated multinational companies, which should be able to look after themselves, had lost money in derivatives trading. Local government treasurers and local taxpayers, however, arouse more sympathy in Congress. Charles County faced a cash crisis as a consequence of the trades. The county saw itself as having been without authority, under state law, to have bought securities with a maturity longer than 270 days. Because it believed it never legally owned them, it could not sell them, Mr Fink said yesterday. However, to avoid freezing the securities during years of litigation, the county and the brokers being sued subsequently agreed to sell the portfolio. Mr Stephen Johnson, deputy treasurer but now dismissed, is running for election in November as treasurer. Ms Thelma Bowie, the treasurer who appointed Mr Johnson as her deputy, announced last week that she would resign before the election. Derivatives column, Page 31</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Contradictory data on UK house prices - At a glance HOUSE prices in the UK fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.2 per cent in May, according to the Halifax House Price Index. Prices had risen 1.4 per cent in March and 1.7 per cent in April. House prices are now 3.3 per cent below a year ago, compared to last month's figure of 2.3 per cent down on the year. But figures from the Nationwide building society this week showed a 1 per cent rise in house prices in May, with prices down 5.5 per cent from a year ago. The Halifax said that the housing market showed clear signs of recovery, but warned that realistic prices were still necessary to generate house sales. The Halifax predicts a gradual recovery in 1993, becoming more sustained in 1994, when house prices should grow broadly in line with earnings as a whole.</p>

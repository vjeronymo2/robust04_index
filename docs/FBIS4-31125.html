			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] In articles published under the rubric  "Fate of the Avram" in the 2 and 9 May issues of the Belgrade  opposition news weekly VREME, journalist Zoran Jelicic examines  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's economic stabilization  program, which was introduced in January 1994. Jelicic expresses  concern that the stable dinar, which is pegged to the German  mark and is a key element of the program, may not survive the  inflationary pressures of the second phase of the economic  recovery program and its plans for state support for key  industries. (The stable dinar is nicknamed "Avram" after Bank  Governor Dragoslav Avramovic, author of the stabilization  program.) In addition, Jelicic charges that the Serbian  Government's plan to establish coordinating groups for economic  recovery which will be responsible to a Central Coordinating  Team (CKT) is reminiscent of the central-planning, command  economy of the post World War II era.  <H5>  Inflationary Pressures </H5>   In the 2 May article, titled "The Conception of Inflation,"  Jelicic argues that the contents of the second phase of the  Program for the Recovery of the Yugoslav Economy introduced in  early May make it possible to predict "more or less accurately"  whether the dinar will remain stable or whether its "quiet  erosion" will begin. Jelicic recalls that there was disagreement  within the government over adoption of the "Avramovic Program"  in late 1993: The word of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic  was decisive in adopting the stability program, Jelicic writes,  while most of those involved in the decision, including Federal  Prime Minister Radoje Kontic and the majority of economists in  Serbia, viewed hyperinflation as unavoidable as long as the war  and sanctions lasted and favored a solution that would provide  state "support for the most important sectors, from the army to  medicine." Since January, however, the success of the Avramovic  program and the stable dinar policy -- the disappearance of "any  inflation whatsoever" on 24 January, maintenance of the  dinar-mark parity for the most part, and increase of the state's  hard currency reserves by 299 million marks -- and the resulting  "rapid influx of money into empty state coffers," Jelicic  writes, has "choked off disagreements on basic concepts" and  shifted discussion to the "second phase of the economic  stabliization program, `economic revival.'"    Judging from what has "leaked" to the public so far, Jelicic  concludes, what the Federal Government has prepared points  toward increased state spending. "Stimulus measures and more  stimulus measures" have been announced for those producers "in  which a state interest is ackowledged" and once again the  economy is being divided into "essential and nonessential  parts." Moreover, elements of a "policy of controlled prices"  are beginning to appear, not only for individual products or  services but for production factors (the cost of capital and  labor), and commercial banks are being "leaned on to secure  `necessary' means for clients," again for the "sake of reviving  production, and so forth."    Jelicic contrasts recent statements by key officials on the  government's approach. A recent Avramovic statement that a  "healthy national currency is the best basis for economic  expansion," Jelicic says, means that economic expansion is  possible "only where there is no `revival' of monetary emissions  without backing." Nevertheless, Jelicic points out, two vice  presidents responsible for coordinating implementation of the  recovery program -- Dragan Tomic of the Serbian Government (who  is also minister without portfolio in the Federal Government)  and Nikola Sainovic of the Federal Government -- were cited in  daily newspapers as advocating increased state support during a  recent visit to the Serbian industrial city of Kragujevac. Tomic  reportedly stated that the government was "in a major offensive  to stoke up the economy" and that "it goes without saying that  we will support those who produce." Sainovic, saying that he  "supported monetary stability," at the same time added: "We are  in favor of the spirit of free market competition under the  conditions of the sanctions, with special reference to those  collectives in which the sanctions have caused especially  negative consequences." Jelicic also cites newspaper reports  that the Federal Government will draft a "special program" to  increase the use of "`special-purpose' (weapons) production  capacities." Jelicic implies that the Zastava firm in Kragujevac  is a potential candidate, since its civilian sector will  probably produce only 20,000 automobiles this year, thus  operating at only 10 percent of its capacity.    Jelicic cites other evidence of pressure for state  intervention, pointing out that Tomic -- longtime director of  the Simpo firm in Vranje, a major manufacturer and distributor  of furniture and other household products, and a member of the  board of governors of the National Bank of Yugoslavia -- has  been best known for organizing regular weekly roundtables on  state television that bring together representatives of various  economic sectors to uncover ways to revive production "through  mutual aid, but also with government aid." In one such  discussion, Jelicic adds, an enterprise director said "with  complete candor" that he was looking forward to the completion  of the state budgets because "this would make possible more  money and more work for his company." In short, Jelicic  observes, the picture is very reminiscent of the early  post-World War II era when Edvard Kardelj was in charge of  economic policy or, "more precisely, of all times when, under  various names, an economy without a sound currency was created."  <H5>  Role of Coordinating Teams </H5>   In his 9 May article, titled "The CKT as the CK [Central  Committee]," Jelicic focuses on the proposed organizational  structure of the recovery program -- drafted in the office of  Dragan Tomic -- and warns that under this plan, the Serbian  economy will find itself under an administration reminiscent of  the state administrative-operational leaderships (AOR) of the  central- planning, command-economy era of the late 1940's and  early 1950's. The only differences, he says, would be in the  name -- at that time the AOR's and today the SKT's (special  coordinating teams) -- and in the fact that the SKT's, unlike  the AOR's, are not subordinated to a ministry, but to the CKT,  the "organizational center" for implementing the recovery  program.    Describing the structure of the Operational Program, Jelicic  presents an organizational diagram "drawn up by Dragan Tomic"  which shows that the CKT is responsible directly to the Serbian  Government and that SKT's for "branches of production" are  subordinate to the CKT. The diagram explains everything, Jelicic  states, warning that "one should not examine it superficially or  interpret it lightly." The "center of centers," he says, is  Dragan Tomic, the Serbian minister "responsible for coordinating  the implementation of the Avramovic economic stabilization  plan." Next in the hierarchy, within the CKT, are the  "magnificent seven," identified by the plan as "the most  competent specialists," who are ready to provide the  prerequisites for the successful implementation of the recovery  program. Other economic players in the republic -- regional and  local governments, commercial banks, unions, scientific  institutes, and production enterprises (companies) -- are also  subordinate to the CKT, either directly or through the SKT's.  Jelicic observes that enterprises are found at the bottom of the  organizational diagram, several layers removed from the CKT, and  that "judging by the diagram," the Serbian Government went as  far as possible to "humiliate enterprises and businessmen."    The "main task" of the CKT, Jelicic writes, is to form  specialized teams in production, trade, and the banking system  and to establish a specialized bank or consortium of banks that  will provide "indispensable financial support to carry out  concrete plans of the economic recovery program." The basic task  of the SKT's is to "implement the general policy and directives  of the central team," and, within this framework, to draft and  carry out their own operating plans. Another major duty of the  SKT's, according to the plan, is to inform the public once a  month "via special television programs and other means of  information about the results of the recovery of production in  various economic sectors on the basis of benchmarks for the  successful implementation of the program (volume of production,  number of enterprises rehabilitated, number of productive new  employees, and so forth), as well as about planned measures and  activities."    Subordinate to the SKT's are management teams, Jelicic says,  noting that "their task is easier" because they do not have to  report to the public, but only to those to whom they are  subordinate, and "managers have been promised that they will be  given special awards for their work in the form of various types  of incentives." A footnote in the organizational diagram states  that members of the management teams are drawn from specialists  from "successful enterprises, chambers, institutes, faculties,  and elsewhere." The management teams oversee "enterprises that  are being given direct assistance to improve production."  <H5>  Avramovic Defends Organizational Plan </H5>   According to statements made in an interview aired 11 May on  the Belgrade RTB Television Network, Dragoslav Avramovic  apparently does not share Jelicic's apprehension about the fate  of the currency nicknamed for him. Asked to comment on Tomic's  plan to form coordinating groups for the recovery of the  economy, Avramovic replied: "Well, this is an extraordinary  initiative. We have been thinking about it, but not in terms of  such concentrated and extensive efforts as he has undertaken. We  expect all the best from it, as the key to our future recovery  lies in the reconstruction of our production systems and big  companies. There could not have been a better initiative than  the creation of these coordinating groups, which will take care  of the revival of production, further investments, and the  resolution of all problems that some of our companies face."</p>

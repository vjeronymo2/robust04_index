It is mainly used to  describe changes in such property rights as arising from  enterprise mergers, amalgamations, sales, and auctions, as well  as purchases of shares in enterprises.    Since our country introduced the policies of reform and  opening up, lateral ties among enterprises have developed  constantly. During the process, some enterprises whose  liabilities exceed assets, whose production capacities cannot  satisfy the requirements of the economic scale, and whose  economic returns are poor have been amalgamated, in an active or  passive manner, with enterprises generating good economic  returns. Some enterprises have bought the property rights of  other enterprises, thus annexing the latter by depriving them of  their qualifications as legal persons or by changing their  status as legal entities. Competent departments have begun to  sell the property rights of some small state-owned industrial  and commercial enterprises, especially those whose liabilities  exceed assets, those which approach bankruptcy, those which have  chronically operated poorly, and those which have suffered  losses or made meager profits for successive years. Some  localities have established enterprise auction markets to  auction off property rights. Some have sold property rights in  their entirety while others have sold them separately in the  form of shares. Since the early eighties, Sino-foreign joint  ventures have mushroomed and the enterprise shareholding system  has gradually taken shape. There have been mutual purchases of  shares between state-owned and foreign-funded enterprises, among  state-owned enterprises, between state-owned enterprises and  enterprises not under state ownership, and between enterprises  and individuals. This has resulted in interchanges among various  principal holders of property rights. Shares and share  certificates issued by joint stock enterprises have been traded  openly through listing or over the counter. The movement of  property rights has been fairly constant.    The aforementioned changes in property rights are generally  termed the movement and realignment of property rights. They  are the positive results of reform of our country's economic  structure. According to state provisions, assets must be  evaluated and the evaluation results must be verified by  competent departments prior to the movement and realignment of  property rights.</p>

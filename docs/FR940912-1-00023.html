			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Format for the Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As authorized under section 111 of the Act, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards consist of a combination of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and equipment, design, and work practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Emission standards are used whenever feasible;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, such standards are not feasible in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. In some cases, alternative emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are also proposed. Separate standards for tanks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface impoundments, containers, individual drain systems,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil-water separators, treatment processes, and control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices are proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed standards, SOCMI process unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams with a volatile organic concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (measured using Reference Method 25D, 40 CFR part 60,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A) greater than or equal to 500 ppmw and flow rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than or equal to 1.0 liter per minute (Lpm) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be controlled. In addition, any wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream with a volatile organic concentration greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10,000 ppmw would be controlled under the regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of flow rate. Process units that generate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater with a total annual volatile organic mass of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1 Mg are exempt from the wastewater control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed wastewater treatment standard involves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of a controlled collection and treatment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to individual wastewater streams that fail the cut off  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria. The treatment requirements are designed to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the VOC content in the wastewater prior to placement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units without air emission controls. The proposal includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a variety of compliance options in order to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment process standard. These include a recycling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option involving recycling of the wastewater to a process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit, an equipment design and operation standard, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerical emission standard formatted as an effluent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration limit, and a numerical emission standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> format in terms a mass removal requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to treatment, the wastewater must be managed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units equipped with air emission controls, and wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection and treatment systems must be designed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated without leaks, as defined in the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following is a summary of the specific standards for each of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the individual types of SOCMI wastewater units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Standards for Tanks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed standards, owners and operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required, with two exceptions, to place wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams in one of the following types of tanks depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tank capacity and vapor pressure of the stored material:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A tank equipped with a cover (e.g., a fixed roof) and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed vent system and control device that meets certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design, inspection, and measurement specifications specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the rules; (2) a tank equipped with a fixed roof and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal floating roof that meets the design requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified under the existing volatile organic liquid (VOL)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage NSPS (40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb); (3) a tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with an external floating roof that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design, inspection, and measurement requirements specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the existing VOL storage NSPS; or (4) a pressure tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is designed and operated with no pressure releases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during normal operations including waste loading and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unloading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rules would provide two exceptions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank control requirements described above. First, when an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected stream (i.e., one in which the wastewater has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass-weighted average volatile organic concentration equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to or greater than 500 ppmw) is managed in certain size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks and possesses certain vapor pressure characteristics,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an owner or operator would be allowed to place the waste in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a tank equipped with a fixed roof. Second, when the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is placed in a biological treatment tank that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological organic degradation performance requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., 95-percent destruction efficiency), no additional air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission controls would be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each cover opening not vented to a control device would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to be maintained in a closed, sealed position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except at those times when a specific opening is used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> add, remove, inspect, or sample the waste in the tank or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underneath the cover. Safety devices that vent directly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the atmosphere could be used on the cover or closedvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system with control device provided that the safety device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the safety device remains in a closed, sealed position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at all times except when an unplanned event requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opening of the device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Standards for Surface Impoundments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The owner or operator of an affected surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundment is required to install and use emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. The proposed rules would require owners or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators to place waste in a surface impoundment equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a cover (e.g., air-supported structure) and a closed-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vent system with control device or, when applicable, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface impoundment equipped with a floating membrane cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the air emission control. If the surface impoundment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for biological treatment that meets the same organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biodegradation performance requirements described above for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks, no additional air emission controls would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be used on the surface impoundment. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating and venting requirements for surface impoundment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air emission control equipment are consistent with the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Standards for Containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards would not apply to a container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that has a design capacity less than or equal to 0.1 cubic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meter (m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (26.4 gallons (gal)). The owner or operator of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an affected container would be required to place the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material either into a container equipped with a cover that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operates with no detectable organic emissions when all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> openings are secured in a closed, sealed position or to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the alternative requirements discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative requirements under the proposed standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a drum with a design capacity less than or equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.42 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (110 gal) would allow an owner or operator to place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the waste in a drum meeting the Department of Transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (DOT) specifications and testing requirements under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR part 178. For a drum meeting these DOT regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring, nor recordkeeping of cover design documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required under the proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another alternative for containers under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards would require the owner or operator of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container that attaches to or forms a part of any truck,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trailer, or rail car to show that the container has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested for organic vapor tightness within the preceding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 months in accordance with the requirements of Method 27  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Method 27 is a pressure test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure originally developed by the EPA for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vapor-leak tightness of a tank truck into which gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is placed. The EPA also considers the use of Method 27 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be appropriate for determining vapor-leak tightness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trucks, trailers, and rail cars into which wastes containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organics are placed. Neither Method 21, leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring, nor recordkeeping of cover design documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required for trucks, trailers, or rail cars complying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this provision of the rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / CNBC targets Europe and Asia for expansion CNBC, the NBC cable television channel that specialises in business news, is planning to expand in Europe and eastern Asia. The 24-hour channel carries around 12 hours a day of programmes devoted to Wall Street, supplemented by consumer and other news. Several individual CNBC programmes are already broadcast to Europe on Super Channel, the pan-European channel which claims it is available in around 50m homes. CNBC is expected to announce today significant expansion of programming carried on Super Channel. CNBC, available in 48m homes in the US, is also considering significant expansion in Asia by joining a satellite system there. The CNBC move is the latest example of US cable television programmers expanding overseas, particularly Europe. This week, Turner Broadcasting said it was launching its Cartoon Network and Turner Network Television in Europe on the Astra satellite, while Viacom said recently that it was introducing its Nickelodeon channel to Europe in a joint venture with British Sky Television.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / BP to cut workforce by 20,500 worldwide BRITISH Petroleum yesterday announced it would cut a further 9,000 jobs worldwide by 1995, increasing an earlier figure for expected job losses to a total of 20,500, or 20 per cent of the workforce. The cuts are in addition to previously announced plans to cut 11,500 jobs by early 1993. The job losses are part of a cost-cutting drive launched by Mr David Simon when he became group chief executive. this year. BP aims to cut Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from operating costs by 1995. The company said yesterday it had set a target to make 5,000 direct job cuts over the next two years, with a further 4,000 jobs to be lost through the divestment of peripheral businesses. The latest reductions will come mainly from the downstream part of the business - refining operations and petrol stations - where competition and low oil products prices have squeezed margins while demand remains affected by the recession. But BP also indicated that further cuts in its corporate staff will be made. BP has suffered from increasing debts and a huge net cash outflow to fund its ambitious oil exploration programme. The company is expected to incur a loss of around Pounds 500m this year on a replacement cost basis, partly as a result of provisions made for job cuts mid-year. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is at 87 per cent and, in spite of the dividend cut earlier this year, analysts believe it could rise above 90 per cent by the end of the year. But Mr Simon hopes that by saving Dollars 1bn a year, he can add Dollars 600m to annual profits by 1995. He hopes to cut Dollars 400m from refining and marketing costs, Dollars 300m from the corporate centre, Dollars 200m from exploration and production and Dollars 100m from chemicals. He also hopes to boost profits by a further Dollars 400m from reduced advance corporation tax tax payments and improved efficiency. BP Chemicals yesterday said it was closing a 50,000 tonne a year butadiene plant with the loss of 40 jobs at its Baglan Bay site in South Wales, adds Paul Abrahams. Dow Chemical announced yesterday it was mothballing a 20,000 tonne a year polystyrene plant in Bilbao and shutting a 14,000 tonne a year latex unit from May. London Stock Exchange, Page 40</p>

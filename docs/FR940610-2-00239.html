Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA issued on August 21, 1992, (57 FR 38102) a final rule establishing Worker Protection Standards (WPS) for agricultural pesticides (40 CFR part 170). The WPS includes a prohibition against routine early entry to pesticide treated areas to perform hand labor tasks during restricted-entry intervals (referred to as ``early entry''). Section 170.112(e) of the WPS provides a process for considering exceptions to this prohibition against early entry. In the same August 21, 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA proposed to grant an exception to the early-entry prohibition for the cut flower and cut fern industries. Information received from the industry during the comment period for the proposed WPS persuaded EPA that there could be substantial economic repercussions if routine hand labor tasks were prohibited during the restricted-entry interval (57 FR 38175). EPA solicited comments on the proposed exception for the cut flower and cut fern industries and received a wide range of comments both supporting and opposing the proposed exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. EPA's Exception Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has reviewed the information received and has decided to grant a modified exception to the early-entry prohibition for harvesting greenhouse-grown cut roses only. The information submitted by the rose industry combined with EPA's knowledge of rose production convinced EPA that rose growers could suffer a substantial economic impact if compliance with the WPS early-entry restrictions were required. EPA is granting a 2&hyph;year exception to provide rose growers time to adjust pesticide spray schedules, find early-entry alternatives, and develop technology. The exception is subject to conditions designed to mitigate risk to early-entry workers. EPA believes that early entry under the terms of the exception for the period of 2 years will not pose unreasonable adverse effects to rose harvesters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the economic benefits of a 2&hyph;year exception for rose growers may be high and that the conditions of this exception will mitigate workers' risks. EPA does not, however, have sufficient information about the risks and benefits of the exception to grant a broader or longer term exception. If the rose industry determines that it needs an exception beyond 2 years, the industry will need to provide additional information on the economic benefits of an exception, as well as the risks, in a new exception request under 170.112(e)(1). This information should include worker exposure data, poisoning incident data, personal protective equipment feasibility information, and data on the economics of rose production and how WPS early <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> -entry restrictions affect revenues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has not received sufficient information to warrant an exception to the early-entry prohibition for other cut flower and cut fern producers at this time. Information submitted in some comments suggests that alternatives to early entry exist for these other crops and that such an early entry prohibition would not cause economic repercussions great enough to outweigh the risk to workers. Growers of other cut flowers and cut ferns who would still like EPA to consider an exception for these crops should submit an exception request which supplies the information outlined in 170.112(e)(1). This includes information on crop production and pesticide use practices, alternative practices, economic data, safety practices, and the costs and feasibility of implementing the conditions under which an exception would be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Comments, Summary of Major Issues Raised in the Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  and EPA's Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the WPS, EPA prohibited early entry for hand labor such as harvesting because EPA concluded that entry during a restricted-entry interval (REI) to perform routine hand labor tasks is rarely necessary, that personal protective equipment (PPE) for field workers is impractical because workers may remove it or use it incorrectly, and that PPE may be risk inducing because of heat stress concerns. Here, the rose industry has made a case, at least for the interim, that routine entry during an REI to harvest roses is necessary and that prohibiting such entry could have a substantial economic impact on rose growers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, EPA is granting a limited exception to allow workers to harvest greenhouse-grown cut roses to avoid excessive economic burden to rose growers. Under conditions described below, workers may enter treated areas under an REI to harvest roses. EPA believes that in rose greenhouses, the use of PPE, a limitation on worker-exposure time, accessible decontamination facilities, provision of label-specific information to workers, basic pesticide safety training, and shade and mechanical cooling devices will mitigate risks for rose harvesters. The following additional factors contributed to EPA's decision: (1) PPE would be worn for only limited periods of time; (2) greenhouses usually encompass a much smaller area than field crops so that employers should more easily be able to ensure that workers wear the PPE; (3) harvesting could be accomplished in a reasonably efficient manner while wearing the required PPE, including coveralls, chemical-resistant gloves (possibly as liners underneath leather gloves), chemical-resistant footwear and headgear (if the potential for head exposure exists), and protective eyewear; (4) the accessibility, usual in rose greenhouses, of running water and in many cases showers for decontamination and heat-stress alleviation; and (5) the availability, also usual in rose greenhouses, of shade, fans, or other mechanical ventilation to provide some cooling. EPA therefore believes that early entry with PPE would be feasible and provide adequate reduction of risks to rose harvesters. Under the conditions of this exception there will be less pesticide exposure to rose harvesters than in the past. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because of continuing uncertainty about the potential risks to early-entry rose harvesters and about the extent of the economic impact of WPS entry restrictions, and because EPA believes that certain alternative practices will eventually reduce or eliminate the need for early entry for rose harvesting, EPA is limiting the exception to 2 years. Should industry determine it needs an exception beyond 2 years, the industry will need to provide EPA with additional information on risks and benefits to support such an exception request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Economic Need <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments received from rose growers estimated annual revenue losses from $22,000 to more than $50,000 per acre as a result of restricted-entry intervals imposed by the WPS, should no exception be granted. Roses, Incorporated, a national association representing rose growers, estimated an average annual loss of $35,000 per acre for rose growers nationally. This is based on an estimated loss of the equivalent of 1 day's harvest per week due to the WPS. These figures appear to be based on the frequency at which pesticides are normally applied in rose production, the toxicity categories of the pesticides most commonly used on roses, and the need to harvest roses 2 times per day to ensure the harvested crop will yield a premium price. One comment stated that a rose crop can lose 80 percent of its value in 5 hours if not harvested promptly. Several rose growers commented that, given the practices currently employed on their operations, they would lose from 10 percent to 28 percent of their crop as a result of the WPS prohibition against reentry for harvesting during restricted-entry intervals, which range from 12 to 48 hours. These comments cite an average loss of 1 to 2&hyph;days' harvest each week depending on the pesticides applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many growers also cited foreign competition in the rose industry as posing a serious economic threat. According to information submitted, imported roses, which represented less than 10 percent of the domestic market in 1980, now account for approximately 50 percent of the U.S. rose supply. Several comments noted that roses can be produced outside the U.S. with far lower labor costs and fewer government restrictions on chemicals used and on workplace safety. A few comments stated that domestic rose producers have managed to retain an economic edge over their foreign competitors by producing higher quality roses. These comments also noted, however, that quality rose production is dependent on intensive pesticide use to ensure an enhanced cosmetic standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments opposing the exception noted that the industry's estimates are based on current practices which rely on entry as soon as sprays have dried and dusts have settled. These comments suggested that alternative cultivation practices, such as improved scheduling of pesticide applications around essential work activities and use of nonchemical or less-toxic chemical pesticides, would either greatly reduce or eliminate the need for early entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One rose grower also noted that improved worker safety, while important in itself, has economic benefits which would offset some of the costs to employers brought on by the conditions of the exception proposed by EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA currently has insufficient information to project quantitatively the economic impacts of not granting an exception to rose growers at this time. Given current practices, it is clear that without an exception to early-entry prohibitions, rose growers would be forced to change their practices. EPA expects that such changes in pesticide-use patterns, harvesting, post-harvest handling, scheduling of activities, or other cultural practices will either decrease growers' revenues, increase costs, or both, thereby decreasing growers' income at least in the short run. Given EPA's knowledge of rose culture, including the high per acre value of rose production, and information presented in comments submitted by rose growers, EPA believes that the impacts of denying the exception at this time could be substantial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also believes that the entry requirements set out in the terms of the exception will encourage the rose industry to adopt alternative production practices which ultimately will reduce the need for early entry, the toxicity of pesticide used, the frequency of pesticide use, and, eventually, the potential economic losses resulting from WPS entry restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Risk to Workers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most comments opposing the proposed exception identified risk to workers as a primary concern. These comments observed that the frequency and volume of pesticide use in flower production which is necessary to maintain a high cosmetic standard contributes to worker exposure risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments included specific information about injuries and poisonings relating to benomyl use. (EPA notes that in 1992 all ornamental uses of benomyl, including use on roses, were voluntarily cancelled. Therefore benomyl should pose no added risk to workers harvesting roses under this exception.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of comments also noted injuries to workers in cut-fern operations and included testimonials from fern workers who suffered pesticide-related illnesses or injuries. Some comments included reference to a study (Brouwer et. al. 1991) which suggested that workers in cut flower cultivation may experience higher exposure than workers who apply the pesticides. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most comments from growers, on the other hand, noted safety records reflecting few, if any, lost work days as a result of worker exposure to pesticides. Roses, Inc., surveyed its members in 1988 about pesticide safety records and suggested that the survey results supported these comments. However, due to the limited scope of the survey and because the survey to some extent relied on growers' memories for data collection, it is difficult to draw conclusions from the results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many growers' comments noted that a factor contributing to rose workplace safety is the relative stability of the work force. Since roses are cultivated year round there is less worker turnover than in other, seasonal crops. Some growers cited an average employment period of 5 years or more per worker, and others added that rose workers are frequently paid by the hour rather than at a piece rate, which may encourage safer work practices. Rose growers also commented that productive workers must be trained and gain experience in cultivation and harvesting techniques. This employer investment also contributes to work force stability and safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employers' Reports of Occupational Injuries, compiled by the California Department of Industrial Relations from 1981 to 1990, indicate that workers in horticultural specialty crops, which include roses, had a slightly higher rate of pesticide poisoning (0.53 poisonings per 1,000 workers per year) than that for agricultural workers in general (0.46 poisonings per 1,000 workers per year). This data, as well as information gathered by Agency experts about intensive pesticide use in rose production, has led EPA to determine that, without PPE and the other protective conditions of this exception, risk is as high or higher for rose harvesters as for workers harvesting outdoor agricultural crops such as strawberries, cotton, leaf crops, etc. EPA believes worker exposure risk is a serious concern in greenhouse rose production. Certain workplace conditions discussed below, however, increase the likelihood that the conditions of this exception will effectively mitigate worker exposure risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Brouwer study measured pesticide residues collected on hand and arm coverings worn by workers during flower-cultivation activities without any protective clothing or gloves being placed between treated foliage and the residue collectors. Workers in the Brouwer study were not provided with or required to use protective gear and their time in treated areas was not limited. EPA believes the conditions of this exception, which also include training about pesticide hazards and personal safety, and employer-provided PPE and decontamination facilities, will reduce worker exposure during harvesting activities permitted by this exception. Because the rose workforce is comparatively small and stable, EPA believes the conditions placed on this exception will be easier to implement and monitor than for many other agricultural crops. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA remains concerned about worker risk in rose cultivation. EPA is gathering the data necessary to establish chemical-specific REIs to ensure workers are adequately protected from risks associated with reentry. As a result of this process, some product-specific REIs appearing on pesticide labels include special restrictions. The exception described in this Notice may be used unless early entry is expressly prohibited in product labeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Conditions of the Exception <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1992, EPA proposed to grant this exception subject to the following conditions: (1) The PPE specified on the product labeling for early entry is provided, cleaned, and maintained for the worker by the employer, and measures to prevent heat-related illness are implemented, when appropriate; (2) no entry takes place for the first 4 hours after the application and, thereafter, until any exposure level listed in the labeling has been reached or any ventilation criteria established by the WPS or in the labeling have been met; (3) the time in treated areas for each worker may not exceed 3 hours in any 24&hyph;hour period; (4) the required decontamination and change areas are provided; and (5) the required basic training and label-specific information have been furnished. Public comments on these conditions, which are designed to mitigate risk to early-entry workers, are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time the exception was proposed, EPA expected that the basic provisions of the WPS for all workers would be provided for early-entry workers under this exception. However, since recent legislation has delayed the compliance date of certain WPS provisions, some of those basic protections have been incorporated into the conditions of this exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Personal protective equipment (PPE). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several comments opposing the exception stated that PPE use is not practical or feasible for harvesters. The Farmworker Justice Fund and others noted that often workers are not provided with PPE because it is expensive. Farmworker advocates also commented that PPE is not practical for harvesting cut flowers because it is awkward to use and uncomfortable. This, they argued, is a disincentive for some workers_those paid a piece rate_to use PPE since it could slow their work and thus reduce their pay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments from rose growers echoed these concerns and recommended EPA permit early entry with normal work attire (long sleeved shirt, long pants, shoes and socks) and leather gloves, expressing fear that a crop could be damaged by PPE-encumbered harvesters. Other rose growers noted that, relative to the value of lost crop without an exception, the cost of PPE is low. Therefore, employers would assume the cost of providing PPE to their workers if it were a condition of the exception. Some growers also commented that rose workers are frequently paid by the hour rather than a piece rate. In such cases, there would be no economic reason for workers to avoid use of PPE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA notes that in most situations_even for toxicity category I pesticides_the most PPE that would be required for early-entry workers will be coveralls over long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, socks, chemical-resistant footwear, and chemical-resistant gloves. If the pesticide is an eye irritant, eye protection also will be required. EPA believes that this level of PPE is not likely to affect workers' mobility or dexterity to the extent that it could lead to a damaged crop or discourage workers from using the required PPE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Farmworker Justice Fund and other commenters who opposed the exception questioned the feasibility of PPE for protecting workers. Some comments cited a study evaluating PPE during chemical applications (Fenske, R.A., 1988) which demonstrated certain deficiencies in PPE's protective qualities. These deficiencies included pesticide exposure through seams and openings in protective garments. The study also showed exposure as a result of workers removing gloves because of discomfort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA notes that, while some problems identified in the Fenske study which involved pesticide applicators may also apply to early-entry workers, the potential circumstances of exposure differ. Under this exception, early-entry workers would enter to work in a treated area under an REI only after a minimum of 4 hours have elapsed since the end of an application, while applicators involved in treating the area would have potential for direct exposure to pesticide formulations as they are applied. Additionally, the time in treated areas under this exception would be limited to 3 hours per worker per day. Also, since the Fenske study, several PPE manufacturers have made improvements in their products including better engineered seam closures, lighter-weight materials, and enhanced comfort for workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical-resistant gloves and glove liners. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the product label requires chemical-resistant gloves, the WPS allows rose harvesters to use chemical-resistant glove liners under leather gloves in lieu of chemical-resistant gloves because of concern over sharp thorns. (Once leather gloves have been worn for this use, thereafter they may only be worn with chemical-resistant glove liners and for no other use.) Roses, Inc., and other commenters in favor of the exception requested that EPA allow rose harvesters to use leather gloves only in lieu of either chemical-resistant gloves or leather gloves with chemical-resistant glove liners. These comments stated that chemical-resistant gloves that are sufficiently supple and durable for rose harvesting are not yet available. Roses, Inc., after testing some glove options with member growers, added that chemical-resistant glove liners tend to be uncomfortable to wear and cause hands to sweat excessively which may encourage skin and fingernail diseases. One comment suggested permitting the use of cotton glove liners in lieu of chemical-resistant liners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA remains convinced that leather gloves do not sufficiently prevent pesticide exposure, and in many cases may pose a greater hazard than if no gloves at all are worn. Since leather is virtually impossible to decontaminate once impregnated with pesticide residues, workers who wear such gloves are subjecting their hands to uninterrupted contact with residues and are thus at increased risk of pesticide-related problems. Agency experts also doubt the ability of cotton liners to be an effective barrier to residues given the duration and conditions under which the gloves would likely be worn. EPA notes that obtaining chemical-resistant gloves of a quality and durability appropriate for harvesting thorn-type roses is difficult at present. However, several varieties of lightweight and disposable chemical-resistant gloves and glove liners are currently available which EPA believes, when worn under leather gloves, would not significantly affect a worker's dexterity. EPA therefore continues to require the use of either chemical-resistant gloves or leather gloves over chemical-resistant glove liners under this exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Heat stress. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Another concern expressed in the comments was that PPE may increase workers' risk of heat stress. Information was presented that suggested heat is a serious health threat to workers, particularly those in fern operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several growers commented that PPE would not pose a significant heat problem for rose workers because of several mitigating factors. These comments noted that temperature must be carefully regulated for successful rose cultivation through use of fans and venting during hot weather. One comment added that it is rare for temperatures in a rose greenhouse to exceed 90 degrees. Comments also added that water for drinking and decontamination is immediately available in virtually all rose greenhouses. EPA believes that such conditions make it likely that PPE will not pose the risk of heat-related illness to be expected for workers in other crops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conclusions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . EPA recognizes the potential risks of worker exposure and heat stress during early-entry work; however, EPA believes that the PPE required under the exception is feasible and likely to provide adequate reduction of risks to workers in the rose industry. This is based on several factors: PPE would be worn for only limited periods of time; harvesters could work relatively efficiently while wearing the required PPE; water for drinking and decontamination is immediately available in most rose greenhouses; and the usual presence in rose greenhouses of fans or other mechanical ventilation to provide some cooling. Also, that the rose workforce is relatively stable and frequently paid an hourly wage rather than a piece rate, contributes to this determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this exception, EPA is requiring that early-entry workers wear PPE listed on the pesticide product label for early-entry workers. Early-entry PPE is generally equal to that which would be worn by applicators of the chemical in question (minus respirators, since entry is prohibited until the exposure level listed on the labeling has been reached or any ventilation criteria established by the WPS or in the labeling have been met). Additionally, under the conditions of this exception, early-entry workers would be instructed how to put on, use, and take off early-entry PPE, the importance of washing thoroughly after removing PPE, and how to prevent, recognize, and give first aid for heat-related illness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4&hyph;hour prohibition versus ``sprays dried and dusts settled <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' Several growers commented that the performance standard of ``sprays have dried and dusts have settled'' is preferable to EPA's generic entry prohibition of 4 hours after an application. Comments noted that the ``sprays dried/dust settled'' standard is both more workable for their industry and more protective of workers: sprays usually dry in 2 &hyph; 3 hours, but sometimes, in humid greenhouse conditions, may not be dry until after more than 4 hours have elapsed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments, both favoring and opposing the exception, cited California regulations governing re-entry. The California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) also submitted comments. California's current regulations allow reentry for hand labor activities when sprays have dried and dusts have settled for most toxicity category II and III pesticides, and for six category I pesticides of importance to the greenhouse industry. (These six category I pesticides are skin and eye irritants.) Otherwise, entry is restricted for 24 hours following application of a category I product. According to CDPR, ``These reduced entry intervals are based on workers being protected by work clothes and gloves, and instructions to shower at the end of the work period.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA adopted the generic 4&hyph;hour period of no entry as a means of removing personal judgment from the entry equation. Sprays dry at different rates in different parts of a treated area, depending on greenhouse conditions. Therefore, it is a difficult and subjective decision as to when entry is permissible under a ``sprays dried'' standard. For this reason, the ``sprays dried'' standard is also difficult to enforce. EPA continues to believe that there should be no entry into freshly treated areas which would involve contact with treated surfaces until the dusts or sprays have settled and some drying or volatilization of the formulation has taken place_4 hours. Thus, under this exception, EPA prohibits entry to treated areas for the first 4 hours after an application. (Also, entry is not permitted until any exposure level listed on the labeling has been reached or any ventilation criteria established by the WPS or in the labeling have been met. In some cases this will exceed 4 hours.) EPA believes that the conditions of this exception will protect workers from hazardous pesticide exposures regardless of a pesticide's toxicity category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  3 hours per worker per 24 hours limit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . EPA proposed that each worker could not exceed 3 hours of early entry in any 24&hyph;hour period. The 3&hyph;hour limit was based on comments from Roses, Inc., on the proposed WPS which stated that 3 hours per worker per 24 hours would allow for most harvest needs and would limit worker exposure. Many comments from growers recommended extending the amount of time a worker may spend in a restricted area beyond 3 hours in a 24&hyph;hour period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments from rose growers suggested that normally 3 hours per worker per 24&hyph;hour period would be sufficient to carry out necessary harvesting during a restricted-entry interval. Most comments noted, however, that an early-entry worker may need to harvest for more than 3 hours during holiday harvest times. One comment stated that up to 8 hours could be needed. A few comments recommended a weekly standard rather than a 24&hyph;hour limit. Roses, Inc., also suggested that, given the proposed PPE conditions, a time limit would not be necessary. Some grower comments, however, indicated that the 3&hyph;hour limit would not pose significant problems and that pesticide applications could be scheduled around holiday harvests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments opposing the exception raised the concern of worker non-compliance: if harvesters are paid piece rate they will have a strong economic incentive to exceed the 3&hyph;hour limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is persuaded of the industry's economic need, given current production practices, to harvest roses during restricted-entry intervals, and recognizes that the time required to harvest roses varies from greenhouse to greenhouse and depends on holiday demand. Based on comments submitted by industry and knowledge of rose cultivation practices, EPA will accept 3 hours to be the amount of time needed to meet most harvest needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA points out that the effectiveness of PPE, upon which workers will rely to prevent exposure, declines the longer equipment is worn. Chemical resistance also decreases with time. Additionally, the longer a worker wears PPE the more likely it becomes that the worker will remove pieces as the PPE grows less comfortable. EPA believes an individual should not exceed 3 hours of early-entry rose harvesting in any 24&hyph;hour period. Therefore, the proposed 3&hyph;hour limit remains a condition of the exception. Any employers allowing their workers to exceed the 3&hyph;hour limit would be violating the WPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Decontamination facilities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Worker advocates commented that decontamination supplies will be too expensive for many employers to justify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Growers have responded that, like PPE, decontamination supplies are cheap relative to the value of crop lost due to entry restrictions. Employers would therefore assume the cost of decontamination supplies as a condition of the exception. Rose growers also commented that water for drinking and decontamination are immediately available in virtually all rose greenhouses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has decided that the proposed exception requirements for decontamination should remain a condition of this exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Training and label information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . EPA proposed that early-entry workers be given the required basic safety training for workers and be provided with label-specific information before any early-entry work which involved contact with treated surfaces. Some comments submitted by growers stated that the training and communication requirements were extensive, and requested clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA notes that the basic safety training for early-entry workers under this exception is identical to the basic safety training for other workers covered by the WPS, but early-entry workers must be trained before the early-entry work. EPA has prepared the basic materials and resources for worker training under the WPS and is currently distributing these widely through the States, USDA Cooperative Extension Service, and other training networks. Additionally, EPA will provide copies of such training resources directly to the rose industry to help facilitate training as required under the exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the provision of label-specific information, EPA believes that workers harvesting roses during an REI should be informed about the hazards associated with the chemicals to which they could be exposed. Early-entry workers may either read the product labeling or the employer may inform the worker of the appropriate labeling requirements. EPA believes this will not be unreasonably burdensome given the potential value of the information to workers, and has decided to maintain this as a condition of the exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Time limitation and alternative practices <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Several comments recommended a strict time limit, should an exception be granted, to provide an incentive for developing and implementing alternative practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides (NCAMP) stated in their comments that a time limit for an exception ``is an appropriate tool to encourage the development and implementation of alternative pest control methods which will result in greater worker safety.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble to the WPS, EPA stated that the elimination of routine early entry for hand labor activities may ``force'' the development of technology such as engineering controls, mechanical harvesters, weeders, and pruners in crops where the timing of such tasks is critical (57 FR 38116&hyph;38117, August 21, 1992). This exception is intended as an interim measure which will allow growers time to explore and implement early-entry alternatives which are appropriate for cut rose production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments from both growers and worker advocates cited the existence of alternatives which should reduce the need for early entry within a few years. Examples of alternatives named in the comments included lower toxicity chemicals with shorter REIs, biological controls, engineering and technological advancements, genetic engineering of resistant rose varieties, and cultural practices (such as scheduling pesticide applications and work activities to avoid conflicts). The key difference between the growers' and the worker advocates' positions on alternatives was the extent to which they believe such alternatives can be quickly and cost-effectively adopted by industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Farmworker Justice Fund presented information suggesting that several alternatives, including biological controls and cultural practices, have been studied and found to be effective in controlling certain rose pests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1988 Roses, Inc., estimated a 5&hyph;year to 7&hyph;year time frame for the rose industry to develop alternatives to toxicity category I and II pesticides. In 1992, Roses, Inc., commented that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> While some progress had been made, a lack of research funds and pressures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from subsidized and dumped low-cost rose imports have seriously reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profitability, making research and capital investment funds extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hard to obtain. Less toxic pesticides are being used. Introduction of new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials is helping....

While progress has been made, here again Roses, Inc., states they are still years away from rose plant introductions with significant engineered insect and disease resistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Roses, Inc., noted that while certain biological controls are promising, they often require a grower to make a sizable capital investment to implement. They conclude that these alternatives need more research, time, and money ``to let the substitute practices mature as a real answer for our industry.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Society of American Florists suggested that EPA offer incentives to growers who use less toxic pesticides. The Agency notes that, to a large extent, the provisions of the WPS are the incentive: growers who use primarily toxicity category III and IV products may not need early entry and therefore would not have to provide PPE, etc., for their harvesters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One grower commented, ``With some planning and shifting personnel we could keep early entry to a minimum.'' EPA lauds this as an immediate, practical alternative. Information about rose cultivation gathered by Agency experts suggests that in some cases roses can be cut early with minimal loss in crop value, if properly stored and handled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, for a complex and highly managed crop such as roses, EPA believes industry will attempt to make adjustments in cultural practices and pesticide use patterns to minimize losses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A time limit will encourage development and implementation of safer methods of pest control. EPA believes that time and research are needed to develop sustainable alternatives to early entry, but that the industry should aggressively work toward implementation of alternatives that have been proven effective. EPA expects that much early entry can be eliminated immediately through ``planning and shifting personnel'', and that in 2 years other alternatives to toxicity category I and II pesticides can be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, while rose growers submitted sufficient information to convince EPA that an early-entry prohibition could have a substantial economic impact, EPA believes that the benefits, based on the limited information presented, only justify an interim period for the growers to adapt to the requirements of the WPS. Therefore, EPA has decided that the exception for early entry for harvesting cut roses will expire 2 years from publication of this Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA continues to believe that in most cases the most reliable and effective means of risk reduction for harvesters is to keep them out of treated areas until the expiration of the REI. However, because of the potentially considerable economic benefits of an exception for the cut rose industry, EPA has decided to grant a temporary exception. Until this exception expires, PPE, safety training and provision of label information, decontamination facilities, and time-in-treated-area limits, etc., will be the primary means of mitigating early-entry workers' pesticide exposure risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider another exception for roses if the industry submits a request supported by the full set of data required under 170.112(e), including the feasibility of the conditions of this exception, and can clearly demonstrate that an aggressive attempt to develop and implement alternative practices was made during the period of this exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Activities Not Included in the Exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many comments from growers urged the Agency to include tasks such as watering, pruning, and disbudding in this exception, and to clarify whether ``passing through'' a restricted area would be acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Farmworker advocates' comments recognized that while industry comments had stated the need to harvest roses twice daily, 365 days per year, insufficient evidence was provided to support early entry for activities other than harvesting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sufficient evidence has not been presented to show that pruning and disbudding could not be accomplished outside of normal restricted-entry intervals. EPA believes these tasks can be accomplished without early entry through coordinated planning and scheduling without undue economic hardship for the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In several rose greenhouses, automated or semi-automated irrigation is becoming the norm. In such operations, watering may be accomplished either without entry into the greenhouse or without contact with treated surfaces in the greenhouse; such entry may be permitted under 170.112(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA expects that passing through a treated area would be permissible, in most cases, under 170.112(b),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception for activities with no contact <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as long as the employer ensures the conditions of 170.112(b)(1) and (2) are met, that is, the worker will have no contact with treated surfaces, and no entry is allowed until any inhalation exposure criteria or ventilation criteria have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

Comments from growers expressed concern that employers are at risk of enforcement action should their workers fail to follow directions to use the required personal protective equipment or stay out of restricted areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA notes that responsibility for compliance with the general requirements of the WPS as well as the conditions of this exception rests with employers. While employers are prohibited from taking retaliatory action against employees for attempting to comply with the requirements of the WPS or this exception, the WPS does not prevent an employer from disciplining a worker who fails to observe the employer's instructions to use PPE, stay out of restricted areas, or other directions relating to WPS requirements. Such action in no way alleviates the responsibility of the employer to adhere to the requirements of the WPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some comments requested exceptions from provisions which are outside the scope permitted by the exception process in 170.112(e). Such requests included (1) a special exception from oral notification and posting provisions, (2) use of barrier tape in lieu of posting with the WPS warning sign, (3) special minor use registration assistance, and (4) use of the exception process to revise other provisions of the WPS. Since these requests are beyond the scope of 170.112(e), they are not addressed here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

Evidence submitted in some of the comments suggested that alternatives to early entry exist for these other crops, and that an early-entry prohibition would not cause economic repercussions great enough to outweigh the risk to workers. Therefore, EPA has determined that an exception for other cut flower and cut fern producers is not warranted at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Terms of the Exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This exception for harvesting cut roses is narrower than the exception which was proposed by EPA in the August 21, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 38175) in that this exception extends only to harvesting cut roses and expires after 2 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April 1994, Congress enacted legislation which delays the compliance date for some of the basic safety provisions of the WPS until January 1, 1995. This legislation permits entry during an REI for tasks relating to the production of agricultural plants, but explicitly excludes hand labor activities, such as harvesting, from the permitted tasks. EPA is including in the terms of this exception for rose harvesting, some basic safety provisions which will be provided to all workers covered by the WPS on January 1, 1995. These include provisions for basic safety training, display of a safety poster, posting of application information, decontamination, and emergency assistance. Notwithstanding the 1994 legislation, agricultural employers taking advantage of the exception announced in this Notice must comply with the conditions of this exception. The 1994 legislation does not affect the terms of this exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The terms of the exception are the same as those proposed in the August 21, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 38175), with the exception that a requirement has been added that agricultural employers who make use of this exception inform their early-entry workers about the exception, and that the exception is limited to 2 years. The basic safety provisions described above also have been included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  EPA reserves the right to withdraw exceptions, including the exception for cut roses, in accordance with 170.112(e)(6),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Withdrawing an exception <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , if the Agency receives information or any other data that indicate the health risks posed by the exception are unacceptable or if the Agency receives information that indicates the exception is no longer necessary or prudent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exception described in this Notice may be used unless early entry is expressly prohibited in product labeling.

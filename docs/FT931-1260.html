			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Sejm vote may topple Suchocka THE FUTURE of Poland's seven-party coalition led by Ms Hanna Suchocka could hang on the result of a no-confidence vote in Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister. Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the minister responsible for European Community affairs and Mr Lewandowski's party colleague, said yesterday that his group, the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD), would leave the government if Mr Lewandowski failed to survive the vote. The motion has been brought by the anti-communist KPN party, which espouses populist policies and has been pushing for Mr Lewandowski's resignation since last autumn. The KPN's move follows the defeat last week of Mr Lewandowski's mass privatisation plan, with subsequent party inquiries suggesting that a no-confidence vote might succeed. Next week's vote will coincide with the government's resubmission of revised privatisation proposals. Mr Bielecki's statement is aimed at bolstering Mr Lewandowski's position within the coalition and in effect turns the vote into a vote of confidence in the government. The coalition controls about 210 votes in the 460-member Sejm and relies for its majority on the 26-strong Solidarity trade union group and a handful of independents. The KLD and its close allies have 52 votes in the Sejm. Were they to withdraw, the alternative would be the imposition of a cabinet by President Lech Walesa or new elections. The KLD is hoping that most parties want to avoid both.</p>

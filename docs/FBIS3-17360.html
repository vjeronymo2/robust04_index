"Estonia intends to make no concession at negotiations with  Russia," Luik said while adding that Estonia's Government has  been flexible enough by issuing a decree under which retired  Russian military can apply for residence permits on individual  basis.    On commenting possible agreement on Russian troop  withdrawal,  Luik said that "if the agreement comes, it will certainly come  with different terms than the agreement between Russia and  Latvia". Russia must consider Estonia's Aliens Law, Citizenship  Law and property legislation, Luik added.    "In Latvian-Russian agreements we considered positive only  the general agreement on troop withdrawal," Luik said. "We did  not comment on other agreements," he added. "We do not accept  pegging troop withdrawal to other issues."    Social guarantees of the retired Russian military are  Russia's problem, Luik said. Now, Russia is also covering  social expenses of the retired military under a draft being  negotiated for already two years, Luik said.    "Giving residence permits is entirely Estonia's domestic  matter and we decide whom we will give the permit and whom we  will not," Luik said.</p>

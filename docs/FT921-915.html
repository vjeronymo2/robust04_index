			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Sickly Labour IN PUSHING health to the centre of the election campaign, Labour has played its ace; the ace of bleeding hearts. An emotive party political broadcast, suggesting that the Conservatives want a two-tier health service, with the consequence that some sweet little girls will suffer months of earache while others will pay and get immediate attention, will have its intended effect. There is controversy over whether this work of 'faction' is an act of deceit. Labour says the film was based on a real case, but yesterday brought a whirl of claim and counterclaim as politicians, the hospital consultant and the girl's family were caught up in the fray. The faction of the film, however, is nothing compared with the fiction of Labour's central claims about the National Health Service. Labour has two proposals for the NHS: that it will provide more money and that the managerial reforms initiated by the government will be reversed. On the first count, it has to be doubted whether in the next parliament any government will be able to afford significant extra spending on health. With the 1992-93 public sector borrowing already at Pounds 28bn (Pounds 36bn without privatisation receipts) and growth prospects murky, the first post-election budget may well be about raising taxes or cutting spending or both. Labour cannot simultaneously argue that the Conservatives will have no room to achieve their desired tax cuts - they will not - and that it will add large sums to public spending; or at least it cannot do so without saying where its additional taxes - beyond those already announced by Mr Smith - will fall. The Pounds 1bn which Labour yesterday promised for the NHS (budget, Pounds 36bn a year) is not enough to make a serious difference to the problems Labour accuses the government of creating. Worse, by turning its back on the reforms, Labour would allow the NHS to lapse into its chronic malaise of counting the cost of nothing, because there would be a lack of individual and institutional incentive to be more efficient. This may be aggravated by the costs of the proposed minimum wage and Labour's uncertain mettle on public sector pay. The National Health Service is, by and large, a success story. It has contained the cost of health care in the British economy at a lower relative level than in most other industrialised countries and has done so without losing popular support. Mrs Thatcher made the dreadful error of flirting with privatisation of the NHS, for which Mr Major is now paying the political price. It is because of Mrs Thatcher that Mr Major has no adequate answer to Labour's propaganda. But by cranking up public expectations on the one hand and re-assuring the health professionals that under Labour it will be unchecked bureaucracy as usual, the party is selling short the service it created.</p>

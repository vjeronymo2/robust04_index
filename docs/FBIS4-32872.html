			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning a report published by the Argentine  publication AMBITO FINANCIERO, in which among other things the  chief executive notes that he would "do his utmost not to  dissolve Congress," President Juan Carlos Wasmosy last night  said: "I do not have any power to dissolve Congress."    The chief executive said that his words had been  misinterpreted. He emphasized that he does not have the  "constitutional power to dissolve Congress." He added that he  fully disagrees with any aggression against Congress. Wasmosy  pointed out: "This is far from my intention."    The president noted that when he said that "the people must  mature" he meant the entire society (government officials,  politicians, entrepreneurs, trade union leaders, journalists,  and so on) and not specifically Congress. He added that the  Paraguayan people are gradually changing their beliefs.    Moving on, the president recognized the activities currently  being carried out by congressmen. He described as normal the  controversial positions that exist between the executive and  legislative branches, bearing in mind the democracy prevailing  in our Republic.    President Wasmosy emphasized: "As we pursue the path of  democracy, all of us are growing up." He claimed that it is  normal to make mistakes. The president emphasized that he trusts  these mistakes will be corrected in favor of most Paraguayan  people.  <H5>  Laino Does Not Believe in Dissolution of Congress </H5>   President Wasmosy last night received the European Union's  Silver ECU, delivered by Franco Teucci, the European Union's  representative in our country, to mark the Day of Europe. During  the award ceremony Dr. Domingo Laino, of the Authentic Radical  Liberal Party, ruled out the possibility of a break in the  democratic process.    Laino pointed out: "I am not really acquainted with the  remarks, but I do not see why he should worry about Congress,  because Congress is not seeking to destabilize; quite to the  contrary, Congress is trying to stabilize democracy."    Laino emphasized: "A group within the Colorado Party has  maximalist and fundamentalist attitudes. I believe the  destabilizing trend involves this group. I believe the  opposition, Congress, and other segments outside the ruling  party are demonstrating a very mature and very thoughtful  attitude."</p>

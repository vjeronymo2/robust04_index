			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, president of the </F> National Bank of Poland, by Zbigniew Maciag; place and date not  given: "Consolidation and Privatization"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Maciag] Don't you think  the new leadership of the Finance Ministry attaches greater  importance to the consolidation of the banking sector than to  its privatization?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think that all Polish banks should be  both consolidated and privatized. Both these processes are  truly necessary. Our banks, even the state-owned ones, are only  small financial institutions compared to the big European banks.    [Maciag] Is it easier to privatize or to consolidate? Which  should come first?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] If one wants to create one big bank out  of several smaller banks, then indeed consolidation is more  advantageous. Then, when individual banks are on the stock  market, any mergers among them are less likely. For the time  being, the role of the giant, but only on the domestic market,  is played by Bank Handlowy. Other banks are much smaller. I  believe that it would be good if several banks with really  strong capital reserves were established. For me, as president  of the National Bank of Poland [NBP], it does not make any  difference whether I supervise the activity of one bank or the  activities of several banks. The important thing is that they  are in good financial condition. I am more interested in the  problems of small privately owned banks, threatened with  bankruptcy, than the problems of state-owned banks, whose  functioning is supervised by the owner--that is, by the Finance  Ministry.    [Maciag] The authors of "Strategy for Poland" stress that  ownership transformations in the banking sector will be  perceived by the government as an instrument that enables  efficient allocation of resources. In this context, the choice  between the form of ownership and efficiency, if such a choice  emerges, will be a foregone conclusion: Efficiency will be  chosen. Such an approach may mean that it is not worth  privatizing any more state-owned banks because right now their  efficiency indexes are much better than those of privately owned  banks. What do you think of it?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In the long run, the condition of  state-owned banks will deteriorate. The experiences of other  countries, such as Italy, Austria, and France, show that these  banks achieve definitely poorer financial results than their  privately owned competitors. For the time being, state-owned  banks are characterized by a lower cost of obtaining money. If  we take into account the huge turnover and the large number of  accounts, this is perfectly understandable. The costs of  obtaining money in privately owned banks are incomparably  higher. These banks must attract customers with higher interest  rates of deposits, which costs money. However, in a few years'  time, state-owned banks would be bound to achieve poorer results  than privately owned ones. Such phenomena have been observed to  take place in many market economy states. The correct  conclusions must be drawn from these experiences.    [Maciag] The first version of "Strategy for Poland" included  the suggestion that banking supervision should no longer be  exercised by the NBP. The suggestion was later removed. Did it  happen at your request?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, it did. There is no reason that  this supervision should function outside the NBP. Of the 12  states in the European Union [EU], only in four of them is  supervision exercised outside the central bank; however, this is  only to a certain degree because, in France, supervision is  exercised by a special banking commission; its head is the  president of the central bank of this country and his inspectors  are the employees. [passage omitted]    [Maciag] The economic program presented by Deputy Prime  Minister Grzegorz Kolodko is critical of the activity of the  NBP. It accuses the bank of combining the functions of issuing,  supervisory functions, and ownership functions, which is not  conducive to the proper fulfillment of any of them.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I do not agree with this thesis; it is  not really tenable. If we take into account the financial  policy, it is the central bank that forces the government to  limit the budget deficit, inflation. The fact that the members  of the supervision team presented deputies with a good diagnosis  of the situation in the banking sectors proves that they stopped  pretending that nothing is happening to it.    But, if the state budget is willing to take over banks  being supervised by the NBP--for instance, Prosper Bank or  Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin--I will gladly give them up.  The NBP does not have to perform the ownership function. I  have suggested many times in the past to the finance minister  that state-owned banks, of which he is the owner, should take  over trouble-stricken privately owned banks.    [Maciag] Was the NBP consulted over that part of the  "Strategy for Poland" program that pertains to reforming the  banking sector?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, it was not. Apparently, one of our  departments is said to have been contacted, but there was  neither any team formed nor was there an exchange of official  letters on the topic. I received the final draft of the program  right before a session of the Council of Ministers, and I was  asked to take a position on it.    [Maciag] The program's authors announced a gradual reduction  in the rate of mandatory reserves. When can the central bank  make the first step in that direction?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We must wait for economic figures from  the first six months of the year. The inflation level compared  with the forecast for the end of 1994 will have a decisive  impact. If inflation is low, we will think whether to decrease  mandatory reserves and whether to keep reducing interest rates.  For the time being, we are not planning on making such  decisions. Still, the trend is correct: Along with falling  inflation, there should occur a decrease in mandatory reserves  and interest rates.    [Maciag] Is it realistic to expect inflation to fall below  10 percent by 1997?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Achieving a singe-digit inflation figure  within three years is possible, but it will require tremendous  financial discipline. First of all, one must control salaries  in the state-owned sector very tightly, regardless of whether we  decide to adopt the British or the French model. We cannot  allow for an increase in the budget deficit. On the contrary,  one must strive to limit its size. That is because a high  budget deficit limits the possibilities of financing  investments. The central bank's role in financing the budget  deficit cannot be significant because that would cause an  increase in inflation. Personally, I think we will manage to  decrease inflation to below 10 percent, but not before 1998. I  presented such a forecast at a meeting of EU representatives in  Brussels. At the meeting, West European experts stated that,  according to their calculations, we will achieve a single-digit  inflation figure in 1998.    [Maciag] Banks have been devoting too much money for  financing the budget deficit. What should one do to increase  the number of credits for the economy and for individual  enterprises over the next few years?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] From the standpoint of monetary  policies, credit measures by banks are perhaps insufficient.  But, in our country, there is the habit of treating credits as  something that is given away and that people deserve to get.  That is wrong. If there are good projects, banks will finance  them. Decreased inflation is bound to decrease the  profitability of investing in Treasury bills, and, thus, it will  increase the interest banks charge on credits.    [Maciag] For the moment, however, banks prefer to make money  on security transactions rather than on providing credits.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] By purchasing Treasury bills, banks take  a smaller risk. We are not the only country with a budget  deficit. The Treasury bills market is developed in many  countries with market economies. Naturally, it is  competition--banks prefer to buy secure, state-owned securities  rather then financing risky ventures. That is why a persistent  reduction of the budget deficit is necessary.    [Maciag] How should one encourage the Polish people to save  money? Is it possible to have a slower rate of falling interest  rates on deposits compared with the rate falling interest rates  on credits?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Banks make their living by price  margins. We cannot expect them to deliberately decrease their  profits. In my view, the Polish zloty should be continuously  overvalued, if I may say so. That means that  creeping devaluation should be lower than inflation. Then we  will make sure that it will be profitable to save in zlotys.  The central bank has been trying to conduct such a policy.  Last year, it was profitable to have zloty deposits in banks,  even though not as much as we initially planned. We had to  devalue the national currency because of the deepening payment  deficit. This year, we will do everything not to allow those  who have deposited money in Polish banks to suffer losses.  [passage omitted]</p>

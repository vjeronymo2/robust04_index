The controversial Greek move will be discussed by EC foreign  ministers at their meeting Monday, the European Commission  spokesman said.    Experts at the executive EC Commission are to study the  impact of the Greek decision, which could breach Community laws  on free trade with a third state.    Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, attending a meeting of  the EC "troika" of foreign ministers of past, present and future  presidency incumbents in Athens, said the blockade was  "naturally in contradiction" with the Maastricht Treaty on  European Union.    Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos swiftly  rejected the move, saying his government's decision "conformed  to European law."    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, also attending,  earlier  demanded that Greece immediately lift its trade embargo of its  land-locked neighbour, and issued a sharp attack on Athens'  "extraordinary" decision.</p>

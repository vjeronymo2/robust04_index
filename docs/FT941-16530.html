			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Major predicts economic growth this year The economy will grow by between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent this year, and at that level 'or a little higher' next year, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday, Kevin Brown writes. Mr Major's forecasts, delivered in a television interview with Sir David Frost, are slightly more optimistic than the government's Budget estimates last November. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, forecast in his Budget speech that the economy would grow by 2.5 per cent this year, rising to 3 per cent in 1994-95. Mr Major also forecast that unemployment would continue to fall and reaffirmed the government's determination to keep inflation within the target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.</p>

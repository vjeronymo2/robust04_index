			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY VOTERS REELECT INCUMBENTS, ADD SOME NEW FACES  </P> <P> Voters in the Antelope Valley went to the polls Tuesday to decide a spate of  local school races, electing new members to college, high school and elementary  district boards in the area but also retaining many incumbents in the mostly  low-profile races.  </P> <P> The most closely watched race came in the strife-torn Lancaster School  District, where early returns showed three incumbents -- Richard White, Melinda  White and Michael Huggins -- struggling to fend off four opponents, including  one who is the wife of the district's recently ousted superintendent.  </P> <P> In other contests, voters were deciding whether to reelect two incumbents in  both the Antelope Valley Community College District and the Antelope Valley  Union High School District, while also filling a vacant third seat in each  district. In the Palmdale School District, meanwhile, three contenders were  vying for an open seat.  </P> <P> In the 10,700-student Lancaster School District, early returns showed a very  close race. Board president Richard White, a former district principal elected  four years ago, was seeking a second term. Incumbents Melinda White (who is not  related to Richard) and Huggins, who defeated incumbents to win office in a  bitter February recall election, also were seeking reelection.  </P> <P> They are being challenged by Maridelle Wright, the wife of former  superintendent E. Jarold Wright, who was dismissed by the present board in  July; Parent Teacher Assn. President Jacki Pendleton; air traffic controller  Joseph Starling, and structural mechanic Keith Wilde.  </P> <P> In the 8,600-student Antelope Valley Community College District, board  president James Du Pratt Jr. and Herman Kicenski both appeared headed toward  wins. Du Pratt is a high school teacher elected in 1985, while Kicenski is a  Lancaster physician who has served on the board since 1973.  </P> <P> The election contest focused on the two challengers seeking a third seat, which  was vacated by Lynda Gloyd. Seeking to succeed her was Betty Lou Nash, a former  spokeswoman for the college who held an early lead over Felix Le Marinel, a  Palmdale insurance agent.  </P> <P> In the nearly 9,800-student Antelope Valley Union High School District, board  president William Olenick was trailing in early returns, while colleague Larry  Rucker was headed for his third term. A third seat, vacated by incumbent Bob  McMullen, drew five challengers into the at-large election.  </P> <P> The other two early leaders were Agua Dulce homemaker Sophia Waugh and Steve  Landaker, a Palmdale billboard executive. Trailing candidates were Phil Maher,  a Palmdale phone company manager who tried four years ago; Daniel Fricke, a  school police officer; and David Von Buskirk, a court financial officer. Fricke  and Von Buskirk both ran unsuccessfully in 1987.  </P> <P> * In the Palmdale School District, incumbents Velma Trosin, Fay Harrington and  Frederick Thompson were unchallenged and were automatically reelected. That  left only a contest among three Palmdale residents seeking to fill the two  years remaining in the term of Susan Moulton, who resigned in June. Early  returns showed retired aerospace engineer Dan Hunter in the lead, followed by  teacher Sheldon Epstein and general contractor F. Don Linde.  </P> <P> * In the Westside Union School District, six candidates -- two incumbents and  four challengers -- were vying for three at-large seats. Incumbents Lynne  Murley and Charles Strole were running against challengers Chuck Brandel,  Howard Brooks, Sandra Engebretson and Larry Lindner.  </P> <P> * In the Eastside Union School District, five candidates -- one incumbent and  four challengers -- were seeking three seats. Incumbent Martha Johnson was  joined in the race by challengers Lee Doughty, Gary Holmes, Larry Lake and  Michael Terry.  </P> <P> * In the Keppel Union School District, seven candidates -- three incumbents and  four challengers -- were vying for three seats. The incumbents are Patricia  Conner, Jerry Freeman and Robert Jones. The challengers are Michael Dutton,  Valorie Gorny, Claudia Moore and Richard Sanders.  </P> <P> * In the Wilsona School District, five candidates -- two incumbents and three  challengers -- were running for three seats. Incumbents Luis Easterwood and Sue  Stokka were competing against Frank Donaldson Sr., Michael Brown and Richard  Foster.  </P> <P> Results: A27,A28  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Italian insurer hit by investment write-down RIUNIONE Adriatica di Sicurta, the stock market listed Italian insurance company controlled by Allianz of Germany, reported a steep drop in net profits to L95bn (Dollars 63m) last year from L201bn in 1991. The reduction came in spite of a 13.9 per cent rise in group premiums to L7,337bn and a 14.5 per cent increase to L3,720bn for parent company premiums. Mr Umberto Zanni, chairman, explained the earnings slide stemmed from a L214bn write-down on the group's investment portfolio. Like other financial institutions, RAS has had to write down heavily the value of its government bond holdings due to last year's severe price volatility. However, Mr Zanni stressed the recovery in government securities in the past four months implied RAS would show sharp extraordinary earnings this year. Mr Zanni also pointed to a marked upturn in the group's underwriting position. Losses on the non-life side fell by L30bn to L147bn. 'But for third party motor insurance, we would have shown a underwriting profit in 1992,' he said. The group is looking forward to the planned liberalisation of the motor insurance market in July 1994, which will allow tariff increases and the introduction of more personalised policies geared to clients' claims records. In the meantime, RAS hopes the government will approve a reasonable increase in tariffs for this year. The underwriting improvement was reflected in a 22 per cent rise in operating profits to L240bn in 1992. Combined with the upturn in bond prices, RAS has decided to pay an unchanged dividend of L300 a share for ordinary shares and L360 a share for savings stock. The payout, which leaves only L7.9bn of net earn-ings attributable to extraordinary reserves, is 24 per cent higher than that in 1991 due to last November's rights issue.</p>

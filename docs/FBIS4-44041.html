In a statement after the talks, Demirel said all aspects of  bilateral relations and cooperation were discussed, adding that  views were also exchanged on regional and international issues.  He noted that the brotherly Central Asian countries, primarily  Uzbekistan, have become significant economic and trade partners  for Turkey in the last two and a half years. Pointing out that  Turkish contractors and entrepreneurs have undertaken projects  worth some $2.5 billion in Central Asia, Demirel noted that  Turkey's foreign trade volume with this region soared to $550  million in 1993.

Pointing out that the two sides  confirmed that the two countries share similar views regarding  regional and international problems, Demirel stressed that they  have also determined that Turkish-Uzbek relations and  cooperation contribute to regional and world peace.    Giving information on the joint communique, Demirel said the  two sides have verified that some 60 agreements and protocols  have been signed since 1991 and have expressed their  satisfaction over this observation. Demirel added: In  conclusion, our talks with Karimov have been extremely  beneficial and it has given a new impetus to our relations.    Karimov expressed the belief that the talks have been very  significant and that great development has been achieved in  bilateral relations.

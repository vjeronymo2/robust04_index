			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Development Securities back in the black Development Securities, formerly Claythorn Properties, has returned to the black after three years of heavy losses. The company has undertaken a radical programme of asset sales in the last two years, but since Mr Martin Landau took a significant shareholding and joined the board last June, it has started to rebuild its investment portfolio. Pre-tax profits in 1993 amounted to Pounds 900,000, compared with losses of Pounds 40.8m restated for FRS 3, but the figures were boosted by the release of Pounds 5m of negative goodwill from the sale of Stead &amp; Simpson, the shoe retailer. Turnover fell to Pounds 26m (Pounds 71.4m). The company raised Pounds 56.4m during the year through two placings and open offers, and boosted its investment portfolio from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 80.2m. It has become more positive about the property development market, and is to start work on two sites, after several years of inactivity. Mr Landau, deputy chairman, said the company had cleaned up its balance sheet and was looking to expand through property investments, or by acquisition. Earnings per share amounted to 1.9p (107p losses).</p>

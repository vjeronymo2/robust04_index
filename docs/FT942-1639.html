			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Observer: Not tongue-tied Anyone wishing for an instant assessment of the state of the South African economy need look no further than the attire of finance minister Derek Keys. Yesterday he was sporting what he calls his 'good news' tie, a truly appalling confection of broad stripes in yellow, purple, maroon and blue. This garish combination heralded an upbeat introduction to yesterday's budget: an economic recovery boosted by a higher gold price, solid export earnings, improved access to foreign markets, favourable agricultural conditions, improving local and international business and consumer confidence 'with each day that passes'. If on his next public appearance Keys sports an even more spectacular choice of neckwear, brace yourselves: he'll most likely be announcing the abolition of the financial rand.</p>

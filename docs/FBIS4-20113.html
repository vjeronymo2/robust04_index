			<p>Supporting   EU Accession   <F P=102> AU2804101094 Vienna WIENER ZEITUNG in German 28 Apr 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> AU2804101094 </F> <F P=104>  Vienna WIENER ZEITUNG </F> <F P=105>  German </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Resolution by OeVP Executive </F> Committee: `In Favor of EU Entry'"]    [Text] On Wednesday [27 April], the Federal Executive  Committee of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] passed a  resolution on the European Union [EU]. In its declaration, the  OeVP "invites all people, irrespective of party affiliation, to  support this future course for Austria."    Under the leadership of Foreign Minister Alois Mock an  "excellent result" was achieved in the negotiations, "which has  made possible our support for EU entry." The OeVP describes  itself as a "guarantor that there will be no tax increases in  connection with EU accession."    For the OeVP, the EU referendum is the "most important  national issue of the outgoing 20th century. This is why we  will do everything we can to keep the referendum on EU accession  out of the debate on daily and party politics. We are  particularly anxious to see -- if possible -- all citizens  participate in this vote, regardless of their convictions."    In the statement, the OeVP also describes itself as the  "driving force and guarantor" for accompanying national measures  in preparation for EU membership. Thus, it has been ensured that  accession will not take place to the discomfort or the  disadvantage of a weaker social group. In terms of the national  economy, EU membership will have positive effects for Austrian  employees, for industry, and for farmers.    It is the OeVP's goal to secure the achievements of farmers  on a permanent basis and to make it possible for farmers to  prosper. The national accompanying measures guarantee that  Austrian farmers will get adequate financial compensation and  will thus be able to cope with the EU entry. The necessary  structural reforms in the farming sector can thus be  accomplished.    A set of measures has been devised for the protection of  Austria as an economic and industrial center. To ease the  transit traffic burden, additional railroad capacity on the  Austrian part of the Munich-Verona route has been promised.  This will make it necessary to build a new underground railroad  track through the lower Inn Valley. This track can make a  decisive contribution to relieving the population along the  Tirolean transit routes of some of the burden.    Regarding employees, the OeVP Federal Executive Committee  points to a new employment protection law. It contains  improvements in the spheres of occupational health and safety  equipment. Austrian accesion to the EU will also stimulate the  labor market. The Wifo Economic Research Institute has  predicted an increase of 55,000 jobs between 1995 and 2000.  Some 7.5 billion schillings would be provided from the European  Union's social fund for fighting unemployment until the end of  1999.    For the OeVP, EU membership is "our country's most important  step in terms of security policy, comparable in its significance  only to the conclusion of the State Treaty." As the  eastern-most part of stable Europe, Austria lies in immediate  proximity to the conflict zones in the Balkans and the CIS  republics. It is for this reason alone that Austria must try to  seek security in an alliance. It is important to have partners  "who stand firmly behind us even when only the first signs of a  crisis are showing."</p>

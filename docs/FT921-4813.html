			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Price rises threaten wages row in Germany PRICES are still rising in Germany despite slackening economic growth, threatening to exacerbate the gathering confrontation over wages between employers and trade unions. Hesse and Bavaria, two of the country's economically most important regions, reported an acceleration in inflation rates for February. In Bavaria, the annual rate was 4.7 per cent (4.3 per cent in January). In Hesse, it was 4.6 per cent (4.1). These high regional rates do not necessarily mean the overall west German inflation rate, which stood at 4 per cent in January, will be at these levels. The more heavily-industrialised state of North Rhine-Westphalia reported a rate of 4.3 per cent for February. While inflation has been picking up, economic activity is hesitant. The economics ministry said west Germany's manufacturing order inflow rose 5 per cent between December and January, but the combined level for both months was down by 2.9 per cent on the previous year. Industrial production figures showed a similar trend, rising in January over December by 6 per cent but falling on a two-monthly basis by 1.2 per cent on the year. The February unemployment figures were also mixed. In west Germany, the total eased 11,640 to 1.86m people, a rate of 6.1 per cent against 6.3 the previous month. But the improvement mostly reflected mild weather. In east Germany, the jobless rate was down to 15.9 per cent, or 1.29m people, from 16.5 per cent (1.34m), helped by government job-creation programmes. In spite of the slackening economic situation, wage claims have been high. A moderate 4.9 per cent settlement was reached for Ruhr coalminers yesterday, but this came as no surprise, in view of the difficult state of the industry. Public-sector workers are holding out for 9.5 per cent after an offer this week of 3.5 per cent, while banking unions have called members out on strike to back their claim of 10.5 per cent against the employers' 5 per cent offer.</p>

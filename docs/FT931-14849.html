			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: US regulator exempts swaps from key rules A US Federal regulator yesterday ruled that swaps trading - a large and growing global over-the-counter derivative market - will for the most part be exempt from rules that govern US futures markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US watchdog for futures and other derivatives trading, received power to exempt swaps from its oversight when it was reauthorised late last year. Up to now, swaps trading, had faced the danger of being declared invalid if it were successfully proven that they were futures, and thus had to be traded on an established futures exchange. US commodities exchanges had hoped that the CFTC's regulatory exemption for dealer-traded swaps would be extended to their own proposed exchange-traded swaps products. However, the CFTC indicated the exchanges would have to apply for exemptions on a case-by-case basis.</p>

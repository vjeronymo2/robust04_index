			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Irish beef inquiry adjourned THE TRIBUNAL of inquiry into allegations of fraud, malpractice and political favouritism in Ireland's beef-processing industry has been adjourned until September 2, pending the outcome of an appeal to the Dublin supreme court. The appeal is being taken by Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney general, against a ruling by the high court last Friday which allowed questions to be put to witnesses about cabinet discussions on the export credit insurance scheme. Mr Liam Hamilton, the tribunal's chairman, said yesterday it was 'unable to continue its inquiries' until the supreme court's decision was known. The supreme court gave Mr Whelehan and lawyers for the tribunal seven days to make written submissions before it could hear the appeal.</p>

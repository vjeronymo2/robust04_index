			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO EARNINGS: GREAT AMERICAN CROWS DESPITE DROP IN PROFITS  </P> <P> Great American First Savings Bank reported a first-quarter profit of $11.1  million, down from $14.3 million for the year-ago quarter.  </P> <P> Despite the decline, Great American executives at Tuesday's annual shareholders  meeting hailed the results as evidence that the S&amp;L's core earnings, or  those from lending activities and real estate income, are improving and that  asset quality is on the rebound.  </P> <P> Of this year's profit, about 85% flowed from core earnings, whereas last year  Great American lost money on its lending activities. Last year's first-quarter  profit was made possible only by $32.5 million in gains from investment  transactions and the sale of packaged mortgage loans. This year those gains  added up to less than $5 million.  </P> <P> Great American's core earnings were stunted last year by problems connected  with the S&amp;L's commercial loan portfolio in Arizona, which was inherited  when it acquired Home Federal Savings of Tucson. Great American ended up taking  $154 million in loan-loss provisions last year, which amount to charges on  earnings.  </P> <P> For example, during the first quarter of last year, Great American set aside  $22.2 million for probable loan and interest losses. Its loss provisions in the  current year's first quarter dropped to $7.6 million, according to chief  financial officer Jim Krzeminski.  </P> <P> Great American has now reduced its non-performing loans and foreclosures to  $389 million, or 2.3% of its $16.4 billion in assets. That is a significant  improvement from this time last year, when bad loans were $556 million, or  3.68% of assets.  </P> <P> Although Great American's bad loans are still above the 2%-of-assets benchmark  characteristic of healthy thrifts, analysts commended the S&amp;L for facing  the bad loans head-on.  </P> <P> "There seems to be a trend of improvement," said David Hochstim, a thrift  industry analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. "The strategy was to  get all (the bad loans) behind them and go forward. When you have  non-performing loans at the high levels they had, they become a real drag on  earnings, and the best thing is to get them off the books."  </P> <P> Great American's interest rate "spread," or difference between what it collects  in interest on its loans and other assets and what it pays out on liabilities  such as deposits, was 1.87% of assets during the quarter. That is less than the  2.5%-or-higher spread of several top-performing S&amp;Ls, but is noteworthy in  that Great American was able to keep it from eroding further in the environment  of rising interest rates.  </P> <P> "Great American's spread is low relative to their competitors, but it only  dropped 10 basis points (0.10%) from Dec. 31, while most S&amp;Ls saw their  spread decline by 30 to 40 basis points," said Gary Gordon, a stock analyst  with PaineWebber of New York. "Borrowing costs over the first quarter were  rising much faster than S&amp;Ls' variable-rate loans could adjust for."  </P> <P> Bruce Harting, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York, said Great American's  reduced provision for loan losses demonstrates confidence for the coming year:  "Most S&amp;Ls won't try to 'front load' earnings in the first quarter by  taking too low a (loan loss) provision. They prefer to show a stair-step  increase in earnings through the year."  </P> <P> Despite improvements in some areas, Great American Chairman Gordon Luce said in  an interview that he is still cautious about the Arizona portfolio and the  effect rising interest rates could have on the loans there and elsewhere in the  system.  </P> <P> "I don't know if they're completely out of the woods yet, but I think it's fair  to say they are starting to see their way out of the woods," PaineWebber's  Gordon said.  </P> <P> Krzeminski said Great American's assets will grow only 5% this year and that  1989 loan originations will drop to $4.3 billion in 1989 from $5.6 billion last  year. The reduction is due mainly to the softer secondary market for loans  because of uncertainty surrounding future interest rates.  </P> <P> Deposits as of March 31 totaled $11.3 billion, up from $10.9 billion a year  ago. Loans were $11.6 billion, up from $10 billion a year ago, and assets of  $16.4 billion were up from $15.2 billion. Great American is the eighth-largest  publicly held S&amp;L.  </P></p>

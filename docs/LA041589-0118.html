			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HOLLYWOOD EFFORT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if, sometime soon, "The Cosby Show's" Cliff Huxtable tells  his teen-age daughters that their aerosol hair spray cans are destroying the  ozone layer. Or "Roseanne" gets a sudden impulse to recycle her Twinkie  wrappers.  </P> <P> The reason: Some of Hollywood's most powerful studio executives and agents are  launching an organization, called the Environmental Media Assn., to raise the  public's consciousness about the destruction of the environment through TV  shows and feature films.  </P> <P> The United Nations will provide technical advice to script writers, said Noel  Brown, North American director of the U.N.'s environmental program.  </P> <P> Outside TV/film producer Norman Lear's Westside home Thursday night, a stream  of Mercedes, BMWs, Rolls-Royces, and stretch limos pulled up for the first  formal meeting of the group. Inside, about 100 of Hollywood's rich and powerful  discussed ways to use the power of the media to steer American life styles in  more environmentally sound directions.  </P> <P> "It's going to take more than government action," Lear said of the dwindling  ozone layer, the destruction of the Earth's rain forests and the alarming  growth of toxic wastes. "We're talking about a monumental shift in attitudes."  </P> <P> Lear said that can start by adding "just a line of dialogue, an action." When  the Fonz on "Happy Days" took out a library card several years ago, Lear  recalled, thousands of inner-city youngsters followed suit.  </P> <P> Lear's guests included investor Marvin Davis, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner  and his wife Jane; Creative Artists Agency President Michael Ovitz and wife  Judy; producer Ted Field and wife Susie; Warner Bros. President Terry Semel and  wife Jane; Castle Rock partner Alan Horn and wife Cindy. (Several Hollywood  wives apparently came up with the idea for the group at a recent lunch.)  </P> <P> Other executives associated with the group include MCA President Sidney  Sheinberg; Disney President Frank Wells; Columbia President Dawn Steel; Fox  Chairman Barry Diller and NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff.  </P> <P> "Studio and network executives set a climate for approval," said Andy Spahn,  who is leaving his post as chief of staff to state controller Gray Davis to run  the Environmental Media Assn.  </P> <P> Barbra Streisand was also there, and Robert Redford -- who runs his own  environmental effort -- has endorsed the group, as have 10 of the country's  major environmental organizations.  </P></p>

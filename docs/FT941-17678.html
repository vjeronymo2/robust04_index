			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: AGF chief tipped for new role Mr Michel Albert, chairman of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of the largest French insurance groups, has been tipped as a member of the Monetary Policy Council, the new body which will set monetary policy for the newly independent Bank of France. Yesterday's Le Figaro, the French newspaper, claimed Mr Albert, 63, was a key candidate for one of the nine seats on the council, which will be responsible for setting interest rate policy under the new system whereby the Bank of France will operate independently of the government. If Mr Albert accepted the post, he would have to resign from AGF, given that council members will not be allowed to hold other positions in financial or industrial circles. AGF would not comment yesterday on the speculation about Mr Albert's future. The Monetary Policy Council will be composed of nine members, including Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, and his two deputies. The names of the six new recruits will be announced on Wednesday. Mr Michel Sapin, who was finance minister in the last socialist government, has been cited as another candidate for the council. So too has Mr Alain Prate, who is deputy chairman of the European Investment Bank. The departure of Mr Albert would mark the end of an era for AGF, which is a prime candidate for privatisation by the Balladur government. In his 11 years as chairman Mr Albert has turned AGF into one of France's most powerful insurers. He orchestrated the coup in 1992 whereby it expanded into Germany by taking a stake in the AMB insurance group. Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Gallignani, chairman of Banque Indosuez, the investment bank, has been mooted as a possible successor to Mr Albert at AGF, together with Mr Bernard Esambert, former chairman of Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild.</p>

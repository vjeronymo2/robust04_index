			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Calculated Dangerous Military Moves" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ASAHI  SHIMBUN reported that some latest attack helicopters Apache of  the United States were deployed in a South Korean base on April  10 for a "reinforcement of the combat power" of the U.S. Forces  stationed in South Korea.    And the first batch of Patriot missile batteries which has  left Texas will arrive in South Korea, timing to coincide with  the Seoul trip of U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry in a few  days, said the newspaper.    These are premeditated dangerous military moves to further  destabilize the military situation on the Korean peninsula and,  furthermore, to unleash another war.    As is known, the South Korean puppet clique have massively  shipped in sophisticated weapons from the United States and  "decided" to extend for an indefinite period the order to  strengthen "the military posture of readiness" issued to the  entire units of the puppet Army, which would cover the period  from November last year to March this year. All the units of  the three services of the puppet Army now are intensifying their  "watch" to attack the North.    Such provocative moves of the U.S. imperialists and the  South  Korean trigger-happy elements for Northward invasion are based  on their scrupulously worked out operational plans.    Already in September last year the Kim Yong-sam group  completed a "New Operation Plan No. 5027" for northward invasion  with the U.S. military officials and have staged war exercises  against the North with the U.S. imperialists almost every day.    Facts vividly show that the ever more undisguised new war  provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppet clique these days are an extension of their premeditated  and intentional war moves stepped up from long ago.    Yet, the South Korean puppet clique are making quite a noise  as if others were to blame for the tense situation on the Korean  peninsula, raising a hue and cry over the fictitious  "provocations" by the North. This is nothing but a despicable  humbug for justifying their new war provocation moves.    The South Korean puppets are seeking to overpower the DPRK  by  "strength" in league with the U.S. imperialists and,  furthermore, to gratify their wild ambition for "unification  through Northward invasion" by force of arms, but it is a  foolish daydream.    It is the unshakable will and policy of the DPRK to answer  strength with strength, and dialogue with dialogue.    The U.S. imperialists and the "civilian" warmaniacs must  ponder over things and stop acting rashly, looking squarely at  the resolute will and determination of the Korean people who are  fully prepared to cope with any event.</p>

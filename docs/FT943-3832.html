			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Stockholm Sweden goes to the polls next Sunday and the market is likely to remain sensitive to the opinion polls during the coming week. UBS notes that a series of polls last week showed support for the Social Democrats, who had been expected to form a majority government, falling below the previous 50 per cent of the total votes. This begged the question of whether the Liberals, or Left and Greens, would be required to support the incoming government. The market, meanwhile, is hoping for the Liberals, who are seen as a moderating influence.</p>

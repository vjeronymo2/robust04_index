			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] INTERFAX has learned that ex-Finance Minister Boris  Fedorov prepared a review "Russia's Finances in 1993," a kind of  Finance Ministry report of the work done. The document also  includes prognoses on the developments in the country's economy  in 1994.    According to Fedorov, the principal conclusions are:    1. In 1993, the ministry on the whole stuck to the  anti-inflation orientation of Russia's financial policy and make  a considerable step forward. The most ingenuous analysis shows  that there was no "shock therapy" at all.    2. Nearly all principal decisions have already been made,  the only thing left is to calmly and consistently pursue this  policy, develop a set of instruments and build market  institutions and mechanisms.    3. A market economy already exists in Russia, and it is  possible to regulate it by market means, e.g. by monetary  measures. There is no real alternative to the policy that is  being pursued, and there could not be one.    4. The results would have been more substantial, had the  government and the Central Bank supported and pursued the  monetary and credit policies they proclaimed. The Finance  Ministry alone cannot restructure the whole country's economy.    5. The turn away from reforms which began to take shape in  the beginning of 1994 (shift to mythical non-monetary methods,  raising the industrial output at the expense of additional  emission, neglect of elementary financial discipline) is doomed  to failure. The situation in the economy will inevitably  worsen. A market economy cannot be regulated by the same  methods that Gosplan (the State Planning Committee) used.    6. Any waiver of this policy must be short-term and  politically motivated. It is already impossible to reverse the  course of the development of Russia' economy by peaceful means.  However, it is the people who will pay out of their own pockets  for the waiver. "Red businessmen" are throwing the country into  an abyss of limp decay and non-competence again.    The review also suggests three versions of the financial and  economic policies for 1994:    THE FIRST VERSION implies "refusing the wide-spread idea  that  problems of structural reconstruction might be solved at the  expense of monetary emission, especially when the conditions for  the effective use of financial resources in the real sector are  not yet created."    According to the first version, it would be more expedient  to  gradually reduce the Central Bank's emission by about three  times compared to 1993 and keep it down to 5% of GDP in  the  fourth quarter of this year. In this case, inflation would  amount to 5-6% a month by this summer. The ruble would  trade  against the US dollar at 2,000-2,500 in the second half of the  year. By the end of the year, GDP would shrink by another  8-10% compared to last December. After a sharp fall in the  first quarter of 1994, people's real incomes would grow by  another 10% by the end of the year, e.g. by about the  same as  in 1993.    THE SECOND VERSION envisions that the government will  continue to support industries by emitting more money and  granting credits, but very discreetly.    According to this version, the Central Bank's emission would  reach 9-10% of GDP in the first half of the year and  decrease  by 1.5 times by the end of the year. This would allow  preservation of the average monthly inflation rate of  11-12%  obtained by the end of 1993 and a positive re-financing interest  rate. On the whole, GDP would be shrinking by about 7-9%  by  December 1994. People's real incomes would remain the same as  in 1993. The ruble's rate would grow slower than the inflation  rate and would total 4,500-5,000 rubles per US dollar by the end  of the year. Like the previous one, this version would make  possible constructive cooperation with international financial  institutions, real financial aid and agreement in restructuring  Russia's foreign debt.    THE THIRD VERSION "reflects the situation taking a feasible  shape in late January 1994: A reverse from the moderately  strict credit and monetary policies pursued in 1993." According  to this variant, the government will boost monetary emission to  cover the budget deficit, as the Central Bank will grant more  credits. There will be re-introduced the institution of  privileged credits, delays of payments and writing off the  agro-industrial complex's debts.    The review points out that in its assessment of the  quantitative parameters of this version, the ministry took into  account the presidential decree setting the maximum deficit of  the federal budget financed at the expense of the Central Bank's  credit at 7.5 Tn rubles.    This is why the credit emission was more likely to expand at  the expanse of the Central Bank's credits to the industries  (seasonal works in agriculture, delivery of goods to the  northern regions, aid to the fuel and energy complex, etc.) and  channelling its incomes to the budget. In addition, decisions  to pay out a number of "production" debts to defense  enterprises, agriculture, and for purchase of grain from the  budget of 1993 are being prepared.    Taking into account the expected tax earnings in the first  quarter of 1994 and the maximum deficit limit set by the  president, payment of the "production" debts is possible only if  the announced indexing of salaries of employees of state bodies  is cancelled. Therefore, the inflation mechanism will function  in the following way: the Central Bank's credits to the  industries and the "production" re-orientation of budget  spending will result in a swift aggravation of the situation in  the budget sphere. This will indeed require indexing the  salaries of budget-supported enterprises' employees in the  second quarter.    To support the industries balancing on the brink of the  budget's survival, the credit emission will have to increase up  to 25-30% of GDP by mid-summer. This is a moderately  realistic  assessment of the activities of "red businessmen" (the Ukrainian  government granted credits totalling half of GDP in 1993). So,  Russia may face a "Ukrainization" of its economy in the third  quarter of 1994. Negative processes in finance will be further  aggravated by an outflow of capital and a sharp drop of the  ruble.    The authors of the review point out that "the attempt to  replace monetary methods for control of inflation with  non-monetary ones such as restricted prices, compulsory sale of  all hard currency earnings, fixed rate of the ruble, obligatory  deliveries , etc., will finally mean gradually curbing not only  economic, but also political reforms, and the course for  democratization of society."</p>

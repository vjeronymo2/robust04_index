			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: Mind-set in European agriculture Sir,I have just read David Richardson on the Po valley ('Farmer's viewpoint', May 12), and while having some sympathy with him on the inability of the Italians to stick to the rules, I cannot help thinking how his article typifies the mind-set that exists in European agriculture. His analysis of the comparative merits of two strains of dairy cows focuses completely on a gross output model whereas those of us who would operate in an undistorted and unsubsidised world would necessarily focus on a gross margin model. He did at one stage mention the pursuit of profit but it is one thing to pursue it, and another to achieve it. Is it any wonder that in almost all commodities produced in Europe the price needed by farmers is around twice that needed by the world's economically efficient producers. The promised review of the Common Agricultural Policy will produce changes far more profound than most people in Europe necessarily understand as pricing pressure puts pressure on gross output thinking.

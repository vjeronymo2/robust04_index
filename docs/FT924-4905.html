			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Coal on his Christmas list: Michael Heseltine must wrestle with tough choices as he formulates UK energy policy Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may not spend much time with his family this Christmas. The festive season will find him trying to hammer together a plan to save British Coal in time to meet his self-imposed deadline of publishing a white paper 'early in the new year'. He will not lack ideas. In the seven weeks since British Coal triggered a crisis with its announcement of 31 pit closures and the loss of 30,000 jobs, he has been deluged with suggestions from industrial, social and public interests. The parallel hearings conducted by the Commons select committee on trade and industry have also produced hundreds of pages of testimony. With the consultation period now drawing to a close, these will all go into the melting pot. The overall message is clear: Britain's energy policy, insofar as any exists, is in a mess; people are confused and shocked by the decision to shut down half the coal industry, and they think the answer lies in government taking a more active role. But unfortunately for Mr Heseltine, the torrent of words does not contain an easy solution to his dilemma. If anything, the debate has shown that virtually anything he does to try and increase coal's share of the UK energy market will have a knock-on cost, either as higher prices, jobs lost or subsidies. It has also become evident that he will be hard-pressed to save more than a third of the 30,000 jobs at risk. But the result need not be just a short-term palliative. One of the few encouraging points emphasised by the debate is that British Coal might have stronger prospects if it can only be helped over the next three or four difficult years. Mr Heseltine's white paper will have to balance many competing aims. These include: saving a large enough number of coal jobs to quell public outrage, but keeping the cost to a minimum; achieving quick results, but also creating a sensible long-term framework; taking government initiative without destroying the overriding aim of introducing market forces into the energy sector; making the rescue a boost rather than a burden to the economy as it struggles to recover. The fundamental question which Mr Heseltine will have to answer before he considers possible courses of action is who will bear the cost of saving British Coal, the taxpayer or the electricity consumer. The trade secretary himself has put the total cost of keeping British Coal at its present size at Pounds 1.2bn a year. The case for placing the cost on the taxpayer is that saving miners' jobs is essentially a social matter. Coal is uncommercial, and if wider national considerations require it to be saved, the country at large should foot the bill. But having only just agreed the spending cuts needed for the Autumn Statement, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be in no mood to countenance fresh outlays. Saving coal would add about a half penny to the basic rate of income tax. There is a stronger case for loading the cost on the electricity consumer. Here, the argument is that saving coal is not a social matter but a prudent way of diversifying the country's fuel supplies. A rescue financed by consumers would also save the government a large sum of money by reducing the state's redundancy bill for jobless miners. Mr Heseltine may find it easier to bury the cost in electricity bills. At the moment these are unlikely to rise next year because of the effect of price controls. If Mr Heseltine forces them up, household consumers may not notice much difference, though industrial consumers could kick up a fuss about the threat to recovery: 'What we need is price decreases, not price increases,' Mr Peter Rost, the chairman of the Major Energy Users Council told the select committee. None of the possible solutions would meet all of Mr Heseltine's requirements. Some, such as the suggestion that power generators be asked to hold larger coal stocks, are plainly impractical because their yards are already bulging with coal, and British Coal itself has 20m tonnes lying unsold. Suggestions that imports of coal and electricity should be banned are ruled out by the commercial and diplomatic repercussions. The solution that looks most attractive remains one of the first to be mooted: the extension of the so-called franchise market in which most of the electricity generated from British Coal's output is sold. Those in this market, which consists of all but the 5,000 largest electricity consumers in the country, have to buy power from their local distribution company. It accounts for 70 per cent of electricity consumed, and prices have been maintained at artificially high levels to help coal. The intention was to phase the franchise market out in stages starting in 1994, and to liberalise competition completely by 1998. Mr Heseltine could delay this timetable, either through legislation or with the agreement of the electricity regulator, Prof Stephen Littlechild. Such a move would be welcomed by many regional distribution companies which are not looking forward to tougher competition, and it would place the cost on the consumer rather than the taxpayer. Above all, it would achieve quick results because it would give the electricity industry confidence to sign up for larger deliveries of coal in the new five-year contracts which they are negotiating with British Coal. These contracts, due to start next April, are crucial to British Coal's future. The franchise market could be extended in a further way, along the lines of a proposal by Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the largest generator. He suggested that Mr Heseltine decree that this market could only be served by electricity generated from coal produced in the UK. This would mean excluding the controversial new gas-fired generators which have been accused by large electricity users and the coal lobby of being uneconomic. The present structure of the market allows the regional electricity companies to pass on any higher costs directly to consumers. Mr Baker's suggestion would also staunch coal imports. Although Mr Baker's proposal looks self-serving because National Power is the largest supplier of electricity to the franchise market, it would return that market to the role for which it was originally created - to protect coal. It would doubtless provoke a cry of protest  - and probably legal action - from the gas projects' owners. But it would also put to the test the claim which these projects have always made that gas can compete in a free market. 'They can't have it both ways,' says Mr Baker. Together, these measures could add 15m tonnes of coal to the 40m tonnes currently expected to be burnt for power generation next year. By contrast, the other front-running suggestion - that Mr Heseltine accelerate the closure of the UK's ageing magnox nuclear reactors - has fewer attractions. Although these reactors are currently subsidised to the tune of Pounds 1.2bn a year, their closure would not save this money since it is earmarked for decommissioning costs which will be needed anyway. On top of that, premature closure would deprive the Treasury of the considerable earnings which the magnoxes generate now that their costs have been fully written down. Nuclear Electric puts the potential revenue loss at Pounds 2bn. A further drawback is that nuclear power stations cannot be closed down at a stroke; their closure would not spark any immediate additional demand for coal. While Mr Heseltine will want quick results, he will also need to lay out long-term plans in order to rebuild confidence in the energy sector. The question here is whether he will want to institutionalise a more active government energy policy by creating an energy commission, or even reviving the department of energy which he scrapped only six months ago. There is strong political support for the idea of an energy commission. Public opinion seems to favour making the country's fuel mix a matter of national policy which takes account of social, economic and environmental needs. It also looks as if the select committee will back such a scheme. The committee's hopes that Prof Littlechild would perform this role were dashed when he told them that it was not his job to promote particular types of fuel or save the coal industry. The committee subsequently welcomed a blueprint for an energy agency proposed by Dr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates. But Mr Heseltine would have to decide whether closer government intervention marked a large step back from its long-term plan of introducing market forces into the energy sector. For one thing, it would require detailed legislation. The cost of trying to dictate the fuel mix could also be huge because of the subsidies and distortions it would introduce. The economics of the electricity generation and distribution business would be radically altered only two years after privatisation. But are these fears exaggerated? Mr Francis McGowan of the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, a leading academic centre on energy policy, says it should be possible to adopt a more active policy without falling into the same mistakes as the past. The privatisation of the power industry and the creation of regulators to protect consumers' interests have made the market much more transparent. 'The pendulum has to swing back a bit the other way,' he says. Would a solution that created a market for an extra 15m tonnes of coal production be enough? Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, delivered a gloomy warning to the select committee. Because of the increases of productivity which his company is making, the need for labour will fall anyway. So even though 15m tonnes represents half the amount by which British Coal production was due to be cut, it would at the most save only 10 of the 31 threatened pits, and a third of the miners' jobs. But by the same token, a breathing space would enable British Coal to bring more of its pits up to competitive strength. According to John T. Boyd, the mining consultancy hired by the government to advise on the closures, 28 of the pits could produce coal at an average price of Pounds 1.33 a gigajoule within three or four years, and some could do better. That compares with the current price of Pounds 1.80, and would take British Coal within range of imported coal prices. Mr Heseltine may conclude that it is worth holding back changes in the power market in the hopes of securing these gains, and putting British Coal on a sounder long-term footing, particularly if he can point to wider social benefits. But there will be a hefty price to pay.</p>

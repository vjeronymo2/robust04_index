			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Behind the ERM Crisis: The tragedy of errors that led to chaos on the currency markets - As political disarray threatens the summit of European leaders beginning in Edinburgh today, Peter Norman and Lionel Barber give the inside story of the events which led to Black Wednesday and made the Community's most important objective, monetary union, its least plausible goal THE exact timing remains unclear. But, sometime in the afternoon of Saturday September 12, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet went through one of those chameleon-like changes which top international bureaucrats sometimes experience. As a senior French official, he had stood that morning alongside his boss, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, receiving high-level visitors from Germany in France's steel and glass finance ministry at the unfashionable end of Paris, near the Gare de Lyon. Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the powerful Bundesbank, and Horst Kohler, state secretary at the Bonn Finance Ministry, were on their way to Rome. They had told the French government that Germany wanted to negotiate the first substantial realignment in the European exchange rate mechanism in more than five years. By late evening, Mr Trichet had switched roles. He had exchanged his French civil servant's hat for that of an EC functionary as he prepared to relay to Community member states two pieces of important news: Italy was planning to devalue the lira by 7 per cent in the European Monetary System; and Germany had promised a cut in interest rates in an attempt to calm turmoil in the ERM. What he did not tell them was the Germans wanted a broader realignment of currencies within the system, including sterling. The ERM, a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, was no longer capable of providing monetary stability for Europe. The planned realignment was a radical move to restore order to the system and keep alive hopes of progress to economic and monetary union (Emu). Mr Trichet is director of the French treasury, the most coveted position in France's civil service hierarchy. He is also chairman of the European Community's monetary committee, the secretive group which helps manage European monetary affairs. His actions that weekend were to play a crucial role in determining how the ERM crisis unfolded. Some critics have accused him of putting French interests above those of the Community - by trying to place a protective 'ring-fence' around Italy's devaluation so that the French franc would be shielded from speculative attacks in the week ahead of France's closely contested September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Others charge that he failed to tell the UK that Germany wanted a broader realignment, including sterling. With hindsight, some officials have argued that, if Mr Trichet had pushed for an early weekend meeting of the monetary committee or of EC finance ministers, the EC might have organised a broader realignment that would have calmed the growing fever on financial markets and perhaps even have ensured Britain's continued ERM membership. He has been cast as the eminence grise who scuppered such an opportunity. The truth, as a Financial Times investigation, which has included dozens of interviews with top officials across the EC makes clear, is both more complex and Mr Trichet has told colleagues that, in his capacity as a French official, he could not use the highly-sensitive information given to him by the Germans that morning to set in motion discussions leading to a broader realignment. When wearing his monetary committee hat later in the day, he accepted as a fait accompli the news of the Italian devaluation and took no steps to broaden the scope of the weekend's currency changes, arguing that he could not negotiate on behalf of individual member states. The crisis that has shaken the EC's system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates since September is a story of communications failures at all levels. Mr Trichet's behaviour accorded with the letter of the Community's arcane rule-book, but it did nothing to avert turmoil. Yet Mr Trichet's split personality on that Saturday merely typified the bureaucratic contortions that drove the EMS into the biggest crisis in its 13-year history. Even though currencies will not feature on the formal agenda of the European Community's summit in Edinburgh today, the autumn crisis will haunt the 12 leaders of the EC member states. Ambitious plans for Emu by the end of the decade have been set back by Black Wednesday's traumatic suspension of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM and by subsequent crises and disruptions. Time and again, this autumn's European crisis was bedevilled by human failure and institutional weakness. The crucial meeting of EC finance ministers in Bath on September 4 and 5 exemplified this; so, too, did the events which led to devaluation of the Italian lira and the turmoil which culminated in Black Wednesday. The EMS looked ripe for change when the ministers met in Bath. Funds were haemorrhaging out of the lira into the D-Mark, threatening exchange rate relationships that had stood for 5 3/4 years. The UK government's policy of trying to hold sterling's ERM parity at DM2.95 against the D-Mark during a harsh recession was looking threadbare. The fact that opinion polls in France pointed to a possible government defeat in the September referendum increased the chances of a massive speculative attack against currencies in the EMS. The twice-yearly informal 'Ecofin council' is usually something of a treat for the ministers and governors, their close aides and their spouses. Bath was different. 'It was the worst I've ever attended,' said one veteran of nearly 20 such gatherings. 'A disaster,' concluded another. Nobody who attended has a good word to say about it, least of all senior British Treasury officials who were summoned late on Saturday September 5 to help break deadlock. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, was later to say that the failure to arrange a realignment at the meeting would go down as a 'black page in the book of 1992'. But a realignment was never properly discussed at Bath. Instead, the meeting set what was to become a familiar pattern of half-articulated expectations by some countries that were deliberately ignored by others. Neither Mr Lamont nor Mr Sapin, his close ally in the talks, would contemplate any devaluation of their currencies. Mr Sapin's position was that there could be no ERM realignment before the Maastricht referendum. The Italians, in office for only a few months, kept their heads down. Nobody uttered the 'R-word' in the meeting. Instead, Mr Lamont turned repeatedly on Mr Schlesinger, urging him to cut German interest rates. 'It was tense,' observed one continental official. 'Unilateral pressure was put on one partner in a repeated way.' Mr Schlesinger - as mere primus inter pares on the Bundesbank's decision-making council - was statutorily unable to deliver any such promise. He was also temperamentally disinclined to yield to political pressure. Faced with Mr Lamont's battering ram tactics, Mr Schlesinger nearly walked out. Some days later, he complained that he had been asked four times to cut rates and had to reply No four times 'when only once should have done'. Mr Lubbers later blamed Bath's failure on 'political motives'. Realignment, he said, 'was not possible - because England had its pride and France said that it couldn't be done because it was facing a difficult referendum and they couldn't discuss it; and the English said then that the Bundesbank should do something first, and so the discussion went.' Certainly, realignment was in the air, despite Mr Lamont's and Mr Sapin's efforts to keep it off the agenda. Outside the Bath Assembly rooms, Mr Waigel, the German finance minister, was asked by journalists whether a realignment was being discussed. He stonewalled, answering that such a move would need unanimous support from ERM states, which was not forthcoming. Inside the Assembly Rooms, Mr Schlesinger made comments that officials present were later to interpret as signals that the Bundesbank favoured a realignment. At the time, however, almost no-one realised the significance of his words. The ministers finally knocked together a four-point statement which reaffirmed their opposition to a realignment and referred to a Bundesbank promise not to raise its interest rates. Mr Lamont was quick to imply that this had been a victory over the mighty Bundesbank, a suggestion that angered Mr Schlesinger. Any calming effect the statement might have had on financial markets was undermined the next day when Mr Schlesinger said the Bundesbank pledge represented no change in policy and distanced himself from the agreement not to realign ERM exchange rates. In the days after Bath, the ERM suffered further blows. The Finnish markka, which had been pegged to the Ecu, the EC's embryonic currency, was allowed to float after suffering extended speculative attack. Sweden began a costly and ultimately futile bid to keep its krona pegged to the Ecu by intervening heavily on currency markets and pushing its interest rates to 500 per cent at one point. The Italian lira was sold heavily, finally falling below its ERM floor on Friday September 11 in spite of massive support from the Bundesbank and Bank of Italy. After having to buy an unprecedented DM24bn worth of lire in less than a week, Mr Schlesinger sought the German government's support for a general realignment in the ERM. It was at a special meeting in the Bundesbank on Friday evening, that Mr Tietmeyer and Mr Kohler were asked to go to Rome by way of Paris, to negotiate a devaluation of the lira and seek a realignment involving other currencies. In one respect, the monetary manoeuvrings of the September 12-13 weekend started under a more favourable star than in Bath. In discussions with Chancellor Kohl and his financial advisers, Mr Schlesinger made a potentially far-reaching concession that earned him criticism at home when it became known after the weekend. He made clear the Bundesbank would be prepared to bargain a cut in German interest rates in return for a realignment. The extent would depend on the number of countries taking part. On Saturday and Sunday, the Bundesbank president contacted members of the bank's council to discuss the scope of the interest rate cut. However, the Bundesbank made no effort to contact the Bank of England or British government. 'It was not our job to inform the British of our intentions,' Mr Schlesinger would say later. The absence of timely communication with London was to diminish greatly prospects for the broad realignment the Bundesbank sought. Once a member state seeks a realignment, it is the job of the EC monetary committee, whose chairman is Mr Trichet, to find out the views of other member states. On that weekend, Mr Andreas Kees, the committee secretary who usually canvasses ERM members before convening a meeting of the committee, was away boating. Mr Trichet had to sound out members for a meeting. He decided against such a gathering. Mr Trichet's decision to handle the lira devaluation by phone is now recognised by all - including, it seems, Mr Trichet - as a mistake. It stifled a broader debate on currencies that weekend. There was no opportunity for bilateral meetings with the chairman in which room for compromise could be assessed. Instead, that weekend again illustrated how difficult it is for EMS member states to thrash out delicate policy issues. It is unclear whether Messrs Kohler and Tietmeyer realised Mr Trichet was acting as a French government official alone, and not as EC monetary committee chairman, when they met him and Mr Sapin in Paris en route to Rome. What is certain is that Mr Trichet interpreted their visit as a kind of courtesy call. He knew that the Germans wanted a broad realignment, but believed they had come to advise the French government of a potentially difficult situation just one week before the Maastricht referendum. The German visitors never made a precise request for London to devalue; nor did they propose new parities for the pound. It was in the evening after he was told by telephone of the outcome of the German-Italian negotiations in Rome that Mr Trichet put on his monetary committee hat. It was his duty to see whether the other ERM members approved the planned 7 per cent lira devaluation, and he duly contacted them. But he did not consider it his job to sound out others about broader realignment. After all, he reasoned, the positions of the various countries were known. France had said it did not want to devalue. Both Mr Major and Lamont had publicly rejected devaluation, turning it into a prestige issue. Although it had been fairly clear since the Bath meeting that Germany wanted a broad realignment, it would have been a delicate matter to have suggested a devaluation to the British because the pound had not been under pressure in the previous week. Others have argued that he took a narrow view of his job. 'To do that realignment by phone was unacceptable,' complained one continental central banker. 'Not only was the issue too delicate to be handled by phone. The procedure meant that not everybody was in possession of the same information.' But any of the ERM countries could have insisted on a meeting of either the monetary committee or ministers if they wanted more than the 7 per cent lira devaluation of that weekend. They had an opportunity to act when Mr Trichet contacted them from Saturday evening onwards, or when the draft monetary committee communiques announcing the realignment were circulated. But none did so. Mr Trichet also felt confident a successful realignment could be handled by phone. On three previous occasions the lira parity had been changed in the EMS without a meeting. Moreover, by late Saturday, when he received the news from Rome, time was running short. This is acknowledged in Bonn. According to a senior German Finance Ministry official, Mr Trichet was 'under a very difficult time restraint, and operating in a very difficult environment'. 'We came together very late that weekend with the Italians, asking for a realignment,' the German official said. 'On Friday evening, when invitations normally go out for monetary committee meetings, we were talking among ourselves. It was only on Saturday that we could really offer something in terms of interest rate moves, and we could really pull the Italians on board.' British officials say that the first they heard of a realignment was on Saturday evening when they were asked: 'Do you consent' to the Italian devaluation against the D-Mark? The weekend development was so unexpected that Whitehall had to mount a large-scale search operation to trace Sir Terry Burns, the permanent secretary to the Treasury. He was finally tracked down in Dulwich, a south London suburb, at a party celebrating a friend's 25th wedding anniversary. He learned the news on a mobile phone from Sir Nigel Wicks, the second permanent secretary, who, conscious of recent security breaches on mobile phones, would only refer obliquely to a problem with 'our sick friend'. Mr Lamont, who was at the last night of the Proms, was also only told of developments at a late stage. Although there was some concern that the lira devaluation could mean further volatility in the ERM ahead of France's referendum, there was no sense of imminent doom early on Sunday when Mr Lamont met senior officials in the UK Treasury to discuss developments. By then, according to UK officials, it was known the Bundesbank would cut its Lombard rate by  1/4 percentage points the next day and announce cuts of  1/2 point in its discount and money market rates. When Sir Terry asked, as a matter of form, whether sterling would join in the realignment with a devaluation, the answer from the chancellor was No. Superficially, the 7 per cent lira devaluation appeared almost a text book realignment. It had been carried out behind the scenes, apparently without fuss. But there were some worrying loose ends and signs that all might not be well. The Italian government was unhappy to be devaluing alone. On Sunday morning, Mr Guiliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, rang Mr Major, who was staying with the Queen at Balmoral, to tell him about the planned lira devaluation. He asked if the UK was joining the realignment. Mr Major said No. According to Downing Street, the Italian premier did not then press the UK to devalue. Just before going to church with the Queen, Mr Major telephoned Mr Lamont at the Treasury meeting to confirm the no devaluation line. But, by Sunday afternoon, some UK officials feared the lira devaluation would trigger further speculative pressure in the ERM ahead of the French referendum. They were to argue later that Germany should have 'nursed the lira through' until September 20. There was also concern in the Bundesbank that the changes would not satisfy the markets. The Italian government, it emerged later, thought the scale of the devaluation too small. Rome believed 15 per cent was necessary to restore competitiveness, although it recognised that such a large lira devaluation would almost certainly have been blocked by France because it would have given Italian exporters a big price advantage. Whatever Mr Trichet's motives, the scene was set for the last act of the drama before Black Wednesday. The scale of inflows into Germany the week before showed that markets could wield awesome power in an age of almost unrestricted capital movements. The 7 per cent lira devaluation had been sufficiently large to reward speculators. There was enough dissonance among policy makers to encourage fund managers and corporate treasurers to take a further shot at the ERM. By the afternoon of Tuesday September 15, sterling was in trouble. It closed in London just a fifth of a pfennig above its ERM foor of DM2.778, at its lowest ever level in the mechanism. The Treasury called a high-level crisis meeting in Chancellor Lamont's office with senior Bank of England officials to discuss tactics for the next day. As the meeting was in progress sterling suffered its knock-out blow - as a result of yet another misunderstanding. News agency reports appeared on Tuesday evening of an interview by Mr Schlesinger with Handelsblatt, the German newspaper. He was quoted as favouring a more comprehensive realignment. The news pushed sterling through its ERM floor in after-hours dealings. Two frantic telephone calls between Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Schlesinger got the response that the remarks were 'not authorised'. While the governor was initially reassured, Mr Lamont, according to one participant, was angry and anticipated trouble. He abruptly silenced Mr Leigh-Pemberton. Though denials were soon forthcoming, the scene had been set for a day of carnage on the foreign exchanges. Mr Schlesinger's purported remarks were too close to the known views of many top officials in the German central bank - including his own. Twenty four hours later, Mr Lamont was outside the Treasury facing the television cameras. He announced Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. Massive intervention, possibly exceeding Pounds 15bn, and two emergency interest rate increases, first to 12 per cent and later to 15 per cent, had failed to save the pound. The question facing the EC was whether the ERM and the strategic goal of economic and monetary union by the end of the millenium could be saved from the wreckage.

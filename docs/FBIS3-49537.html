			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Agency for Bulgarians Abroad is concerned over  the new exit fees imposed by the Republic of Serbia, under which  every citizen of the Republic has to pay a fee of 10 German  marks [DM] per person and DM30 for a private vehicle when  departing from the country for abroad. These fees make it  difficult for our compatriots in the Western Outlands [border  region of Serbia inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians] to maintain  contacts with their friends and relatives in Bulgaria and limits  their possibilities of visiting our country, which in many cases  is for them the only way of obtaining essential goods.    The Agency for Bulgarians Abroad proposes that the competent  Bulgarian institutions should take steps through diplomatic  channels to obtain exemption from the exit fees for Yugoslav  citizens of Bulgarian nationality, especially those living in  the municipalities near the border and those who have close  relatives in Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Williams Holdings sells 9.95% Racal stake for Pounds 81m WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday sold the 9.95 per cent stake in Racal Electronics that it was left owning after its failed hostile bid last November. The 139m shares were placed with institutions at 58.5p, netting Williams Pounds 81m after expenses. Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, said the price meant the company had 'more or less wiped its face after carrying cost'. The sale cleans up the loose ends of Williams' third failed hostile bid in four years and clears the way for other acquisitions, although the proceeds will initially be used to pay debt. Mr McGowan said it was unlikely Williams would attempt further hostile bids in the short term but would concentrate on buying large businesses from giant companies that are re-focusing on core businesses. 'From the bid point of view, there is not much value around in the London market,' Mr McGowan said. 'Most of the obvious targets have the bid price roughly in them.' Williams is locked in at fixed rates for 10 years for most of its Pounds 130m of debt, so the company had an 'awful lot of flexibility' within its balance sheet, he said. The placing by Warburg Securities, joint brokers to Williams, was heavily oversubscribed, underlining institutional confidence in the value of Racal after last year's demerger of Vodafone, the cellular network operator. Sir Ernest Harrison, Racal's chairman, is likely to announce the timing of the last phase of the unbundling of Racal - the flotation of Chubb, its security division - when it reports its preliminary results in June. The flotation will probably take place in the autumn, before which the group will have to decide how much of Racal's debt is to remain with the group and how much will go with demerged Chubb. Bid speculation surrounding Racal has subsided over recent weeks. Mr McGowan said yesterday that no one had approached Williams about buying its stake in preparation for a bid. Instead Racal has derived support from a growing institutional confidence that Williams' bid had galvanised a sleepy management in Racal's non-Vodafone businesses. Mr McGowan said there was no prospect of Williams going back for a second bid at Racal. Williams share price rose 7p to 352p on news of the placing while Racal's was unchanged at 60.5p.</p>

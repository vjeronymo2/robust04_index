			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HANDMADE;  </P> <P> JEWELRY FOR THE SPACE AGE  </P> <P> IRIDESCENT, METALLIC bits glitter against black backgrounds, resulting in the  illusion of sparkling objects floating in dark waters. In Julie Bauer's  wearable art glass for men and women, the fusion of layers of glass creates a  third dimension.  </P> <P> New in her repertoire -- which includes earrings, pins, necklaces, bracelets,  tie bars, bolo ties and color pins -- are works using dichroic glass, which she  describes as "a modern, Space Age material in neon colors: fluorescent green,  turquoise blue and gold."  </P> <P> It is apparent from her work that the San Diego-based artist likes to play with  triangular designs. Elements in her jewelry always appear in sets of threes,  borrowing the concept from Japanese gardens. "I want peace in my work, not  chaos," she explains.  </P> <P> In addition to designing jewelry (prices range from about $25 for a pair of  earrings to $200 for elaborate necklaces with 14-karat-gold stars imbedded in  glass), Bauer also makes free-form bowls and wall sculptures -- all in her  trademark media: iridescent, fused glass. (Bowls are tagged at $35 up to $500;  wall sculptures, from $125 to $1,800.)  </P> <P> Though Bauer has pieces for men and women, she says she has made a special  effort to produce jewelry for men, because designers "are not spotlighting men  as much as women. Men are not ornamented enough."  </P> <P>  Julie Bauer can be reached at Glass Act, 544 3rd St., Imperial Beach; (619)  423-4150.  </P> <P> LORETTA K. PARAGUASSU  </P></p>

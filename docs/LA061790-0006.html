			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: SONY CLASSICAL'S DEBUT LACKS ADVENTURE  </P> <P> Two months ago in these pages, Gunther Breest, the president of Sony Classical,  the new major label on the block, noted that he wasn't happy with all the  projects he had inherited from CBS Masterworks, whose catalog and commitments  are now part of the Sony enterprise.  </P> <P> One wonders how many components of this initial batch of Sony Classical  releases are original Breest projects, for while it offers certain items of  value, the sense of adventure promised by the much-publicized debut is lacking  in the product.  </P> <P> Among the more pleasant surprises are three recordings that may give Zubin  Mehta's battered reputation a lift.  </P> <P> Richard Strauss' "Alpine Symphony" (45800), universally considered beneath  contempt a decade ago -- a bombastic, rehashing/trashing of earlier Straussian  ideas -- has lately insinuated itself into both the catalog and the concert  repertory through the offices of such celebrity conductors as Karajan, Solti,  Haitink and Previn. And now Mehta. Whether he adds to what little need be known  about the work is questionable, but his enthusiasm is palpable, as is the  sumptuous execution by the Berlin Philharmonic. Junk food for the ears,  perhaps, but tasty.  </P> <P> The companion piece is the delightful E-flat Horn Concerto, written when  Strauss wasn't yet rehashing himself, but assimilating ideas picked up from  Schumann and Mendelssohn. The performance, by the same forces and with BPO  principal Gerd Seifert as soloist, is absolutely first-rate.  </P> <P> Although the prospect of yet another Bartok Concerto for Orchestra fails to  excite, Mehta -- for whom slapdash performances became a way of life in New  York -- combines with the Berlin Philharmonic for an interpretation that is  cohesive, finely detailed, almost chamberlike in its clarity. The accompanying  "Miraculous Mandarin" Suite, Bartok's most raucous score, is given the all-out  virtuoso treatment, and it's a thriller (45748).  </P> <P> Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic do not, however, provide the sensitive  accompaniment due Murray Perahia's refined interpretations of the Chopin piano  concertos (44922), but Mehta and the Vienna Philharmonic are congenial,  gracious partners in the 1990 New Year's concert of music by the waltzing  Strausses (45808).  </P> <P> Two other conductors featured in Sony's initial outpouring are Daniel Barenboim  and Pablo Casals. Barenboim is both piano soloist and conductor of the Berlin  Philharmonic for Beethoven's C-major Concerto and Seventh Symphony in "Das  Konzert" (45830), which took place last November in the presence of an East  German audience celebrating the toppling of the Berlin Wall. Musically it is  redundant; emotionally, it arrives too late.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Barenboim and the BPO provide heavyweight backing for 65-year-old  Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in Mahler's "Wayfarer" and "Wunderhorn" songs (44935),  both of which he has recorded previously and, not surprisingly, in better vocal  estate.  </P> <P> The Casals material, originating at the Marlboro Festival in the 1960s,  consists of the Beethoven First and "Pastorale" (45891) and Seventh and Eighth  Symphonies (45892) as well as the Bach Second and Third Orchestral Suites  (45892).  </P> <P> The Beethovens, except for the "Pastorale" all previously released, are in the  gruffly affectionate vein typical of Casals' work at Marlboro. The Bach suites  are simply ponderous. The latter disc also offers a set of canons, in effect  Bach's further variations on the "Goldberg" theme, recorded in 1976, three  years after Casals' death. The stylistically inapt realization is credited to  "Marlboro Musicians" and the ensemble features pianist and festival director  Rudolf Serkin.  </P> <P> The late Vladimir Horowitz's last recording (45818) finds him fussing with  Chopin but striking sparks with a dynamic, crisply articulated Haydn Sonata in  E-flat (Hob. 49); and the listener not swept up by the voluptuousness of tone  and sentiment the venerable pianist brings to Liszt's tarting-up of Isolde's  "Liebestod" must be made of wallboard.  </P> <P> Isaac Stern's playing is spirited and stylish and Daniel Barenboim is in peak  form in Schubert's undervalued oeuvre for violin and piano (44504, two discs).  Together, they capture the music's elusive combination of Romantic sentiment  and Classical vitality.  </P> <P> The agglomeration of Stern, Jean-Pierre Rampal and Mstislav Rostropovich, on  the other hand, likely had a better time than those who will be exposed to  their rough, each-man-for-himself assault on works by Mozart, Telemann, J.C.  Bach and Reicha (44569).  </P> <P> The Bulgarian production of Borodin's complete, four-act "Prince Igor" (44878,  3 CDs), in many respects admirable, has two gaping holes at the center: Boris  Martinovich fails to provide the vocal heft (with lashings of cream) demanded  by the title role, and Nicolai Ghiaurov's once-noble instrument is in tatters,  with the veteran artist further unable to supply the dramatic punch to pull him  through the potentially scene-stealing paces of the Polovstian Khan. Nicola  Ghiuselev blusters amiably as the dissolute Galitsky, and the two women, Stefka  Evstatieva as Yaroslavna and Alexandra Miltcheva as Konchakovna, are vocally  accomplished and dramatically alert.  </P> <P> The Sofia Festival Orchestra and National Opera Chorus, both very fine, are  under the lively, colorful direction of Emil Tchakarov.  </P></p>

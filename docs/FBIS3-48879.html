			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Taro Yayama: "Rice Liberalization: `Heaven's </F> Will'"]    [Text] The time limit for the Uruguay Round (new  multilateral trade negotiations) is now imminent. The U.S.  Government has to attain the new round's blanket passage by 15  December under a term of negotiations it gained from the  Congress, and so it is arranged that respective countries should  show their acceptable conditions in each sector by 15 November.  Among conditions are those related to Japan's rice issue, and  Prime Minister Hosokawa must decide by that time whether Japan  should accept "imposition of custom duties without exception" to  replace all other trade barriers.    Dark clouds of regional economic blocs are hanging low over  the world economy, partly affected by the worldwide recession.  Amid such a development, making the new round successful amounts  to opening a bright prospect in the world trade. It is  undoubtedly Japan that will receive the largest benefits by the  success of the new round. Prime Minister Hosokawa should  consider it the highest national interest to carve out the  future of the world trade by effecting a breakthrough on the  rice question. There is no doubt that the rice issue is an  extremely difficult question, but it is after all nothing but  Japan's domestic problem. It should be defined as a matter of  secondary importance, compared with the supreme national  interest.    Seeing a prospect of hardship in the future of the new  round,  there was once a move in GATT to grope for a "small package"  (small compromise). The move meant to avoid the difficult  agricultural issue and settle things on a small scale. However,  once such a move began, each country backed down on its  concession plan, resulting in a widened move to only make  smaller concessions. This resembles the way in which you make  caramel candy. In making caramel, you should boil sugared water  blended with baking soda, stirring the mixture with a stick.  When it swells, the stick should be pulled out instantly and you  will see caramel made in a flash. If you clumsily give too many  small stirs, nothing will be produced and you will end in seeing  only the sugared water remaining there. Sensing that there was  such a knack at doing their business, respective countries came  to realize that their negotiations would fail once they began  moving toward the small package. They have thus generally agreed  at present to work out a large package, that is, to produce the  largest possible caramel.    The agricultural negotiations between the United States and  the EC are now facing difficulty. The Miyazawa cabinet appeared  to be looking forward to the failure of the U.S.-EC  negotiations, with the view that, as a result of the failure,  Japan would not be called to task for the new round's collapse  and could avoid settlement of the rice issue. However, this was  a totally mistaken view. No matter how the U.S.-EC negotiations  turn out, Japan should manifest its acceptance of the imposition  of custom duties to replace all other trade barriers. This may  possibly soften the EC's position and link to successfully  reaching a global agreement. Japan receives the highest benefits  from free trade, and it should make sacrifices for the new round  which perfects free trade rules.    Agricultural organizations and rice-related Diet members  have  made a do-or-die resistance to the imposition of custom duties  under the following diagram: the imposition of custom duties =  deregulation = the collapse of rice farming. Hikaru Matsunaga,  former minister of international trade and industry, once said  that "the logic that not even a grain of rice will be imported  is not warrantable in the world" (January 1990). Reacting  against his remarks, agricultural organizations adopted a  resolution to the effect that "we seek his immediate  resignation." Since then, the tendency to taboo the rice issue  has taken root in the political world, and the issue has not  been discussed at all, even in the Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]. This is strikingly similar to  the condition of Japan during World War II when people who  mentioned a cease-fire or the unfavorable progress of war were  regarded as traitors. Japan was heading toward a catastrophe  because there was no freedom of research and the press, was it  not? What prospects do agricultural organizations, the MAFF, and  rice-related Diet members have now regarding the rice issue? It  is indeed irresponsible for them to only call for stubborn  opposition without having any prospect, and it is not an action  taken out of real consideration for the future of agriculture.  <H5>  Farm Households Without Successors </H5>   According to agricultural censuses, of every 14.9 farm  households, only one household had a successor (a key male  agricultural worker) in 1970; however, in 1991, showing a sharp  decrease, one of every 78.7 farm households had its successor.  This decrease in the number of households having successors will  particularly be sharp in the upcoming five or six years. In  those five or six years when people born during the first 10  years of the Showa era are expected to retire, the decrease will  be made in geometric progression. The lack of successors are  particularly tense among rice farming houses.    Miyagi Prefecture, the home of the Sasanishiki rice strain,  registered a ratio of one to 154 households in 1991 against the  national average successor ratio of one to 78.7 households. When  we compare this with the prefecture's 1990 ratio of one to 101.3  households, we will see how sharply the number of the households  with successors decreased.    Likewise, in Akita Prefecture, the home of the Akitakomachi  rice strain, the 1990 ratio of one to 139.2 households changed  to a ratio of one to 183.3 in 1991, and in Niigata Prefecture  where the Koshihikari strain is produced, the 1990 ratio of one  to 153.8 changed to a ratio of one to 251.8 in 1991, both  indicating a sharp decrease.    If this trend goes unchecked, farmlands will be successively  devastated and abandoned across the nation in the upcoming five  or six years. Why does rice farming alone lack successors like  this while there are enough of them in the domains of flower and  plant cultivation, animal husbandry, chicken raising, and the  growth of vegetables? The MAFF and agricultural organizations  are not analyzing the reason for this and, in the first place,  they even do not report to the people on this serious situation.    Young people shun rice farming because the rice industry is  not profitable. It is said that, of profits accruing from the  rice industry, 20 percent come from production, 30 percent from  processing, and 50 percent from sales. It is only in this 20  percent sector where farmers are now able to display their  creativeness and ingenuity. This is because they are bound hand  and foot by the Agricultural Land Act and the Staple Food  Control Act. In contrast, agricultural cooperatives control the  30 percent and 50 percent portions, skimming the cream of the  top. Should the Staple Food Control Act be repealed, farmers can  advance into the 30 percent and the 50 percent sectors. Then  their managerial efforts will be rewarded, and they will become  able to display their entrepreneurial spirit.    Present agricultural cooperatives exist not for the sake of  farmers, but for their own benefits, and farmers are just like  serfs working at government-run farms. Such being the case, it  is natural for young people to shun rice farming.  <H5>  What MAFF Should Do Is... </H5>   What MAFF should do is think about how to release farmers  from such inconveniences and restraints and make them enjoy the  profitability of rice farming. It is none other than MAFF  bureaucrats that fawn upon agricultural organizations and  reckless commando-like rice-related Diet members and drive the  rice industry to ruin.    Former GATT Director General Dunkel's proposal, which  constitutes the base of negotiations in the new round, calls for  1) importing 3-5 percent of minimum consumption requirements,  and 2) lowering tariffs by 15 percent in seven years. As things  stand now, our country already falls short of rice by 300,000 to  500,000 tons for other purposes [rice for uses as other than  principal food] even when there is not a crop failure, and so  there will be no problem in accepting the proposal. As for  tariff rates, they will be brought up for negotiations after our  "acceptance of the imposition of custom duties" to replace all  other trade barriers, and even though the imposition of custom  duties is realized, foreign rice will not flow in with a rush  when initially proposed high tariffs such as a 700 percent rate  are approved.    Prime Minister Hosokawa, accept the imposition of custom  duties to replace all other trade barriers with a firm resolve.</p>

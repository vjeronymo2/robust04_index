			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FUERBRINGER BLOCKS SERVITE'S PATH TO TITLE  </P> <P> With three seconds left in overtime, Servite High School went for it all.  Trailing by two, the Friars' Paul Stapleton set up for a three-point field goal  attempt.  </P> <P> But the shot had barely left Stapleton's finger tips when Matt Fuerbringer  reached out and swatted it into the corner.  </P> <P> The play preserved a 51-49 overtime victory for Estancia High School in the  Southern Section 3-AA championship game at the Bren Center Wednesday.  </P> <P> For Fuerbringer, it was vindication of sorts.  </P> <P> On Friday in the semifinals, Fuerbringer had tipped a three-point field goal  attempt against Lompoc. However, the ball went in to tie the score and send the  game into overtime.  </P> <P> Although Estancia had won in triple overtime, Fuerbringer has been haunted by  that shot.  </P> <P> "If you tip a shot, it shouldn't go in," Fuerbringer said. "If I hadn't touched  it, the shot wouldn't have been close."  </P> <P> But the incident against Lompoc was the furthest thing from Fuerbringer's mind  when he charged Stapleton Wednesday.  </P> <P> A little more than 30 seconds before, Stapleton had hit a three-pointer from  the exact spot to tie the score, 49-49. Fuerbringer lunged at Stapleton, but  got there too late.  </P> <P> After Agustin Heredia made two free throws with seven seconds left to give  Estancia a 51-49 lead, the Friars worked the ball up the left side.  </P> <P> "I saw it was the same play they had burned me on before," Fuerbringer said. "I  didn't think I was going to get there in time to block the shot. I thought he  was going to make it and we were going to lose. So I just jumped."  </P> <P> It was Fuerbringer's second blocked shot of the game. He also scored eight  points and had a team-high eight rebounds.  </P> <P> Wednesday's game was not his best performance in the playoffs, far from it.  Fuerbringer has averaged 17.7 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots per  game in the postseason.  </P> <P> However, Fuerbringer, a 6-foot-4, 155-pound sophomore, was able to hold his own  against the Friars' tall front line. He battled Steve Marusich, Servite's 6-7  center, to a standstill.  </P> <P> "Matt has come through for us at the right time,"' Heredia said. "Every team  needs a big man. Matt's ours.  </P> <P> "That was a gutsy move by Matt on the blocked shot. What if he fouls the guy?"  </P> <P> But Fuerbringer wasn't worried about a foul.  </P> <P> "What if he makes the three-pointer?"  </P></p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (4): Equities buzz phrase - Blue Chips THE BUZZ phrase for those who intend to stay in the Spanish equities market is to go for the interest rate-sensitive sectors. They stand to make gains, always presuming that the cuts do occur, well before the industrial cycle recovers. This means banks - and particularly Santander, Popular and Bankinter, a trio that can represent up to 30 per cent of any Bolsa strategy model. These are the high yielding equities in which every investor who was able to took up positions as far back as anyone can remember. Those seeking to spread the banking group representation have begun to include Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) mostly on the basis of its improving results, and Argentaria, the newcomer this year to the Bolsa which issued 25 per cent of its equity in May. Although not a significant beneficiary of lower interest rates, Argentaria is living a honeymoon period with the market and there has been a considerable post-issue net flow from domestic retailers, who were favoured by the placement, towards foreign institutions. This is not surprising for foreign interest was very high during the public issue with international investors subscribing 10.6 times the shares on offer. It is believed that international investors may now hold between 14m and 15m ordinary shares in Argentaria up from the 11.7m that were offered in the global tranche. This would represent close to 50 per cent of the equity that was issued and, according to Morgan Stanley who acted as Argentaria's global co-ordinators, the proportion could rise to 60 per cent. The Autopistas, the Spanish toll motorways, have consistently been investor-friendly stocks. They are obvious interest rate cut winners and they should benefit too, through an influx of tourism, from the peseta devaluations of the past months. Meanwhile there is a mix of feelings about the three staple ingredients of all Spain portfolios: Telefonica, the telecommunications group; Tabacalera, the state-controlled tobacco company; and the energy conglomerate Repsol. Telefonica posted a healthy 5.9 per cent net profit rise in the first-quarter result but there are market misgivings about the potential impact of European Community deregulation on the government-controlled telecommunications monopoly. Investors were not reassured by the government's approval of telephone tariffs which fell short of what Telefonica had hoped for. Tabacalera faces just as many imponderables. The market has already discounted the possible sale of its food division Royal Brands and it sees a less-than-clear strategic direction in the months ahead in spite of a lot of talk about returning to its core tobacco business. In theory, Tabacalera is a candidate for partial privatisation but its first-quarter results were as disappointing as those of 1992. Cigarette sales dropped by 15 per cent in the first three months. This was not because Spaniards have cut back on smoking but because a January tax increase has prompted a massive increase in cigarette smuggling. Repsol, in contrast, delivers sustained good feelings. The most high-profiled of all Spanish equities, Repsol was able to waive a discount when it raised nearly Dollars 1bn in an April global offering to institutional investors. The offering reduced the government's holding in the energy group by 13.3 per cent to 41.1 per cent and it raised to 33 per cent the equity held by foreign investors. The good news that shareholders received at Reposl's annual general meeting this month, apart from the forecast of improved results, was that the 1992 payout will be raised to 43 per cent - it was 42 per cent in 1991 - and that it will be gradually increased to 50 per cent.</p>

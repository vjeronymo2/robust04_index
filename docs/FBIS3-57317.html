			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Larisa Zhalovaga: "I Am Sure the Tripartite </F> Agreement Serves Ukrainian Interests"]    [Text] Speaking at a meeting devoted to the recent  scientific conference held in Jamaica and titled "Russia,  Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the U.S. Policy," Ukrainian Foreign  Deputy Minister Borys Tarasyuk said that sentiments in the U.S.  scientific circles, which have a substantial influence on  American lawmakers, have recently changed in favor of Ukraine.  In the opinion of Mr. Tarasyuk, Ukraine is regarded as a  serious factor in the geopolitical situation. The journalists  wanted to learn certain aspects of the tripartite agreement  regarding the liquidation of Ukrainian nuclear weapons recently  signed in Moscow by the three presidents.    Asked whether the agreement will be implemented if the  Supreme Council blocks joining the Lisbon Protocol, Borys  Tarasyuk said: Of course, as a legislative body, the Supreme  Council wields powers ensured by the Constitution, and its  position on the Lisbon Protocol is known. However, one cannot  deny the fact that the executive branch has a somewhat different  viewpoint. As you know, the Ukrainian president has repeatedly  stressed his disagreement with the Supreme Council decision made  on 18 November, and again will try to persuade the deputies that  Ukraine must join the nonproliferation treaty. Will the  agreement be implemented?    We know how the world reacted to the ratification of START I  by our legislature. Some participants of the tripartite  agreement soundly rejected the position and all conditions put  forward in the Supreme Council resolution. As a result, the  fact of signing the tripartite agreement proves that our  partners recognized the correctness of the conditions declared  by our parliament on 18 November, 1993.    Let us examine the most important ones. National security  guarantees are reflected in the agreement. So is compensation  for nuclear weapons and financial aid. A question may arise  here: Are these sufficient guarantees? But this is a different  issue, and it will be worked on. I am confident, however, that  implementation of this agreement serves the interests of Ukraine.    Asked how the Crimean elections will influence  Russian-Ukrainian relations, the foreign deputy minister cited a  statement by a high-ranking Russian diplomat reported by  INTERFAX, who thinks that the issue of the presidency in the  Crimea is not completely settled with the Ukrainian parliament.  Legally, the Ukrainian president can declare the elections  void. The unidentified diplomat believes that no serious  political crisis should be expected in case Yuriy Meshkov is  elected Crimean president. Russian should only develop mutually  advantageous relations with the Crimea, but on no account, as he  put it, get it to eat out of Russia's hand. Politically, this  would not be a good move regarding Ukraine. Besides, Russia  does not need any spongers. This is the viewpoint of a ranking  Russian diplomat, stressed Borys Tarasyuk. He also said that  since this is our internal affair, the Crimean elections should  cause concern to Ukraine rather than to Russia.    If the presidential elections in the peninsula do not change  the present norms of international law and the Helsinki  principles, improving instead its social and economic life, they  should only be welcomed.    But if those elections result in attempts to change Crimea's  status as part of Ukrainian territory, this will certainly  produce very serious consequences in the domestic situation and,  depending on Russia's reaction, on Ukrainian-Russian relations.    At the same time, Borys Tarasyuk emphasized, signatures of  the three presidents on the tripartite agreement that speak  about territorial integrity -- especially as it applies to  Ukraine -- and the nonviolability of the present border point to  the explicit position of the Russian leadership on possible  attempts to split the Crimea from Ukraine.</p>

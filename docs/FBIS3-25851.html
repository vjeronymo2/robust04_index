			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] may build an airport, a  port, and a lighthouse on the disputed Spratly Islands to  underscore its claim of sovereignty over them. A ranking  official with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications  said Monday [24 January] from a political standpoint, it is  feasible to go ahead with such project even though there may be  no economic benefit. ROC Marines maintain a base on Taiping, an  islet in the Spratlys. The South China islands are claimed  wholly or in part by Brunei, Mainland China, Malaysia, the  Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.    An ROC study group of officials and experts toured Taiping  for about three weeks last November, and it has started to make  a formal proposal on airport (?to be published in the media)  later this year. Officials said the government plans to develop  tourism on the Spratlys and has yet to resolve problems with  accommodations and water supply.</p>

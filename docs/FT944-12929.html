			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Troupe's leaden turn - The re-launched Ballet Rambert is disappointing despite a promising group of dancers / Dance In 1966, Ballet Rambert was re-launched as a dance company inspired by the adventurous example of Nederlands Dans Theater. For 40 years, Rambert nurtured talent, but fell victim to the need to lure audiences with classical stagings of the sort we still see being touted round the regions today. The post-1966 Rambert troupe did grand things, helping build a public for modern dance, joining with the London Contemporary Dance organisation in this missionary act. But after a quarter of a century, what had been re-named the Rambert Dance Company fell victim to declining audiences, as did LCDT. The rigorous post-Cunningham aesthetic of Richard Alston brought about his departure as Rambert's director, and curious funding policies resulted in the demise of LCDT, and the forming of a smaller contemporary troupe which is now Alston's creative home. Meantime, Rambert was given more funds and more dancers, a strong musical ensemble was envisaged, and Christopher Bruce, long-time a Rambert star as dancer and choreographer, became the director. The re-launched Rambert company was unveiled last week. And, as in 1966, the guiding influence is that of Nederlands Dans Theater. Bruce's choreographies have often seemed shadowed by the work of Jiri Kylian, who has shaped Nederlands' identity. There is a similar concern with the folksy and the non-specifically anxious, even the same affection for dun-coloured designs and muzzy emoting. For the 'Rambert re-launch' we have a piece from Kylian, and from Ohad Naharin, who has made pieces for NDT, and of course from Bruce himself. Watching Rambert in Edinburgh last week was like seeing NDT 4 - there being already three NDT troupes, different only in that they all look the same save in matter of the performers' age. Be it said first of all that Bruce has assembled a magnificently promising group of dancers. Some remain from the previous ensemble; recruits include an outstanding artist in Ted Stoffer, fast, clear in rhythm and movement. But the portents in Bruce's repertory choices are less encouraging. I can see no point in baptising the troupe with Martha Clarke's Garden of Earthly Delights. Miss Clarke was a member of the Pilobolus company (gymnasts passing themselves off as dancers), and this Garden was seen nearly a decade ago at the Edinburgh Festival. It has the audacity to claim that it is 'based on' the Bosch triptych which explores the idea of heaven and hell in astounding and surreal imagery. What we are shown are crass mime scenes in which dancers lurch and posture, and interfere with three hapless musicians who provide olde-worlde tootlings and clatter. (At one moment two dancers assault a set of tubular bells. Send not to know for whom these bells toll: they toll for the staging.) As a portrayal of medieval faith and its terrors, the piece is sexually and cloacally vulgar. As a piece of dance-theatre it is brutish. As a baptismal act it is like inviting Attila the Hun to stand as godfather. The stage is covered with movement graffiti of the dullest and most explicit kind - every bodily function highlighted - amid a cascade of that well-known medieval delicacy - the raw potato. Not Bosch but tosh. The programme ends with Bruce's Sergeant Early's Dream, dating from 1984, which offers emotion, folk-song performed on stage (oh, that pitch-wary keening]), and dances, blazingly done, that bring the novel news that the peasantry had a hard time. If this first programme might be seen as retrograde - cannot well-funded modern dance do better and more boldly than this? - the second was worrying in its implications. Rambert has acquired a strong musical identity with the involvement of London Musici under Mark Stephenson. Yet the programme brought choreographic assaults on compositions which should not have been countenanced. Kylian's Petite Mort uses the adagios from Mozart's K467 and K488 piano concerti as a soundtrack for a witless exercise in sexual grappling. The girls lurk within cut-outs of black 18th-century dresses, which are obligingly on castors and can be rolled about the stage to give us such a jolly laugh. Kylian, whose musical sensitivities have something of the chain-saw about them, proposes dull duets and a good deal of spurious 'meaning' while the two adagios are played. Hell gapes. So it does as Ohad Naharin shows 19 dancers got up as garcons de cafe (with aprons in twee fabrics), chairs, undressing, childish humour and even more tiresome dance ideas, and a touch of angst for his deleterious Axioma 7. The fourth Brandenburg concerto is well played while these fatuities take place: I hope Mr Stephenson and his musicians get danger money. The piece is of staggering foolishness. The programme is completed by Bruce's new Crossing, which is dark, disturbed, reflecting the moods of Gor-ecki's grinding second string quartet. The programme-note makes oracular statements - each piece comes with a guide-book quote as a kind of early-warning system - and the dance, magnificently done (as is everything in this repertory), is richly endowed with striving and the statutory moments of consolation. I thought it looked most like a Rite of Spring in which no one wanted to be the Chosen Virgin. The merits of these performances were clear to see - a superbly trained and already coherent ensemble, and notably good musical standards. The problem lies with the dancers' ability to transform choreographic lead into the gold of the theatre. Match dance to dancers and Rambert will truly be re-launched. Rambert Dance will be at the Grand Theatre, Swansea, from November 1-5, and at the Orchard Theatre, Dartford, from November 8-12.</p>

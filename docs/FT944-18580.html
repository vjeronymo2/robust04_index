			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Policy of lending through recession set to pay off - Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland, which reports its interim results on Wednesday, is expected to show that its policy of lending through the recession is paying off. Market forecasts of interim pre-tax profits range from Pounds 190m to Pounds 202m, up from Pounds 117.6m at the halfway stage a year ago. Analysts are waiting for earnings per share figures of 9.6p-10.4p, of which about 2.1p will go in dividend. The figures are contingent, above all, on estimates of Bank of Scotland's bad debt provision. If it falls at the rate of other UK banks, profits would turn out at the higher end of the range. But Scotland, which never went into recession as deeply as other parts of the UK, has commensurately less potential to rebound. Other banks have achieved profit growth as the UK economy comes out of recession. But none have improved their results at the same time as increasing lending and income at the pace of Bank of Scotland. One analyst forecast 9 per cent growth in total income in the year to this first half. The next fastest growing UK bank achieved total income growth of 7 per cent and one's figures actually declined by 4 per cent. Bank of Scotland has had room to expand in that its business a decade ago was exclusively north of the border. Now more is in England and Wales than in its home territory. Analysts have periodically speculated on the logic of an approach to an English building society. The bank's culture remains conservative, however. In any case, few building societies have signalled their readiness to sell out. Costs, as well as income, are rising at a faster rate than the sector as a whole. But Bank of Scotland responds with irritation to suggestions that it should now curb its expenses. The lowest cost-income ratio of major UK banks is proof of its efficiency, Bank of Scotland believes.</p>

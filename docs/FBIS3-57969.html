The new party's convention has been set for January 18. The  regional coordinators named by Martinazzoli as the backbone for  the re-baptised formation will organise regional liaison  committees, which will then appoint candidates to run in the  coming general elections.    According to a cartel of incumbent Christian Democrat MPs,  however, Martinazzoli has chosen the coordinators badly and is  moving wrongly in seeking to create a conservative force to  offset the progressive one emerging on the Left.    In one move, the "neo-centrists" as they have dubbed  themselves, sent Martinazzoli a registered letter demanding the  urgent convening of a session of the Christian Democrat National  Council, saying that they were not planning to leave the party  for the time being.    But they also ventilated the possibility that they could  break ranks and vote against the Ciampi government in the  confidence now scheduled on January 12. [as received]    "The confidence debate will be a test case," said one of the  group, Pier Ferdinando Casini, alleging institutional bias in  favour of the Left Democrats, the major opposition party. "The  fact is that the government is cross-eyed. Despite its majority,  it looks leftward. I can't exclude any hypothesis, not even a  vote against the government."    According to the "neo-centrists," Martinazzoli and his  planned People's Party should be seeking to form a "grouping"  with ex-Christian Democrat Mario Segni, the Northern League and  Berlusconi, who has recently thrown his weight as entrepreneur  and media mogul behind attempts to stop a left-leaning victory  at the polls.    Casini welcomed this afternoon's over 2-hour meeting between  Berlusconi and Martinazzoli at the latter's villa at Arcore near  Milan. No details were available on the meeting, though  Berlusconi invited the press in and, after making sure  Martinazzoli had made no statement on leaving, described it as  "very cordial, let's say the discourse continues."    Berlusconi also commented that the conservative parties have  so far failed to emerge from the mentality created by  proportional representatives into the sort of alliances needed  to create a winning bloc in the coming elections by simple  majority.    Asked how he assesses the objections raised by some of  Martinazzoli's aides to an alliance with himself or the Northern  League's Umberto Bossi, he said: "It's the death sentence for  their party, in other words, a ploy that is openly advantageous  to the Left Democrats."    The "neo-centrists," who will be releasing a policy document  tomorrow, say cooperation with Berlusconi and the League is  possible. But, for the time being, unless a "serious revision"  is seen, they draw the line at a "tactical" alliance for the  elections with the conservative hardliners of the Italian Social  Movement, the post-war heir to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party.    But, in an editorial to be published Thursday morning by IL  POPOLO, the Christian Democrat mouthpiece, Martinazzoli said he  sees a platform including the League or the Social Movement as  its reference-points would be "an exercise verging on a short  circuit."    He also said that, once the Christian Democrat Party had  been  freed of the "dross" accumulated during decades in power, it  would still be able to reflect the need for a balance between  "the values of liberty and the aspirations for justice" that are  needed to govern an "orderly democratic progress."</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / British proposal seeks to break Danish deadlock on Maastricht BRITAIN has put forward proposals over Denmark's relationship within the European Community which seem likely to break the deadlock over the Maastricht treaty. EC governments last night cautiously welcomed the proposals, which are expected to reduce the risk of acrimony over the EC's future at next week's Edinburgh summit. The British initiative avoids tampering with the text of the treaty, but would allow Denmark to remain outside key areas such as monetary union and European defence. The four-point plan calls for a series of declarations from the EC and the Copenhagen government to allow Denmark to submit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum next year. The proposals involve three clarifying 'declarations' and one 'decision' by the 12 EC nations. Although there was still uncertainty last night over the precise legal status of the package, the latter part of the proposal would exempt Denmark from being bound to follow the key goals of the Maastricht treaty. France welcomed the plan to solve the problems caused by Danish voters' rejection of Maastricht in June. Up to now, the government in Paris has been suspicious that a Danish compromise could water down the Maastricht treaty. Mr Jean Musitelli, the spokesman for President Francois Mitterrand, said in Bonn: 'We consider that there is a possibility of satisfying the demands presented by the Danish government to its 11 partners by adopting adequate declarations.' Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, said the British suggestion was 'an excellent starting point for arriving at a satisfactory solution for Denmark'. In Brussels, officials from several member states expressed hopes that the plan could enable Denmark to ratify Maastricht. The treaty cannot come into force unless ratified by all 12 member countries. Success on the Danish front would in turn clear hurdles holding up other contentious issues, such as the future financing of the EC and the entry of new member countries. The proposals were announced after talks on Wednesday between Mr Schluter and Mr John Major, the prime minister, currently the Community president. There was, however, apparent disagreement over the crucial point of whether the Danish requirement for exemptions from monetary union, a future European army and EC citizenship would be 'legally binding'. One senior EC diplomat said in Brussels last night that the Danes were 'softening' this demand after other EC members spelt out the risks of Denmark torpedoing the Edinburgh summit. But Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said the British proposals would provide the legally binding guarantee Denmark was demanding for exemptions. Danish opposition politicians - who will have considerable say in deciding whether the deal is acceptable - also expressed reservations. Mr Bjorn Westh, market affairs spokesman for the opposition Social Democratic party, said: 'There is much that needs to be formulated otherwise and more satisfactorily.'</p>

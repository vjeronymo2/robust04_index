			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BT defends payment of chairman's bonus DESPITE a 36 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits, British Telecommunications announced on Thursday an unchanged 'performance-related' bonus of Pounds 90,000 for Mr Iain Vallance, its chairman, prompting questions about how the bonus was calculated. BT said bonuses are set by a remuneration committee chaired by Mr Paul Bosonnet, a non-executive director. The committee 'looks at a range of considerations reflecting operational as well as financial achievement against the targets that have been set'. The committee decided that last year 'saw a strong management performance, in particular delivering a good quality of service to customers while cutting costs'. Furthermore, 'the profit figures were affected by a number of special charges, particularly the cost of the redundancy programme'. BT's recent quality of service report showed standards maintained or improved in most areas. Its voluntary redundancy programme cost it Pounds 1.03bn over the year, and its profits had to bear a further Pounds 188m for the repurchase of government bonds and for losses on the sale of subsidiaries. Add that back in and pre-tax profits were 3.9 per cent up the previous year. On the other hand, turnover was 0.7 per cent down, volumes for inland calls were static, the company lost about 2 to 3 percentage points of market share. Job losses yielded an 8.1 per cent fall in gross staff costs so that without a single redundancy, profits would still have been sharply down. Executive pay, Page 8</p>

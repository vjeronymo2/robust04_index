The  officials included the director-general of the agency, Mr. Bappa  Jama'are, who was represented by Dr. Yusuf Dibal, Abdulkarim  Mohammed Bello, Steven Ogundayo and Hyeladzie Nganjiwa. The  others are Alhaji Abdullahi Yunusa, Y. Saleh, Bala Ibn Na'  allah, Olusegun Roland, Jacob Idowu, Y. Bayawo, Adamu Tukur, and  A. Audu.    At the trial of the officials today, the prosecutor told the  tribunal that Bappa Jama'are and his personal assistant, Jerry  Kumbisi, could not appear before the tribunal because they are  on an official tour abroad. The director of public prosecutions  in the Federal Ministry of Justice, Mrs. Wonu Folami, pleaded  for an adjournment of the trial of the NDLEA officials because  of the ministerial enquiry set up by the Justice Ministry to  look into the theft of the drug exhibits. However, the tribunal  chairman, Justice Oni-Okpaku, dismissed the application saying  the issue of the theft is of very high magnitude, the domestic  enquiry cannot be allowed to delay proceedings.    She also rejected another application by the DPP to grant  bail to the suspects. Justice Oni-Okpaku later released four of  the officials--Steven Ogundayo, Adamu Tukur, Alhaji Y. Saleh and  Hyeladzie Nganjiwa--who only accompanied the vehicle that  conveyed the burnt exhibit on Thursday. In another development,  the tribunal turned down an appeal by Joe Brown Akubueze asking  it to grant him one week more to enable him to secure the  services of a lawyer.</p>

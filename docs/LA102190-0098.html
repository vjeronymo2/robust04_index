			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> REDSKINS PREPARE FOR A TASTE OF 'DIRTY WATERS'  </P> <P> He once knocked out David Archer. He once leveled Jim Everett. And Monday  night, in full view of a national television audience, Andre Waters twice went  after the legs of Minnesota Vikings quarterback Rich Gannon.  </P> <P> Who is Andre Waters and why has the NFL suddenly drawn a bull's-eye on his  back?  </P> <P> Depending on who's doing the talking, he's either a very aggressive player with  an undeserved reputation or he's the dirtiest player in the NFL.  </P> <P> At the very least, he's a factor this week as the Washington Redskins prepare  for the Philadelphia Eagles to come to RFK Stadium on Sunday. The Eagles are  Randall Cunningham and Reggie White and Keith Jackson. ...  </P> <P> And while the Redskins have to prepare for the Pro Bowlers, they'll also spend  some time on the unpredictable strong safety, Mr. Waters.  </P> <P> "They don't call him 'Dirty Waters' for nothing," Cunningham said this week.  </P> <P> Waters is the guy who knocked the breath out of Washington quarterback Doug  Williams two years ago and he's the guy who NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue  said will be investigated for his hits against Gannon on "Monday Night  Football." He's the guy who spends about half his time warning other players  what he will do, or hearing players warn him about what they're about to do.  </P> <P> "You want me to talk about who?" Redskins tight end Don Warren said this week.  "No way."  </P> <P> Several other Redskins, including quarterback Stan Humphries, reacted the same  way. Coach Joe Gibbs said only, "You have to be prepared. The Eagles come at  you with everything but the kitchen sink."  </P> <P> One Redskin did talk. Defensive tackle Jumpy Geathers, who may be activated on  Sunday, points to a couple of long scars around his right knee, and said maybe  it wasn't Waters so much as the system.  </P> <P> Geathers's 1989 season with the New Orleans Saints ended in Week 15 when a hit  by Philadelphia guard Mike Schad tore his right knee apart. Geathers said he  thought his career was over, especially since he'd already undergone  reconstructive surgery on his left knee two years earlier.  </P> <P> When the Saints left him unprotected in the Plan B free-agency system, he said  he was told: "Don't worry, you won't get any offers."  </P> <P> He was stunned to get about 10 and narrowed his choices to the Redskins and  49ers, finally picking Washington for its three-year, $1.5 million offer. But  his recovery has been slow.  </P> <P> On his final play of 1989, Geathers said, he dived for a loose ball and Schad  dived for him.  </P> <P> "He cheap-shotted me," Geathers said. "There's a lot of guys (on the Eagles)  that do cheap shots."  </P> <P> Geathers said Schad "was definitely trying to get me out of the game because I  was having a good game already. He couldn't handle me so he was definitely  trying to get me out of the game. I was going for the ball. You can't see  behind your back. I'm going to have a bad knee the rest of my life, but the  other guy didn't think that way."  </P> <P> Asked about getting revenge if he's activated, Geathers said: "He's on offense  so he's got an advantage on me. I'm just going to play my game. You start  holding a grudge and you get out of your game plan. You're not out there to get  a guy back."  </P> <P> Geathers, asked about Waters, shrugged. "They outlaw steroids -- they ought to  outlaw guys trying to end somebody's career," he said. "You can't end  somebody's career just to win the game. (Schad) limited my career in the NFL  and took money out of my pocket. You've got guys who are really good athletes  who respect each other and don't try to come down to hurt you, but then you've  got guys who have no feeling for anybody and they get a name other ways."  </P> <P> The Eagles defend their man and their style of play. Coach Buddy Ryan said he  watched tapes of the two plays against Gannon and thought the plays looked okay  to him.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a clean deal," he said. "He's had a reputation since I've  been here of being a dirty ballplayer. He's not. He's a good kid, an aggressive  kid. He plays the game all the way. He got the reputation in '86 when he'd  chase people out of bounds. He's cleaned up his act since then. He was killing  us before."  </P> <P> Cunningham said that teams preparing for the Eagles had better prepare for  Waters. "He's a hardcore player," he said. "If you go through there  lollygagging, he's going to give you a shot. What he does is legal. He goes 100  percent. He throws his whole body at you."  </P> <P> Cunningham said Waters and Redskins safety Alvin Walton are similar players.  </P> <P> "I think he and Walton are basically the same style players," he said. "Neither  one of them are dirty players. They just go in there and try to knock you out.  They're two tough players. You've got to respect them for their ability. When  you see them, you better slide and prepare to get hit anyway.  </P> <P> "If you want to run out of bounds because you think you're not going to get  hit, you better get out of bounds faster."  </P> <P> Walton refused to join the debate, saying he had enough to worry about without  defending himself.  </P> <P> The subject of Waters and late hits isn't new to the Redskins. In the first  game of 1987 he ran into kicker Jess Atkinson and broke his ankle. In the  second meeting that season Waters punched Williams in the stomach. Then before  the two teams played several weeks later, Mark Rypien, by then elevated to the  starting job, called Waters a cheap-shot artist.  </P> <P> Ironically, Williams came off the bench to win that game. The subject came up  again last season when Williams started the second game against the Eagles and  helped the Redskins to a 10-3 victory.  </P> <P> "You prepare for them like anyone else," guard Russ Grimm said Sunday when  asked about Waters and the Eagles. "They've got certain things they do and  basically you have to be prepared to block everyone in this league. You can't  prepare for some guy to hit you late, but you're aware of it."  </P></p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Taking steps to lure shoppers Designers and operators of shopping centres need to respond to the leisure interests of their customers if they want to retain business, the Institute of Geographers Conference in Swansea was told. Shoppers are bored with the 'functional' aspects of shopping and feel that the pleasure element has been stripped out of it, Mr Peter Newby of Middlesex Polytechnic said. A survey of 24 shopping centres opened since 1988 found that all were offering some form of entertainment in order to create a 'circus in the mall'. Nearly 90 per cent offered live music and 72 per cent variety acts. Mr Newby said Sunday trading provided special opportunities for centres to create leisure activities and a 'carnival atmosphere'. Centre managers needed to plan annual entertainment strategies and be given training in how to provide entertainment, he said.</p>

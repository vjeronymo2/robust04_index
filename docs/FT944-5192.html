			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Labour reform plans for royal family prompt Tory outrage Labour is drawing up a comprehensive constitutional reform package that would cut the cost of the royal family and prevent ministers from using the antiquated rules of crown privilege to bypass parliament. The proposals prompted outrage from senior ministers, many of whom believe the Conservatives would win a general election fought on constitutional issues such as the role of the monarchy and the UK's place in Europe. Labour's proposals, which will be given a preliminary airing tonight in a BBC Panorama documentary on the monarchy, are being drawn up by a Commission on Democracy that will report to the party's 1995 conference. Initial attention is likely to focus on Labour's proposals for a big reduction in the number of royals carrying out official functions, heralding a smaller monarchy along Scandinavian lines. However, the commission is also considering fundamental changes to the sovereign's residual executive powers, most of which are in practice exercised by ministers. The powers include appointment of officials without reference to parliament, making foreign treaties and binding regulations by executive order, and exempting government activities from the law. The democracy commission is also considering the practical implications of Labour's plans to abolish the right of hereditary peers to vote in the House of Lords, and to set up assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the English regions. It will also confirm Labour's plans for fixed parliaments and propose a new bill of rights. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, accused Labour leaders of 'trying to placate their leftwing activists with constitutional reform - downgrading the monarchy, splitting up the UK, subordinating Britain in Europe.' However, Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, said Labour was contributing to a national debate prompted by public disgust at the government's failure to uphold high standards of public behaviour.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP study shows energy demand still growing Worldwide demand for energy continues to rise outside the former Soviet Union, with little evidence of any gains in energy efficiency, according to the latest edition of British Petroleum's Statistical Review of World Energy. Total primary energy consumption outside the FSU grew by 2.1 per cent in 1993, the same as 1992, but below the 1983-93 trend rate of 2.5 per cent. Mr Peter Davies, BP's chief economist, attributed the overall decline to the effects of recession in Europe and Japan. Energy consumption growth in North America of 2.3 per cent and 4.2 per cent in the less developed countries was close to the long-term trend rate. Declines in energy intensity, which measures the ratio of energy consumption to real GDP growth, have been 'rather disappointing', Mr Davies said. 'LDCs in particular find that development and consumer income growth inevitably results in comparable rises in energy consumption.' The 0.2 per cent overall rise in world consumption last year reflected the collapse of demand in Russia and other former Soviet republics. Mr Davies said the pace of contraction in the world's second largest energy market had '. . . become truly unprecedented in peacetime'. Primary energy consumption in the FSU fell by 9.7 per cent last year. Oil bore the brunt of the reductions, and production delined for the seventh consecutive year. Total FSU production has fallen 40 per cent, or 5m barrels a day since its peak in 1987. But net exports of Russian oil rose last year for the first time since 1989 as supplies were diverted from FSU to hard currency markets. The growth of Russian and other non-Opec oil exports was one of the factors behind recent oil price weakness. Mr Davies said last year's surge in non-Opec output was 'exceptional'. Even so demand for Opec oil continued to grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years. World oil demand outside the FSU rose by 1.4 per cent last year. China's booming economy boosted oil consumption growth to more than 11 per cent, and the country became a net oil importer for the first time since the early 1970s. Mr Davies said China could be importing 1m barrels a day by 2000. The report found that the balance between fuels was relatively stable. Natural gas consumption outside the FSU grew by 4.6 per cent. Gas gained market share in all regions. UK consumption grew by 15.2 per cent in 1993, as new gas-fired power stations began production. The UK is now the largest west European gas market, and the world's fifth largest. Coal consumption fell for the fourth consecutive year, with the declines concentrated in the FSU and western Europe. Coal use grew in the US (4 per cent) and China (2.7 per cent), the two biggest consuming countries. Consumption of nuclear and hydroelectric power grew by 3 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Curragh's troubles bode ill for Yukon mining HOPES FOR the revival in the near future of lead and zinc mining in Canada's Yukon territory have faded with the collapse of Curragh, the Toronto-based base metals producer. An Ontario court this week appointed Deloitte Touche as interim receivers for Curragh's Faro and Sa Dena Hes mines in the Yukon, after the beleaguered company failed to find an outside investor willing to inject fresh equity. Curragh is continuing its search for a backer. Its chairman, Mr Clifford Frame, has recently been in Europe meeting prospective partners. Rumours in Toronto suggest that he has had discussions with, among others, the Kuwaiti government. Talks earlier fell through with two Korean companies that had bid for a a 50 per cent stake. Low zinc prices and Curragh's financial problems forced the closure of the Faro mine last April. Faro's output totalled 66.7m lb of zinc and 51.2m lb of lead in the first three months of this year. Sa Dena Hes, which is close to the Yukon-British Columbia border, has been shut since last December. Curragh's problems have also stalled development of the new Grum pit at Faro. The company had been seeking CDollars 29m (Pounds 14.5m) from the Yukon government to complete the pit. A Yukon government official said, however, that the authorities 'are not going to pump more money into the mine just to reopen it'. The two mines are the cornerstone of the Yukon economy, employing over 1,300 people at their peak, and supporting many of the territory's small businesses. A spokesman for Curragh's unsecured creditors said that the long-term outlook for the mines was 'fairly reasonable', depending on zinc prices  - Faro needs a zinc price of about 50 cents a lb to break even, 25 per cent above the prevailing market level.</p>

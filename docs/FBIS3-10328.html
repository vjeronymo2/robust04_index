			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Connie Ochoa Gomez] </F>   [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 28 February -- Jaime Serra  Puche, secretary of commerce and industrial development, has  said the foreign investment law implemented in January 1994  makes Mexico competitive enough to attract savings from abroad  to complement national savings, therefore "there will be no  further modifications to the law."    Serra Puche stressed that the federal government does not  plan to adjust the laws to NAFTA as the modifications needed to  make the country more competitive "have already been made."    In an exclusive interview for EL FINANCIERO, Serra Puche  said  the Mexican Government is studying the possibility of signing  bilateral agreements to protect the investments of countries  with the largest amount of foreign investment in our country; in  other words, Europe and Japan.    This does not mean that Mexico will not offer legal  guarantees to countries other than the United States and Canada,  with whom we signed a trade agreement, that wish to participate  in the Mexican market. Proof of this is that in 1993 we  received foreign capital totaling $15.6 billion, which means  that among developing countries, Mexico receives the largest  amount of foreign investment in the world.    Even the sad incidents in southeastern Mexico have not  reduced investors' confidence in Mexico. Foreign investment  reached $2.370 billion in January, a sum equivalent to what the  country received "for an entire year" six years ago. In other  words, all indications are that Mexico is highly competitive and  that investors view us as a nation with great possibilities for  growth and stability.    Serra Puche stressed that NAFTA represents a region open to  trade, which is confirmed by the fact that Mexico proposed the  clause giving other countries access to the treaty.    He said the government is studying the possibility of  signing  bilateral agreements to protect foreign investment, giving  priority to Europe and Japan, but a final decision has not been  reached.    European trade representatives have noted the importance of  Mexico's signing bilateral agreements to protect investments,  particularly the establishment of impartial judges who can  guarantee the resolution of controversies between foreign  companies and the Mexican Government as established in NAFTA.  In that manner, other countries would have the same privileges  as Canada and the United States when investing in the Mexican  market.    Serra Puche reiterated that "we are not planning to make  additional changes" to Mexican laws, even though some exporters  claim that national laws "fall short" of covering the scope of  the trilateral agreement.    In the specific case of the Intellectual Property Law, for  which "changes are not being contemplated, either," Serra Puche  stressed that Mexico's regulations to protect intellectual  property are already internationally recognized as their legal  and institutional framework has been modernized; therefore, no  further adjustments are warranted.    During the interview conducted near the Miguel Hidalgo  Airport in Guadalajara, Serra Puche categorically said that  Mexican exports "today are under conditions equal" to similar  products in the United States and Canada, as great efforts have  been made to improve quality to raise their competitive level.    The export sector, however, has persistently demanded that  the Mexican Government give specific support to Mexican  enterprises so they can compensate for the existing differences  between Mexico and its main commercial partners.    In that regard, Serra Puche said that NAFTA "does not permit  the application of subsidies to exports."</p>

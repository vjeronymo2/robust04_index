			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling effort required If we are to believe the City consensus, the greatest threat to financial markets in this election comes from a hung parliament. The polls released on Tuesday were the first to predict an absolute majority for any single party, albeit Labour. So it is curious they should have produced such an attack of nerves in equity and gilt markets yesterday. All the more so, since sterling fell only half a pfennig. The foreign exchange markets were hardly displaying alarm at the prospect of a majority Labour government committed to the ERM. That in turn should reduce the threat of a post-election increase in base rates. Of course, things are never as simple as they seem. Last night's Gallup poll had a different message. The outcome may still be a hung parliament after all. The exchange markets are treading water ahead of tomorrow's US unemployment figures and may have deferred judgment on the election. But a feature of trading was reluctance to sell the UK currency after its initial fall. Though sterling was held up by higher money rates, higher base rates are by no means automatic. That would only become inevitable if the market distrusted Mr John Smith enough actually to drive sterling through its D-Mark floor. On balance after yesterday, it looks as though there is enough faith in his ERM commitment to make that a risky course even for the hardiest speculator. The prospect of a maintained parity and stable interest rates ought to be some consolation to both equities and gilts. Indeed, with receding devaluation risk, the 10-year gilt starts to look attractive even against a backdrop of rising government borrowing. The yield is more than two percentage points above its German equivalent. It is different for equities. Political uncertainty is compounded by worries over Japan, not to mention the property and banking sector. After their 11 per cent fall since last Friday, Barclays Bank shares now yield nearly as much as gilts. That would make them cheap if there were signs of an end to the property woes which are playing havoc with its loan book. Unfortunately this is all the more unlikely given the deflationary pressure of ERM membership. That would limit the upside for shares even in the increasingly unlikely event of a Tory victory. It will be compounded in Labour's case by short-term shock to the economy as consumer wealth is redistributed away from the south-east. Mr Smith will need firm credentials from the gilts market. A weak economy may make him a bigger-spending customer than he has yet let on.</p>

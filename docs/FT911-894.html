			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Danish tunnel in trouble CONSTRUCTION of a 7.7km rail tunnel under the Great Belt, the main waterway into the Baltic Sea, has become a nightmare for MT Group, the international consortium constructing the tunnel. The tunnel is now 13 months behind schedule, all work is at a standstill, and the state-owned company which has commissioned the tunnel has issued barely concealed warnings that changes will be made in the consortium if work does not progress more smoothly. James Howden, the Glasgow group which delivered the four tunnel-boring machines, also built the machines which have nearly completed the work of boring the Channel Tunnel. The rail tunnel under the eastern half of the Great Belt is one part of a three-part DKr19bn (Pounds 1.68bn) project to build a rail and road link across the 14km belt to link Sjaelland, the large island on which Copenhagen is sited, with the Jutland peninsula. A road and rail bridge across the western half of the belt to the tiny island of Sprogo in mid-belt will link up with the rail tunnel and a motorway bridge across the eastern half. MT Group is led by Monberg and Thorsen, a Danish company, and includes Campenon Bernard, France, Dyckerhoff and Widmann of Germany, Kiewit Construction of the US, and Sogea of France. A six-month delay in the delivery of the machines was the first setback for MT Group. Since the first machine was started up last August, there have been endless problems getting them to work properly. On Tuesday this week, all four machines were halted for repair work and the personnel working on the tunnel have been laid off. So far, the machines have tunnelled 840 metres. According to the schedule, they should have tunnelled 2,400 metres by now. MT Group has until May 17 to say when tunnelling can restart and when the tunnel will be completed.</p>

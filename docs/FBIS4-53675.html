			<p>BFN     [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, May 22 KYODO -- State Minister  Moriyoshi Sato on Sunday [22 May] opposed a Russian proposal  that Japanese fishing ships be allowed to operate in waters off  four Russian-occupied islands claimed by Japan provided they pay  fishing charges.    "As the Northern Territories are Japan's inherent territory  (Japan) should not authorize any Russian intervention, including  joint fishing ventures," said Sato, who is director general of  the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agencies.    Nikolai Pokidin, head of the South Kurils Administration,  earlier this year proposed that both sides strike a commercial  deal on fishing in the area.    But Tokyo has rejected the proposal out of concern that such  a step could be taken as an indirect recognition of Russian  sovereignty over the territory.    Sato visited the city of Nemuro on the eastern tip of  Hokkaido to view the Russian-held islands from Nosappu Point.    Japan has long demanded the return of Kunashiri, Etorofu,  Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets, known in Japan as the  Northern Territories, which were seized by the Soviet Union at  the end of World War II.    Russia has voiced protest over hundreds of border violations  by Japanese fishing boats in the area over the last year.</p>

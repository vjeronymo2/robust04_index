			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Foreign banks 'started India scam' AN INDIAN parliamentary committee yesterday blamed foreign banks operating in India for initiating the Rs50bn (Pounds 1.1bn) Bombay financial scandal and suggested in a draft report that all banks in the country, Indian and foreign, be brought under strict parliamentary control. The joint parliamentary committee set up last year to investigate the stock market scandal said in its second draft report: 'Foreign banks have been initiators of the scam as well as major players. With their tremendous resources, their clout, their aggressive posture and posturing, they can, if they choose, play havoc with the economy.' The report came down heavily on the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, for not putting in place a system of inspection for financial institutions. 'Deregularisation and liberalisation without effective checks and balances would be an unmitigated disaster.' The Finance Ministry had also failed to 'exercise much closer supervision of the entire securities and banking transactions' of all banks, and was accused of 'not monitoring the stock exchanges, or undertaking formal assessments of alleged irregularities in the stock markets, despite being the sole authority responsible for this'. Three government employees were badly hurt when militants fired a rocket yesterday at the civil secretariat building, seat of the Jammu and Kashmir government, in Srinagar. A pro-Pakistani militant group, Operation Balakote, telephoned a local newspaper office claiming responsibility for the attack, minutes after the rocket pierced through the second-floor office of Mr R K Sayeed, an adviser to the Jammu and Kashmir governor, injuring his staff.</p>

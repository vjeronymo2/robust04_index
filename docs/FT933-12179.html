			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (2): Anxiety over risk of floods - The opposition: Anthony Moreton tells how concessions were secured A LONG battle has taken place to prevent the barrage being built, a campaign which came near to succeeding. Opponents, though few in number, fought the hybrid bill necessary to sanction the barrage tenaciously through both houses of parliament almost line by line and caused considerable delays to its implementation. Such a parliamentary measure has been necessary because navigational and other water rights were involved, as well as others involving different government departments and local authorities. Private bills can only be introduced into parliament on one day in the year, late in November, and if there are too many of them on the same day some are lost and have to wait a further year to be represented. The barrage bill did not fail on this count, but it was soon evident that a number of people, both in Cardiff itself and elsewhere in Wales, were opposed to the scheme. Most of them owned houses alongside the Taff, the city's main river, and feared the lagoon created by the barrage would affect the water table and cause flooding when abnormal amounts of water came down from the mountains of upper south Wales. Even without the barrage impounding water, they had suffered from flooding several times in the recent past. It was claimed that as many as 12,000 houses could be affected by any rise in groundwater levels. There were also environmental issues. Several rare breeds of birdlife, especially dunlin, redshank, curlews and shelduck use the bay, which is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), as feeding grounds. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds became concerned and joined the opponents. The numbers of these birds are not large - no one put the figure above 50,000 - but they caused problems out of proportion to their numbers. There were, too, other environmental issues which brought Friends of the Earth into the fray. As recently as last February, it was saying that if the barrage were to be built there could be water pollution problems leading to growth of poisonous blue-green algae, proliferation of midges and creation of an environment leading to the potential for spread of leptospire bacteria. 'The people of Cardiff do not want the problems of damp, midges, algae or Weil's disease,' they argued. They also urged that SSSIs, such as Cardiff Bay, needed to be extended, not reduced. These fears prompted a small group of Labour MPs, headed by Rhodri Morgan (Cardiff West), to mount a highly effective sniping campaign during the passage of the bill. Mr Morgan's constituency does not actually cover the bay itself - it is an irony that his Labour colleague Alun Michael (Cardiff South and Penarth), who does represent the bay, has all along been a strong supporter of the scheme - but, as many of the complainants worried about water-table levels do live in his constituency, he had good grounds to lead the opposition. He was backed by a few other Labour MPs, and by Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, which advocated that any government money spent on projects in Wales should be shared geographically across the country rather than concentrated in Cardiff. The opponents secured a series of concessions. In the spring of 1990 they persuaded a Commons select committee to pass the bill back to the Welsh Secretary on a technicality, a move that probably added at least a year to the bill's passage. Almost exactly a year later, Mr Morgan and his supporters won their greatest parliamentary triumph by talking the bill out in the Commons following an all-night sitting lasting 13 hours. The private bill was dropped and the government picked up the measure and began the long journey to royal assent all over again. That success, in April 1991, is the last main victory to fall the way of the opponents. They have won important concessions along the way since then, but the bill is now expected to receive royal assent either before parliament rises for the summer or immediately the session resumes in the autumn.</p>

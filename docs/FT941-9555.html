			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Shift in sentiment under way - New York After a weekend blizzard, the snow is piled high on Wall Street, but anxiety is close to the surface. Analysts say any surprising political or economic development could trip up the stocks this week and send share prices tumbling again. The risk is great, according to Ms Gail Dudack, an analyst at SG Warburg in New York, because the market has grown so complacent. For investors accustomed to bullish news, the only true surprises are negative ones. In such an atmosphere, panic selling is easily triggered. For this reason, Ms Dudack sees the Dow industrial falling to 3,600 in the coming weeks, or about 10 per cent, from January 31's peak of 3,978.36. 'Underlying most stock market corrections is a shift in investor sentiment from confidence to fear,' she says. 'Ironically, investors often feel most comfortable at a point at which trends are about to change.' She argues the events of the past fortnight leave little doubt that such a shift is under way. The turning point was the 96-point battering two weeks ago, set off by the Federal Reserve's tightening the Fed Funds rate to 3.25 per cent. The plunge may have rattled investors, but did not drain their confidence. When equities regained their stride early last week, there were sighs of relief from Wall Street. But the balloon, hastily reflated, was quickly burst. The trigger was Thursday's appearance by Ms Elaine Garzarelli, a respected Lehman Brothers analyst, on CNBC, a business news cable television. In mid-morning she reiterated her view that a 4 - 7 per cent market correction would be 'normal' in the circumstances. Within half an hour, edginess in the market had turned into a minor rout, with the Dow losing about 20 points. Even though the bellwether Dow index finished 23 points ahead on the week, 'the vulnerability of the market is not going away', warned Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. 'We may try to trade a little higher (today) but I expect the market to fall.' He points out that the Dow utility average, which often presages downturns in the broader market and parallels trends in interest rates, hit a 52-week low last Thursday. 'If people choose to focus on that, it could be bad for bonds as well as stocks.' In addition, there are several potential triggers lurking on the political and economic calendar. Investors could well react unfavourably to the weekend talks between President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokowa, the Japanese prime minister. After last Friday's tame producer price data, the financial markets are looking for the same in Thursday's consumer price report. The Commerce Department's data on capacity utilisation - a keenly watched indicator of inflationary pressure in the economy - may pose an obstacle as well. Sharp rises in either figure would raise fears about the Fed bringing forward a second rate increase.</p>

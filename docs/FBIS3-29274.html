			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  semiconductor industry began this year with an unprecendented  increase in exports, the Korean Semiconductor Industry  Association and other business sources said on Tuesday. Global  demand for semiconductors continued to rise early this year and  exports of South Korean semiconductors soared last month.  Exports are expected to increase further in the second half of  this year when full-fledged exports of 16 mega DRAMs [dynamic  random access memory] begin.    Samsung Electronics Co. exported 248 million U.S. dollars  worth of semiconductors in January, up 82.3 percent from a year  ago. The figure marks Samsung's biggest export rate increase on  a monthly comparison basis since 1990.    Semiconductor exports by Goldstar Electron Co. increased  48.6  percent from 74 million dollars in January last year to 110  million dollars last month.    Hyundai Electronic Co., which produces semiconductors mainly  by assembling parts on already designed wafers, expanded its  integrated processing production system which includes design,  wafer processing and assembly this year to increase the added  value of its exports. Hyundai exported 83 million dollars worth  of semiconductors in January this year, up 73 percent from 48  million dollars a year earlier. Hyundai's proportion of  integrated processing exports to exports of assembled  semiconductors was one to two last year, but last month the  proportion changed to three to one.    Anam Electronics Co., which assembles only semiconductors,  exported 155 million dollars worth last month, up 35.6 percent  from the same month last year.    Korean semiconductor makers plan to invest three trillion  won  (about 3.7 billion U.S. dollars) in facility investment this  year.    A business source said, "demand for 4 mega-DRAMs will soar  to  the peak this year, and demand for 16 mega-DRAMs will begin to  increase rapidly from the second half of this year. South  Korea's semiconductor exports are thus expected to easily  surpass 10 billion dollars this year."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> III. Listing of Acceptable Substitutes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This section presents EPA's most recent acceptable listing decisions for class I substitutes in the following industrial sectors: refrigerants and air conditioning, foam blowing, solvent cleaning, fire suppression and explosion protection; sterilants; aerosols; adhesives, coatings and inks. These decisions represent substitutes not previously reviewed in the final rulemaking for SNAP (59 FR 13044; March 18, 1994) and, consequently, add to the lists of acceptable substitutes under SNAP. For copies of the full list, contact the EPA Stratospheric Protection Hotline at the number listed in Section V of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parts A through H below present a detailed discussion of the substitute listing determinations by major use sector. Tables summarizing listing decisions in this notice are in Appendix A. The comments contained in Appendix A provide additional information on a substitute, but like the listings themselves, are not regulatory in nature, and thus they are not mandatory for use of a substitute. Nor should the comments be considered comprehensive with respect to other legal obligations pertaining to the use of the substitute. However, EPA encourages users of acceptable substitutes to apply all comments to their use of these substitutes. In many instances, the comments simply allude to sound operating practices that have already been identified in existing industry and/or building-code standards. Thus, many of the comments, if adopted, would not require significant changes in existing operating practices for the affected industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the final rule for the SNAP program, EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are required to list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove any prior license to use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding substances to the list of acceptable alternatives without first requesting comment on new listings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA, however, does believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any alternative on the list of prohibited substitutes, to list a substitute as acceptable only under use restrictions, or to remove a substitute from either the list of prohibited or acceptable substitutes. Updates to these lists are published as separate notices of rulemaking in the Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> D. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses of class I and class II substances to produce cooling, including mechanical and non-mechanical refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat transfer. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a more detailed description of this sector. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into the following end-uses: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Commercial comfort air conditioning; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Industrial process refrigeration systems; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Industrial process air conditioning; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ice skating rinks; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Uranium isotope separation processing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cole storage warehouses; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Refrigerated transport; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Retail food refrigeration; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vending machines; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water coolers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Commercial ice machines; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Household refrigerators; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Household freezers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Residential dehumidifiers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Motor vehicle air conditioning; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Residential air conditioning and heat pumps; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Non-mechanical heat transfer; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Very low temperature refrigeration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> In addition, each end-use is divided into retrofit and new equipment applications. EPA has not necessarily reviewed substitutes in every end-use for this Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA has modified the list of end-uses for this sector for this SNAP update. First, EPA has changed the name of the heat transfer end-use to non-mechanical heat transfer. This change is intended to avoid confusion between systems that move heat from a cool area to a warm one (mechanical refrigeration) and systems that simply aid the movement of heat away from warm areas (non-mechanical heat transfer). The second change is that EPA added a new end-use, very low temperature refrigeration. Substitutes for this end-use have been reviewed since the final rule, and therefore have been added for this SNAP update. Finally, EPA has also reviewed substitutes for CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 industrial process refrigeration. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a detailed description of end-uses other than these three. EPA may continue to add other end-uses in future SNAP updates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Non-mechanical Heat Transfer. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed above, this end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on a fluid to remove heat from a heat source to a cooler area, rather than relying on mechanical refrigeration to move heat from a cool area to a warm one. Generally, there are two types of systems: systems with fluid pumps, referred to as recirculating coolers, and those that rely on natural convection currents, known as thermosyphons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Very Low Temperature Refrigeration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Medical freezers, freeze-dryers, and other small appliances require extremely reliable refrigeration cycles. These systems must meet stringent technical standards that do not normally apply to refrigeration systems. They usually have very small charges. Because they operate at very high vapor pressures, and because performance is critically affected by any charge loss, standard maintenance for these systems tends to reduce leakage to a level considerably below that for other types of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (23): The politics of subsidiarity SUBSIDIARITY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY by Andrew Duff (editor) Federal Trust, Pounds 17.95 135 pages TX;For subsidiarity read federalism. They are the same thing: the principle of separating constitutional authority between different territorial tiers of government. We are lumbered with subsidiarity because Britain's Tories cannot abide the 'f' word. And because Jacques Delors, ever shrewd, seized on a term which not only avoided the word 'federalism', but appeared to denote a more sophisticated concept. In reality, subsidiarity's sole concern is the balance of power between the European Union and its 12 nation states. The Union is already a federation, albeit an unusually weak one. It has a constitution, an executive, a bureaucracy, a judicial power, and a legislative power (divided, confusingly, between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers). Yet there is nothing sophisticated about the way subsidiarity regulates the balance between the Union and the States. The Treaty of Maastricht says, simply, that Union intervention is 'in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity' if its objectives 'cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states', so long as they can nonetheless be achieved by the Union 'by reason of the scale or the effects'. Which means precisely what the beholder wants it to mean. 'Sufficiently' and 'scale or effects' are not defined; while the potential fields of Union action laid out Maastricht are broad and largely unfenced by anything except subsidiarity. As Andrew Duff puts it in his introductory chapter to the Federal Trust's excellent symposium on the subject: 'subsidiarity means that important powers - for example citizenship, the internal market, external trade, competition policy, the protection of the environment, the control of money, and, ultimately, defence policy - can be logically transferred to a federal government at the European level'. In other words subsidiarity is a political, not an objective, principle. It allows Europe's politicians to organise the relationship between the Union's upper tiers of government as they think necessary, provided they can secure a minimal level of public support for their arrangements - which is all they ever got to push through Maastricht. Two centuries hence, Maastricht's Article 3b might be regarded as the all-purpose instrument for extending the authority of the Union, much as the 'inter-state commerce' clause was for the development of the federal tier of US government. So, far from being closed by Maastricht, the debate about subsidiarity has barely begun. It will be invoked every time the future of the EU comes up; and by enshrining a flexible definition of federalism in the European Constitution, it is likely to make it relatively easy for the Union to adapt to changing agendas. Whatever lies in the distant future, a United States of Europe is not around the corner. In any political system, the paymaster is king: at Pounds 55bn, this year's European budget would barely foot Britain's social security bill. Nonetheless, there is legitimate concern, largely unreflected in this volume, about subsidiarity as a constitutional principle. The problem is that it is at once too vague, while offering the pretence of an objective formula for a process - the allocation of powers between different tiers of government - that is essentially subjective. Any formulation intended at the outset to mean all things to all people is a poor principle to guide a constitution. With a fair wind, it may work. But constitutions should be designed for the storm, not the calm. Most of the contributors to this volume too glibly assume that federalism is a superior system for a democratic Europe than a patchwork of independent states. Alas, history is more ambiguous. For every federation that has succeeded, there is one that has failed (Czechoslovakia), one where a sense of common identity has weakened (Canada), and one which has only been sustained by civil war (the US). If the EU is to survive, it will not be at the hands of constitutional witch doctors peddling subsidiarity.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Nordic EU campaign boosted The Swedish Social Democratic party's general election victory may prove to be a turning point in the successive referendums for Finland, Sweden and then Norway to join the European Union. The Social Democrats are believed to hold the key to a Yes vote in Sweden because to date more than half their supporters have been shown by opinion polls to be against membership. Now in government, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the party's leader, will seek to persuade his voters that EU membership is a way to advance social democratic policies, particularly the fight against unemployment. The electorates in each country are closely following opinion in the other two, reflecting a widespread desire that that the three should stay in step. Therefore, the election of a Social Democratic government in Stockholm has long been seen as a virtual pre-condition for a Yes vote in Sweden and could help stiffen the Yes side ahead of the vote in Finland and, if Finland and Sweden vote to join, in turn influence Norway's sceptical electorate. Finland will vote first, on October 16, followed by Sweden on November 13 and Norway on November 28 on whether to accept agreements already negotiated with the EU on terms for membership. A Yes vote would mean the three will join Austria as new members from January 1 next year, expanding the EU from 12 to 16 members. But the outlook for the three referendums is still far from clear. In Finland, considered the likeliest of the three countries to vote in favour of membership, opinion polls have recently shown strong gains for the No campaign, with the lead held by the Yes camp narrowing to as little as two percentage points. In Sweden, the signals are mixed. After two years in which the No side has held a steady lead, two recent polls, including one held among voters on election day, have shown a majority in favour. The election-day poll suggested that 51.8 per cent of voters were in favour of joining the EU and 45.5 per cent against. But another poll published yesterday showed the No campaign widening its lead slightly over the past month to 52 per cent, against 48 per cent in favour. The Social Democratic party deliberately avoided making EU membership an election issue for fear of alienating voters who identify the EU with Mr Carl Bildt, the strongly pro-Europe leader of the outgoing right-centre coalition. The election delivered the No side an important boost through increased representation of the former communist Left Party and the return to parliament of the Environment party - both are strongly anti-EU. All the polls in Norway suggest that the Yes campaign has almost no chance of succeeding unless Finland and Sweden vote to join first in their referendums. If they do, the indications are that Norway may also follow its neighbours into the Union.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLIE SENT 475 MILES TO BE SPAYED  </P> <P> Millie the presidential spaniel made a brief and secret visit to a veterinarian  to be spayed, it was reported Friday.  </P> <P> Millie, troubled by false pregnancies, was sent from the White House to the  clinic of a Columbia veterinarian for the surgery about two weeks ago,  television station WIS-TV said.  </P> <P> The White House did not want to put Millie's difficulties in the media  spotlight, so her Army veterinarian drove about 475 miles to Dr. Randy  Basinger's clinic, the station reported.  </P> <P> The English springer spaniel reportedly was kept overnight and driven back to  Washington the next day.  </P> <P> Basinger declined to be interviewed by the station and said the White House had  asked him not to talk about Millie, the mother of one litter of puppies.  </P> <P> Anna Perez, a White House spokeswoman, told the station, "She was spayed. This  is a private matter . . . and a family matter. They don't want to talk about  it."  </P> <P> The White House said Millie was not spayed at taxpayer expense, the station  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Milan Babic, foreign  minister of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], conveyed to  Geert Ahrens, deputy cochairman of the Conference on the Former  Yugoslavia, the Serb side's readiness to continue negotiations  on the normalization of relations between the RSK and Croatia.    Babic said that the RSK proposed Turanj or Geneva as a site  for the negotiations. We believe that it is necessary to  conduct negotiations in a place that is not beset by political  tensions, so we suggest Turanj, a place under the control of the  UN peace force in the buffer zone where peace has already been  restored, Babic said in a statement to Politika TV.    He stressed that Turanj is accessible to both  representatives  of the RSK and the Croatian Government -- something that is an  extra advantage given the fact that at this stage of  negotiations frequent meetings of technical and expert groups  would be needed.    Babic also says that the Serb side was today presented with  a  document by the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, headlined  "The Program of Economic Affairs," although it was not discussed  since today's meeting was by and large focused on the question  of when and where these negotiations were going to take place.    Following the meeting Ahrens said that the atmosphere at the  talks with the RSK foreign minister was excellent and that the  talks would resume next week.    Ahrens added that the Croatian side was also completely  ready  to resume negotiations and that some minor details had yet to be  decided upon prior to the second phase of negotiations.</p>

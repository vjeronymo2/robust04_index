			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Travel: Unprepared for the shock of the mighty Parana - Tom Fort explores a thundering river in the Brazilian rainforest and hears tales of things curious and inexplicable Seen from above, the great river wound in easy curves through the dull green of the forest - like an anaconda, I thought, wishing vainly that a more startling metaphor would come to mind. It was terracotta in colour, thick with the red earth washed down by the rains 1,000 miles to the east. The aircraft wheeled, and the river burst into foam over the fabled Falls of Iguacu. Several Germans, bristling with cameras, rushed to the windows to obtain views. My own was blotted out by a backside in green stretch pants. Alas, poor Niagara, Mrs Roosevelt sighed when she saw the Iguacu falls. And they are an astounding sight, curving in a tumultuous bow from the Brazilian to the Argentine banks of the River Iguacu. The cataracts - nearly 300 of them - extend over two miles, broken by islands and outcrops. The grandest, part-obscured by the plume of spray drifting skywards to form an ever-present cloud, is tight against Brazilian soil. As if resentful of this, the Argentines have built a squat, modernistic intruder of a hotel below the falls. Brazil's elegant answer is the Hotel das Cataratas, a splendid confection in pink and white, like a wedding cake deposited in the sombre green of the forest. It is a comfortable place, thronged by a stream of tourists as constant as the thunder of the waterfalls. We were there for five days, which almost qualified us as residents. Our purpose was to explore another river, into which the Iguacu debouches 15 miles downstream. This is the mighty Parana, which rises in central Brazil and flows 2,000 miles until it joins the Uruguay in the estuary of the River Plate, in Argentina. This information I had from books. But nothing could have prepared me for the shock as I stood beside the Parana for the first time. I was silent as I looked across to Paraguay on the far side, half a mile or so away. Between me and a country about which I knew little beyond the reputation of General Stroessner, extended a brown, surging flood, marbled with competing currents, boiling with terrifying whirlpools. Had someone told me that its volume exceeded that of all the rivers of Britain put together - or of Europe - I should not have been surprised, for in places the Parana plunges to a depth of 600ft, and the water travels at a terrific speed - the pace of a galloping horse would be near the mark. The base for our operations was the whimsically-named Iate (Yacht) Club das Cataratas. In idle periods when the fish were not biting - yes, I was there to fish, and yes, there were many such periods - we would discuss with our host, Edward, how he might stage the inaugural Iate Club regatta, a prospect complicated by the certainty that any iate launched into the Parana would be washed up in Argentina before a jib had been raised above a bowsprit. The Iate Club is one of the more prestigious amenities of a town called Foz do Iguacu. In times past, Foz was no more than a sun-drenched, slumbrous frontier post. In those days, the Parana was rendered impassable a few miles upstream by the Falls of Guayru. Now the biggest dam in the world stands there, Itiapu, which supplies much of Paraguay and a sizeable slab of Brazil with power. Fifty thousand men came to build the dam, and turned Foz into a boom town. Across the water is the Paraguayan town of Cuidad Presidente Stroessner, whose tax-free shops and casinos keep the soaring bridge over the Parana clogged with traffic. Visitors pour in to see the falls and the dam, and to enjoy the attractions of Foz itself. Among these, the chief appears to be sex at a modest price. The place is studded with clubs - with subtle names such as Sex Appeal - which comprise dance-floors infested with meagrely-dressed young girls, and knocking-shop facilities through a side door. 'They'd be most offended if you thought they were whores,' Edward explained. 'They call themselves programme girls. Lots of men marry them. They make very good wives.' More congenial by far were the restaurants with glistening, barbecued meats carved from skewers on to your plate, and others where you dipped into an earthenware pot bubbling with prawns, squid and mussels cooked in coconut milk; and with everything that superb drink of Brazil, caiparinha: cane spirit poured over crushed ice, sliced lemon and sugar. On the river, we were whisked about in a high-powered speedboat with cushioned seats and a box filled with ice and beer, piloted by Jorge, a dark-skinned humorist with a gleaming set of teeth sent through the post by a grateful client, and a bullet somewhere in his head, a legacy of a lawless youth. With him, I gradually lost my nervousness of the Parana, though never my awe. Opposite Foz, on the Paraguayan shore, extended a succession of extravagant villas, refuges - so we were told - of drug barons, arms dealers, and crooks of every shade. Once downstream, the sub-tropical rainforest closed in on the water, stretching away on either side into immeasurable distances. It was a forbidding sight, this rearing barrier of bamboo and palm and tangled trees with pale trunks, like bones. One afternoon, we beached on the Paraguayan bank. We followed a path through the trees, led by Edward brandishing a metal hook with which he said he would fend off any of the numerous venomous snakes with which the forest abounds. We saw none, nor any of the jaguars, pumas, tapirs or wild boar reputed to lurk in the shadows. But we did come upon a strange institute of learning, mouldering quietly in a clearing above the Parana. It had been the home of Moyses Santiago Bertoni, a one-time Swiss anarchist who had fled to South America and devoted the greater part of a lifetime of awesome industry to studying the people, the customs, the creatures and the plants of Paraguay. Here, stuffed on sagging shelves, was the residue of his colossal library, 7,000 left out of 40,000 volumes. A goodly portion he wrote himself - more than 500 hefty volumes: dictionaries of the language of the Guarani Indians, studies of anthropology and flora and fauna, all typed on a primitive machine given to him by Theodore Roosevelt, and printed on his own press. There were other relics of the wise man of Paraguay, as Bertoni's adopted country knows him: his top hat, false teeth and visiting cards; and, outside, the trees he planted, and his grave in a little plot to one side of the pale blue and brown wooden house, together with those of three of his 13 children, and a great grand-daughter, only recently buried. The sun was dying when we returned to the boat. As we made out way upriver to Foz, Jorge related his own tales of things curious and inexplicable. He told us of the woman who gave birth to a monkey; and another who conceived a creature half-human, half-toad; and of a foreman at the dam who had resigned because his wife had an affair with their mastiff, and produced puppies. He spoke without his usual smile, and it was not until we had left the black, silent forest behind, and the lights of the town appeared, that we were able to laugh again.</p>

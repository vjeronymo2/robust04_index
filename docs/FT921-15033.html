			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Economics: Eyes on both sides of Atlantic scan figures for indications of recovery A WELTER of figures from the US and UK will be watched keenly this week for hints that economic recovery is on the way. Little cheer for the flagging US economy is expected from industrial production and retail sales figures for December. The retail sales figures are predicted to reflect the weakness of demand in the run up to Christmas, which may lead to further retrenchment in the business sector. Both sets of figures will be watched closely for signs that the Federal Reserve will attempt to revive the economy by cutting US borrowing rates again. The main news in the UK will be the release of December's unemployment figures. Economists expect a rise of about 30,000, less than November's sharp increase of 38,000. A fourth consecutive monthly increase in the UK retail prices index would suggest that inflation was not being squeezed out of the economy as quickly as the government predicted. Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of city forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a financial information company, include: Today: UK, final figures for retail sales in November (up 1.2 per cent), credit business for November (unchanged); US, November housing completions; Norway, December trade balance; Canada, October wages and salaries (up 0.2 per cent); Belgium, EC finance ministers' council meeting; Switzerland, Regular Bank for International Settlements meeting. Tomorrow: UK, producer price index for December - output (up 0.1 per cent on month), input (down 0.5 per cent on month); US, December retail sales (down 0.1 per cent), excluding autos (up 0.01 per cent); Japan, wholesale price index for January (unchanged on month, down 1.6 per cent on year). Wednesday: US, November business inventories; Germany, GNP for 1991 (up 3.2 per cent on year); France, December consumer price index (up 0.1 per cent on month, and 3.1 per cent on year); Spain, December consumer price index; Italy, vote on budget privatisation measures. Thursday: UK, December unemployment (up 30,000), December vacancies, November average earnings (up 7.25 per cent); US, December consumer price index (up 0.2 per cent), excluding food and energy (up 0.3 per cent), December real earnings, M1 for December (Dollars 7bn), for week ending January 6 (-Dollars 4bn), M2 for December (Dollars 6.3bn), for week ending January 6 (-Dollars 8.5bn), M3 for December (Dollars 7.6bn), for week ending January 6 (-Dollars 12bn), state benefits for week ending December 28; Sweden, December consumer price index; Australia, December unemployment rate (10.6 per cent); Canada, November unfilled orders (down 0.2 per cent).

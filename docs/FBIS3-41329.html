The department added that slightly over 32 million new pesos  of the money was "in cash," and that the National Banking  Commission has been asked to impound various accounts discovered  in the names of presumed drug dealers. The latter include front  men and accomplices of the brothers Ramon and Benjamin Arellano  Felix.    The source stressed that, owing to the aforementioned  program, the results of which were submitted to the Finance  Secretariat and the Secretariat of the Comptroller General of  the Federation, it was possible to acquire an updated record of  the assets confiscated.    The department noted that, last year, 22 public auctions  were  held to sell the public poisoners' properties and assets, and  that over 9 million new pesos were obtained from these auctions.  Some of the money was used to give incentives and awards to PGR  workers who have distinguished themselves in the performance of  their duties.    On the same occasion, the department emphasized that each of  the auctions was held through public bidding, and that the  groundwork has been established for the computerized system to  support a constant check of the material resources confiscated  from organized crime.</p>

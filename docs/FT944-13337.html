			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Russia puts radical reform back on agenda: Document reveals determination to try to create new economic climate The Russian government is determined to try once again to pursue radical economic reforms, according to a document on economic strategy obtained by the FT. Written by Mr Yakov Urinson, the first deputy economics minister, the document provided the background against which Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, gave a largely uncompromising speech to the duma (lower house) yesterday. It admits that 'at the moment, economic and political instability, inflation, high-cost credits and mistrust in the authorities make up a generally inhospitable climate for investment'. Only by changing that climate can the rouble be stabilised. And to change the climate, the report confirms the government's commitment to a monthly inflation target of 2 per cent over next year, the eschewing of credits from the central bank and the funding of the deficit by the issue of treasury bills and borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier for the economy, said last week the government hoped for as much as Dollars 14bn in IMF and Bank credits next year - an expectation the Fund has been at pains to play down. The paper lays out an industrial strategy which gives pride of place to ending subsidies and credits to 'hopeless' enterprises and concentrating on existing or newly created businesses which can attract a mixture of state and private capital. It wants to 'closely co-ordinate' the second phase of the privatisation programme with measures to stimulate private investment; and it wants to make investment attractive to individual savers. As for the long-suffering foreign investors - there is, again, a frank recognition of the causes for their suffering, and of the urgent need to convince them that the government is on their side. If it can do so - Mr Urinson does not spell out how it might be done - then 'we can expect foreign investment to run at around Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn a year from 1995'. The document is equally frank in recognising that Russian industry, its output still falling, its technology archaic and its work relations unreconstructed, is in no condition to stand unprotected before the world market. The government will thus continue its policy of 'reasonable protectionism' - using an array of weapons, including tariffs, quotas, export credits and manipulation of the rate of the rouble. However upbeat its determination to re-commit itself to a harsh path - not yet consistently followed by any of the post-1991 Russian governments - its forecasts sketch an economy still tumbling. GNP is expected to come out at between 92 per cent and 94 per cent of this year; production is set to continue falling, by 3 per cent to 5 per cent (compared to 8-10 per cent this year). Oil output will be 6 per cent down, at 295m tonnes; gas a mere 1 per cent down at 600bn cubic metres; and coal 1 per cent down on this year, at 270m tonnes. These are rather better figures, if they come to reflect reality. However big falls will continue in engineering (expected to be 12-14 per cent down); timber (13-15 per cent down); light industry products (15 per cent down); agricultural output (6 per cent down). The commitment is strong. But the edifice rests on the assumption that the deficit will be financed by a vast issue of treasury bills and a very large package of loans. Critics were questioning both last night.</p>

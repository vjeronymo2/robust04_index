			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Mixed fortunes for golfing memorabilia: Saleroom CHRISTIE'S had a disappointment in its sale of golfing memorabilia in Glasgow yesterday when a rare niblick, made in 1865 by James Anderson of Anstruther, was unsold at Pounds 5,000, half its estimate. A blacksmith-made track iron dating from about 1790, sold by the Royal Golf Club, was bought by a private collector for Pounds 20,900 and a gutta golf ball made about 1860 trebled its estimate at Pounds 7,700. A red playing coat worn by members of Leicester Golf Club about 1890 to warn non-golfers of possible danger sold for Pounds 935. The present malaise in the art market was underlined by Sotheby's sale of 18th-century and 19th-century British drawings and watercolours. It totalled Pounds 276,375 and was more than 38 per cent unsold. In a healthy market, the department would have expected about 12 per cent to be unsold. The top price was the Pounds 44,000 paid for a chalk drawing by Gainsborough of the Duchess of Buccleuch. The London dealer Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox paid Pounds 28,600 - twice the estimate - for a landscape with a boy and horses by the same artist, while another London dealer, Leggatt, acquired a view of Worcester Cathedral by Constable for Pounds 24,200. Bonhams has come back into the market for 20th-century art at a difficult time, and its auction yesterday totalled Pounds 200,000, at the bottom of the estimate. 'Feeding the chickens' by Sir Alfred Munnings sold for Pounds 19,800, below forecast, and 'Megalith' by Ben Nicholson, an abstract which Daphne du Maurier had hidden from view in her Cornish house 'Manderbilly', the inspiration for Rebecca, also went cheaply, at Pounds 16,500.</p>

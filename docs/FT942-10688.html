			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK beef imports face German ban Germany will tomorrow consider a unilateral move to ban the import of British beef because of public concern over 'mad cow disease', in defiance of the European Commission and the rest of the European Union. A draft regulation to control beef imports will be submitted to the German cabinet by Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, on the grounds that a form of the disease - bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) - may possibly be communicated to humans. The German government is pressing ahead with the ban, in spite of warnings from Brussels that it will face injunctions and legal action in the European Court of Justice. Its own experts have also expressed doubt that any unilateral ban can be effectively enforced because of the EU's open borders. But health ministry officials insisted yesterday that the measure will be enacted and can be put into effect. In London, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the British agriculture minister, said a unilateral ban on British beef by Germany would be unjustifiable and illegal under the Treaty of Rome. Britain would take court action if necessary against Germany for creating an unfair trade barrier, but it looked to the European Commission to take action in the first instance, she said. Mr Dieter Vogel, for the German government, said yesterday: 'We have always said we would prefer to find a common solution for this BSE problem. If that is not possible, then we have to find a unilateral solution. It may be that the cabinet will decide on this on Wednesday. 'We are not in favour of unilateral solutions, but in the worst case we will have to find one.'</p>

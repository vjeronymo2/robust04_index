			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as: (i) The specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a species on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) that may require special management considerations or protection, and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. Section 3(5)(C) further indicates that in most cases, critical habitat should not encompass the entire geographical area that can be occupied by the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Role in Species Conservation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``conservation,'' as defined in section 3 of the Act, means to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary (i.e., the species has recovered). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of critical habitat, while explicitly mentioning the features essential to conservation of a species, implicitly requires that the areas themselves be essential to the species' survival and recovery. Not all areas containing those features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to its conservation. Conversely, areas not currently containing all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may be designated as critical habitat. However, areas not included in critical habitat that contain one or more of the essential features are also important to the species' conservation and would be addressed under other facets of the Act and other conservation laws and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship to Recovery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2(c)(1) of the Act declares that all Federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section 3(3) of the Act defines conservation to include all measures needed to recover the species and justify its removal from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring Federal agencies to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs and insuring that Federal actions will not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat); section 9 (prohibition of taking of listed animal species); section 10 (wildlife research permits and conservation planning on State and private lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants); land acquisition; and research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

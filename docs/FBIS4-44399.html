			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Wu Yadong (0702 0068 2639): "South </F> Xinjiang Regional Deputies Agree: Stability Is the Prerequisite  for Economic Development"]    [Text] In the last few days, minority nationality People's  Congress deputies from the four south Xinjiang prefectures and  autonomous prefectures have been engaging in a heated debate on  stability and on promoting development. The deputies believe  that if Xinjiang is to have a stable social-political  environment, we must first stabilize and increase input in south  Xinjiang.    Deputy Julaiti Maimaitiming said, Hotan Prefecture is an  exceptionally poor prefecture; the national separatist elements'  subversive activities are a problem. Relying on our own hard  work and struggle alone--without the state and the autonomous  region's special political and financial support--it will be  impossible for the prefecture to accelerate development or to  become relatively well-off at the same time as the rest of  Xinjiang. Deputy Yibulayinmu Sulaiman said, agricultural input  in south Xinjiang should be greatly increased, because south  Xinjiang's development is dependent primarily on agriculture,  and if this problem is not properly resolved, we can't even  begin to talk about becoming well-off, and it will adversely  affect stability. He also said that if south Xinjiang wants to  keep its talented people, the government must formulate special  policies to keep those people and create an environment that  respects knowledge and talents. Delegate Hadir Kayitoufu said,  some of south Xinjiang's prefectures, autonomous prefectures,  and counties are economically backward; the peasants carry a  heavy burden and cannot afford to send their children to school.  He suggested that while the government vigorously develop the  economy, it should reduce the minority nationality students'  school expenses in some regions to support educational  development. He also said that we should continue to vigorously  implement the "Law on Regional Autonomy of Minority  Nationalities" and assign minority nationality and Chinese  students on an equal basis, because it will help promote  stability.    Deputy Zhu Ruojing [8540 5387 7234] said, stability is the  prerequisite for reform and development. Without a stable  political environment and without unity among the nationalities,  there will be no economic development and prosperity for south  Xinjiang. Deputy Maimaitiming Tuoheti said, it is imperative  that we truly understand that the threat to Xinjiang comes  mainly from national separatism and that we must crack down on  the separatist conspiracies within the region and strengthen the  political and legal contingents. Delegate Qi Baowen [7871 0202  2429], who represent the military police, said that they  shoulder the important responsibility of protecting the  fatherland's unity, opposing national separatism, and preserving  social stability. He said that the unity between the Army and  the people must be strengthened, that we need to acquire a  stronger sense of national defense, and we must resolutely and  steadfastly struggle against a handful of minority nationality  separatists and other hostile forces and make a positive  contribution toward protecting social stability and promoting  economic development.</p>

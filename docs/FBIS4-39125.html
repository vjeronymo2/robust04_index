			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 3 June TASS -- Delegations from Russia and  Ukraine are holding talks in Kiev today on the settlement of  Ukraine's debt to Russia for supplied gas.    Chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee for Gas and Oil  Supplies, Mikhail Kovalko, said that this year, Ukraine already  owes the Russian Gasprom joint stock society a considerable sum  of money in hard currency. The overall debt has been estimated  at $850 million. "Today's talks with our Russian partners are  very important," Kovalko said. The sides are expected to look  into political problems connected with the further development  of gas pipe line systems in Russia and Ukraine and an increase  in exports of Russian gas to countries of Western Europe,  Kovalko said.    "Chairman of the board of the Gasprom joint stock society,  Rem Vyakhirev, told ITAR-TASS that they regard financial  difficulties faced by their Ukrainian colleagues with  understanding. Vyakhirev said that they approved of Ukraine's  proposal to repay part of the debt at the expense of  construction of houses for Gasprom workers in Russia. "Today,  we intend to discuss the terms of construction and evaluate its  cost," Vyakhirev said. "We are also interested in a more  efficient use of Ukraine's gas pipe line system for exports of  Russian gas to Western countries," Vyakhirev said.    Later in the day, the sides are expected to sign a contract  on further cooperation in this field.</p>

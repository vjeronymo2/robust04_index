			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The chetniks have been firing  selectively at civilian targets this morning. The refugee  center has been hit. At about 1030 a tank caused bloody havoc  in the Red Cross refugee center, where the old and the weak have  been housed. Since this facility is still under constant  chetnik artillery fire, the total number of casualties is still  unknown. So far the bodies of four killed, and five wounded old  folk have been dragged out. The evacuation of others is still  under way. We have just received information that a tank shell  in the center of Gorazde has killed one person, and wounded six  others. This is just one illustration of the hell in Gorazde,  just one example of the suffering of these people. [passage  omitted]</p>

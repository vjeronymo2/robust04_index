			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: OK FOR KIDS TO BE AFRAID  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Recently, our 7-year-old has been watching the evening news  with his father, and I've noticed that he's become much more fearful. He's  worried about robbers, fires, earthquakes -- you name it. It is normal for  children his age to have fears? How many are too many? -- S.S.  </P> <P> DEAR S.S.: Everyone needs a certain amount of fear to protect us from danger.  If your son has been watching the news, he's become more aware of what's  happening in the world around him. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. While  parents need to take time to explain the dangers to the child, they should also  let him know that there are lots of good things happening in the world that  don't get reported on the evening news because people take them for granted.  It's the bad and the unusual that make the news.  </P> <P> If parents are calm, controlled and in command of their lives, children are  more likely to feel curious rather than anxious. Children's fears are sometimes  a reflection of their parents' anxiety levels.  </P> <P> Dr. Leon Rosenberg, child psychologist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Children's  Center in Baltimore, says being afraid or worried about strangers, bad people,  fire and robbers isn't unusual for 7-, 8- and 9-year-olds. If the child is  spending any significant amount of time with these worries, if it's  interrupting the child's play during the daytime, then the anxiety may be  unhealthy. If he's only a little anxious before bedtime, take time to talk  about his fears and explore the source, but chances are this is healthy, normal  fear.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I love my wife despite the fact that she's convinced she is  sick, when her doctors and I know that this isn't the case. I have to screen  newspapers and magazines before leaving them around the house, because if there  is an article about an illness, she's got it and nothing will persuade her that  she hasn't. What causes this preoccupation and how can I get her off the  subject of her health? -- L.R.  </P> <P> DEAR L.R.: Some hypochondriacs develop the problem as children, often as a way  of getting attention from parents or friends. Children discover that the only  time a mother or father shows affection is when they have a headache or when  they complain about some physical ailment.  </P> <P> Hypochondriacs often come from homes where one parent has been seriously ill  for a long period of time or when their life has been threatened by invalidism  in the home. A parent may pass on his or her anxieties about illness to the  child so that the youngster grows up with a persistent preoccupation with  disease.  </P> <P> As for the treatment of this imagined illness, it isn't easy. Most  psychiatrists agree with Sigmund Freud that intense, long-term psychoanalysis  isn't especially effective in treating hypochondria. Group therapy, behavior  modification and drugs to treat the accompanying depression are generally what  is advised today. Treating the depression helps the patient feel better.  Doctors usually try to manage the patient's anxiety, as this is the dominant  emotion with hypochondriacs. This will help your wife.  </P></p>

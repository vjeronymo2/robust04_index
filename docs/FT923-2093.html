			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Elonex ahead and plans flotation ELONEX, the privately-owned north London personal computer manufacturer which has grown to become the biggest direct seller of PCs in the UK, yesterday reported sharply higher full year pre-tax profits and turnover, and announced plans to seek a stock market quotation 'within the next 24 months.' Pre-tax profits in the year to April 30 increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 7.34m), on turnover which grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 45.5m). Net current assets at the six year-old company almost doubled to stand at Pounds 10.5m (5.45m) at the end of the period and capital and reserves grew to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 6.64m). Despite the recession and fierce competition, Elonex has bucked the industry trend increasing the number of employees from 130 in 1991 to over 200 today. Growth has been self-financed and the company's only long term debt is the mortgage on its London headquarters and production site. However Mr Michael Spiro, finance director, added that after six successive years of growth 'we can now start to lay the foundations for publicly quoted status.' He said a share flotation 'will enable us to assume better control over the production and distribution of Elonex products worldwide, and will provide our staff with a bigger stake in the company's continued success.'</p>

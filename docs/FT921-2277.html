			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury eases on placing A PLACING of Cadbury Schweppes shares drove the price down 10 to 433p. New shares totalling 34.4m were placed with institutions by company broker Hoare Govett at 425p apiece to help pay for the acquisition of Femsa Aguas Minerales, a Mexican producer of carbonated mineral water. Cadbury Schweppes is paying Dollars 325m (Pounds 188m) for the company, raising Pounds 145.1m through the share placing and taking the remaining Pounds 42.9m from existing cash resources. The share placing had not shown up on the Seaq reporting system at the close of business, when the day's total volume in Cadbury stock was 3.2m shares. Outside of the share placing, trading in Cadbury was average and the share price followed the sector. Unitech warning A warning on trading progress from the Japanese subsidiary of Unitech sent ripples across the stock market yesterday. The electronic components group lost 18 to 170p after Nerric-Lambda, a power supply manufacturer, issued a profits warning. The Unitech announcement prompted alarm over Rank Organisation's Japanese joint-venture, Fuji Xerox, which manufactures and markets office stationery equipment. It contributes around one-third of profits to Rank Xerox, which itself accounts for some 55 per cent of Rank Organisation's profits. Analysts reported Rank as saying Fuji was 'toughing it out' in difficult trading conditions. In New York, US broker Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette was said to have moved from a buy to a hold on Rank Organisation. In London, the shares tumbled 23 to 643p. Nerric-Lambda now expects to contribute only around Pounds 8m pre-tax to Unitech for the year to May 1992. Mr Robert Millington at BZW had previously predicted Pounds 13m profits at Unitech this year but, in view of the Nerric announcement, has downgraded to Pounds 11m. Utilities hit The latest opinion poll showings hit the utilities sectors of the market, with dealers chopping prices in a largely successful move to head off any big selling pressure. Fears that a Labour government might affect the water, electricity, power generation and gas and telecommunications stocks have hung over the sectors for a long time. Water shares were the worst hit as they are seen as most vulnerable to a Labour victory. Labour has repeatedly stated its intention of returning the water companies to public ownership. Of the Footsie stocks, Anglian fell 14 to 332p, Thames 13 to 341p, and Severn Trent and North West 10 apiece to 321p and 342p respectively. The Electricity Package dropped 70 to Pounds 2548. Scottish Power closed below 100p, the level at which the shares were sold last year, settling 2 1/2 off at 98 1/2 p. British Gas lost 6 to 248p and BT slipped a penny to 318p. Midland Bank shares closed a further 11 higher at 340p, after 344p, on turnover of almost 14m, making the stock the day's most heavily traded on the London market. Dealers said the market was expecting Hongkong and Shanghai Banking to reveal its merger terms in around two weeks, the consensus being that the minimum price it will offer will be around 375p with the potential for up to 400p. Specialists maintained that Hongkong Bank will have to pitch its terms at a level to win the Midland board over before a possible counter-offer might emerge. News of the departure of Mr Peter Van Cuylenburg, a director of Cable and Wireless and widely regarded as responsible for the build-up of the comp-any's Mercury telecoms division, caused a flurry of selling of C and W shares. They registered a fall of 13 at 583p. Last month C and W appointed the former head of BP America, Mr James Ross, as chief executive, apparently completing a management shake-up instigated by Lord Young, C and W's executive chairman. A telecoms specialist commented: 'The fall in the share price is a demonstration of the City's high regard for Mr Van Cuylenburg.' International stocks were mostly affected by domestic political influences, including opinion poll developments, but Reuters stood out as a sufferer from transatlantic factors. Overnight selling from Wall Street set the downward trend of the global business communications group in a London market already disinclined to buy Reuters shares. At 1105p, the stock ended 36 down although turnover, at 441,000 shares, was insignificant. SmithKline Beecham stood out against a generally dull background, moving up 8 to 880p on the back of fairly modest buying. Fewer than 2m shares were traded but the units were upgraded by a New York brokerage house. ICI, down 13 at 1224p, featured in the market's overall setback without attracting much attention from the dealing desks. The fall in Fisons was held to only 2  - to 364p  - by underlying, albeit unconvincing, bid speculation. Glaxo, down 6 at 766p, dipped through a support level as US sources turned sellers. Among the media stocks, WPP Group remained friendless, drifting 2 to 66p. Chain manufacturer Renold continued to respond to suggestions that TT, a mini-conglomerate run by ex-Hanson dealmaker Mr John Newman, may be considering a bid for the group. Renold finished 5 ahead at 63p. TT revealed last week that it had increased its stake in the company to 4.6 per cent. Building products group Marley provided one of the market's better performances, responding to higher than expected preliminary profits. Up some 75 per cent at Pounds 25m, these compared with estimates around the Pounds 22m mark. The shares settled 3 ahead at 122p, having touched 125p. Mr David Taylor, building sector specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, described Marley as 'the only building materials group that has reported increased profits for 1991 and the only one that will do so'. Mr Taylor said Marley had 'come from being a stale takeover stock to a company that has sorted itself out and is a buy in its own right'. Building materials retailers took a pasting from broker downgrades. Meyer dipped 14 to 353p and Wolseley 5 to 142p. Theme park group Euro Disney rose ahead of today's inclusion in the CAC 40 index in Paris, adding 18 at 1678p, after touching 1690p. The defensive attractions of Tate &amp; Lyle helped the shares firm a penny to 421p against the general trend. Political worries, following the latest opinion polls, weighed on the stores sector, in spite of better than expected retail sales data. Boots lost 7 to 435p, Dixons 4 to 219p, Marks and Spencer 4 to 315p and WH Smith 'A' 10 to 444p. Rothmans International fell 26 to 1013p in a delayed reaction to Tuesday's warning of a 15 per cent profits fall by Rothmans Holdings, of Australia. Guinness was a bright spot in a drinks sector depressed by the nervous political situation. Shares in the brewing and whisky giant put on 2 to 570p ahead of today's results. Bass fell 19 to 530p, Grand Metropolitan 6 to 886p and Whitbread 'A' 9 to 418p. Gloom surrounded Automated Security Holdings shares, as the security alarms group revealed preliminary profits down some 30 per cent to Pounds 23.2m, well below most analysts' forecasts. The stock plummeted 31 to 102p on above average turnover of 1.7m. After Tuesday's successful presentation to institutions by Dowty Group, at which executives are said to have eased worries over the dividend on the back of the imminent part-sale of its IT business, the shares steadied in a weak market, losing a penny to 114p. The good showing reflected poorly on Smiths Industries, which is often talked of as a predator to Dowty, the shares losing 9 to 275p. BM Group failed to find support after a large seller moved into the market, the shares falling 20 to 367p. Johnson Matthey climbed 11 to 365p on optimism over the South African election.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Srdjan Radulovic: Is There a Rome-Knin Axis?"] </F>   [Excerpts] The establishment of an open alliance between  the Krajina Serbs and the new Italian political team headed by  Silvio Berlusconi -- as Swiss paper JOURNAL DE GENEVE  prognosticates, albeit without invoking any (un)official sources  -- has reintroduced the story about Krajina-Italian connections  and attempts so far at exerting diplomatic pressure on Croatia.  [passage omitted]    The Swiss paper's forecast attracts attention since the  current revival of Krajina-Italian relations ensued after a lull  that was preceded by a case of open lobbying on the part of  Italian senator Arduino Agnelli, favoring general Serbian  interests on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.    At the end of last September, Senator Agnelli attended a  session of the assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK]  and the Assembly proclaimed him an "honorary citizen of the  RSK." At that time, the Krajina authorities suggested to  Agnelli that he support Knin's initiative for Italians to  mediate in solving disputes between Krajina and Croatia, and he  promised to provide "good services."    "I hope that we will march into a liberated Zadar together.  The Croats do not deserve to have such a lovely town," Martic  thanked Agnelli. [passage omitted]    The announcements of a rapprochement between Italy and  Krajina, if only in individual statements by more influential  politicians, were followed by the phenomenon whereby the Italian  question in Istria and Dalmatia became more topical. The Osimo  agreement issue reemerged despite statements by some Italian  parties and officials that these documents had become part of  history for good.    The question is, of course, whether the Italians care so  much  about the status of Serbs in Krajina so that they would call  into question their relations with their most important seacoast  neighbor or whether they have also realized that Krajina is a  favorable "political medium" through which one can articulate  certain political interests more efficiently.    This dilemma becomes completely superfluous if one keeps in  mind Italy's latest actions, which are aimed at hampering  Croatian (and Slovene) admission to the European Union and  include the Krajina card as part of the game.    By losing aggressive German support and with its general  rating in the world falling, Croatia, analysts of international  relations assess, has not only become "softer" regarding the  possibility of Italy realizing a dominant position in the region  of the Adriatic, but also a gratifying "issue" that Italy can  use in order to more efficiently enter international games of  solving the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.    As far as Krajina is concerned, its interest is mainly  exhausted at a diplomatic-psychological level and therefore the  attempt at creating a political Knin-Rome axis, although it is a  good diplomatic move, cannot have long-term effects. Over the  long-term, Krajina's position still depends on the  Zagreb-Belgrade axis.</p>

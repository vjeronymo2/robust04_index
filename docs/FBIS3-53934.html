Limited small-arms fire was exchanged along the frontline  and  pro-Rabbani gunners fired the occasional rocket at rival forces.    The lull followed the announcement in Pakistan overnight by  the anti-Rabbani front that it had decided to observe a  ceasefire unilterally in response to a proposal from a mediation  commission of mojahedin commanders.    The front linked its decision to what it called "guarantees"  from the Kabul commanders that its demands, including Rabbani's  resignation and installation of an interim government, would be  implemented.    The announcement was issued from the northwestern Pakistani  city of Peshawar by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], on behalf of the  so-called Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution  of Afghanistan (SCCIRA).    The anti-Rabbani alliance threatened to resume fighting to  deal a "final blow" if the president did not resign.    Ex-communist general Abdol Rashid Dostam's Junbish movement  is part of SCCIRA along with the Hezb-e Eslami, the National  Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA) of former Afghan president  Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and some other groups.    Defence Ministry officials acknowledged that a 45-man  delegation of mojahedin commanders from the Kabul area had put  forward an independent peace proposal.    Presidential spokesman Aziz Morad said the state concurs  with  the delegation's demands for a ceasefire and the removal of the  armed groups from the capital but not the resignation of Rabbani.    Both Morad and Defence Ministry officials loyal to the  president's military strongman Ahmad Shah Mas'ud said while  rapproachement was possible with Hekmatyar, none was possible  with Dostam.    Morad said the state was prepared to negotiate a ceasefire  with Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction, but only on the  condition that Hezb cut its ties with Dostam.    Dostam's forces launched an attack against Rabbani 20 days  ago but failed to grab key posts in the capital and were pushed  back to their Bala Hissar and Maranjan Hill strongholds, where  they have been joined by Hezb-e Eslami.    The nearly three weeks of fierce rocket and artillery duels  left hundreds dead and thousands injured, besides triggering a  flood of refugees to safer areas.    "The state is ready to accept a ceasefire with Hezb, but no  way with the militia and ex-communists," the presidential  spokesman said.    "The militia must surrender their heavy weapons to the  state,  and their lives will be gauranteed, otherwise they will be  smashed in their posts," Morad said.    The declaration of a "Jihad" or holy war against the militia  is clear evidence that Rabbani is holding firm and will not bow  to rival demands that he must resign.    "The people of Afghanistan are the only ones to decide on  Rabbani's leadership as they elected him," Morad said, noting  that as Rabbani, elected for two years in December 1992, he  still had one year left to run.    In the downtown old bazar area of Kabul, which sits at the  foot of Bala Hissar fortress, hundreds of residents took  advantage of the de facto ceasefire and the sunny weather to  flee with their possessions, transported mostly in carts hired  especially for the job.    There was some looting of private houses and shops which had  been badly damaged in the heavy bombardment between the rival  factions.</p>

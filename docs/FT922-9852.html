			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Argentina to privatise nuclear power plants AN announcement by Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that he intends to privatise part of the country's nuclear power industry has run into stiff opposition. The minister has said he wants to sell two nuclear power stations next year to raise money to fund the completion of a third nuclear generator. His plan focuses on the 357MW Atucha I unit close to Buenos Aires and the 648MW Embalse plant in the central province of Cordoba. The money raised from the sale would be used to complete the 750MW Atucha II unit, which has been delayed for almost 10 years. It is being built largely with local technology and is already 61 per cent over budget - the government has spent Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) on the plant, with completion costing a further Dollars 900m. However, Mr Eduardo Bauza, President Carlos Menem's chief of staff, has warned that private operators could not be relied on to provide sufficient security and safety precautions. The Atucha I plant has suffered a series of accidents and systems failures, although the National Nuclear Energy Commission, which operates the station, insists that safety has never been threatened. Staff at the plant are reported to have attacked Mr Cavallo's idea, claiming that reducing the state's role in the industry was further evidence of Argentina's submission to the US. Washington has voiced concern that Argentina's nuclear technology is being leaked to 'unreliable' regimes such as Iran. Last month Argentina introduced new export controls, restricting the sale of sensitive technologies.</p>

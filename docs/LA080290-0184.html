			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BULGARIA;  </P> <P> OPPOSITION LEADER CHOSEN AS PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Bulgarian lawmakers elected opposition leader Zhelyu Zhelev as the nation's  first non-Communist president in more than four decades.  </P> <P> Thousands poured into the streets of Sofia, the capital, in a spontaneous  demonstration. The election of Zhelev, 55, ended a four-week deadlock since the  resignation of Petar Mladenov, a member of the ruling Communist Party, now  renamed the Socialist Party. Zhelev's elevation, with Socialist support, was  seen as a commitment to pluralism by the government.  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Petrobras gets fifth president in two years MR FERNANDO Collor, president of Brazil, yesterday appointed a new head at Petrobras, the state oil monopoly and one of Latin America's largest companies. Mr Benedito Moreira will be the company's fifth president in just over two years and 27th in its 39-year history. The dismissal of his predecessor, Mr Ernesto Weber, has been expected ever since a cabinet reshuffle last month and the launch of a police investigation into the company for alleged manipulation of contract bids and misuse of its pension fund. Three directors were sacked last month. In an interview with foreign correspondents last Thursday Mr Weber joked: 'I am already getting old in the job - I have held it for eight months.' The news of Mr Weber's sacking came as he prepared to fly to Houston to receive the oil industry's top offshore technology award for the company's deep sea drilling operations. His trip was cancelled. Five new directors were appointed yesterday along with the 61-year-old Mr Moreira who is the former head of the extinct Export Registration Bureau. The new minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Marcus Pratini de Moraes, said that Mr Moreira's appointment would mark a new phase in Petrobras operations. The company, which has long been subject to heavy political interference, is expected to be given more autonomy as it prepares to confront possible competition. In an interview with Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's leading financial journal, Mr Moreira described Petrobras as 'rather worn-out' and said he would give more priority to increasing the company's international operations.</p>

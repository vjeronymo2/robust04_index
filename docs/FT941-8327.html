			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Defiant Serbs drink toast to Russia: Soldiers were confident Nato deadline would pass without air strikes Bosnian Serb forces, coolly defiant to the last, laid plans for campfire barbecues and night skiing on the hills around Sarajevo yesterday, confident Nato's deadline would pass without air strikes on their remaining guns, AP reports from Pale. 'We want to make it easier for Nato planes to spot us,' joked a Serb officer as he outlined plans for roasting oxen and lambs over fires on Mount Trebevic, overlooking Sarajevo. Hundreds of Serbs chanting 'Greater Serbia' and 'Long Live Russia' gave a heroes' welcome to their Orthodox Slav brothers - Russian peacekeepers en route to Sarajevo - as they arrived in this Bosnian Serb stronghold, about 10 miles to the south-east. Home-made brandy, bread and salt were passed in traditional welcome as soldiers and Serbs alike exulted. 'We feel safe now, because they're our brothers,' said a 15-year-old Serb girl, weeping with joy. 'Everybody here feels the same.' It was a Russian pledge last Thursday to bring the 400 peacekeepers to Sarajevo that enabled Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to promise to withdraw the heavy guns that have besieged and bombarded the Bosnian capital for almost two years. Mr Karadzic himself was among the crowd shaking hands with the Russian soldiers, who held out three fingers in the traditional Serb victory sign. Children clambered over the trucks and armoured personnel carriers in the 67-vehicle Russian convoy, saluting the soldiers. The Bosnian Serb Olympics, being held in memory of the Sarajevo Olympics 10 years ago, scheduled night skiing on the slopes of Mount Jahorina just five hours before Nato's ultimatum expired at midnight GMT. In Grbavica, a Serb-held section of southern Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb forces showed no fear of Nato bombs. 'We are not afraid. we can fight back their infantry attacks with our 7.62-calibre automatic rifles, which are not supposed to be under UN control,' said Second Lt Danko Przulj, speaking in a bunker built in what used to be a heating plant. His bunker is only 70 yards from Bosnian government troop positions across the Miljacka river that flows through Sarajevo. From two loopholes, the buildings housing Sarajevo defenders could be clearly seen. 'The latest ceasefire has been respected by both sides,' said Lt Przulj. 'It was never as quiet as it has been in the past 10 days.' Grbavica streets saw heavy fighting between former neighbours in May 1992, early into Sarajevo's 22-month siege. Damaged buildings stand in mute testimony to destroyed friendship and joint life in multi-ethnic Sarajevo. Black plastic covers about 50 feet high hang like curtains between buildings, shielding residents from the government snipers who residents claimed have killed many Grbavica civilians.</p>

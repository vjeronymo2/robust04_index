			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the issuance of that priority letter AD, the FAA received the results of an extensive analytical study performed by GE as a result of the noted stage 2 turbine wheel failure. The study indicates that a crack initiated in the inboard radius of the rabbet groove on the forward side of the wheel. The fatigue crack propagated 360 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; around the wheel, and approximately 300 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; of the wheel departed in the failure. The wheel failure has been attributed to an under minimum radius that results in reduced low cycle fatigue capability. The results of this study also indicate that the minimum calculated lives for certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels, regardless of the forward and aft rabbet groove radii, are significantly lower than the published limits and those imposed by the priority letter AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CT58 Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72&hyph;126 (CEB&hyph;206), Revision 2, dated August 31, 1993, that describes the revised inspection requirements, accelerated inspection schedule, and the removal from service of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design, this AD supersedes priority letter AD 93&hyph;10&hyph;09 to add an additional eddy current inspection requirement, accelerate the inspection schedule, and provide for the removal from service of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels. The priority letter AD referred to the stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels as high pressure turbine disks. In order to be consistent with the SB described previously, the terminology has been changed in this final rule to turbine wheel. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the SB described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;03.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HUMOR AND COMPASSION IN MESSAGE OF 'ONE VOICE'  </P> <P> Cabaret performer Alan Nicholson walks on stage in a gaucho dress jacket and  opens his show with a song called "Are You Ready?" But nobody could be.  </P> <P> Those who jammed the Coronet Theatre for the opening of Nicholson's one-man  production, "One Voice," knew of Nicholson's personal battle. But hearing him  jump right into it with the kind of mockery one might reserve for the gout  still comes as a shock -- and welcome relief.  </P> <P> Rather incredibly, the star puts a shine on the tone of the evening Monday with  these words: "When I heard I had AIDS, my first reaction was . . . arrrrgghh! I  first learned about it on my birthday, July 18, 1988. I had to check into the  County-USC Medical Center. That's where you go when you don't have any  insurance. It's for indigents."  </P> <P> A little music, maestro. And Nicholson sashays into a fanciful ditty called  "Funeral Tango" by Jacques Brel. Later he uncorks his version of an AIDS  television commercial: "Hi. AIDS got you down?"  </P> <P> Nicholson is not the first performer to deal humorously with a personal  scourge. But he may be the first person with AIDS to turn the alphabet soup --  HIV, ARC, AZT -- into a tuneful entertainment.  </P> <P> For the record, Nicholson looks good. This is not a dreary or sentimental  event. This is a man who refuses to knuckle under because he was dealt a bad  hand. At the end of the two-act show, he ad libs, "I wanted to get out of  therapy and put (the therapy) into a show."  </P> <P> His running chatter is not as smooth as it could be, although his star  impersonations, especially a lily-festooned Katharine Hepburn, are choice. He  barely negotiates a satiric, black humor routine (from the dripping pen of  comedy writer Bruce Vilanch) about prescribed rules of etiquette at an AIDS  memorial service. But what salvages his performance is his affecting  self-consciousness. Why shouldn't he be a little nervous? In a show like this,  you couldn't cope with Mr. Slick.  </P> <P> Of course, there's palpable compassion in some of the music. Rear scrim  projections of patches from the National AIDS Quilt display blow-ups names of  AIDS victims. These are wrenchingly accompanied by Nicholson's personal vocal,  "Remember Their Names" (written with on-stage, unobtrusive keyboardist Michael  Orland).  </P> <P> Nicholson's strong suit is belting out the rousing "The God Why Don't You Love  Me Blues" (Sondheim) and "Shakin' the Blues Away" (Berlin).  </P> <P> The title song, "One Voice" (Manilow), and most of the production's material  and technical values were a collaborative donation by people in the  entertainment community to celebrate the power of living and performing with  acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The director is Sally Fisher.  </P> <P> The audience was predominantly white and male. That is the lamentable truism  about gay theater.  </P> <P> But as Nicholson noted for the rest of the world out there, "It's unreasonable  to think this crisis can't touch you." And he then sharply catalogued the  ignorance: "AIDS is illegal in Texas, in Cuba they quarantine AIDS patients --  and forget about going to Japan!"  </P> <P> A portion of the show's proceeds will benefit five Los Angeles-based AIDS  organizations.  </P> <P>  At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., Mondays only, 8 p.m., through July 10. Tickets:  $15. (213) 659-2400 and (213) 642-4242.  </P></p>

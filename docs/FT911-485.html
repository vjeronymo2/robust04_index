			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Words and connections - Radio WHO WOULD ever have expected to hear a reporter on the use of words? Radio 3 has been giving us little Sunday talks on Words for a time now, but from a literary or academic standpoint. Now for a month they have Kate Adie, a reporter, a woman reporter at that, and her choice of words is not only that of a reporter but of a television reporter, not quite the same creature. 'Hello' was her first word study - a greeting increasingly common with us. I don't think it matters how you spell it, as Ms Adie devoted her time to its adjuncts ('How are you?') and its alternatives ('Good day, morning, afternoon, evening'). She was likeable and interesting, and evidently as able on radio as she is on vision. Tomorrow, hear her on 'belief', with its chief connections, fairies, God and ghosts. One word she is not to assess is 'apartheid'. No doubt there are people in Britain as well as in South Africa who believe in that, but they are likely to find public approval as easily as rapists. In Radio 1's Unbroken Spirit on Monday we heard occasional white South African voices insisting that the country belonged to them - because, for example, they had fought for it, though I don't think they meant that they fought the British forces in 1899. But the programme was intended as an impartial argument, not even between the ANC and the Nkatha. It was an hour-long feature built around a poem written and performed by a black South African poet, Mzwakhe Mbuli of Soweto. The poem used simple, saddening phrases repeated again and again, with archives from recent South African history inserted as counterpoints - 'Imagine what life could have been like]' 'What a shame, Africa]', the 'shame' being such matters as the death of Steve Biko, the imprisonment of Sisulu and Mandela, and so on. We heard Archbishop Tutu, and we heard Verwoerd, Botha and de Klerk. I hope it won't sound as if I am on the wrong side if I say that 'what life could have been like' was life over the border in Botswana, or up north in Kenya (to which Mzwakhe gave its long 'e', bless him.) The feature might well have kept a black South African audience rapt, but I should be surprised if many listeners to Radio 1 stayed with it for long, certainly not for its full hour. All the same, I think it was right to have scheduled it, especially at two o'clock on a Monday afternoon. Now how about anti-apartheid promotion of the kind that average Radio 1 listeners would stick with, like its information about Aids? And since I am with Radio 1, I have to apologise that Paul Simon, about to be celebrated in seven programmes, is not my cup of tea, though I used sometimes to listen to Simon and Garfunkel in the 1960s. Radio 3's Sunday play, Kingdom of Crows and Carrion, was adapted from stories in the Mabinogion by David Calcutt. The Mabinogion, Welsh mythical tales from the 14th century, is described by BBC publicity as 'an unbreakable cycle of murders, curses and revenge', and this is just what Calcutt has made it. 'It will take a long time,' says Gwydion the magician, and so it does. King Pwyll, who lives under his mother's curse, swops a year of his life with Arawn, king of the underworld, on condition that his wife Rhiannon is not touched. But of course she is, so Pwyll casts her adrift in a boat. She curses him and has two children, son Pryderi and daughter Aranrhed. Pwyll is killed hunting a white hart (really Rhiannon) and Pryderi becomes king. Aranrhed curses him, never to have a wife, but he takes up with Blodeuedd. Her brother Math tricks Pryderi into war, and kills him (by magic) in single combat. When Math dies he is succeeded by his son Lleu (whom we met earlier disguised as an eagle). There is more yet, more of the murders and curses. Blodeuedd ends up as an owl. I think the play should have been done as a serial, so the director, Nigel Bryant, and the singers could have infused extra freshness. It is too repetitious, too much on the one note, to stay charming for an hour and three-quarters.</p>

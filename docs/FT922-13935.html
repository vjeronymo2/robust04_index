			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Nokia Data slows fall at ICL ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, was profitable in 1991, albeit at a reduced level, in the worst trading environment the computer industry has experienced. Operating profit was Pounds 78m, a 30 per cent decline on the previous Pounds 112m. Revenue, however, rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.87bn. The rise reflected a three-month contribution from Nokia Data, the Finnish personal computer operation bought last year. There were also contributions from ICL's investment in CFM and Sorbus, the European computing services companies specialising in maintenance and facilities management. Without these contributions, revenue growth was essentially flat, emphasising the effect of the recession on the company's main markets in the US, UK and mainland Europe. Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive, said the group's performance had been creditable in a difficult year. The group had incurred substantial expenses as a result of the Nokia acquisition and new product introductions. Research and development costs increased 4 per cent to Pounds 223m. However, it was the first time the company had demonstrated that it could increase its market share in Europe. The majority of its traditional competitors lost money last year. Net earnings amounted to Pounds 39m; after ordinary dividends, the company will retain net cash of Pounds 31m. Group borrowings are now Pounds 51m, equivalent to gearing of 17 per cent. Mr Bonfield said he thought the current year would be as difficult as 1991. However, he expected revenues to increase with the complete assimilation of Nokia. Research expenses - now second in the UK only to Glaxo in terms of expenditure per head - would grow but as a smaller percentage of sales. ICL, owned 80 per cent by Fujitsu and 20 per cent by Northern Telecom of Canada, has no need to report its results separately, but is doing so both to emphasise its arm's-length relationship with its main shareholder and to prepare for its eventual flotation on the London stock market. It is committed to floating at least 25 per cent of its equity within the next three years at a minimum price of 225p a share.</p>

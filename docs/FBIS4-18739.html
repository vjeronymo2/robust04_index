			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "kett": "Greens' No to European Union Is Now </F> Set"]    [Excerpt] Vienna -- Austrian People's Party [OeVP]  Chairman Erhard Busek indicated on Saturday [9 April] that his  party will not make a recommendation for the European Union [EU]  referendum on 12 June. In contrast, Karl Krammer, chief of  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's cabinet, stated that a party has to  take a clear position on such an important question.    Yesterday, Sunday, the Greens set their "no." The party is  to make a relevant "recommendation without patronizing" for the  referendum at the end of April. Yesterday, the extended federal  executive committee agreed unanimously on this. Federal  Spokesman Peter Pilz stated that he had submitted the relevant  motion to the committee.

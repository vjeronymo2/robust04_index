Gladkikh: ``Cholera Virus in Razdolnaya </F> River''; boldface as published in source text]    [Text] Cholera virus -- what is called cholera vibrio  -- has been discovered in the Razdolnaya River (Primorskiy  Kray).    The administration and local sanitary-epidemiological  services are treating this as exceptionally important and are  seriously worried. The Razdolnaya River, which flows into Amur  Bay, flows along large population centers through virtually the  entire Primorye territory. In view of this fact, physicians are  seriously worried that an epidemic may break out at any moment.</p>

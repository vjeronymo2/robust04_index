			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nigerian divestment agreed by Unilever Unilever, the UK-Dutch consumer goods group, has agreed plans to divest from its Nigerian affiliate, UAC, in which it has a 40 per cent stake valued at around Dollars 46m. UAC has evolved from a trading operation into Nigeria's largest manufacturing, packaging and distribution conglomerate, with the 60 per cent Nigerian-owned shares held by both private and institutional investors. Unilever will re-invest the cash from the divestment in its core sectors, including food and personal products. UAC will remain the flagship company of Nigeria but without foreign ownership and management for the first time in its 74-year history. The Nigerian authorities approved a complex restructuring of UAC and the transfer of Unilever's assets to a new holding company, Unilever Nigeria, ensuring that no capital leaves Nigeria. Unilever will retain its 40 per cent share in UAC's tractors and equipment division (the Caterpillar dealership), which will become a separate joint venture, and acquire all the shares in AJ Seward, the consumer goods arm. The two holdings account for half the value ofstake in UAC. Unilever will sell its shares in the other divisions of UAC and re-invest the capital in new ventures in Nigeria, all under the newly-formed Unilever Nigeria. Unilever's remaining UAC shares (worth about Dollars 21m at the current share price) will be offered for sale to the public at the same time as UAC issues new shares. Company sources say that subject to clearance by an extraordinary general meeting in May and by the courts in June, the share offer will follow as soon possible.</p>

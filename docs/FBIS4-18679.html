			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Central Bank President Jean-Claude </F> Trichet by Werner Benkhoff and Klaus C. Engelen in Paris on 29  March: "The Central Bank in Paris `Knows How To Protect Its  Independence'"]    [Text] The Bank of France -- which was released from the  government's guardianship in terms of monetary policy at the  beginning of the year -- knows how to protect its independence  and consistently continue its policy of stability, its governor  said. With another good result: Jean-Claude Trichet, who has  headed the central bank since September, expects the French  inflation rate to drop below 2 percent this year.    In the past few years, France managed to reduce the  traditional difference in inflation to Germany and, as of 1990  and 1991 even managed to reverse it. The rate of inflation is  clearly below Germany's. In an interview with HANDELSBLATT,  Trichet emphasized that the two currencies are being regarded as  the central pillars of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism  [ERM]. It was, of course, not easy to get to that stage, he  said, adding that "to break through the vicious circle of high  inflation and high interests requires perseverance."  <H5>  Financial Markets Convinced by Course of Stability </H5>   Yet, the efforts have been worthwhile for the French: The  inflationary trend speaks for itself. The financial markets,  which were originally skeptical whether the French monetary  authorities would be able to maintain a tough policy of  stability, have been converted. This optimism explains why not  only the short-term, but even the long-term interest rates have  long since been adapted to German rates.    Trichet was evasive regarding the question of whether the  French capacity for interest cuts was not limited by the  Bundesbank. Germany and France bear joint responsibility for  the stability of a multilateral exchange rate system. The  monetary policies of the two countries are complementary. His  words suggest that the German and French central banks are  acting on an equal footing.    However, many observers have noticed that the old asymmetry  in the European Monetary System [EMS] continues: The room for  interest cuts of the central banks that are tied to the German  anchor is usually determined by the pace of monetary policy set  by the Bundesbank. The French central bank is no exception  here. External stabilization is also, for the Banque de France,  one of the two interim objectives (apart from the money supply)  on the path toward price stability.    If and when the members of the EMS return to narrower  currency bands and whether such a narrowing is necessary at all  in the letter and spirit of the Maastricht Treaty should be  decided "in a pragmatic and practical and not in an abstract and  theoretical way at the appropriate moment," Trichet said. The  old, close bands of 4.5 percent were extended to 30 percent  under the pressure of foreign currency market speculation in  early August. The Maastricht Treaty only allows a member to  permitted to participate in monetary union if it can keep its  exchange rate within the narrow bands for at least two years  before going over to a single currency.    In retrospect, Trichet justifies the August decision to  abandon the old bands. "We wanted to indicate to the markets at  that time that the key rates were in harmony with the  fundamental economic figures and that we were determined not to  give in to speculation. In particular, we wanted to signal that  exchange rate risks existed for both sides." The financial  markets accepted that, he said, which is why the system was  currently working very well.  <H5>  No Additional Powers for the EMI </H5>   He obviously does not think that initiatives to Europeanize  monetary policy, even in the run-up to monetary union, are  desirable. "In Europe, we have a mechanism of coordination that  has proven to be successful. And then there is the Maastricht  Treaty. We have what we need. I would not recommend any new  ideas." He added: "People should not forget that France's  monetary policy is determined by the French central bank in  Paris by law, in the same way in which German monetary policy is  determined by the Bundesbank."    He would like the European Monetary Institute [EMI],  designed  to prepare for the single currency, to be given all powers laid  down in the Maastricht Treaty on monetary union, but no more,  either. Here, too, Trichet's view is in full agreement with the  Bundesbank, which is not willing to cede its powers and  responsibility on monetary policy prematurely. According to  Trichet, there are currently no plans to give the president of  the EMI the power to act as proxy in negotiations with the  outside world -- such as on exchange rate initiatives with the  United States or Japan. These powers stay with the national  monetary authorities.    Whether it will be possible to stick to the agreed timetable  for monetary union wass answered diplomatically by Trichet: "We  will go through the stages laid down in the Maastricht Treaty  and see where this will take us."    Trichet, his two deputies, and the other six members of the  French Central Bank Council (Conseil de Politique Monetaire)  will still have to work hard to convince people and dispel all  doubts regarding the independence of French monetary policy. A  few months ago, the German Association for the Protection of  Savers voiced its skepticism. It is not enough to make the  central bank autonomous and to make it responsible for monetary  stability; it must also be able to implement decisions even if  these are painful. Distrust toward the French Government  bureaucracy's urge to intervene, which at one point might be  able to affect the autonomous Banque de France, is created when  Paris -- as in the current case of massive subsidies for Air  France and the large Credit Lyonnais bank -- shows that it is  finding it hard to give up old habits.    Critics of the Central Bank Law have mainly pointed to the  passage that sees monetary policy as being part of economic  policy in general. The statute does not clearly define at what  point monetary policy may refuse to support the finance and  economics ministers.    Governor Trichet does not want to accept such objections.  Even the first article of the Central Bank Law, which also bans  the government or any other authority from issuing decrees,  cites price stability as the number-one objective. The law even  bans the Central Bank Council from accepting instructions from  politicians. Trichet points to the country's very high "culture  of stability." How important price stability is for the  government could be seen in August when the EMS bands were  extended. Instead of using the room for abrupt interest cuts  and a devaluation of the franc, as was suspected by many  observers, and thus creating the impression that price stability  was no longer a central objective, there was a quick return to  parity, while interests were cut gradually and continually.  <H5>  New Communicative Tasks </H5>   Even within the business community, which used to call for  devaluation to improve export opportunities, there is now a  growing understanding that only a monetary policy that is geared  toward price stability can bring the economy back on the right  track. "It is also thanks to the French public's very strong  adherence to monetary stability that we have managed to protect  the stability of the franc for more than seven years."    Trichet is aware that the central bank will also have to  explain its policy of stability to a skeptical public, which  will push the Banque de France toward increased public relations  efforts. The formerly tight-mouthed institute has opened its  doors. In monthly and annual reports it now explains its  policy. As happens after Central Bank Council sessions in  Frankfurt, the media are briefed on monetary policy in Paris,  too. Under law, the financial committees of the National  Assembly and the Senate provide an additional forum to explain  the goal of monetary stability. Central Bank Council members  repeatedly gave interviews to journalists, including, for the  second time, also HANDELSBLATT. In talks and conferences we  "make it clear again and again that price stability is in the  interests of all."</p>

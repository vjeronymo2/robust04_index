			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Write-down adds to Harvey Nichols' losses HARVEY NICHOLS, the Knightsbridge store now owned by Mr Dickson Poon, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, lost Pounds 3.5m in the final 13 months of Burton Group's ownership after taking a big stock write-down. The escalation of losses from the previous Pounds 1.6m resulted largely from a Pounds 2.8m write-down on stock as the new owners adopted a more conservative accounting policy. The report for the period to October 3 1991 also serves as completion accounts for the Pounds 60m acquisition. Mr Simon Gardner, Harvey Nichols' company secretary, said that historically Burton had aggregated the value of stock held - lower of cost or net realisable value - but Dickson Concepts had decided to produce a more detailed breakdown of individual stock items, leading to a heavier reduction in value. In the first six months under new ownership, Harvey Nichols nudged into the black, although this did reflect the half of the year which included Christmas. Dickson Concepts is locked in dispute with Burton regarding Harvey Nichols' depreciation policy and a prior year adjustment contained in the company's completion balance sheet. The dispute has been referred to arbitrators and a decision is expected this month, although the amount claimed is less than 2 per cent of the purchase price.</p>

Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims When Petitions for Relief Are Filed Untimely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. Petitions may be accepted at the discretion of the district director at any time prior to commencement of any sanctioning action against a bond principal or the issuance of any notice to show cause against a surety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. If a petition is received untimely, Customs shall first consider the petition as though it had been filed timely and shall determine the amount of mitigation that would have been afforded in the case had the petition been filed timely. For purposes of these guidelines, this determination shall be known as the base amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Once the base amount has been determined, Customs shall calculate the number of calendar days that the petition is late and charge an additional mitigation amount of 0.1 percent (.001) per day. In no case shall the additional amount be less than $100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. If the bond principal fails to file a petition during the time period provided by regulation, but then files a petition during the period in which the surety, by regulation, could file a petition, that petition will be considered as a late petition. The number of days late shall be calculated from the end of the 60-day petitioning period afforded to the principal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of all bond cancellation standards (Sections I&hyph;XII), the term value shall mean value as determined under 19 U.S.C. 1401a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9118 Filed 4&hyph;12&hyph;94; 12:28 pm] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4820&hyph;02&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Two die in South Africataxi protest LAW and Order Minister Hernus Kriel declared Johannesburg an emergency area yesterday, giving police special search and arrest powers after the death of two people in violent demonstrations by black taxi drivers, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress condemned the declaration as an attempt to obscure the real grievances of the taxi drivers. Police shot dead one man and wounded at least three others when they opened fire on a mob attacking a white motorist in central Johannesburg, police said. Witnesses said a second man died when police opened fire to clear a blockade erected by the protesting taxi drivers. The killings came as two days of violence accompanied the strike by taxi drivers alleging harassment.</p>

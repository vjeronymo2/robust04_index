			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The report on the trial of former  Albanian President Ramiz Alia and nine high-level party and  state communist functionaries has just been finished. Marash  Mirashi reports:    [Mirashi] Today's hearing opened with a request by Chairman  Celiku for silence, due to the extreme heat and the large number  of correspondents in the courtroom. It could be said that this  is also a moral trial being conducted against the former party  state.    [Begin former Interior Minister Simon Stefani recording] We  should in no way forget that the Party of Labor [PPSh] at that  time was not only a political organization, or rather the only  party in power, but it was in fact a state party that performed  state functions. [end recording]    [Begin former Interior Minister Hekuran Isai recording] We  were a party state. The party decisions had a state power that  was obligatory for the state and for society. The role of party  state relied on the constitutional law. That is how it was.  [end recording]    The defendants -- Simon Stefani, Hekuran Isai, and Ramiz  Alia  -- explained the indictment against them at today's hearing. It  should be stressed that the defendants categorically negated  everything as if they were inhabitants of an unexplored planet  and not the main characters of an unprecedented dictatorship.    While most of the trial proceedings were being conducted in  the hall, the shivering victims were in other halls of the  Tirana Court testifying to correspondents [passage omitted  including indistinct recorded passages]:    In his deposition, Stefani negated the charges, stating that  his entire activity was in conformity with the law. According  to him, nothing makes him responsible -- not the abuse of  official position, the murders on the border, or his  contribution to drafting the platform on state security.    While the evidence points to Stefani for the assassinations  of a number of citizens on the southern border, he declared at  the trial that he had not given any order. However, a telegram  states the contrary. This is a political trial, he said.    Prosecutor Thana defended the indictment by building on  authentic facts. Chairman Celiku then read the text of the  telegram, which placed Simon Stefani in a very serious position.  The defendant said that no one dared to oppose the Politburo.  Chairman Celiku then asked him to recall several names of  Politburo members during his time. Stefani named some 10  Politburo members, dead and alive, including himself.    Chairman Celiku later requested some explanations from  Hekuran Isai. He gave an extremely long speech of a theoretical  character, which, at times, was mixed with a typical communist  irony. He also admitted nothing. He said that the indictment  is political. Meanwhile, the defendant, in general, expressed  himself against the class struggle. I expressed my convictions  against the class struggle even when I was interior minister, he  said. I have never acted against the law. I have always  applied decisions by the PPSh accurately.    The defense counsel of Isai proceeded to say that his client  should be thanked for his tolerance and soothing of the  dictatorship.    The chairman of the judicial body and the prosecutor asked  Isai to explain the exiles and evictions. The defendant said  that, while he was deputy chairman of this commission, he  approved only 112 such decisions.    The explanations by Alia, though at an hour of hot and muggy  weather, were received with interest by the media. The former  head of state declared himself to be a political prisoner and,  consequently, innocent. The former president claimed no  responsibility. On the contrary, he claimed several merits.  The indictment does not blame me in a legal way, Alia said. I  did not participate in a conspiracy and I did not abuse my  position. I have not approved the movement against religion  alone in the Politburo, but together with the others, after we  were convinced in the youth's movement against the religious  cult.    The defense counsel claimed Alia to be innocent. We cannot  judge on a former head of state.    Meanwhile, Chairman Celiku and Prosecutor Thana told him  that  we are not judging and charging Alia as a former president but  on the basis of stored charges. The next hearing begins at 0900  tomorrow.</p>

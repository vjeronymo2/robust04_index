			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Deportation rules to be reviewed THE Home Office confirmed yesterday that it intends to carry out a joint review with the Metropolitan police of procedures used in cases of deportation that require an arrest. This follows the death of Joy Gardner last Sunday. The review will look at the specific rules that cover the behaviour of police and immigration officers before an illegal immigrant is arrested for deportation. The review is less than the full public inquiry requested by Mrs Gardner's family. It will be carried out by senior immigration officers and a senior officer from the Metropolitan police. The inquiry will investigate in particular the equipment used by the authorities to restrain violent deportees. Mrs Gardner died after being subdued in a struggle with officers trying to arrest her for deportation at her flat in Hornsey, north London. The proposed joint review is in addition to the internal investigation already being carried out by the Home Office into the work of Scotland Yard's deportation unit. Yesterday Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, said that while she regretted Mrs Gardner's death, she had been 'bumming on the social services for five years'. Mrs Gorman told the BBC: 'She has cost the . . . taxpayer an enormous amount of money. If she had gone quietly none of this would have happened.'</p>

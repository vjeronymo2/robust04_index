			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: No urging on ERM Sir, I am writing in connection with your article 'Japanese urge Britain to re-enter ERM' (January 28). This referred to a speech given by Minister Tamon Kitabatake of this embassy to a seminar held by the Anglo-Japanese Parliamentary Group on January 27. When I read the article I was concerned that the headline and the first paragraph might be somewhat misleading, as they imply that Japan is urging Britain to re-enter the exchange rate mechanism. What Mr Kitabatake stressed was the importance of a stable pound for Japanese investment. He did not urge Britain to re-enter the ERM. We appreciate that re-joining the ERM is a matter of considerable political and economic significance, and we would certainly not take it upon ourselves to urge upon the UK government any particular course of action. Yasuo Nozaka, director, Japan Information and Cultural Centre, Embassy of Japan, 101-104 Piccadilly, London W1V 9FN</p>

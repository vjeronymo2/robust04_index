			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wickes calls for Pounds 10m to fund retail expansion WICKES, the do-it-yourself retailer which was rescued last year with a Pounds 42.6m rights issue, yesterday called on investors to fund a Pounds 10m retail expansion in the UK and continental Europe. The group, which operates 102 stores in the UK, Belgium, Holland and France, announced plans for 17 new outlets to be opened next year. All but two would be opened in the UK and some 350 new jobs would be created as a result. Stockbrokers SG Warburgs yesterday placed 13.5m new shares with institu-tions at 72 1/2 p, raising a total of Pounds 9.8m, to fund the expansion. The new shares represent less than 5 per cent of the existing equity. Wickes' shares closed last night 2p down at 75p. Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said the group was taking the opportunity to ex-pand when sites were cheap, in spite of tough trading conditions. 'We are not looking at the economy through rose-coloured spectacles in 1993, but we do expect some recovery in 1994,' he said. Wickes, which incurred losses of Pounds 7m last year, is forecast to report profits of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 8.5m for the year to the end of December. Debt is expected to be lower than the Pounds 84m reported at the half-way stage.</p>

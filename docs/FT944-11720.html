			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MMT up 45% to Pounds 2.5m and plans full quote MMT Computing, the USM-quoted computer services company, lifted pre-tax profits 45 per cent from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.51m in the year to August 31. Mr Mike Tilbrook, chairman, said the result was helped by an easing of the tough trading conditions prevalent in the last few years. He said the group's policy of working primarily for blue chip and household name clients was the right one. He added that MMT planned to move to a full quote 'in the near future'. Turnover of continuing operations advanced to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 7.06m) generating operating profits of Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.1m). The final dividend is raised to 3.7p (2.75p), making 5.2p (4p) for the year, payable from earnings of 13.1p (9p).</p>

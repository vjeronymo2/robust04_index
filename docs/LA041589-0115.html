			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY ILLNESS THAT HIT 18 STUDENT SINGERS IS DIAGNOSED AS HYSTERIA  </P> <P> A mysterious illness that struck 18 student singers and triggered the  evacuation of 2,550 people during a concert at the Santa Monica Civic  Auditorium has been diagnosed as mass hysteria, authorities said.  </P> <P> Although all of the stricken youngsters were treated and released at local  hospitals for ailments ranging from dizziness and nausea to headaches and  fainting, Santa Monica fire officials were unable to find evidence of fumes or  toxic substances that could have caused the phantom outbreak Thursday night.  </P> <P> "The Fire Department searched the auditorium with a . . . toxic fume detector  and found no indication of a hazard," said Fire Chief William Pajaras at a  press conference Friday. "A full search was completed, and no physical cause  was found. It's tough to make it look like you're not ridiculing the kids, but  the mind can really play tricks."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reacting to Heat, Stress and Anxiety  </P> <P> Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Supervisor Eugene Tucker suggested  that the youngsters were "reacting to heat and stress (and) general anxiety  from earlier in the day when one or two youngsters fainted."  </P> <P> Health experts called the incident a classic case of mass hysteria, explaining  that it usually afflicts female adolescents or preadolescents involved in  psychologically or physically stressful situations.  </P> <P> "All it takes is one person with a real illness and sympathetic people around  who are tensed up for some reason, and it spreads like wildfire," said Shirley  Fannin, associate deputy director of disease control programs for the Los  Angeles County Health Department. "But the key is that there is no pathological  or objective signs of illness."  </P> <P> Dr. Gary Small, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the UCLA Medical School  who has studied outbreaks of mass hysteria around the world, said the  phenomenon is not uncommon among students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Crowded Room'  </P> <P> "I observe a few cases a year, most of them around this time when there are  more assemblies and graduation ceremonies," Small said. "Assemblies can be  places where there is not only physical stress because of the crowded room but  also psychological stress. The children performing are excited about being in  front of the audience, but they are also anxious that their performances will  fall short."  </P> <P> Small added, however, that even though there is no physical cause, the symptoms  experienced by victims of mass hysteria are real.  </P> <P> "They feel real and seem real," he said. "Mental anxiety or unconscious  psychological conflicts are converted into a physical symptom."  </P> <P> Margie Ashkar, whose 12-year-old daughter, Amanda, was one of those sent to a  hospital Thursday night, was less than satisfied with such explanations.  </P> <P> "I feel that there was something, maybe in the earlier part of the day, that  was present in the air that the children breathed," Ashkar said. "I don't  believe it was mass hysteria."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, her daughter agreed.  </P> <P> "When I rehearsed in the morning, I smelled something like lacquer that was  really weird," the youngster said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Felt Awful'  </P> <P> "I felt awful and sat with other kids who felt awful too. I was fine until the  end of the performance. Every time I moved my head it hurt. I walked out and  collapsed," Amanda said.  </P> <P> The chain reaction occurred near the end of the first of two performances of  the 40th annual "Stairway-of-the-Stars" program, which is produced by the Santa  Monica-Malibu Unified School District and features 1,100 members of the  district's bands, choruses and orchestras from the 4th through 12th grades.  </P> <P> But anxiety among the performers apparently increased before noon when two  girls fainted and a third complained of nausea during rehearsals at the  auditorium. School officials said all three were friends and were seated near  each other at the time.  </P> <P> Auditorium officials acknowledged that guard rails had been touched up with  white water-based enamel paint in the morning, which could have left a  lingering but harmless smell in the air.  </P> <P> Beyond that, "it was apparent these gals had not eaten all day, and they were  involved in a performance that was stressful," said Barbara Moran, director of  cultural and recreational services for the city of Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "In fact, one of these young ladies had a medical problem that was conducive to  having her faint," she said. "Other youngsters followed the leader. It was a  domino effect."  </P> <P> Blood tests conducted on the youngsters at five local hospitals proved  negative, Pajaras said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Show  </P> <P> Based on information provided by the Fire Department and Santa Monica  officials, Tucker said he decided to permit a second performance of "Stairway"  Friday night at the Civic Auditorium. He acknowledged, however, that crowds  were likely to be smaller.  </P> <P> Because authorities were concerned about a replay of Thursday night's mass  reaction, cameras were prohibited from the auditorium. "Part of the problem  (Thursday night) might have been nervousness" from such attention, said Santa  Monica Police Sgt. John Miehle.  </P> <P> A young violinist, on his way into the hall for Friday's performance, said he  hadn't noticed any unusual smells the night before. "I think it's like they  said on the news," the teen-ager said. "I think it was hysteria."  </P> <P> Thursday's outbreak was similar to one that took place in 1982 when 127 people  attending a high school football game in East Los Angeles were sent to  hospitals complaining of nausea, stomach pains and chills. The mass hysteria  was apparently triggered by cheerleaders who complained of feeling ill after  drinking soft drinks.  </P> <P> "People on both sides of the football stadium were drinking Coke from the same  dispensers," Fannin said of the incident. "On one side, 127 people went to the  hospital."  </P> <P> In Israel a year later, 300 students at six Palestinian girls schools fell ill,  and health officials there suggested mass hysteria was the cause.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Patt Morrison contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / BA to restore cabin crew pay BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday agreed to go back on pay cuts of up to 10 per cent it imposed on 450 cabin crew staff at Gatwick airport when it acquired Dan Air last November, Robert Taylor writes. The move, which will cost the company Pounds 400,000 in backdated salary, followed an application to an industrial tribunal by the TGWU general union on behalf of 280 staff involved in the pay cuts. BA said it intended to restore the cabin crews' basic pay to its original level - backdated to November 7 last year - and to restore pay supplements which were reduced at the same time. Staff can expect to receive between Pounds 750 and Pounds 2,000 as a result.</p>

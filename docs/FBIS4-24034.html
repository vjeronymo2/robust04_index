			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] categorically  rejects and strongly opposes French military intervention  throughout Rwandan territory. [passage omitted]    In addition to the RPF, numerous countries, notably those in  the Great Lakes region, have also made public their opposition  to French military intervention in Rwanda. We have spoken, for  example, of the reaction of Tanzanian Prime Minister John  Malecela, who condemned the French intervention in Rwanda,  because the OAU and United Nations are dealing genuinely with  the Rwandan issue. [passage omitted]    The situation is similar in Zaire. The opposition there  condemned French military intervention in Rwanda, and asked the  Zairean Government not to back the French, notably by giving  them a military base. Another neighboring country is Uganda:  President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who is on a visit to the  United States, has stated that French military intervention in  Rwanda will be a disaster, as it is opposed by the RPF.    It is worth recalling at this juncture that the RPF has made  this clear, by warning the international community and those  countries who ally themselves with France. This French  intervention risks going beyond Rwanda's borders, and might even  set the whole region ablaze. [passage omitted]</p>

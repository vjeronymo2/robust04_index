			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Brussels draft budget shows money to spare: Main saving to come on farm subsidies THE European Commission yesterday presented its 1993 draft budget which at first sight shows the EC has money to spare, thereby undermining its own controversial plan to increase Community revenue 35 per cent by 1997. The full 'appropriations' budget would rise from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.62bn) this year to Ecu67.3bn in 1993, a rise of only 1.1 per cent, against average spending rises in the member states of 7 per cent. This compares with an 11.3 per cent rise in last year's EC budget and a 19 per cent increase the year before. Actual spending this year is forecast at Ecu63.1bn, and Ecu64.3bn next year. This means that spending in 1992 is below target and that the Commission is in real terms pitching next year's target below this year's likely outcome. The EC's revenue ceiling is equivalent to 1.2 per cent of Community gross national product. This year's forecast outcome would be well within the ceiling at 1.11 per cent, whereas next year's target would be 1.1 per cent. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, however, still wants to raise the revenue base to 1.35 per cent of GNP by 1997, under its new five-year finance plan. Net contributors to the budget, led by Germany and the UK, will see the draft budget as confirming their argument that the revenue base should not be raised that high because there is enough 'headroom' under the existing ceiling to accommodate EC spending ambitions. These ambitions are reflected in the planned 19 per cent rise in regional spending, from Ecu18.6bn this year to Ecu22.1bn next. This includes Ecu1.6bn for the 'cohesion fund' to help poorer member states catch up with average EC living standards. Spending on external aid and foreign policy, and on research, rises 13 per cent, from Ecu3.6bn to Ecu4.1bn, and from Ecu2.5bn to Ecu2.8bn respectively. These priorities and the cohesion fund were agreed at December's Maastricht summit, but the only attempt to attach sums to them is the so-called 'Delors II' five-year finance plan which is likely to be whittled down by member states. The main saving for 1993 is on farm spending, forecast to drop from Ecu35.3bn to Ecu32.1bn - the first time since the EC was founded that agriculture has absorbed less than half the budget. This estimate is based on current world prices and the strength of the dollar, and also incorporates modest savings from the Commission's farm reform plan which has yet to be agreed. But this picture could easily change. Lower farm spending and more 'cohesion' finance are also likely to increase pressure on the UK to give up some of the budget rebate it won from 1985, conceded because it did relatively badly out of a bigger agriculture budget. Germany, by far the largest net contributor, intends to press for a reduction of this Ecu2bn rebate, and Mr Delors on Tuesday told Socialist Euro-MPs that 'consideration of the British situation could be different from in the past'. Commission budget officials said yesterday they would recommend whether to 'continue, modify or abolish' the rebate later this month.</p>

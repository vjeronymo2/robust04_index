			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RISE IN RETAIL SALES MAY END WITH JUNE GAINS, ANALYSTS SAY  </P> <P> The nation's major retailers today reported that store sales rose modestly in  June, but analysts said the month's solid performance may be the last in an  increasingly lackluster year.  </P> <P> While Wall Street analysts said the June gains will help retailers salvage  respectable profits in the second quarter, the rest of the year looks more  bleak as recession fears spread and comparisons with 1988's strong results  become more difficult.  </P> <P> "Retailers will be up against big numbers in the second half. It's going to be  harder for them to improve margins," said retailing analyst David Williamson of  Advest Group Inc.  </P> <P> Sales at Sears, the nation's largest retailer, gained 3.6% last month, while  they rose 2.3% at K mart, the second-largest merchandiser. Same-store sales at  J. C. Penney gained 5.6%. Specialty apparel retailers Gap Inc. and The Limited  Inc. made same-store sales increases of 13% and 12%, respectively.  </P></p>

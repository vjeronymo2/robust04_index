			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWSUIT FILED OVER GRIFFITH PARK NOISE  </P> <P> A Los Feliz resident filed a $500-million claim against the city of Los Angeles  Thursday as a prelude to a class-action suit that he said would seek damages  for noise, traffic and community disruption caused by commercial programming at  the Greek Theatre and Griffith Park Observatory.  </P> <P> Real estate broker Barney Feldman, who is not represented by a lawyer, said the  claimed amount would compensate a class of 25,000 residents of the Los Feliz  area for 25 years of suffering.  </P> <P> Feldman said the city could avoid a lawsuit by pledging to enforce municipal  laws, such as those regulating noise and prohibiting the consumption of alcohol  in parks.  </P> <P> "It doesn't say in the law, 'except the Greek Theatre,' " Feldman said.  </P> <P> In 1985, Feldman was successful in forcing the city to put up a fence to keep  golf balls from the Roosevelt Golf Course in Griffith Park out of his yard.  </P></p>

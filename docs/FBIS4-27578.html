			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Reason for the President's Visit to Russia"] </F>   [Text] President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia to begin on  1 June is significant in that it will complete the basic frame  of the ROK's tetragonal diplomacy. With President Kim's  forthcoming Russia visit, which will follow his visit to the  United States in November 1993 and to Japan and China in March  1994, it appears to us that he gives priority in dealing with  countries that are most important to us.    We hope that President Kim's tetragonal diplomacy will  provide an important momentum for peace and reunification of the  Korean peninsula and for durable peace in Northeast Asia. Since  we cannot help but be concerned about the North Korean nuclear  issue, we have great expectations of cooperation from strong  neighboring countries that can exert considerable influence upon  North Korea.    In particular, we have many difficulties in building new  relations with Russia because it still maintains political,  diplomatic, economic, and military relations with North Korea  that were established in the age of the former Soviet Union  empire. Rapid improvement out of need and sudden cooling down  have alternated in ROK-Russian relations mainly because Russia's  policy on the Korean peninsula has been in a transition period.    Accordingly, the most important task of President Kim's  upcoming visit to Russia is to show Russia a new direction to  completely free itself from the former Soviet Union's policy on  the Korean peninsula. The ROK should become a country with  which is worth trying to expand relations.    To achieve this goal, we have to seriously reflect on the  trials and errors in our relations with Russia, and humbly  reassess Russia's potential. Although our expectations,  amplified in those early days of improved relations between the  two countries, have turned into dissatisfaction, we should not  maintain our present view of Russia. We should know the fact  that our efforts can give more room for interests that can be  obtained in mutual cooperation with Russia.    It is true that there are many delicate pending issues  between the ROK and Russia. However, they might be minor  problems to be solved through a long-term basis approach of  relations between the two countries.    Russia should also assume a fresh diplomatic attitude to  achieve the goal it had when improving its relations with us  while treating North Korea inhospitably. It is important for  Russia to abandon the policy of putting South and North Korea on  the scales and to pursue the true worth. We can also be very  helpful to Russia. We should be mindful so as to prevent  impolite happenings from hurting our self-esteem as it  repeatedly has happened every time there is a summit.    We have special interest in multifold diplomacy that  President Kim Yong-sam will pursue after he visits all the four  strong neighboring countries. We have been unilaterally  influenced by neighboring countries throughout a long history.  Now we have to grow up enough to influence our neighboring  countries. This is not a mere illusion as long as diplomatic  power is not in proportion to the size of the territory and  population of a country.</p>

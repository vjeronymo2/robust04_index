Belarusian Prime Minister Bets on Russian  Parliament"]    [Text] Addressing the closed meeting of the Belarusian  parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich explained  the situation with regard to the unification of Belarus' and  Russia's monetary systems. In his view, talks between the two  countries' expert groups have reached a stalemate after "Mr.  Tulin, deputy Central Bank chairman, Mr. Kazmin, deputy finance  minister, and some others revised the documents, a procedure  that has entirely distorted the original draft treaty that was  to be signed."    The issue is, first of all, what the Minsk Government sees  as  unacceptable demands that the two countries' budgets be merged  and that the Belarusian National Bank [BNB] be stripped of its  independence. In Mr. Kebich's view, these demands have emerged  under pressure from certain deputy factions both at the State  Duma and the Federation Council.    The general tone of Mr. Kebich's address was nonetheless  optimistic. Citing a telephone conversation with his Russian  colleague, Viktor Chernomyrdin, he said that "the Russian  leaders have expressed their political will and unequivocal  desire to sign the document, which discusses setting up a money  union, as early as this month." Mr. Kebich said that "according  to preliminary forecasts, most political factions and committees  at the Russian State Duma support the idea of creating an  economic and monetary union of the two Slavic states."    On Friday, the Belarusian prime minister had a telephone  conversation with Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Russian  Federation Council's Financial Committee. According to Mr.  Kebich, it was said during the conversation that "regarding the  terms set by State Duma and Federation Council factions, all  political demands have been withdrawn and will no longer be  made." All who did make such political demands, the Belarusian  prime minister said, were trying to thwart the signing of the  agreement.    On Monday, Nikolay Gonchar is expected to arrive in Minsk  "to  agree on all final stances." Any unification of the two  countries' budgets or infringement on the BNB's rights will not  be even mentioned in the talks.    Inspired by the prospects, the Supreme Soviet has suspended  the discussion on Belarus' monetary policy. A paragraph of the  draft decree on the subject was planned to set forth that "the  sole legal tender in the territory of the Republic" will be the  BNB's banknote -- the ill-famed "hare" -- which is currently  traded at around 0.15 Russian ruble. Pending news from Moscow,  the Supreme Soviet has once again adjourned the session until 29  March.</p>

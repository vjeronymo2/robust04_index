			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Oral hearings on pension equality - European Court The European Court of Justice will today begin the oral hearings in the Coloroll Pension Trustees' equal pension rights case, along with test cases from Germany and Holland which raise similar issues. The court must decide whether equality is required only for pension benefits earned by service since May 17, 1990, the date of the Barber judgment, or for benefits which become payable after May 17, 1990, whether they were earned by service before or after that date. The difference in the cost of these interpretations to British pension schemes has been estimated at Pounds 40bn. In the Barber case the ECJ ruled that the EC equal pay rules were applicable to pension claims, but only from the date of that judgment. In 1992, this restriction was enshrined as a protocol in the Maastricht Treaty. The court will also have to decide whether the equal pay requirements of the Rome Treaty ban the use of mortality tables which reflect the differing life expectancy of men and women. If they do, annuities, tax-free lump sums, money-purchase benefits and transfer values will all have to be calculated on a unisex basis. This is a requirement of the Equal Rights Amendment in the US, but not usual in Europe. As a measure of how important this case is to EC governments, the court will hear submissions from 16 parties including the UK, Ireland, Holland Germany and Denmark. Joined Cases C-109/91, C-152/91 and C-200/91: G C Ten Oever v Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds voor het Glazenwassers, January 26, 1993. Restriction on consumer protection under the Brussels Convention In a case involving the Brussels Convention, the European Court refused to allow a third party to benefit from the Convention's consumer protection rules, even though that third party was relying on rights assigned to it by the consumer who had entered into the contract in dispute. Under the Brussels Convention rules, consumers are entitled, exceptionally, to bring an action in the courts in which they are domiciled - the general convention rules being that proceedings must be brought in the jurisdiction of the defendant's domicile. The case before the court concerned a contract between a German judge and the brokerage house of EF Hutton of New York to carry out certain financial transactions on the judge's behalf. Almost all the money invested was lost. Every order placed by the judge was initially dealt with by the brokerage's German branch. The judge assigned his rights under the contract to a German company. This company brought the action in question against the brokerage house. The court did not consider whether the original contract would have benefited from the convention's consumer protection rules. Instead, it restricted itself to stating that the rules in question, being exceptions from the main principle of jurisdiction in the convention could not go beyond what was laid down in the convention and that it was clear that the rules were only meant to benefit those parties who were not in a position of equality vis-a-vis their co-contracting party. Thus, the plaintiff in this case, who was not the original consumer, could not benefit from the special consumer protection rules. C-89/91: Shearson Lehmann Hutton Inc v TVB mbH, ECJ FC, January 19, 1993. ECJ jurisdiction over EFTA Customs Commission The ECJ ruled last week that it was competent to give a pre-liminary ruling on the decisions of a customs commission, established under the European Free Trade Agreement, even though the acts of the commission were not binding and were incapable of giving rise to rights which could be relied on before the national courts. C-188/91: Deutsche Shell Aktiengesellschaft v Haupzollamt Hamburg-Harburg, ECJ 6CH, January 21, 1993. Reliance on transitional provisions The court dealt with two cases involving Portuguese transitional provisions for the progressive adjustment of its alcohol state monopolies. C-76/91: Caves Neto Costa v Minister for Commerce and Tourism and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, ECJ FC, January 19, 1993. C-361/90: Commission v Portugal, ECJ FC, January 19, 1993.

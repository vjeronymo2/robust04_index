			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] An unattributed article in the 17  December Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE reported that President  Mario Soares confided to various Socialist Party (PS) officials  he would like to effect a rapprochement between socialists and  communists. Citing unidentified sources close to Soares, the  article notes that the president's staff is no longer discussing  the dissolution of the National Assembly, an option Soares had  been rumored to favor for some time. Instead, Soares' staff has  focused on possible cooperation between the PS and the Communist  Party (PCP) in the 1995 parliamentary elections. According to a  source close to the president, the change is the result of the  recent municipal elections. Soares was betting that the PSD  would sustain heavy losses and that the PS would be supported by  a significant number of communists. Disappointed in both  instances, Soares now believes that the best way to defeat Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva is to unite the Left. PS leader Antonio  Guterres, however, seemingly disagrees with the president's new  initiative, the article reports. At a meeting of the party's  political commission, Guterres made clear that the PS will run  alone in the next parliamentary elections and, if elected, would  prefer to govern alone. The article cites a number of  participants at the meeting as stating that the atmosphere was  "very cordial" and that the minority calling for cooperation  with the PCP quickly "lowered its flag." According to the  article, Guterres stated at the same meeting that the PS's  presidential candidate will not be chosen before early 1995,  thus forestalling any talk about his own candidacy.</p>

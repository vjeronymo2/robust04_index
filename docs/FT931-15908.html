			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Gardening: The noble art of boxing DURING THE frost, I had been playing with shapes and marking out possible gardens on a vacant stretch of turf. The basic idea is so old that it ranks as historic, but I would not call it anyone's 'heritage': it is not peculiar to my family, our ancestry or our country. It is ever-so-1993 and sans frontieres: gardeners all over the Mediterranean were playing with it too long before English gardening was special. It involves a series of rectangular beds whose straight edges do not align exactly but project and recede in various patterns. Their shape can be endlessly varied during planning by the use of lines of string marking the possibilities of the ground. This cat's cradle of rope and twine is not so much a blueprint as a greenprint. Its formal pattern is going to define a space in which I intend to grow vegetables, a few herbs and currants: there is a point nowadays in growing your own, as the new varieties of blackcurrant will fruit very well in early autumn. Such a pattern does not have to be a plot for vegetables. It could just as well be the design for a small front garden, a terrace or a series of beds in which to grow tulips, forget-me-nots and summer flowers. Whatever your intention, be sure to observe one cardinal point: do not make the beds and paths too narrow. If your plan is to walk round a formal pattern, you do not want to feel as if you are visiting one of those mini-villages, laid out for children and parents in need of outings. For any purpose, you need a firm, smart edging: for this reason, I have described my experiments as greenprints. Almost everybody knows that a pattern of small, formal beds can be edged with little bushes of evergreen box. There is only one form for this job and its nursery name is buxus suffruticosa. You will see that I think it is unsurpassed. Those who disagree say that box edging is a home for snails and becomes too leggy. I have never found it to be a safe haven for pests and it will never be leggy if you clip it properly in June. Even if you do not, you can restore old box by replanting it more deeply so that all the bare stem lies below ground. It will then grow away at its new level. None the less, gardeners are curious, changes are seductive and we all like to think of something new. What else will frame a flower bed as a neat edging at a height of about a foot? I can think of six candidates, unless you wish to include painted boards or lengths of whalebone, both of which were recommended in antique English gardening books. In my view, they can stay there: nowadays, we can do better. My six alternatives are lavender, cotton lavender, hyssop, germander, parahebe and sarcococca. Each has its merits which the books will describe to you, but if you are ordering enough to edge 50 or 60 yards of flower bed, you need to know the other side. Nobody could complain about lavender in flower. The best form for a low edging is the dark Hidcote variety which has very silver leaves. It makes an edge which is not too wide and it is extremely cheap because anyone can root it from cuttings taken between April and September. However, it is not ideal. Lavenders die out after several years and Hidcote becomes bare in places, like every other variety. In winter, it looks wretched. Lavenders develop an armoury of dark, spiky growth which is chilly and drab out of season. Box, meanwhile, is a lovely shade of green, enhanced by white frosts. Cotton lavender, or santolina, sounds silvery, fluffy and adventurous, but as an edging, it should be avoided. It makes a very broad bush, even if you clip it back to the old wood. Unlike box, it will not stay neat and level; it dies in the middle and its yellow flowers are beastly. It looks much better in a big bed, either by itself as a contrast to evergreens or topiary on the grand scale, or in big formal blocks, alternating with another low evergreen shrub. Hyssop is more promising. It, too, will root with the greatest of ease from cuttings; its leaves are a fresh and everlasting green, although a hard winter will dull them temporarily. The flowers of blue and pink are charming and they divert bees from other areas. 'Purge me with hyssop. . .', as the psalm says, but these little plants are short-lived, brittle under snow and not absolutely hardy, especially on soil with poor or moderate drainage. On clay, a hundred hyssops would be a bad investment. As an edging, germander is prettier. Its formal name is teucrium chamaedrys; it has rose-pink flowers if you allow it, and its leaves are a beautiful green with good texture. It looks its best in a small knot bed at Barnsley House in Gloucestershire where it was the historic brainchild of Rosemary Verey. None the less, there are snags. It lives longer than hyssop, but it is not as hardy as box. Germander is fun to try, but it is not a mainstay. It needs clipping twice in the year, once in spring and once in July after flowering. My other alternatives are more modern and exotic. I love parahebes, those small, evergreen bushes which grow loosely to nine inches and flower in shades of milk-blue, violet or a splendid white. Again, they root freely from cuttings, but I am not yet confident of their total hardiness. As a greenprint, they are best reserved for a low flower bed where their loss would not ruin the line of an entire plan. Sarcococca, by contrast, is as tough as nails. Americans call it sweet box, and indeed the scent is extremely sickly on a clear day, but very welcome as it appears during the next six weeks. The best value for edging is the glossy evergreen one, confusa, but the problem is its cost. At up to Pounds 3 a plant, it becomes too expensive for a long line of patterning, spaced nine inches apart. Sometimes, just sometimes, it will sit and sulk, especially on heavy soils. So, we revolve like the seasons and come back to box, beautifully green and absolutely hardy. You see why I put it first and why gardeners have used it for this purpose during the last 2000 years. Or perhaps you have the ideal box alternative, a seventh in the list, proven, please, to be totally hardy: if so, let us know about it, but be honest in order to be fair.</p>

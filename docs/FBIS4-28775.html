			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article; part four of series entitled </F> "Bureaucrats and the Coalition Government": "Bureaucrats Resist  Drastic Reform of Food Control System"]    [Text] "The contents of this thing have changed completely,  and we have so wanted to change the food control system  drastically." These were the words uttered by Diet member  Muneaki Samejima of the Japan New Party [JNP] as he read a copy  of the policy agreement of the coalition government.  Priority Given to Maintaining the System [subhead]    At a policy discussion meeting of the coalition parties in  mid- April when the Hata government was about to set sail, a  behind-the- scenes battle was fought over the question of  reforming the food control system. A "rough draft" prepared on  16 April had included the position of the JNP "supporting the  reform of the agricultural cooperatives -- by adopting the  market economy in production, distribution, and sales (passage  omitted) -- in order to improve self-sufficiency in foodstuffs."  The draft had included the intention to abolish the existing  rigid Food Control Law and to legislate a new law designed to  help strengthen the competitiveness of Japan's agriculture in  preparation for the tariffication of rice in the future.    But on the morning of 18 April, Norihiko Narita, secretary  to  Prime Minister Hosokawa, appeared at the office of the JNP and  delivered a hand-written, three-page-long revised draft. He  then said that "an overall revision, including the part on  agriculture, is necessary." When he was asked who wrote it, the  secretary avoiding giving a clear-cut answer. Thus, eventually,  a portion of the agreement was revised to read "to utilize the  function of the market economy in the areas of production,  distribution, and sales (passage omitted) while maintaining the  self-sufficiency system for basic foodstuffs." This meant a  change back to the maintenance of the food control system and  the taking of the substance out of the introduction of the  market economy principle.    When asked whether the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,  and  Fisheries [MAFF] intervened with the prime minister's office, a  ranking official of the ministry denied this, saying "I have not  heard anything about that happening." Still, however, he looked  happy with the contents of the agreement and remarked, "Now that  I have seen the expressions used to explain the details, it  seems to me that someone who is familiar with agricultural  administration was involved."    The MAFF started discussing a reform of the food control  system in the beginning of the year following a decision late  last year to partially open the rice market. The public  outpouring of distrust in the system as a result of the  controversy over rice shortages also prompted the ministry to  act. But the ministry's thinking was based on the premise that  the reform should be effected within the existing system, and  such drastic measures as reorganizing or abolishing the Food  Agency were never contemplated.  Meticulous Groundwork Done on Ruling Parties in Advance  [subhead]    Even in the full-scale ruling-opposition parties'  negotiations since the end of May -- with an eye on the  formulation in July of an intermediate report by the  Agricultural Administration Council on the food control system  reform -- the MAFF took the position of wanting to seek the  understanding of the public on the condition that "it will be a  reform within the existing system," and even MAFF Minister  Mutsuki Kato took the position of respecting the bureaucrats'  position, saying "The basic part of the food control system will  be maintained." The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which until  last year had run the agricultural administration in close  concert with the MAFF, was also all for this, with former MAFF  Minister Tomio Yamamoto declaring, "Saying that the food control  system is unnecessary is sheer absurdity."    The MAFF is concerned that it does not have good personal  connections with the coalition parties because there are so few  Diet members in the parties who previously had worked in the  ministry. As such, it recently has been sending out almost every  day its officials to offices of Komeito [Clean Government Party]  and Democratic Socialist Party Diet members in the Diet members  hall, in efforts to gain friends for it. MAFF Vice Minister  Toshihiko Tsuruhiko complained, "Since the Social Democratic  Party of Japan bolted the coalition, this is taking much more  time than it did before." But even a staff official of the  Ministry of Finance said in praise, "We are awed by their  ability to use politicians who are just good for their  purposes." While the winds for the dissolution of the Diet for  a general election may be blowing, the vote- collecting machines  of agricultural areas, such as agricultural cooperatives and  land-improvement districts, are as sound as ever. An officer of  the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperative Associations noted  his union's efforts to approach the ruling coalition parties,  saying, "In the next election, we must think about dividing  votes between the LDP and the ruling coalition parties."  <H5>  "We Are the Ones Who Draw the Picture" </H5>   The MAFF is standing firm against even the voices of the  private sector which are demanding reform. The Administrative  Reform Promotion Headquarters in April asked for an easing of  existing rules against grain dealers newly participating in the  market, but the ministry rejected this, declaring, "That is a  matter that should be taken up by the Agricultural  Administration Council." The ministry is confident it can  control the Agricultural Administration Council because it  believes, "There can be all kinds of discussions, but in the  end, we will be the people who draw the picture."    Within the MAFF, there are some who even strongly resist  considering a reform of the food control system within the  framework of the existing system. As for operations on  reforming the system, the minister's Secretariat is pushing for  a "system of voluntary reductions of farming acreage" which will  enable farmers to choose whether or not to reduce farming  acreage, but many officials of the ministry's Agricultural  Production Bureau are going around speaking negatively of it and  saying, "That is impossible." Even the Food Agency, which wants  to protect the existing interests of wholesale and retail  stores, is not so willing to support the deregulation of  distribution.    The bureaucrats may have heard criticism (made by Kozo  Uchida, a member of the Rice Prime Review Council and the  executive director of the Federation of Economic Organizations  of Japan) saying, "The postwar bureaucrats of the MAFF were  fired up with the ideal of rebuilding the nation's agriculture.  We don't sense any passions from them now." The bureaucrats  want to be deaf to the song of "reform" and to look the other  way.</p>

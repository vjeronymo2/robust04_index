			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS DON'T HAVE SAME BENEFITS  </P> <P> I have 20 years of experience, I hold one degree and three credentials, and  have averaged teaching 200 students each day at Newbury Park High School.  </P> <P> Our district administrators interact with an average of 15 people a day and  they have a secretary. They receive more money plus, when they retire, they  receive full medical coverage, yet teachers do not.  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Unified School District has asked, and expects, its employees  to work under a contract that allows the district to void key sections of the  agreement.  </P> <P> Cost-of-living raises average 7%, while we are being asked by the CVUSD to  accept 4%.  </P> <P> JOAN CHASE  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

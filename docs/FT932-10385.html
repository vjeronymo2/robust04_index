			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A Blue Elephant in Paris - Thai food in some of Europe's capital cities THE PROPOSED site, atop a renowned hotel, offering clear views across the Seine to the Eiffel tower, would have delighted any restaurateur. But Karl Steppe, Belgian chairman of the Blue Elephant group of Thai restaurants, politely turned it down. Instead, he opened his company's fourth restaurant on a site with no views at all in the Rue de la Roquette in the less-impressive Bastille area of Paris (Tel: 47 00 42 84). Explaining his decision, he said: 'How could any French diner believe they were in Thailand when they looked out on to such a unique symbol of France?' Over the past decade, Steppe has discovered that there is another potential answer to that most elusive question: 'What makes a successful restaurant?' He believes that he has succeeded, not just by offering authentic Thai food  -and the growing interest in Indo-Chinese cuisine has obviously been a great advantage - but by offering his European customers a night out in Thailand. Not that Steppe had this in mind when he first visited Thailand, in the late 1970s, when he was an antique dealer on a buying trip. But the ability to quench Europeans' growing Western interest in the Far East, both aesthetically and gastronomically, soon found an outlet when the first Blue Elephant opened in Brussels in 1982. Steppe's Bangkok office now ships two tonnes of Thai produce a week to Europe. Arithmetic also played a crucial part. If the interiors of the Blue Elephant were to resemble Thai villages, complete with rush matting, verdant plants representing the undergrowth, waterfalls and bridges over ponds filled with tropical fish, then Steppe would not have to join fellow restaurateurs in the race for the more fashionable, but increasingly expensive, restaurant locations. Hence, his decision in 1984 to open at the unfashionable end of Fulham Broadway in south west London (tel: 071-385-6595) with views across a busy road to the Underground station. Make the interior unique, he argues, and the exterior is unimportant. Simultaneously, Steppe realised that he could create a new pricing policy. Most restaurant - goers had long associated Indo-Chinese food with quick and cheap eating. His restaurant in Paris is surrounded by Indian and Japanese restaurants with menus at FFr100 (Pounds 12.01). Take the interior up market, staff it with young, permanently smiling Thai waiting staff who bow and hand an orchid to every female diner (the London branch imports 1,500 orchid stalks a week) and you can charge considerably more. Going to the Blue Elephants in London and Paris was an experience. It was certainly an experience for colleagues in the French press - the restaurant writers from Le Monde, L'Express and Le Figaro among others and the Thai ambassador to France - when the Blue Elephant won the Marco Polo-Casanova award for the best ambassador of foreign cuisine in Paris. Sensibly, the Thai chefs did not deviate from the flavours that make their cuisine unique. They used to great advantage lemon grass, chillies, sweet coconut milk, coriander, ginger and peanuts. Banana leaves were served hot, stuffed with steamed fish and dill, and cold, served with diced chicken sweetened with coconut - the latter given a distinct bite by the spring onions underneath. Other dishes reflected the country's proximity to India and China. Beef stewed with Mennam spices showed that the Thai use of spices can be less aggressive than in much Indian cooking but a green chicken curry, using an imported curry paste barely lightened by coconut cream, anaesthetised my lips. Stir fried bean curd and sweet barbecued pork would appeal to any aficionado of Chinese food but the two dishes that most appealed me were distinctly Thai - tapioca balls filled with prawns and peanut followed by satay of piquant meat balls. The Blue Elephant chain is run on strict guidelines. It believes in quality food and wants to ensure that its restaurants are a commercial success. This last factor leads to two caveats. Firstly, the pricing of its individual dishes is steep. In London first courses range from Pounds 5-Pounds 7, main courses Pounds 8-Pounds 10 without rice, cover charge, 15 per cent service - or the Thai beer that you will probably want to order with your food. The style of this food can easily induce you to over-order and it would be prudent to experiment with one of their set meals or, most economically, to take advantage of their keenly priced Sunday buffet (Pounds 14.50 per head). You would be wise to pay by cash or cheque in London. The Blue Elephant charges 15 per cent service but, unashamedly, fails to close off the credit card slips. This is another reason why the government's recent decision not to legislate on restaurant service charges is against the public interest - but that is another story. However, why a restaurant group that has otherwise sought to win over custom in so many original ways should behave in this fashion is beyond me. Blue Elephant restaurants are also at: 1120 Chausee de Waterloo, 1180 Brussels (tel: 374 49 62); and SAS Scandinavia Hotel, 70 Arnager Boulevard, 2300 Copenhagen (33 11 15 00).</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Crime bosses running Vladivostok, says report The Russian far eastern region of Primorye and its capital of Vladivostok, potentially among the richest areas of the country, are now under the control of a 'criminal clique' who defy federal laws, suppress both opposition and independent media and have enriched themselves corruptly. These claims are made in a report by Russia's main liberal party, Russia's Choice. The report by a group of experts caused the country's four main liberal parties - Russia's Choice, Yabloko, Party for Russian Unity and Accord and the Liberal Democratic Union - to appeal to President Boris Yeltsin to delay the gubernatorial elections in the region, scheduled for tomorrow. They said that Mr Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the present governor, had rigged the elections for his victory and that any voting would be farcical. Mr Yeltsin issued a decree last week banning all gubernatorial elections throughout the country - a move aimed, according to his own staff, at stopping Mr Nazdratenko. The Primoye governor at first said he would defy the decree, arguing that elections had been called before the decree had been promulgated, and then yesterday backed down and agreed to postpone tomorrow's vote. The report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, is a catalogue of corruption, rule by fear and flagrant abuse of the law - though much of the testimony is given by the governor's political opponents and he has refused to comment on it. The authors of the report say that Mr Nazdratenko has: dismissed, harassed and even imprisoned many of his opponents; closed down most independent press and the independent television station; created a company with a group of business leaders, which in turn own substantial stakes in more than 200 privatised enterprises in Primorye region; ignored the Russian constitution, federal laws and direct instructions from the government - including one to re-open the television station. The report says that 'most of all, we were struck by a general atmosphere of fear, recalling the bygone days of our totalitarian past'. It quotes the judgment of one of the last remaining independent papers that the senior administrators are 'running the region while increasingly strengthening a lawless, violent, corrupt and unpunished regime, with the toleration and the silence of Moscow'. Among those prepared to speak to the Russia's Choice experts who wrote the report were Mr V Butov, former presidential representative in Primorye. He alleges that he was sacked from his post when he tried to bring the corruption and the violence in the region to the attention of the Russian administration. Mr V Cherepkov, a former mayor of Vladivostok, said he was beaten up by local security forces and dismissed by Mr Nazdratenko on falsified bribery charges. Mr Ivan Ustinov, a member of the state duma (lower house) for the region, told the experts that a 'huge campaign of discrimination and discrediting' had been mounted against him by Mr Nazdratenko - including a false accusation of building seven dachas for rent outside Moscow with state money and the publication of false testimony of his illegal activities as head of the Nakhodka Free Economic Zone. Mr T Romanenko, leader of the Russia's Choice organisation in the region, said the governor obliquely threatened his daughter after he had published articles critical of him. The charges and counter-charges in part reflect the particularly chaotic nature of growth in Vladivostok and the surrounding areas - where Moscow's laws are far away and where trade, criminality and self-enrichment have grown steeply in the past two years. Journalists appear to have been particularly badly affected. According to the report, 12 have petitioned for exit visas to the US, claiming the status of political refugees.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUR-STATE SURVEY OFFERS INSIGHTS INTO REGIONAL DIFFERENCES;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIANS FOUND RELIGIOUS, BUT IN UNORTHODOX WAY  </P> <P> Californians, who tend to be rootless and highly mobile, are about twice as  likely not to have any religious affiliation as are residents of other parts of  the nation, a new survey has found.  </P> <P> Yet the Golden State appeals to the religiously unorthodox, with nearly one in  three residents believing in reincarnation and more than one in five practicing  Eastern-style meditation -- more than twice the percentage in the rest of the  country.  </P> <P> "California is a surprising mix," declares Phillip E. Hammond, a professor of  religious studies and sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  "It's least religious in some ways and most in others. . . . There's a lot of  loose religiosity floating around."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Four States Surveyed  </P> <P> Hammond is conducting a $249,000 study of regional differences in religious  styles. Funded by Lilly Endowment, his survey is part of a project to help  mainline church leaders confront the widespread challenges awaiting American  Protestantism next century. The data was obtained from 2,600 telephone  interviews last fall with people aged 24 to 60 in California, Massachusetts,  Ohio and North Carolina. Equal random samples were taken in each state.  </P> <P> Californians are about twice as likely to identify with nondenominational  churches but only half as likely to be evangelical as are Protestants in the  other states, the survey shows. "Nondenominational," Hammond explained in an  interview at his oceanside campus office, "means independent congregations that  don't recognize larger organizational connections."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Definition of Evangelical  </P> <P> "Evangelical" refers to conservative, affiliated denominations such as the  Southern Baptist Convention, the Church of the Nazarene and the Assemblies of  God.  </P> <P> At the same time, only 49% of Californians hold membership in a church or  synagogue, compared to 68% of the combined respondents in the three other  states.  </P> <P> Another finding is that Californians tend to drop out -- and stay out -- of  church and synagogue involvement to a greater degree than residents elsewhere:  59% of Californians reported a dropout period of two years or more, compared to  a combined 45% in the other states. And there were fewer "returnees" who later  became active again -- 49% versus 58%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Families Not Close  </P> <P> Hammond also found that Californians are less likely to be surrounded by family  members and close associates who share their religious views -- a finding that  supports the perception that ever since Gold Rush days, Californians have  tended to be more mobile and less rooted than people in other areas of the  nation.  </P> <P> Hammond said he and his colleagues chose Massachusetts to represent the Eastern  Seaboard and North Carolina to represent the South. Ohio, "a one-state mirror  for all 50," is regarded by pollsters as a microcosm of the country because of  its demographic balance. Indeed, in the survey questions, Ohio always came out  in the middle, Hammond said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> West Coast Represented  </P> <P> West Coast religion is distinctive, in Hammond's opinion. So while California  is unique, the state is also representative of the Pacific states, particularly  Oregon.  </P> <P> Hammond, who is a past president of the professional Society for the Scientific  Study of Religion, found that Californians are less inclined to pray, read the  Bible regularly, take the Scriptures literally and say mealtime grace. They  also are less likely to have had a "born-again" experience than the combined  respondents of the other states.  </P> <P> But when it comes to believing in reincarnation and ghosts, and in practicing  meditation techniques such as those taught by Transcendental Meditation, Zen  and other "New Age" groups, Californians are more "religious" than their  counterparts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Morality's Role Uncertain  </P> <P> Hammond also found that people who tend to disavow "conventional" sexual and  family norms are positively associated with "unconventional" religious styles,  particularly belief in reincarnation and the practice of meditation. But  Hammond said he is not sure how to interpret this.  </P> <P> "Do people adopt the 'new morality' because they practice meditation, or the  other way around?" he asked.  </P> <P> The morality measure in the survey was based on asking interviewees whether  they thought premarital sex, homosexual relations and abortion were wrong, and  whether they thought "the husband ought to have the main say-so in family  matters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Women's Ordination Favored  </P> <P> The gray-bearded Hammond stresses that his data analysis so far is  "preliminary" and "provisional." But, pointing to stacks of computer printouts  during the interview, he added: "The religious differences we are finding are  true differences. . . . We are developing confidence as the probability  patterns build up."  </P> <P> Hammond said he was surprised to find widespread approval for women's  ordination, with the only scant resistance being in North Carolina. Even there,  75% of the respondents approve of women ministers, and in heavily Roman  Catholic Massachusetts, it's 86% -- highest of the four sampled states. The  Vatican prohibits women priests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Differences on 'Born Again'  </P> <P> He sees stronger regional differences in what people mean when they say they  have been "born again":  </P> <P> "I think being evangelical in North Carolina is quite a different experience  than being evangelical in California. The mainline people -- the Baptists -- in  Carolina have been 'born again,' " he said. "It's a part of their culture. Here  in California, a 'born-again' (person) is apt to have been a dropout, or one  not reared (as) anything. It's a kind of 'entry-level' expression, I'm  guessing. It's more strongly tied to conservative views -- theological and  social and political -- than it is in North Carolina."  </P> <P> In like manner, Hammond predicts that the bottom lines of his survey will show  marked regional differences in what it means, for example, to be a Roman  Catholic or a Methodist.  </P> <P> "I think we're going to show that mainline religion has no single problem, so  there is no single solution," he concluded. "And there will be considerable  variation . . . not just regional, but within regions. . . . There will be an  intensification of religion as a consumer item, and I think California is  leading the nation in this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES  </P> <P> A survey of religious styles in California compared to an average of samples  taken in three states, Massachusetts representing the East, North Carolina  representing the South and Ohio representing Middle America.  </P> <TABLE CWL="5.52IN:2.22IN:3.21IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE>

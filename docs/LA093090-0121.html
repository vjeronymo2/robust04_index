			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FLAMES, SMOKE POUR FROM MOBIL PLANT  </P> <P> Flames and heavy black smoke poured from Mobil's Torrance refinery Friday  morning as a result of a pressure buildup of hydrocarbon gas, officials said.  </P> <P> Mobil officials said Friday afternoon that they did not know the cause of the  pressure buildup that led to the 10:35 a.m. discharge. But a spokeswoman for  the Air Quality Management District said a valve on a refinery gas vessel  closed, creating excessive gas pressure. AQMD spokeswoman Claudia Keith said  the gas line was closed for repair after the accident.  </P> <P> Mobil spokesman Barry Engleberg said the smoke emission occurred when the gas  buildup was diverted to the refinery's flare system.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported.  </P></p>

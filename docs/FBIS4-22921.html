Pozhidayev, K.A. Pozhidayeva, L.A. Orlova, </F> Bioavtomatika Scientific Research Center, Nizhniy Novgorod; UDC  614.72-074:543.544]    [Abstract] The large quantity of raw materials and ready  products which enter the atmosphere in the form of dust and  vapors during the manufacturing of drugs and their likely toxic  effect on humans prompted the development of stringent exposure  guidelines (OBUV) and necessitated regular monitoring of their  concentration in the air near pharmaceutical industry  enterprises. In particular, a method of determining the  concentration of methyl ether of chloracetic acid--a colorless  volatile flammable liquid with an irritating smell which is  easily soluble in ethanol and ether--in the atmospheric air  against the background of associated biologically active  substances is developed. The detection method is based on using  gas-liquid chromatography with a flame ionization detector  whereby samples are taken with activated BAU carbon for  subsequent thermal destruction and conversion to methyl  chloride. The sampling and sample analysis procedures are  outlined, and a chromatogram of the harmful substance separation  in the air is plotted. The procedure has a detection threshold  of 0.001 g per 2 ml and and a lower measurement limit of  0.0015 mg/m[.sup]3[/] (in a 20 l sample). The measured  concentration range is 0.0015-0.2 mg/m[.sup]3[/] with a  measurement error of +/-17.5%. The procedure has been  tested at  industry enterprises and approved by the USSR Public Health  Ministry. Figures 2.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS AND RECOVERY ON WALL STREET;  </P> <P> FED, AS EXPECTED, INJECTS CASH INTO FINANCIAL SYSTEM;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE ACTION HELPS TO CONTAIN THE STOCK MARKET SLIDE AND IN THE PROCESS  NUDGES INTEREST RATES DOWN SLIGHTLY.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board, moving as promised, injected added cash into the  nation's financial system early Monday, helping to contain the stock market  slide that began Friday and, in the process, nudging interest rates down  slightly.  </P> <P> Traders said that the Fed temporarily provided about $2 billion by buying  securities from banks and brokerage houses with the usual understanding that  the dealers would buy them back within a week. It acted at about 8:40 a.m. PDT,  about two hours after the market opened and after stock prices had begun  rebounding from a further decline in the early morning.  </P> <P> Although the amount was not unusually large, analysts said its impact was  heightened because the purchases came at a time when the Fed ordinarily would  have sought to drain reserves from the banking system to offset seasonal  transactions by the Treasury.  </P> <P> The Fed's action appeared to be just what the markets needed. "They promised  they were going to provide liquidity, and they did," said James Capra, a bond  trader at the Shearson Lehman Bros. investment firm in New York. Capra called  the move "a measured response."  </P> <P> Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a speech to the American Bankers Assn. here,  took a low-key approach to Friday's market plunge.  </P> <P> "We at the Federal Reserve are watching developments in the financial markets  very closely," he said. He added that "coordination exists at a detailed level"  between the Fed, the Treasury Department and the agencies that regulate the  financial markets.  </P> <P> The Fed, as is its custom, did not announce its injection of cash into the  financial system. But analysts were able to spot the Fed's tracks by tracing  transactions in the markets.  </P> <P> "The most important thing the Fed did was psychological -- that is, it  reassured the market that the funds would be there," said Scott Pardee, a  former Federal Reserve official who is now co-chairman of Yamaichi  International America in New York.  </P> <P> Traders said the timing of the Fed's intervention appeared to signal that the  central bank was easing its money and credit policies slightly in its efforts  to avert a panic following Friday's 190-point stock-market slide.  </P> <P> Analysts said the Fed began injecting reserves at a point when the federal  funds rate -- the interest charged on overnight loans between banks -- had  fallen to between 8.5% and 8.6%, down about one-quarter of a percentage point  from Friday's level of 8.75% to 8.8%.  </P> <P> Market specialists said the action suggested that the Fed will probably allow  interest rates to remain at this new level and may even permit them to edge  lower -- in effect, relaxing money and credit conditions marginally.  </P> <P> Because the market seemed not to have panicked during the first few hours of  trading Monday, traders said, the Fed apparently decided to tread lightly and  keep some of its powder dry in case the slide resumed later in the week.  </P> <P> "The fact that stocks were trading on the firm side today made them feel they  didn't have to come in very early or very fast," one analyst said. "They did  not want to make it look like an emergency operation."  </P> <P> Edward Guay, chief economist for Cigna Corp. in Hartford, Conn., a long-time  observer of Federal Reserve actions, called the Fed's move on Monday "a gentle  nudge toward an easier posture."  </P> <P> Guay said the central bank apparently had come through on its promise over the  weekend to inject cash into the financial system if it were needed to ward off  another slide, "but they did not want it construed as a move toward an easing  in monetary policy."  </P> <P> While Fed policy-makers "want to maintain economic growth, they don't want a  new spurt of inflation or a surge of speculation," Guay said. "All in all, it's  a rather gentle move on their part."  </P> <P> At the same time, the Fed's performance stood in sharp contrast to that of  Black Monday -- Oct. 19, 1987. Then the central bank did not act until Tuesday,  the day after the 508-point crash and two trading days after a preliminary  108-point decline.  </P> <P> Many analysts said later that the Fed's late entry then -- combined with  conflicting signals that the central bank issued then concerning likely  interest-rate changes -- resulted in a larger slide than might have otherwise  occurred.  </P> <P> But this time, the Fed was in early, before the market had a chance to plummet  500 points or more, and deftly, so as not to upset its long-standing goal of  leaning against prevailing inflationary pressures in the economy.  </P> <P> After the stock market closed with the Dow Jones industrial average up 88.12  points, Roger Kubarych, manager of Henry Kaufman &amp; Co., a Wall Street  consulting firm, said the Fed had turned in "a very balanced, good  performance."  </P> <P> But Kubarych noted that the bond market fell Monday and the currency market  zig-zagged throughout the day. "There's going to be a lot of volatility in all  these markets until people get their bearings," he said.  </P></p>

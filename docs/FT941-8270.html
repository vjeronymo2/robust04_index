			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / People: Monetary institute truly European Though Germany's Gunter Baer, 53, the secretary-general of the European central bank governors' committee, lost out to France's Robert Raymond in the race for the director general's job at the newly created European Monetary Institute, his deputy, Hanspeter Scheller, 51, has picked up the consolation prize of heading Raymond's general secretariat. Scheller, who started his central banking career at the Bundesbank, has been a member of the secretariat of the Bank for International Settlements since the 1970s. He is one of three new faces who will run the EMI when it finally settles down in its yet to be found headquarters in Frankfurt. The EMI has turned to the Dutch central bank for its head of monetary, economic and statistics department. Gert Jan Hogeweg, 47, who runs the payments systems policy department of De Nederlandsche Bank. Before that he did a stint as the Netherlands' alternate executive director at the International Monetary Fund between 1987 and 1991. Meanwhile, Jim Etherington, 39, (below), who joined the Bank of England straight from school, has been appointed head of the EMI's information and communications systems department. He has been managing the Bank's information technology operation servicing the policy, markets and supervision area. The latest clutch of appointments has filled most of the key jobs in the EMI's top management team. It still needs to recruit a head of administration and a head of reserve management. Filling the latter is not felt to be particularly urgent since it is unlikely that the EMI will be managing a large amount of reserves in the short-term. The rash of appointments at the EMI has had a knock-on effect at the BIS. Baer, who had been the EMI's acting director general, will take over from Giampietro Morelli, the BIS's secretary general, when he retires in August. Guy Noppen, Belgium's executive director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, joins the BIS secretariat in March and will assume the Bank's administrative responsibilities. Meanwhile, William White, deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, is joining the BIS and will take over as head of the monetary and economics department when Horst Bockelmann retires in April 1995.</p>

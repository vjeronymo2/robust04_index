			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tyre group is down but not out - Haig Simonian looks at the mood of the new management at Pirelli Marco Tronchetti Provera. executive vice-chairman of Pirelli, has had a turbulent first 12 months in office. He has had to grapple with the continuing problems of oversupply and severe price competition in the world tyres business, an international downturn in cables as well as the legacy of Pirelli's failure to acquire Continental, its big German tyres rival. Twelve months after the failed bid, Pirelli is down, but not out. Apart from its direct 5 per cent stake in Continental, it has negotiated options on a further 35 per cent and used its weight to stop Continental from pushing through a capital increase earlier this year. Although Mr Tronchetti Provera does not see the Continental shares as strategic, Pirelli is still at loggerheads with the company and especially its main shareholder, Deutsche Bank, on how to dispose of them. Those differences led to an angry clash between Mr Tronchetti Provera and Mr Ulrich Weiss, the Deutsche Bank board member who also chairs Continental's supervisory board, earlier this year. The truth behind the aborted takeover may never be known, though some bankers believe Deutsche Bank's role was much more active than later admitted. Whatever the circumstances, Pirelli's stake in Continental remains the biggest barrier to any future co-operation between the two companies. Some industry analysts believe a closer link between Continental and Pirelli  -the world's fifth and sixth biggest tyre makers respectively  - is essential in the long term to compete against the domination of Michelin, the market leader. 'Remove the shares, and all sorts of situations are possible,' said Mr Tronchetti Provera, whose family owns more of Pirelli than the Pirellis. But contrary to occasional rumours, he denies that any talks on possible co-operation have taken place. 'We haven't been in touch with Continental's management to discuss any projects in the past few months. No one has made any proposals.' In spite of the stalemate, there is much greater confidence at Pirelli compared with last year's dejection. 'At the end of last year we were clearly the losers, today we are a player,' he says. The claim is based on the share options, valid until the end of 1993 and renewable on a further payment for three more years. Yet the Italians have so far failed definitively to overturn the 5 per cent voting right restriction on Pirelli's stake in Continental. Both sides are embroiled in complex legal action to support their positions. However, Mr Tronchetti Provera does not think the courts will ever have the last word. 'I don't think the difficulties between us will be solved through the courts. Both sides use the law to strengthen their positions. But courts are used as bargaining tools, not as forums, to resolve such disputes.' Mr Tronchetti Provera has called the Continental stake financial, meaning they are for sale at the right price. Pirelli and its allies bought the shares for about DM300, (Dollars 187.5) a far cry from the depressed levels of today with Continental shares languishing at little more than DM200. Mr Tronchetti Provera chooses his words carefully when broaching the role of German institutions in the abortive takeover. Though reportedly opposed to the bid, he does not criticise the initiative. 'But Pirelli's mistake was not to drop it when German institutions decided no longer to support us. We should have sold the shares and walked away,' he says. Yet he clearly thinks negotiations with the Germans - and Deutsche Bank in particular - are the only way forward. 'The current situation is damaging to both sides. That's why I believe it will be settled in the end,' he says.</p>

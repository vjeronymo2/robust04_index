			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP BIDS $21.75 MILLION FOR BONWIT TELLER STORES  </P> <P> A consortium including real estate tycoon Donald J. Trump bid $21.75 million  Monday for five Bonwit Teller department stores, including the chain's flagship  outlet in Manhattan's glitzy Trump Tower.  </P> <P> The retailer's creditors rejected a request by a group that included a former  Bonwit chief executive for a two-day extension to secure financing for a  planned bid.  </P> <P> The creditors said a delay could threaten bids by the Trump group and others.  </P> <P> The Trump group, which entered its bid at a bankruptcy court hearing, proposed  buying Bonwit Teller properties in Boston, Buffalo and Manhasset, N.Y., and  Short Hills, N.J., in addition to the main Manhattan store.  </P> <P> The group would forgive $269,000 in financial obligations on the stores in  Trump Tower and Short Hills and match whatever the final bid is for liquidating  the inventory at the Boston and Buffalo stores.  </P></p>

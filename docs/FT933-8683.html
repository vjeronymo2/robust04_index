			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Lagos says bomb plot uncovered: Terrorist campaign blamed on 'disgruntled politician' NIGERIA'S military government stepped up its propaganda campaign against its opponents yesterday, claiming it had uncovered a plot by 'terrorists' to carry out a bombing campaign in three big cities, including the capital. Mr Uche Chukwumerije, information minister, alleged that a 'disgruntled politician' was funding a destabilisation plan from August 16 to 25 which would create a 'national atmosphere of insecurity' by a series of explosions in Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna. Although the statement did not identify the politician, most Nigerians assumed it referred to Chief Moshood Abiola, the victorious candidate in the June presidential poll which was annulled by President Ibrahim Babangida. A civil disobedience campaign in support of Mr Abiola's claim to be the next president of Nigeria stopped business in Lagos and other south-western cities for the second day yesterday, but once again failed to win support outside the south-west, the Yoruba homeland of Mr Abiola. Mr Chukwumerije said the plot also involved blowing up the north-south oil pipeline from Port Harcourt to Kaduna and the same conspirator was giving N10m (Pounds 270,000) to the Nigeria Labour Congress and other dissident activists 'to step up their opposition to the government'. He urged Nigerians of the folly of 'suicide missions on behalf of a fleeing field marshal. . . at a safe distance at the headquarters of ITT in the US'  -a reference to Mr Abiola, who once represented the telecommunications giant in Nigeria. Mr Abiola has been in the US and UK to lobby for punitive measures against the military regime if it does not hand over to an elected civilian government on August 27. This has led to speculation that it may be difficult for Mr Abiola, now in London, to return to Nigeria and pursue his claim on the presidency. A spokesman in the president's office denied knowledge of the source of the allegations. The period they involve covers the run-up to the formation of an unelected interim government, which Mr Abiola and most of his supporters have denounced. The president may reveal details of the interim government in an address to the National Assembly on Monday or Tuesday at a parade on his birthday in Abuja, the new federal capital. On August 23, four days before the scheduled handover, the government is also set to remove partially the petroleum price subsidy. A new high-grade petrol will cost 10 times as much as the present official price, which is a mere 3 US cents per litre. The timing of the move is surprising. It is certain to be highly unpopular and was put back by the government in April because it might have led to riots just before the presidential elections. It prompted speculation yesterday that protests on the August 23 might provide a pretext for the government to stay in office. In the civil disobedience campaign, there was a slightly increased turnout by staff in the private sector and public transport was working. The government threat to discipline civil servants who stayed away had a limited effect in Lagos. Despite the absence of some senior officials from the Central Bank of Nigeria in Lagos, there were enough junior staff at work to process the weekly bids for Dollars 60m of foreign exchange submitted by about a third of the authorised commercial banks.</p>

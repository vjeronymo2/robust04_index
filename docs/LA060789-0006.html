			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGERS HONORED  </P> <P> It is ironic that Capt. Will C. Rogers III has been awarded a top military  honor (Part I, May 28) for his command of the guided-missile cruiser Vincennes,  which became the focus of international controversy last July when it  mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290  people aboard.  </P> <P> What is the rationale for such a public display by the Navy? Could this event  not have taken place at a private ceremony?  </P> <P> PETER C. LATSIS  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

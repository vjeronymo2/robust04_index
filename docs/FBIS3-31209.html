			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/2/1994 -- The National Bank  of Romania opened on Monday, 14 February, new preferential  credit lines for exporters, a measure aiming to stabilize the  national currency leu exchange rate, the daily ADEVARUL says.    The economic agents exporting a part of their production  will  be offered credit lines totalling some 40 billion lei with an  interest rate of 70 percent. The preferential financing will  further rise to several hundreds billion lei while a part of the  costs would come to be supported by the Eximbank and the state  budget so that the exporters will have to pay even lower  interest rates, of 50 or even 40 percent, said the National Bank  governor Mugur Isarescu.    The preferential financing stimulates production, says the  governor, including the export-oriented production, but the way  to walk on would not be that of subsidizing the interest but of  increasing the capital of the efficient economic agents. The  reason is not hard to find out, reads the daily: Without a  really positive interest rate it is practically impossible to  stabilize the exchange rate but the economic agents do not even  want to hear of an even more expensive credit as their working  capital is very small therefore forcing them to borrow up to a  gearing of 80 percent.    When the situation will come to the contrary, hurdles will  lay no more in the way of the trust in leu. Actually, the  process has started already. Only the Bucharest branch of the  Romanian Commercial Bank is buying from the population U.S.  dollars at a daily average of some $100,000. In Ploiesti, 100  km north-east of Bucharest, people are selling dollars at the  exchange houses and then cross the street where they buy with  the fresh lei certificates of deposit issued by banks which are  already yielding more than holding hard currency and  anticipating its appreciation. Some days ago, in Bucharest, an  exchange house sold dollars at an exchange rate of 1,460 lei  that is below the inter-bank rate of 1480 lei, which is probably  something that has never happened since 1989.    The hunger for lei will surely become more compelling, the  National Bank governor Mugur Isarescu says, as the National Bank  "will no longer irrigate the economic field with the pail but  with the dropper and only where it must."</p>

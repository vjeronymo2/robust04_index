			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Szajer, head of the National </F> Committee of the Federation of Young Democrats, by Dezso Pinter;  place and date not given: "We Want a Government of Politicians,  Not a Government of Bureaucrats"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] In view of your  information to date, to what extent did you succeed in  predicting the main trends of the election campaign?    [Szajer] Our strategy has been ready for a year, a strategy  according to which a liberal center must be created in Hungary  that can compete with the socialists and the conservatives from  a position of power. A lot of things happened in one year and  during the election campaign, but this strategy has stood the  test of time. Thus, our predictions proved to be correct.    [Pinter] The present Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]  is not identical with the Fidesz of one year ago. In your view,  where are the changes?    [Szajer] First of all, our positions have changed. For a  long time, the Hungarian public saw competition and  confrontation between the coalition and the opposition parties.  In the first months of 1993 one could already notice a decrease  in the support of the current government parties and, thus,  these forces will not achieve good results in the upcoming  elections. A strong competition emerged among the opposition  parties in the wake of this recognition. There were also  internal causes behind this struggle. The Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] overcame its previous crisis and, as a result,  it emerged as an offensive party. As for the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP], the public freed this party of the  stigma of the post-communist party at about the same time. The  revival of these two parties changed the internal relations  between the opposition parties, and we can no longer start from  the premise that the Fidesz is the only party that is constantly  increasing its popularity. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Under what influence have you modified your views  on national and religious matters in the past one year?    [Szajer] I cannot agree with the statement formulated in  this question, because the Fidesz has not changed its position  regarding national and religious matters. However, under the  effect of previous attacks, we definitely had to change our  communication, namely we informed the public much more  frequently and in much more detail about our views. During our  congress held in April 1993, Viktor Orban openly declared that  the Fidesz is a national-oriented liberal party. For a long  time, we thought that national commitment is so natural for us  that there is no need to mention it separately. From the very  beginning, the fate of the Hungarian nation and of the ethnic  Hungarian minority living beyond our borders has been an  indivisible element of our policy. Many people made use of the  fact that we refrained from constantly declaring this, and many  people tried to create the impression that the Fidesz is not  interested in these matters. We could no longer tolerate this,  and we put adequate emphasis on our position. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] What image does the cooperation of the Fidesz, the  SZDSZ, the Agrarian Alliance, and the Liberal Civic Alliance  Entrepreneurs' Party provide about the power of liberalism in  Hungary?    [Szajer] Liberalism enjoys public support and basis in  Hungary. It also has a task in Hungary, because we have to  carry out a modernization here that actually creates a liberal  bourgeois democracy. There are obvious and firm differences  between the Fidesz and the SZDSZ, but common interests are the  basis of every cooperation between political parties, including  the cooperation between the Fidesz and the SZDSZ. If we are  unable to preserve the unity of the liberal coalition, this  might threaten the implementation of our long-term plans. The  current struggle will decide the determining power on the  Hungarian political arena for years, or even for decades. The  SZDSZ was the strong liberal party in 1990, and it failed to  come up with a strong liberal alternative against the  conservatives despite the weak left at the time. Given its  increased power, the Fidesz has a considerable responsibility in  1994. If it fails to come up with a strong liberal alternative  against the socialists despite the current weakness of the  conservatives, liberalism will hardly become the power to  determine the Hungarian policy in the long term. We must now  become one of the constant and major players in the political  rotation. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Dominance means a determining force in the  political jargon, but not an exclusive force. In your opinion,  could a liberal-dominant coalition emerge now, a coalition also  including the socialists?    [Szajer] Only if the socialist presence is totally  insignificant.    [Pinter] In your opinion, could such a coalition emerge  after the elections?    [Szajer] The election predictions do not show this. The  socialists will most probably have more power than to agree to  participate in such a coalition. Under these circumstances, the  Fidesz does not regard the MSZP as a coalition partner.    [Pinter] What if the SZDSZ does regard them as such?    [Szajer] We cannot exclude this possibility either.  However, in that case, no one should delude himself that he is  a member of a so-called social-liberal coalition. In that case,  a liberal party participates as a subordinate of a  socialist-dominated government. During the change in the regime,  the SZDSZ showed considerable firmness against the forces that  are now making up the MSZP. SZDSZ members would probably find  it rather difficult to accept such a change in direction. At  its inception, the Fidesz was a strong anti-Communist party, but  a civilized party that always took Hungary's future into  consideration. We will definitely preserve this character of  our party. If we gave up our intentions, we would become a  valueless player in political life and we would morally  disintegrate. We are not preparing for this; instead, we are  preparing for a determining liberal role. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] In your opinion, what are the prospects of the  parties of the present coalition?    [Szajer] They have a certain basis and, just as in 1990,  they will again gather mainly votes on their lists. The  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP] will make it into Parliament, but only  Jozsef Torgyan's Smallholders' Party has a chance. The  conservative pole has become weak and it will not play a  considerable role. According to our predictions, the liberals  will govern and the conservatives and the socialists will be in  opposition. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] In the case of a possible opposition role, how  would the Fidesz assert its political responsibility?    [Szajer] The entire political program of the Fidesz relies  on the fact that the SZDSZ gets into power. If this fails to  materialize, from the first moment of our new opposition status,  we will start preparing for the next elections, namely for  governing. Our party's logic will not change, only our  possibilities for implementing our policy will be more limited.  In the opposition, our task remains to show the citizens what  we would do differently from the government. Therefore, we do  not have to prepare specially for an opposition strategy.    [Pinter] If you get into the government, what changes would  you initiate in Parliament regarding the future relations with  the opposition?    [Szajer] One should not mix up the government party and  opposition roles. We must cooperate closely with the opposition  only on really all-national issues and issues regarding our  constitutional order. The opposition should continue its task  of clearly analyzing the government policy. [passage omitted]</p>

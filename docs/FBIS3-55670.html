"I am glad that the problem was solved. That will enable us  to resume peaceful and constructive work and, surely, we all got  a useful lesson," Laar said and added that "constitutional  dispute had ended".    Laar said he had received the information from Tunne Kelam,  vice chairman of Estonian parliament who had been informed of  the President's move over the telephone by Meri's office. Laar  also said Meri had expressed wish to hold a speech before the  parliament on Tuesday in order to explain his latest moves.    Meri's office has not confirmed the news.    Last Saturday, Meri rejected Laar's government reshuffle  plan  refusing to dismiss Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae while  sacking Finance Minister Madis Rike and turning down Premier's  nominee for Finance Minister, Heiki Kranich.    Meri agreed to award Foreign Minister's portfolio to Juri  Luik and Defence Minister's portfolio to Indrek Kannik. Both  ministers refused to take up their new positions if Meri refused  to approve the whole package. [passage omitted]</p>

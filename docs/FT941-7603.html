			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / TSB supports creation of PIA TSB, the banking group, yesterday came out in support of the proposed Personal Investment Authority and announced its plan to apply for membership of the new regulator. Elsewhere, doubts about the new authority were expressed by the Consumers' Association which told the Commons Treasury committee that there should be a shift to 'a simple, clear system of statutory regulation'. The TSB move will be a welcome boost to the PIA, which faces continued scepticism in the financial services industry. The authority must attract substantial support in order to achieve credibility. TSB said bringing all supervision and regulation of financial services for personal customers under one body would make it easier to achieve higher and more consistent standards. TSB's existing regulator is Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry. In evidence to the MPs the Consumers' Association called for a new office of director-general of investor protection, directly accountable to government and parliament. The regulator would have statutory powers to make the industry comply and would be funded by a statutory levy. The association said a successful PIA would help to rationalise the current regulatory structure but its effectiveness would be limited by the continuing ability of individuals and companies in the sector to choose their own regulator.</p>

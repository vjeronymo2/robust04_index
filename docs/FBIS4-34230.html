			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan  President Violeta Chamorro today in Cartagena de Indias  suggested making "economic engines" out of the business sectors  in the Ibero-American countries gathered at this Caribbean port  in Colombia.    "Contemporary economic integration underscores the new role  assumed by the private sector, which is actively participating  in the formulation of economic and social policies," Chamorro  added. The Nicaraguan president spoke at the first session of  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, where  the heads of state and government of 20 countries have gathered  for two days to examine trade mechanisms and regional  development.    Private enterprise "should become the engine and strength of  our economies," Chamorro reiterated. The Nicaraguan president,  who attended the past three Ibero-American summits held since  the inception of the regional forum in 1991 in Guadalajara,  Mexico, said her administration has proven its integrationist  convictions.    The many summits organized by the Central American countries  have generated a dynamic "that will allow us to resolve the  problems that for decades have fostered violence in our region,"  Chamorro said. The Nicaraguan president pointed out that  "Nicaragua has undergone a triple transition process that has  allowed it to go from war to peace, from a centralized economy  to a social market economy, and from a clearly totalitarian  regime to a flourishing democracy."    "We have changed ration cards for the exercise of free trade  through the private sector," added Chamorro, after asserting  that in this development process "we have buried the rifles."  The Nicaraguan president admitted that there are inequalities  in the countries of the region and urged her Ibero-American  colleagues to strengthen their ties of solidarity and mutual  support.</p>

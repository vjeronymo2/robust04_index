			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mixed views on house prices - At a glance The Halifax and Nationwide indices yet again gave conflicting information about the direction of UK house prices last month. Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, reported that house prices had fallen by 0.4 per cent in January, while Nationwide, the second-largest building society, reported that prices had risen by 1.2 per cent last month, the biggest monthly rise since May 1991. However, both societies agreed that there had been an increase in the number of potential purchasers requesting mortgages and inquiring about properties for sale. Lending activity in the last quarter of 1992 was very depressed according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Net advances totalled Pounds 2.6bn, down from Pounds 5.5bn the previous quarter. The CML attributed the weak figures to lack of confidence on the part of potential housebuyers after sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Arts: Cut and Trust The scene is the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. For about 90 minutes Patrick Prior, in the latest of his plays excoriating the Conservative government and all its works, has been laying bare the horrors of Trust Hospitals. Every possibility has become a certainty, every cause for concern turned into the scandal of the century. Spectres pour forth of patients waiting in agony for non-existent ambulances; of stroke victims lying unmoved as hospitals argue about catchment areas; of staff canteens replaced by vending machines, and staff rationalised out of jobs. But then Prior loses faith. Perhaps the audience is missing the point. Best to get an actress to stop the action, mount a soap box, and spell out that Trust Hospitals mark the start of the privatisation of the health service. This insult to the intelligence of the audience hardly matters. Stratford East keeps the Red Flag flying and the paying patrons would be upset if the cast lost faith. It is like a performance of The Good Old Days: outside Majors may trumpet and Heseltines blow, but inside we know that left is right. Perhaps turning the whole thing into a pantomime - with Regina Freedman, who plays four parts including an ambulance man with a detachable moustache - shows a lack of confidence. But it adds to the escapist joy of it all. And it is quite fun. Mr Wentworth (Jonathan Coote, unnervingly like Ken Livingstone) is the Pounds 90,000 a year chief executive of a Trust Hospital who mistakes two lunatics released into the community as the new junior health minister and her adviser. The actual health minister is, of course, taken to be a lunatic. This crazy scenario allows Prior to be equally crazy in his diagnosis of the current state of the health service. The argument never rises above the slapstick but the cast know what is expected and guy away like mad. In the tradition of farce, Wentworth is reduced to pretending to be an ambulance, with a flashing blue light strapped to his head, and then gyrating as a limbo dancer to create a sensual voice as he tries to drum up patients by cold calling them on the phone. Alan Cowan, as the lunatic who talks sense, and Yvonne Edgell as his scatological accomplice, keep the frenzy going. One hopes that no one in Jeff Teare's production believes that this Play School satire is really political theatre. Theatre Royal, Stratford East, until May 9th.</p>

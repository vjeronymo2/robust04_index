			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Miras just when will it all end? - Property / The Budget and You Only one question is left concerning mortgage-interest relief from income tax (Miras), now that the chancellor has reduced it to 15 per cent from April 1995 on the unchanged first Pounds 30,000 of a loan. When will it go for good? It was 40 per cent three years ago. It is now 25 per cent and it comes down to 20 per cent in April 1994. It is a terminal case. But the fall in interest rates more than compensates for the Miras cuts, and houses are more affordable now than five years ago. For buyers of expensive houses the cuts are negligible. First-time buyers, the TSB calculates, need 26 per cent of their take-home pay to service a typical mortgage, the lowest figure for 10 years. That will rise to 28 per cent in April with the Miras changes, and to 29 per cent in April 1995 - still an attractive ratio. Another lollipop is that chancellor Kenneth Clarke is not applying his new 3 per cent tax on insurance premiums to long-term endowment assurance linked to a mortgage. But this is not a reason in itself for taking an endowment mortgage rather than an old-fashioned repayment mortgage. Endowment returns are less than they were, while repaying always reduces the loan - and the danger of negative equity. The slow demise of Miras continues to put renting more on a par with owning. People enjoy more flexibility when distancing themselves from the capital commitment of buying, and it encourages owners to consider becoming private landlords. Gross returns of 8 to 10 per cent are possible - and the net will be better than most forms of saving - and with assured shorthold lets owners know they can return. The eventual removal of the Miras tax perk will help the public to see that owning one's own home does not have to be the top item in everybody's financial planning. Renting releases money for more productive investments, and stepping away from owning makes 1980s-type price booms less likely to happen again. The London property market escaped from its slough of despond a year ago when foreigners, seeing how affordable good properties had become, began to buy. But too few houses and flats are for sale in central London to satisfy would-be purchasers, many of whom are, by now, British. In the past 12 months, the agent Aylesford has sold many properties, 15 of them with an aggregate value of Pounds 40m. Demand is strong for houses over Pounds 1m, in excellent condition with six to seven bedrooms and gardens and, preferably, freehold. Since May, the average price for houses sold by the firm's Chelsea house section has been Pounds 1.4m. For large family flats, preferably in Eaton Square, Cadogan Square or Onslow Square, buyers expect to pay more than Pounds 500,000. Lassmans, another agent, finds that foreigners look to Belgravia, Mayfair, St James's and 'the better parts of South Kensington.' Flats must be in tip-top condition to attract buyers from Hong Kong and elsewhere in the Far East who want them as long-term (post-1997) investments. With many of the bargains and repossessions sold, the market is now more orderly. Its slight tilt to favour vendors will translate into higher prices. Astonishing it might be, but Eilean Aigas, the island in the middle of the Beauly river in Inverness-shire which came to market in the summer, has not sold. Savills (031-226 6961) has now reduced the price 25 per cent and invites offers over Pounds 600,000. That buys a 60-acre island idyll (FT, July 10) that has been in the Fraser family for 600 years. Any bids for lot nine, an obelisk and 35.5 acres? On Thursday, that will be the last item in an auction at Thornhill Park, near Sherborne, Dorset. Sir James Thornhill, architect of Moor Park in Hertfordshire and painter of the great hall at Blenheim Palace, designed the grade II* house (lot one) in 1730 and put up the obelisk (grade II) to honour the marriage of George II and Queen Caroline. The guide price for the house is Pounds 350,000, and Pounds 45,000 for the obelisk and land. The other lots are cottages and land. The agents are Michael de Pelet (0935-812 236), Symonds and Sampson (0305-264172) and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171). If you have no luck with the Dorset obelisk on Thursday, continue to Somerset to bid for a bear pit on Friday. Said to be the country's last surviving pit for bear baiting, it can be found at the back of Cricket Court at Cricket Malherbie near Ilminster, a grade II Georgian house. Guide price is in the range of Pounds 170,000-Pounds 210,000. Greenslade Hunt (0460-52171) will conduct the auction on instructions from Hambro Countrywide Relocation.</p>

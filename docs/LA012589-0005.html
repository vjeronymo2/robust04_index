			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  CEMETERY DECLARED AN L.A. LANDMARK  </P> <P> The Wilmington Cemetery, believed to be the oldest active graveyard in Los  Angeles County, was declared a city landmark Tuesday by the Los Angeles City  Council.  </P> <P> The cemetery, established 131 years ago near Pacific Coast Highway in  Wilmington by Phineas Banning, the father of the Port of Los Angeles, is the  resting place of members of several prominent families of early Southern  California, including the Bannings, Sepulvedas, Narbonnes and Carsons.  </P> <P> Banning, who established the graveyard to bury his first child, was interred  there for a short while, but his second wife moved his remains to Rosedale  Cemetery in Los Angeles. The cemetery has about 300 plots remaining, which are  generally available only to residents of the cemetery's assessment district,  which includes most of Wilmington.  </P> <P> Nearby residents began pushing for the landmark designation about 1 1/2 years  ago when the graveyard had to close its gates for a month because of financial  problems. It has since rebounded, thanks to loans from the city and county and  an annual $8.09 assessment on all taxable parcels in the district.  </P></p>

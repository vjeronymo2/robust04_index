			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / A shock to the political system: Sunday's regional elections will demonstrate the dissatisfaction with France's traditional parties of government If the opinion polls are to be believed, the vote in Sunday's regional elections will detonate a seismic rearrangement of the political landscape in France. At the very least, it will open a new and decisive phase in the presidency of Mr Francois Mitterrand. But if he and the French people are unlucky, it could even herald a return to the political instability which was supposed to have been banished with the establishment of the Fifth Republic 33 years ago. The polling forecasts have been simple, striking and remarkably consistent. The ruling Socialist party is set to see its popular support fall by more than a third to less than 20 per cent; but the traditional conservative parties will also sink significantly, to about 33 per cent. By contrast, the extreme right-wing National Front and the ecologists will both surge ahead, to about 14-15 per cent each. Only one political group appears virtually untouched by this prospective earthquake: the Communist party, which should hang on to 8-10 per cent. For many commentators, the breakthrough by the National Front is the most important development, as it would give France the largest ultra-right-wing party in western Europe. Others have highlighted the collapse in support for the ruling Socialist party, because it reinforces the vertiginous drop in the popularity of Prime Minister Edith Cresson since she was appointed 10 months ago, and calls into question the future legitimacy of a Socialist government. Yet the real significance of these polling forecasts is the aspect which appears least dramatic: the small but unmistakable slump in support for the mainstream conservative parties, the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping, and the Gaullist RPR party. Whatever the meaning of the 15 per cent swing behind the National Front, it is dwarfed in significance by the collective rejection of all the traditional parties of government. It is easy to identify some of the obvious but if the conservative opposition parties cannot gain extra votes from the Socialists' unpopularity, then the traditional political establishment is in a bad way. The Socialists' main point of vulnerability is high and rising unemployment. From 1987 to 1990 it steadily declined, from a peak of 10.5 per cent to a low point of less than 9 per cent, but since then it has been creeping up and may hit 10 per cent again. The government's many job creation and training schemes have failed to stem the tide. Second comes immigration. Stricter rules and tighter restraints on asylum have failed to prevent a continued small inflow of immigrants, mainly for family reunion. The real problem is the multiplier effect between the immigrant community from North Africa, unemployment, deprivation in the outer suburbs, and anxieties regarding law and order. Third is political corruption. Public esteem for the Socialists dropped steeply with the revelation in 1988 of a nationwide system of party kick-backs. Former Prime Minister Michel Rocard tried to wipe the slate clean with tough new rules on party financing, but the move backfired when it was coupled with an amnesty for past offenders. This enraged a number of magistrates and, since then, investigations into the scandal have been repeatedly relaunched, in the glare of the television cameras, manifestly for political reasons. This list of complaints against the Socialists explains why the conservatives are suffering too. They do not pretend to have any better solutions for unemployment or immigration; and they are only slightly less vulnerable to suspicions of corruption. The popular rejection of the Socialists and their conservative opponents, though not in doubt, may however be overstated in Sunday's vote, because of the peculiarities of the event: The timing: this is tailor-made for a gratuitous protest vote since it falls between two general elections. The abstention rate: this is expected to be as high as 50 per cent and will penalise mainstream parties much more than protest groups. The voting rules: minority parties will gain maximum benefit from these elections, which are based on complete proportional representation. Finally, there is the intense publicity drawn by the National Front breakthrough, which has transformed these elections for 22 separate regional councils into something like a national opinion poll. Only half the voters say they will make their minds up on local grounds; the rest will therefore give vent to their feelings of discontent and disarray almost regardless of the local consequences. On all these grounds, the Socialists will seek to discount the significance of Sunday's vote. Indeed, Mrs Cresson is already downplaying the results in advance: 'There will certainly be a drop in the Socialist electorate,' she said this week, 'but I do not think one can speak of a defeat.' Even so, the voting figures will themselves influence the political debate. The most immediate problem in the regions will be how the mainstream conservative parties react to a significant advance by the National Front. They have vowed to form no alliance with the FN; but in many cases they will be unable to form a working majority alone. No doubt some local parties will be unable to resist the temptation to go back on their pre-electoral vows, which would inevitably provoke a row between the Gaullists and the UDF at national level. This could undermine their attempts to form an electoral alliance in time for next year's general elections. Yet the most critical new factor will be the level of support for the Socialist party. Locally, they may be able to take advantage of the FN breakthrough to gain minority control of one or two extra regions through alliances with the ecologists. But if the national vote for the Socialist party falls below 20 per cent, the credibility of Mrs Cresson's government will be damaged beyond repair. France will then wait with bated breath to see what Mr Mitterrand does next; for no one doubts that the president is a politician of resource and ingenuity; that he will have several surprises up his sleeve; and that he is likely to spring some of them before the year is out. Neither of his most obvious options looks satisfactory. Mrs Cresson has become a serious handicap; the name of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has been widely canvassed as a more popular alternative. Yet it is difficult to imagine that any new prime minister will save the Socialist party from a crushing defeat in the general elections. Hence the idea of a shift in the voting rules before then. This has been repeatedly alluded to by President Mitterrand, and is now being echoed by some leading Socialists. But there is a clear difference of objective between him and them. Their ostensible argument is that parliament should be more representative of the diversity of public opinion; but they are only prepared for a small element of proportional representation because they want to keep the logic of majority voting which might one day return them to majority govobjective would be to prevent an overwhelming conservative victory, which would render miserable the last two years of his mandate; so his need would be for a large dose of PR. If the government were to change the general electoral system from majority voting (as it is now, and was in 1988), to full-blooded proportional representation (as it was in the 1986 general elections, and as it will be in Sunday's regional elections), it might just succeed in limiting the conservative parties to 270 or 275 seats, a handful short of a parliamentary majority. But the cost would be high: 50-90 seats for the National Front, and 35-60 for the ecologists, while the Socialists would shrink to 110-140. Such a change in the rules would be nothing new. Throughout their agitated parliamentary history, the French have repeatedly juggled with their voting rules, always for opportunistic reasons. The conservatives are already crying 'Foul]', in rage that they may be robbed of victory; yet the change would be entirely legal, if the government could secure the necessary majority in parliament. Apart from a change in the rules, President Mitterrand may be looking to two policy issues to restore his fortunes. The first will be the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on European union, which should stir a national debate, and may inspire popular enthusiasm for his European achievement. The second will be a package of constitutional reforms next autumn, including a reduction in the presidential term of office (currently seven years renewable), a change supported by all parties. Yet even if President Mitterrand should carry off both these reforms in triumph, he would still face a political and constitutional crisis. The political crisis has been highlighted by the apparent exhaustion of the left-right debate between the Socialists and the conservatives. One of the reasons for the Socialists' unpopularity is that they have largely abandoned their socialist rhetoric, and are in effect managing the economy by conservative rules, in obedience to the imperatives of the European Community. Part of the case for electoral reform rests on the need to find an alternative dialectic to the old left-right antithesis. The constitutional crisis is more serious. By accident or design, President Mitterrand has accumulated more power and influence than any predecessor apart from General de Gaulle. His most pressing need is for a parliamentary majority which is strong but respectful; but it is his personal accumulation of power which has weakened both the parliament in general and his government in particular. He and his government now appear chained together by their common unpopularity. Public opinion is notoriously volatile, however, and time may change the government's standing. The economy will probably revive. The rise of the National Front may drive a wedge through the traditional conservative parties, and thus seriously damage their electoral chances. In combination, a series of small plus-factors could add up to a significant improvement in Socialist prospects in 1993. But if their prospects do not improve, the price of preventing a conservative majority would seem to be a National Assembly which might be unable to muster a governing majority at all, except through a tacit alliance between the conservatives and the National Front. This cannot be the effect sought by Mr Mitterrand; as a conservative, a lawyer and a statesman with a strong sense of history, he will surely not seek to bring down the pillars of the temple. So unless he were prepared to endure another bout of cohabitation with a conservative government, he might have no alternative but to resign. And yet resignation is a strategy which he just might be able to use to confound the conservatives. After successfully leading two national debates, on Europe and the reform of the constitution, he could declare that his task was done, and that he would immediately implement the new, shorter presidential term of office. The conservative parties would have no time to choose a single presidential candidate; Mr Jacques Delors would capture the presidency; and new general elections would produce a centre-left government. This is not Mr Mitterrand's preferred strategy. His natural inclination is to play along, and to wait on events before making decisions. He is stubborn and obstinate. But he will need all his resource and ingenuity if he is to stay on top of the game.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Share of election votes  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           Regional                                                             1992                        Regional   General   European       voting                          1986      1988       1989       intentions                          (%)       (%)        (%)           (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Extreme left              1.3       0.4        2.0           1.0 Communist party          10.2      11.3        7.8           8.0 Socialist party          30.0      36.4       23.6          19.5 Other left                1.5       1.2        0.4           2.0 General ecologists                                           7.0                           2.3       0.4       10.7 Greens                                                       8.0 Local parties             0.2        -          -             - Hunting rights             -         -         4.2                                                              4.5 Animal rights              -         -         1.0 UDF-RPR                  39.9      37.7       37.1          33.0 Other right               4.9       2.9        1.4           3.0 National Front            9.7       9.7       11.8          14.0 Abstentions              22.0      34.0       52.0          47.0  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IPSOS-Le Point  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

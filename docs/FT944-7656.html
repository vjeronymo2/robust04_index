			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Films lift Disney to record: Downturn in theme parks more than offset by 43% rise in film sales The success of Walt Disney's animated features, especially The Lion King, more than offset a downturn in theme parks to produce record fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 226m, against a loss of Dollars 78m. Group operating profits, before losses in Euro Disney, were up 23 per cent at Dollars 439m. For the first time in more than a decade, films made more profit in the full year than theme parks (excluding Euro Disney), at Dollars 856m versus Dollars 684m. According to Disney, The Lion King is now established as its most successful feature ever, and is on track to be one of the five most successful films in history. In the final quarter, operating income from films almost doubled to Dollars 189m on sales up 43 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn. The executive most credited with this result, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, made a highly public departure from Disney at the end of the financial year. His job as chairman of Walt Disney Studios has been divided among other Disney executives. Operating profits from theme parks (excluding Euro Disney) fell 18 per cent to Dollars 155m on sales 2 per cent higher. International tourist traffic fell, the company said, and costs had been written off for the proposed Civil War theme park in Virginia, which Disney was forced to abandon. The company said yesterday it was still contemplating a new theme park in Florida, but had yet to decide whether to go ahead or what the theme might be. Profits from the consumer division, covering the merchandise of characters and books from the films, rose 33 per cent to Dollars 95m on sales up 36 per cent at Dollars 490m. This was also due chiefly to the success of The Lion King, Disney said. For the year as a whole, operating profits from films rose 38 per cent on sales up 30 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. Disney said the year had also been helped by the animated features Aladdin and The Return of Jafar, as well as by strong video sales of older features such as The Jungle Book and Bambi. The share of losses in Euro Disney fell to Dollars 58m, from Dollars 415m, for the quarter and Dollars 110m (Dollars 515m) for the year. Earnings per share for the quarter were 42 cents, against a loss of 15 cents, and for the full year were Dollars 2.04, against 55 cents. Full-year net income was Dollars 1.1bn compared with Dollars 300m. Disney spent Dollars 920m on repurchasing 23m of its shares since May, with Dollars 512m of that coming in the final quarter. The board has now authorised the repurchase of a further 90m shares, on top of the 14m still authorised under the existing programme. At yesterday's closing price of Dollars 43, this could cost the company about Dollars 4.3bn.</p>

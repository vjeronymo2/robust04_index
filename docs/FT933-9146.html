The big question on the table at Germany's Wickert polling institute is whether long red-lacquered fingernails are sexy. Based on the opinion of 63 per cent of those questioned, the answer is no. This might seem surprising, at first sight, but may be explained by the fact that red nails are seen as a tell-tale sign of lethargy, laziness, boredom, and lack of self-confidence.

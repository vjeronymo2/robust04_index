Douglas  Auldridge of the Ventura Police Department.  </P> <P> A car pulled alongside them and a man asked the brothers where they lived. They  replied "Ventura," Lucking said. The man got out of the car and began shooting  at the brothers with a handgun, Lucking said.  </P> <P> Stanley Speer was shot twice and fell in the street, Lucking said. William  David Speer began running when the gunman aimed at him and was not hurt,  Lucking said.  </P> <P> The gunman's car raced from the scene before police arrived, Lucking said.  </P> <P> Stanley Speer was taken by ambulance to Ventura County Medical Center in  Ventura, where he was rushed into emergency surgery, Lucking said. He was  listed in stable condition late Friday, Lucking said.  </P> <P> The gunman may have belonged to a gang, Auldridge said. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

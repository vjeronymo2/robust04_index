			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper close to six-year lows as stocks surge LONDON METAL Exchange copper prices came under renewed pressure yesterday from investment fund selling and was forced the market to retest the lows reached last week in the aftermath of the sudden ending of the recent technical supply squeeze. With sentiment further depressed by news of another big rise in exchange warehouse stocks of the metal the three months price fell by Dollars 42 to Dollars 1,735 a tonne at one stage, just Dollars 2 above last Tuesday's near six-year low. But support was again found at that level, largely from other investment funds, which had already sold the market short and were now making covering purchases. The price ended after-hours trading at Dollars 1,738.50 a tonne. While copper's fundamentals remained far from encouraging, market operators might be adopting a more cautious approach because of a growing awareness that the market could soon become seriously oversold, Mr Ted Arnold, metals analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, suggested. He pointed out that supplies of copper scrap tended to 'dry up' if the price price moved much below 80 US cents a lb - yesterday's close worked out at 79 cents a lb. At that price the flow of toll refined metal from the former Soviet Union might also be expected to slacken, Mr Arnold added. A study of the copper market published this week points out, however, that more than 90 per cent of western world copper mine production was at cash costs of below 80 cents a lb in 1992, while much of the new capacity encouraged by relatively high prices for the metal in recent years uses the low-cost solvent extraction or electrowinning technology. AME Mineral Economics says in its report, Copper 1993 - Growth but no Cheer, that this SX-EW capacity 'will stay in production regardless of copper prices'. It also suggests that the former eastern bloc, which exported nearly 450,000 tonnes of copper to the West last year, is 'another source of inelastic supply'. On the demand side AME sees newly industrialising Asian economies continuing to be a strong growth area for copper. East Asia is already the leading consumer of the metal, with demand having increased between 1980 and 1992 at an average annual compound rate of 5.2 per cent, compared with 2 per cent in Europe and 0.8 per cent in the US, the report points out. And the region's economy is 'forecast to grow at one and a half times the world average in future decades'. AME concludes: 'These two forces in concert will usher in a period a period of relatively strong growth in copper consumption in association with a ratcheting down of price expectations. Despite the positive outlook for copper offtake in Asia, new low-cost sources of supply will hold prices down to 90 cents a lb or less over the next five years'. Copper 1993 - Growth but no Cheer.

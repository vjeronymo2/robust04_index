			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOLY SIDEKICK!;  </P> <P> BATMAN HAS A NEW BOY WONDER WEARING A BRAND NEW WARDROBE  </P> <P> Rest easy, Gothamites, Batman has a new Robin. The Caped Crusader, who saw his  sidekick blown to bits by the Joker two years ago, has found somebody to fill  the Boy Wonder's shoes -- although the footwear and the rest of his outfit are  new.  </P> <P> Tim Drake, who turned up at stately Wayne Manor one year ago, is now Robin No.  3. Drake joins Bruce Wayne's alter-ego this month in Batman comic No. 457,  where he manages to rescue Batman and Vicki Vale from the clutches of the  psychotic Scarecrow.  </P> <P> The third Robin, you say? Yes. The original, of course, was Dick Grayson, who  now works as a solo super-hero called Nightwing. His successor, Jason Todd, was  murdered in Batman No. 428.  </P> <P> Like his predecessors, Drake is an orphan taken in by millionaire Wayne. "I  think it's part of the job description," DC Comics spokeswoman Martha Thomases  said.  </P> <P> Drake -- who used his powers of deduction to figure out that Bruce and Batman  were one and the same -- has been hanging around the Batcave for the last year  handling the more mundane aspects of crime-fighting.  </P> <P> But the folks at DC Comics decided the time was right for a replacement Robin.  </P> <P> "Over the last year, he has proven himself mentally, morally, spiritually and  physically capable of taking over," Batman editor Dennis O'Neil said Thursday.  "Today is his rite of passage."  </P> <P> Robin should also help Batman psychologically. The crime-fighter "would soon  skew into a nasty insanity if he did not have someone . . . to maintain a link  with common humanity," O'Neil said.  </P></p>

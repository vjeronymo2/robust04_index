			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (iv) In the case of a structure constructed or substantially rehabilitated before 1978, if the recipient is presented with test results that indicate that the family purchasing a home under the program includes a child less than six years of age who has an elevated blood lead level (EBL), the recipient must cause the unit to be tested for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces. Testing must be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector certified by a State or local health or housing agency, or by an association recognized by HUD. Lead content shall be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1.0 mg/cm2 or higher shall be considered positive for the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight, the standard shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm). Where lead-based paint on chewable surfaces is identified, covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with &sect;35.24(b)(4) of this title is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, the recipient may, at its discretion, abate all interior and exterior chewable surfaces in accordance with the methods set out in &sect;35.24(b)(4) of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=3 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=3 --> PART 291_DISPOSITION OF HUD-ACQUIRED SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 18.

Testing must be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD.

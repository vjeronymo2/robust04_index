			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LICHTI IN STABLE CONDITION AFTER CRASH  </P> <P> Denver Nuggets guard Todd Lichti was in stable condition but very distraught  today after losing his girlfriend in a one-car accident in Nevada and  undergoing surgery on his right foot, said his family and team officials and  his family.  </P> <P> Doctors said the surgery for a broken bone in his foot was successful, but  stressed that it is too early to determine when or whether Lichti will fully  recover.  </P> <P> But his emotional state was suffering because of the death of girlfriend  Kristin Gravrock, 23, of Bellevue, Wash., said his mother, who spoke briefly to  Lichti by telephone.  </P> <P> "He's just beside himself," Ora Lichti told the Contra Costa Times in a story  published today. "Physically, he's OK, but he's emotionally shot. He's really  broken up."  </P> <P> The Nevada Highway Patrol said Lichti, 23, was a passenger in the car that ran  off Interstate 80, 30 miles east of Lovelock, Nev., and overturned in the  median about 7:15 a.m. (Story, Section C).  </P> <P> Gravrock, the driver, was pronounced dead at the scene. Troopers said that  Lichti's face and hands were covered with blood from multiple cuts and that he  complained of pain in his foot.  </P> <P> Investigating officers said Gravrock apparently fell asleep. Her car ran off  the right side of the highway and slid into the median when she overcorrected.  </P> <P> Lichti and Gravrock began seeing each other about three months ago, and Lichti  was bringing her home to meet his family in Northern California when the  accident happened, Ora Lichti said.  </P> <P> Lichti, a former Stanford star, was the Nuggets' first-round draft pick in the  1989 NBA draft. He played in 79 games for the Nuggets this past season,  starting four.  </P></p>

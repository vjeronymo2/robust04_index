			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / IMF warns of delay in deal with Russia RUSSIA may not be able to complete its full standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund before late autumn, a senior IMF official has warned. After negotiating a preliminary agreement with the Fund which will allow the release of a first Dollars 1bn (Pounds 523.5m) credit tranche, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, had hoped to complete the standby agreement in October. But IMF officials have said they will need some time to complete negotiations on the standby after arrangements for a rouble zone, including several of the former Soviet republics as well as Russia, have been put in place. 'We have no experience in the IMF of a standby negotiated in one day or two,' a senior official said. However, the officials added that it should be possible to complete the standby and move on to the third phase of Russia's IMF programme with the installation of a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund early next year. Fund officials are encouraged by the precedent set by the Baltic republic of Estonia for a 'civilised exit' from the rouble zone, and say they now want to create the conditions for 'civilised coexistence' between Russia and those republics, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, which are considering remaining within the rouble zone. While the deal for a preliminary Dollars 1bn programme negotiated a week ago between Mr Gaidar and Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, was viewed in some quarters as a concession by the Fund, given its original demands for radical economic reform, IMF officials said they had a 'guarded optimism' about the Russian government's commitment to reform. 'In view of the strength of the commitments of the Russians and their friends we believe that there are enough assurances to go ahead,' a senior official said. Fund officials warned, however, that the international community had not yet begun to address Russia's financing needs for 1993. They expect a financing gap next year of roughly the same size as this year's, which prompted a combined Dollars 24bn western aid package.</p>

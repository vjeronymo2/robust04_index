			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (4): A rerun of the debt crisis? THE sudden rush of capital into Latin America has inevitably raised questions about what happens if it stops. As the combined current account deficit of the region widens sharply, as it did last year, the parallels are already being drawn with the years that led up to the debt crisis of the 1980s. There are significant differences, however, between what is happening now and the experience of the late 1970s and early 1980s which should reduce the risks: Then, budget deficits and inflation were on the rise, while now inflation is declining and budgets are balanced. Then, the borrowing was mostly done by the public sector and this time it has been private. This does not comfort everybody: the worrying exception last time was Chile, where the government was eventually forced to assume private foreign debt, mostly owed by Chilean banks. 'Private debt in Latin America has a way of becoming public debt,' notes one US economist. Then, the inflows were largely bank-financed and with interest rates floating along with US rates. This time the mix of inflows is significantly more varied - including equity, more borrowing at fixed interest rates, and an important component of direct investment. Equity investment does not create debt and dividends, in contrast to interest payments, are only paid in the event of investment success. Although in some countries debt servicing would still constitute a problem if US interest rates rose sharply, the new capital flows do not increase the vulnerability of the region to US interest increases in the way that the debt inflows of the 1970s did. Then, the capital inflows represented a much larger percentage of regional domestic product than in the 1990s. In 1978-82, capital inflows into the region as a whole represented 7 per cent of domestic product, in 1990-91, about 4 per cent and last year 4.8 per cent. However, the averages deceive: Mexico's inflows represented last year over 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product. There is another crucial difference. Unlike in 1978-82, official reserves have been rising as authorities have actively intervened in the foreign exchange market. Many governments thus have a substantial cushion of foreign exchange reserves in case of troubles ahead. The current account deficit has been very much the counterpart to the capital inflows. Figures from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean show a doubling of the region's current account deficit, excluding Brazil's large surplus, to Dollars 39bn last year from Dollars 18bn in 1991. This of itself is not necessarily bad: it in part reflects the recovery from the 1980s recession which released demand for both investment and consumer goods from abroad. Nonetheless, Mexico's current account deficit of around 6 per cent of its GDP in 1992 accounted for half of the region's combined current account deficit, excluding Brazil. Many forecasts suggest the deficit will now rise to Dollars 27bn this year, 8 per cent of GDP. EVEN though this is mainly the result of private sector activity, this does not mean it is of no concern to the government - 'in practice, large private sector current account deficits can have important and, frequently, adverse implications for the public sector,' says Mr Paul Luke of the British investment bank, Morgan Grenfell. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which published a generally optimistic report on Mexico last year: 'It could once again become difficult to finance a current account deficit, which as a percentage of GDP is close to GDP growth.' Continued current account deficits at current levels implied rises in the ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP 'in excess of anything observed historically.' More accurately, the question is not whether the deficit can be financed - because after the fact a country's current account deficit will always equal inflows of capital adjusted for changes in reserves. The question is at what level of interest rates and therefore of economic growth will the equilibrium between capital inflows and current account deficit be reached. The big current account deficits highlight another issue: exports are not rising quick enough for some people's liking. 'The model is one of export-led growth; the problem is that in most countries exports have yet to take off,' says Victor Bulmer-Thomas, head of the Institute for Latin American Studies at the University of London. This underlines that Latin America's return to growth has so far mostly arisen directly from the lifting of the constraint on access to foreign exchange. This first stage of growth arises because capital inflows allow an economy to spend more than it produces. The importance of this should not be minimised - it has a valuable role in boosting confidence and kick-starting the economy. 'The value of this initial positive effect should not be underestimated, especially in a region emerging from a 'lost decade' in terms of growth and development,' says Stephany Griffith-Jones of Sussex University's Institute of Development Studies in a recent book. It is however a temporary phenomenon. The second - more long-standing - beneficial effect on growth of capital inflows depends on the extent to which they finance growth in productive capacity. In the 1970s debt splurge, we now know that capital inflows generated insufficient new productive capacity to provide the future income that was necessary to finance the loans. Now the crucial second stage of growth depends on to what extent the inflows are directed to investment and how productive it is. If enough efficient investment takes place and output rises sufficiently, it is more likely that future debt servicing will be financeable without problems. In Mexico, some capital inflows are financing new factories and machinery for foreign and domestic investors. But the Mexican statistics - with their broad definition of intermediate goods - do not really permit a judgement of the extent to which the flows are financing consumption or investment. Moreover, some inflows which might be unequivocally defined as investment are going into construction and real estate projects, which may only obliquely, if at all, help to provide foreign currency income streams to service the financings. Mexico, for example, has been borrowing in dollars to finance toll-road construction.</p>

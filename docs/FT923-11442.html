			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Allocations replace pre-Budget bargaining THE PUBLIC spending round under-went minor reform last year when the then chief secretary to the Treasury made clear that he would not spend the party conference in the traditional manner of chief secretaries, ducking in and out of colleagues' hotel rooms for individual negotiations. The changes announced on Wednesday in the way in which public spending decisions will be taken will affect the role of the chief secretary rather than just his dignity. The new cabinet committee will inevitably mean that the chancellor has more involvement in spending decisions than at present The introduction of the new 'top down' process for agreeing spending for 1994-95 will coincide with the changes to the Budget cycle, leading to a combined Budget and public spending statement in late November or December - slightly later than the usual date for the Autumn Statement. Even Treasury officials profess some uncertainty about how the two sets of changes will mesh together. There will still be a cabinet economic discussion in July each year. If the new system is as firm as ministers made it sound this week, however, the 'control total' which will govern discretionary spending for the following year will already have been set, and the cabinet will be setting the 'control total' for the second year after the one in which the discussion is held. The chief secretary will still hold discussions with departmental ministers, and some spending bids will undoubtedly not make it beyond that stage. However, instead of being negotiations around planned departmental spending, the meetings will be about allocating money within the agreed total. Spending bids that survive those discussions will go to the chancellor's committee, which is likely to meet during September and October. Already nicknamed 'son of Star Chamber', after the committee which can act as arbitrator of last resort in the existing system, the chancellor's committee will include the chief secretary and consist mainly of non-departmental ministers such as the leaders of the Commons and the the Lords. The Treasury is, however, resigned to inclusion of a spending minister as well. As under the present arrangements, the cabinet as a whole will be asked to approve the final deal.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC SPENDING  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   1992-93   1993-94   1994-95   1995-96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation (% year on year ++) Old plans                            4.5      3.5       3         2.5 New plans                            3.5      3         2.25      2.25 Total govt spending (Pounds bn)* Old plans                          266      285       301       310 New plans                          266      285       294.1     303.5 Public sector borrowing  requirement (Pounds bn) Old plans                           28       32        25        19 New plans**                         28       32.5      18.6      12.5 New plans+++                        31.7     41.9      36.0      33.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: ++ as measured by GDP deflator. year on year in real terms. * applies to general government expenditure, excluding privatisation proceeds, at current prices. ** assumes government revenues are as set out in 1992 Budget. +++ assumes lower government revenues, based on projections by Salomon Brothers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT estimates based on Treasury data.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A SHEEP WAY TO CLEAR THE LAND IN SAN CLEMENTE  </P> <P> Glad to see that a San Clemente developer is now using sheep to clear the grass  off the hillsides. What a way to make the environmentalists happy, create a  picture post card scene for the local Chamber of Commerce and save some dollars  all at the same time.  </P> <P> Or so I thought until I read an article in a Seattle newspaper about sheep  grazing in New Zealand.  </P> <P> Seems that in this country of 3.5 million people and 71 million sheep, its  scientists have discovered that the digestive systems of the sheep are such  that the animals emit an oxide that is detrimental to the ozone layer. In fact,  they view it as being so serious that they are actually trying to develop a  pill to cut down or eliminate this gas. No fooling -- that is what the  newspaper in Seattle said!  </P> <P> While the New Zealanders ponder this question, I still encourage the developer  in San Clemente to continue grazing his sheep. And I doubt that their presence  will greatly adversely affect the ozone layer over Orange County.  </P> <P> CLARENCE J. TURNER  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

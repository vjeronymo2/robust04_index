However their development  in many fields does not meet our mutual expectations," German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel says in an interview published in  the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on Monday [7 March].    Kinkel stresses the need to realise that along with claims  for compensation by Czech victims of Nazism there at the same  time exist claims of Sudeten Germans expelled from  Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Kinkel says that Germany is  aware of its responsibility towards Czech victims of Nazism.  "We will seek to find an appropriate solution," he says.    "We are watching with interest steps by the Czech Government  concerning partial compensation for Nazi victims. But there  should not be any prejudices and a dialogue should be carried  out with Sudeten Germans," Kinkel says. "Results of the  German-Czech commission of historians which recently published a  report on its symposium on `Germans, Czechs and Slovaks during  the First Republic' should be taken into consideration much more  than before, which would help make the discussion a  `matter-of-fact' one," Kinkel says.    Kinkel expresses satisfaction concerning German-Czech  economic relations. "In the economic field, Germany, with a  roughly 25- percent share in both imports and exports, is  unambiguously the most important partner of the Czech Republic,"  he says. "We have opened our market to Czech goods. Thousands  of Czechs have found jobs in Germany, and especially in border  regions. Millions of German tourists visit the Czech Republic.  By this we are considerably contributing to economic and social  stability in the Czech Republic," he adds. Besides, the Czech  economy "has absorbed a considerable portion of German  investments oriented towards Central European countries," he  said.    On the future of Europe, Kinkel voices the conviction that  "excessive regulation and centralism" within the European Union  has to be moderated. However, the goals of the Union will  remain unchanged. On the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,  Kinkel says the approach by the EU, NATO and the United Nations  Security Council clearly shows the "firmness with which the  international community reacts to the Bosnian war."    "To achieve a functioning security system in Europe it is  important that different institutions -- the EU, the Conference  of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), NATO and Western  European Union (WEU) -- join together, Kinkel says, adding that  Germany supports such countries as the Czech Republic in their  efforts to approach the structures of European and  trans-Atlantic security.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Beef ban threat hits meat trade German threats to impose a ban on British beef imports because of fears over 'mad cow' disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) had already had 'disastrous' effects on the meat trade for at least one company, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday. She is preparing a dossier for her German counterparts on the effect of renewed publicity over BSE on meat exports. Germany has called for a special session of EU health ministers to discuss a ban on British beef imports. Mrs Shephard said she hoped the Germans would withdraw their request because it was not supported by any other EU country. The German health ministry said yesterday it would take no unilateral action to ban British beef if the meeting could prove that no risks were involved in importing meat which may be contaminated with BSE.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / US sends Marines to Haiti waters Four US naval amphibious assault ships will sail for Haiti today, carrying 2,000 US Marines, the defence department said yesterday. The ships are being sent to help in any evacuation of US citizens and 'designated foreign individuals' from Haiti, the department said. They will join eight US warships patrolling the waters off the Caribbean nation to enforce UN sanctions against Haiti's military regime. A ninth ship - the helicopter-carrier Wasp - is also in the area for training exercises with 650 Marines aboard. It was also announced yesterday that the US would no longer offer asylum to Haitian boat people, although refugees at centres built on the country's territory would continue to be processed for possible asylum in the US. Mr William Gray, President Bill Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said that those fleeing by sea would only be offered safe haven in Panama, which has agreed to accept up to 10,000 Haitian refugees for a six-month period. Mr Gray acknowledged that the policy shift was prompted in part by the drowning of nearly 100 boat people after their vessel had capsized. After Mr Clinton's decision to end all commercial air traffic between the US and Haiti, refugees have fled the nation in record numbers, often putting to sea in overcrowded and unsafe open boats. By reserving political asylum only for refugees at processing centres on land in Haiti, Washington is trying to stem the exodus. Mr Clinton has refused to rule out the possibility of an invasion to reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, exiled after a military coup in September 1991. However, a Pentagon spokesman said ships were being sent only as a precaution and no invasion was imminent.</p>

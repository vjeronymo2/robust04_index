			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / US disputes Iraqi troops pullback The US disputed claims from Iraq yesterday that it had moved a significant number of troops away from the border with Kuwait, and warned that a pre-emptive military strike was being considered. The Pentagon announced that 156,000 ground troops were on alert. Nearly 40,000 troops are in or heading for the Gulf, together with an additional 350 warplanes, including B-52 bombers and F-117 stealth fighters. Their arrival will bring the total of US aircraft and helicopters in the region to more than 650. The US was also said to be consulting other United Nations Security Council members about establishing some form of exclusion zone to prevent Iraq from conducting provocative manoeuvres in the future, a US official at the UN said. General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said some Iraqi units might have moved away from their combat positions, but that 'considerable units' remained close to the Kuwaiti border. He said: 'We still have quite some time to look at this situation before we are certain as to their intentions and where they are moving. I am not prepared yet to say that the crisis is over in any way.' However, Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said at the UN he believed Iraq no longer had the capability of using its weapons against Kuwait or any other country in the region. He was introducing his report on long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons potential, which he believes triggered the weekend troop movements. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, said earlier that a pre-emptive strike against the forces of President Saddam Hussein was under consideration because 'we want to make sure that they do not do this again'. She also said there was evidence of a minimal Iraqi troop movement away from the border. Mr Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, Iraqi foreign minister, said all Iraqi forces had left their forward positions by noon yesterday. A Reuter correspondent returning from Basra to Baghdad yesterday reported large numbers of tanks, armoured troop carriers and artillery moving north, but some forces were moving south. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said a pre-emptive strike remained an option if the Iraqi forces did not pull back: 'We have prepared the contingency plans to do that if it turns out to be the appropriate course of action. We will resolve the crisis in a relatively short amount of time, and if that requires the use of military power, we are prepared to use it.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, left for Kuwait last night where he is expected to meet the Gulf Co-operation Council. In Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry said it was sending two senior diplomats to Baghdad and Kuwait in an effort to defuse the crisis.

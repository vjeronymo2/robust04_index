			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is the last leg of Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet's visit to the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia  is a large trading partner of Vietnam and the country is still  regarded as the powerful nation in the eyes of a large number of  people in the world. On this occasion, the Voice of Vietnam  brings you a review of economic relations between Vietnam and  Russia, and also between Russia and other countries.    To broaden economic ties with the outside world is an  obvious  strategy for the current economic situation in Russia. Russia  has been turning military friends into economic partners as well  as traditional trading partners including Germany and other  countries in Eastern Europe. Russia has entered the markets in  some Western European countries and Asia, especially Northern  Asia.    Since 1990, relations between South Korea and Russia have  developed favorably. Two-way trade reached $1.6 billion in  1993, doubling that of the previous year. China has become the  second biggest trading partner of Russia after Germany. Being  an heir of the former USSR, Russia has been integrating into  economic cooperation in the region. The shuttled mission of  Russian economic groups to the Asia-Pacific region demonstrates  the country's interest in broadening economic ties in the region.    Russia has been a traditional trading partner of Vietnam.  Two-way trade value exceeded the target of $300 million, mainly  in energy, oil and gas exploitation, industry, agriculture,  trade, and transport.    Together with the visit to Russia by Vietnamese Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and the visit to Vietnam by Russian  Deputy Prime Minister Yarov, the visit to Russia by Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet will create new prospects for bilateral  cooperation between the two countries.</p>

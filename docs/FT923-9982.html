			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The case for lateral thinking: Richard Tomkins pulls the drawstrings on the public purse THE 1980s epic Raise The Titanic cost Dollars 36m to make, but it was not a successful film. In fact, it turned into one of the biggest box office turkeys of all time. Afterwards Lord Grade, the showbiz magnate who made it, famously observed that it would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic. A decade later, as the British economy flounders, we need more of Lord Grade's lateral thinking if growing public spending is to be brought under control. The trouble is, most people in Britain are useless at lateral thinking. To take an obvious example, everyone knows it is cheaper to put a sailing boat on a low-loader lorry and park it in a central London car park than to berth it in a Solent marina. But drive into the underground car park behind John Lewis in Oxford Street any day of the week, and what do you find it full of? Cars. In one sense, civil servants are an exception to this rule: they are highly imaginative when it comes to spending more money. When asked to save it, however, they tend to revert to type. Thus it is incumbent on the rest of us to help the chancellor find the spending cuts he needs. A good starting place might be the defence ministry. To cancel Britain's one-third share in the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft project would jeopardise 40,000 jobs, it is said. But if employment is the best reason for going ahead with the project, you do not need Lord Grade to tell you that it would make more sense to give the 40,000 workers Pounds 100,000 each to start up their own businesses, and keep the Pounds 2.7bn change. And what of that Pounds 10bn folly, the Trident submarine? Investing sums as vast as this in countering the submarines of the former Soviet bloc is surely insanity when, for a fraction of the cost, you could buy the former Soviet fleet and scrap it. Next might come the Department of Social Security. Some Pounds 26bn a year is spent on old-age pensions. Clearly this is an area where the search for economies needs to be balanced with compassion: subsidising the provision of hazardous sports for the elderly, for example, might be regarded as distasteful. On a more populist note, however, the welfare budget could be slashed by offering 'new age' travellers and drop-outs Pounds 1,000 each and a ticket to the foreign destination of their choice provided they promised never to come back. After that, the criminal justice system. Whoever came up with the idea of criminalising crime committed a catastrophic blunder: far from restricting its spread, all it has succeeded in doing is driving it underground. It is time to recognise this mistake and legalise crime. If the Pounds 8bn a year saved by the abolition of the criminal justice system were to be redistributed among potential wrong-doers, they would be so busy spending the money that they would lack both the time and inclination to offend. In fact, there is barely an area of government policy where you cannot find scope for whopping savings. Take transport: some branch lines are so heavily subsidised that it would be cheaper to close them and put chauffeur-driven limousines at the disposal of their passengers. Education? It surely makes sense to match the number of university places with the demand for graduates instead of stuffing people's heads with useless knowledge. The arts? Cut the colossal subsidies to opera by offering everyone turning up at Covent Garden Pounds 50 to go away and have a nice meal instead. Economic forecasting? Save money and improve accuracy by sacking the Treasury economists and replacing them with someone flipping a coin. (At least he would get it half right). Maybe these suggestions sound barmy. But back in the 1980s, people used to say that the coal and steel industries consumed such huge subsidies that it would be cheaper to pay their employees to stay at home. So what happened? We did. And what merriment there was when someone suggested it might be cheaper to pay farmers to stop growing things than to go on subsidising the production of food that could not be sold. No one is laughing now. If Britain's economy is to be put back on an even keel, therefore, the imagination must be given its head. And to those who criticise lateral thinking as bogus, I say only this: if that kind of blinkered, small-minded attitude had prevailed at the beginning of the century, the Titanic might never have been built.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Food Agency has exerted  pressure on a major rice wholesaler not to protest the  government's food control policies, it was learned Wednesday [1  June].    The agency asked Bunji Nakamura, president of Yamatane  Corp.,  to keep the company's outspoken chairman Seizo Yamazaki from  making provocative remarks against Japan's food control system,  in which the government keeps a tight grip on production and  marketing of rice.    The agency made the request on March 16 when it called  Nakamura to ask for Yamatane's cooperation in sales of imported  rice.    The agency denied the accusation, but other reports said  that  it has asked members of farm ministry panels and food-services  industry officials not to criticize the government's policies.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Nigerian leader promises fresh elections soon CHIEF Ernest Shonekan, the head of Nigeria's military-installed government, yesterday promised to call fresh elections within the next seven months as pro-democracy strikes grounded air and road transport and paralysed Lagos, the country's commercial capital. In his first national address since taking office last Thursday, Mr Shonekan admitted that his stop-gap administration was a 'second-best solution' to the political impasse created by Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the former military ruler, when he annulled presidential elections in June. He appealed to labour unions and pro-democracy activists in Lagos to end the strikes which have turned the chaotic metropolis of 7m people into a ghost town. But with Chief Moshood Abiola, the winner of the annulled election, still absent from the country and unlikely to return soon, the pro-democracy movement may lose steam after a week of protests. 'If Shonekan can survive through this week, Abiola will have lost his claim to the presidency,' one diplomat said yesterday. A decree yesterday ended speculation over the extent of Mr Shonekan's authority by naming him head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Military officers loyal to Gen Babangida, however, maintain key positions at the head of the army and joint defence staff. The State Security Services, Gen Babangida's feared secret police, have not been dis-mantled. Trade union leaders from Nigeria's National Labour Congress were due to meet Mr Shonekan today in an attempt to end the strikes. In addition to their political demands, unions want the government to repeal its decision to raise petrol prices. Mr Shonekan will be told that he can expect riots in Lagos and other big cities if his government insists on raising the cost of Nigeria's heavily-subsidised fuel 10-fold. In his speech, Mr Shonekan said the National Electoral Commission and Nigeria's two military-created political parties would draft a timetable for new elections within a week. His government, he said, would lead a crusade against corruption and the 'get-rich-quick mania' that lay at the root of the country's social problems. He promised the national assembly would be given legislative powers. It was not immediately clear whether Mr Shonekan's speech would pacify pro-democracy activists. Hostility to the new government is strongest in the south-west, Chief Abiola's home, where Yorubas feel they were cheated of a rare chance to lead a new civilian government.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. V. Ikramov, I. M. Roshchupkin and A. G. </F> Safronov, KOMPOZIT Scientific Production Association,  Kaliningrad, Moscow Oblast; UDC 535.87]    [Abstract] The efficiency of use of a large bimorph  adaptive mirror with compensation of large-scale low-frequency  distortions is demonstrated. The theoretical approach to  achieving efficient compensation of wave front distortions is  outlined. Computer simulation of the correction of low-order  optical aberrations with this mirror is described in detail. A  comparative analysis is made of the efficiency of a large  bimorph mirror and an adaptive mirror with discrete  electromechanical drives. The results, revealing a high  efficiency of such a mirror in the compensation of large-scale  low-frequency wave front distortions, were obtained for a  controlling mosaiced piezoelectric layer 1 mm thick (with a  thickness of the mirror plate 78 mm). This relation of  thicknesses evidently is not optimal and was selected only to  demonstrate the possibilities of a large bimorph adaptive  mirror. It is proposed that a multilayer mosaiced piezoelectric  structure be used for reducing the controlling voltage (which in  the experiments was about 300 V). A similar approach also is  applicable in selecting the optimum thickness of the  piezoelectric structure. A simple and effective method is  proposed for forming a mosaiced bimorph structure. It involves  using a multilayer structure with the least possible thickness  of the piezoelectric film and optimized total thickness. In this  case the controlling voltage can be reduced to several tens of  volts and the individual piezoelements need not be in contact  with one another. Figures 4; references: 2 Russian.</p>

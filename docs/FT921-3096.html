			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Vote on 'demutualising' Equitable Life starts THE formidable task of 'demutualising' the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the large US insurer, got under way this weekend with the mailing of 2.2m ballots to eligible policyholders. Two thirds of policyholders voting must be in favour for the 'demutualisation' plan - that is, a scheme which will turn the company from one belonging to policyholders to one owned by shareholders - to go ahead. The vote is scheduled for May 6. A hearing by the New York Insurance Department has also been arranged for April 21; approval by the New York Superintendent of Insurance is a further pre-condition to the move. The Equitable has been struggling financially following over-aggressive expansion in the 1980s and heavy exposure to junk bonds and property-related investments. Last year, Axa, the French insurance company, provided a much-needed Dollars 1bn capital infusion, which will convert into an equity stake of between 40 and 49 per cent when demutualisation occurs. The demutualisation scheme will allocate ordinary shares among Equitable's policyholders, and is being combined with an initial public offering, which will involve selling shares to outside investors. The offering must raise at least Dollars 300m. Part of this money will go towards providing alternative cash payments or policy benefits to policyholders receiving a small number of shares under the demutualisation scheme; up to Dollars 220m may be used to pay operating expenses and dividends. In the demutualisation documents, Equitable revealed that individual insurance and annuity policy surrenders and withdrawals increased by 53 per cent to Dollars 1.88bn in the first nine months of 1991 over the comparable 1990 figure. It also says that equity real estate and below investment grade debt and equity interests comprised 12.6 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively of the Dollars 41.3bn general account and GIC segment investment portfolio.</p>

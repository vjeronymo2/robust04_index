			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS;  </P> <P> HOME CLUB STORE TO GO ON NORWALK BLVD. SITE  </P> <P> Hawaiian Gardens will get a Home Club store that is expected to bring with it  as many as 190 jobs and $300,000 a year in sales tax revenue under a  development agreement approved Tuesday by the City Council, which also serves  as the city's Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> The store, the 42nd in the nation for the Home Club chain, will be located on  Norwalk Boulevard just south of Carson Street. Under the development and  disposition agreement that the council approved, Gordon F. Sadkin, a commercial  real estate developer from Torrance, is buying the land from the city and will  lease it to Home Club.  </P> <P> David Meyer, the city's redevelopment consultant, said it cost the city  $4,089,359 to acquire the land and do preparation work such as demolishing old  buildings and removing hazardous diesel fuel. The city is selling the land to  Sadkin for $2,776,300 but will recoup the difference of $1,313,059 over the  next 15 years through property taxes that Sadkin pays, Meyer said.  </P></p>

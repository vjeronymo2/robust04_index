			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin instructed the government not to wait until a border  agreement is signed with Estonia and to demarcate the frontier  by December 31, 1994.    "I resolve, before signing a Russian-Estonian border treaty,  to unilaterally mark the Estonian section of the Russian state  border where it existed on the moment when the Russian  Federation recognised the sovereingty of the Estonian Republic  on August 24, 1991," said the decree received by TASS on Tuesday.    The decision was adopted "to protect Russian political and  economic interests" and also because "of the negative attitude"  of Estonia to bilateral demarcation of the border.    Estonia claims some bordering Russian territories.</p>

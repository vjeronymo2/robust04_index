Furthermore, Congress found that individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Community rehabilitation programs, working closely with individuals with disabilities, their advocates, representatives, families, labor unions, and employers, are a significant resource for addressing the national problem of unemployment and underemployment of individuals with severe disabilities. Those programs serve an estimated two million individuals with disabilities annually, many through referral arrangements with vocational rehabilitation State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On-going post-employment training is needed for all who work in community rehabilitation programs to achieve improved employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities, especially volunteers, providers, and employers who fill key roles in staffing, directing, and using these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, RSA funded many nonacademic training programs that maintain or upgrade the skills of currently employed individuals in community rehabilitation programs under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program. However, final regulations for the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (59 FR 31060) focus on the support of academic programs that award degrees or certificates. Therefore, support for nonacademic training programs will be carried out under the other applicable training program authorities, such as this Rehabilitation Continuing Education program, the Short-Term Training program, and the Experimental and Innovative Training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Projects must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide post-employment training for job coaches and other direct service community rehabilitation personnel, including employers and co-workers of people with disabilities who provide support at work for persons with severe disabilities (often called natural support), administrators, volunteers and peer counselors, and other personnel of community rehabilitation programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Coordinate with activities supported by business and industry, State vocational rehabilitation agencies, school-to-work transition projects, and job development centers funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide seminars, forums, train-the-trainer training, technical assistance, and similar methods to meet recurrent and common training needs of employed rehabilitation personnel throughout a multi-State geographical area; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunming, June 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists have  succeeded in artificially cultivating 108 species of endangered  plants in southwest China's Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical  Garden.    Located in Yunnan Province, Xishuangbanna is the only vast  area of tropical forest in China. It covers an area of 19,000  sq km. It also boasts one sixth of the species of seed plants  and pteridophytes in China. In 1959 the Chinese Academy of  Sciences set up the tropical botanical garden, the first of its  kind in the country.    Because of human activities leading to deterioration of the  environment, the tropical forests at Xishuangbanna have shrunk  by 50 percent in the past five decades. Many species of plants  are on the verge of extinction.    In 1984 the tropical botanical garden set aside 80 ha of  land  to cultivate the endangered species. After years of research  and experimentation the garden has succeeded in cultivating 108  species of endangered plants, including 46 species that were  listed among the 53 major species of plants under state  protection.    Many of these plants date back to the tertiary period and  are  considered as living fossils.    In order to better study and protect the endangered plants,  the tropical botanical garden is preparing to set up a bank of  seed genes of tropical plants.</p>

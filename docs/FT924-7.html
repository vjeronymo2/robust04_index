			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Price war fears hit Sainsbury FOOD retail shares fell sharply, pulling the market down in their wake, after supermarket group Sainsbury said it would launch an aggressive package of price cuts in the New Year. The announcement immediately raised fears that a damaging food price war could follow and dent prospects in the food retail sector. Tesco, the rival food supermarket group, is expected to announce its response to the Sainsbury move either today, or early next week. Although rounds of price promotions are expected at this time of year to compensate for flat new year trading, yesterday's move by Sainsbury was viewed in the market as putting further pressure on Tesco, which has used improved margins to offset lower sales growth and enhance earnings. Mr Nick Bubb at Morgan Stanley said that with the food retail sector at a five-year relative high against the stock market, some investors were already looking for an excuse to take profits. He added: 'This is a clever pre-emptive strike by Sainsbury, which can afford to take risks, and Tesco margins will be put under more pressure.' He believes that the price war talk will continue to affect sentiment and is advising clients to go underweight in the sector, with shares likely to come off a further 5-10 per cent. At Henderson Crosthwaite, Mr Bill Myers said that short-term weakness would be counterbalanced by selective buying at the discounted levels, with Sainsbury and Argyll prices likely to be restored prior to yesterday's levels. Argyll closed at 398p, a fall of 22, Kwik Save at 784p, down by the same amount, Sainsbury at 561p, off 16, and Tesco the same at 251p. Pentos setback A profits warning from Pentos, the high street retailer which owns the Rymans and Athena chains, sent the shares crashing and, along with the Sainsbury announcement, took the shine off the gains made among retail stocks on Tuesday. Pentos said that pre-tax profits for the year ending December 1992 would be 'significantly below market expectations.' It blamed disappointing trading at Athena and its Pentos Office Furniture outlets, as well as reorganisation costs. The shares closed 16 down at 56p. Analysts quickly moved to chop forecasts. County NatWest moved from Pounds 17m to Pounds 6m, while Kleinwort Benson expected to change from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 5m. Mr John Richards at County said that the bad news was probably all in the share price now, but that any recovery would take some time. He also said that hints that books may be included in changes to VAT in the Budget in March could also cast a cloud over the shares. There were also criticisms from analysts over the company's accounting policy. The Pentos warning was behind the fall in WH Smith, even though Pentos said its Dillons chain was trading 'satisfactorily'. Smith 'A' shares retreated 10 to 500p. J Menzies fell 4 to 457p, although Pentos said Rymans was also performing as expected. Marks and Spencer lost 4 to 328p on the back of the Sainsbury announcement. Food sales are an increasingly larger part of the company's revenues. Acquisition talk once again circled Kingfisher, helping the shares rise 6 to 589p. Sainsbury also helped drag food manufacturers down as analysts predicted a tough first quarter, the sector being squeezed between higher raw material costs and price cutting retailers. Cadbury-Schweppes tumbled 9 to 439p, Northern Foods 8 to 265p and United Biscuits 11 to 352p. The recovery in British Aerospace continued with renewed hints that a new Hawk aircraft order could be in the offing from the Indonesian government. The shares lifted 6 to 167p. Elsewhere, motor industry groups were strong, sentiment lifted by bullish statements from Vauxhall. Component manufacturer GKN rose 4 to 448p, while distributors Evans Halshaw added 3 to 205p and Pendragon 3 to 236p. Buoyant holiday bookings again lifted Airtours, shares in the tour operator ahead 15 at 300p. Sentiment was also helped by rumours that some institutional shareholders at Airtours rival Owners Abroad are unhappy about the latter's tie-up with German travel group LTU and may vote against it at the EGM on 8 January. If true, this could encourage renewed interest from Airtours, which is thought to have held exploratory talks with Owners in the summer. Owners shares raced forward 7 to 94p. Old talk that Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, was eyeing the smaller Mount Charlotte concern gave some investors the excuse to take profits and the shares fell 2 to 45p. House builders at last took some comfort from the recovery talk and made gains. Among them, Bellway added 13 to 311p, Henry Boot 5 to 230p, and Countryside Properties 3 to 93p. Trading in derivatives remained slack yesterday, and traders stressed that increased business in the March stock index future contract still left the total well below average levels. The contract closed at a premium of around 12 points above its fair value reading of 12 above cash, allowing for the dividend and financing flows imposed on holders of the underlying blue chip stocks. Traders said that most of the business came from speculative sources, including such few locals, or independent traders, as were still to be found in the City of London ahead of the new year break. The big institutions have largely completed their activities for this year, and the securities houses are no longer interested in taking positions ahead of the extended holiday weekend. Turnover in traded options rose to 21,718 contracts from the 10,619 of the previous session, with the FT-SE contract recording 8,801 against 3,288. Among individual contracts, Asda recorded 3,684, reflecting unease in the food retail sector. Grand Metropolitan followed with 2,209 and Lonrho recorded 738 contracts.

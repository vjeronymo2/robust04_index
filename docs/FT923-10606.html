			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar at post-intervention low THE DOLLAR dipped to its lowest point against the D-Mark since last week's central bank intervention, after figures showed that US consumer confidence had fallen sharply in July, writes James Blitz. The US consumer confidence index dropped to 61.0 this month from a revised 72.6 in June, while the market had expected it to decline to 69.5. That news triggered a new wave of dollar selling, with the currency weakening to a low of DM1.4690. With the dollar on its lows, the market was beset with rumours that the Federal Reserve was intervening in the market, buying the currency at DM1.4700. The rumour boosted the US unit by more than a pfennig within several minutes. Later, when it proved to be unfounded, the dollar slipped again to close in Europe nearly a pfennig down on the day at DM1.4740. At the end of New York trading it was slightly lower at DM1.4730. The see-saw dollar/D-Mark trading showed how fearful the market is about intervention. Many analysts are convinced that the US currency will not test the all-time low again. Traders said they expect these fears to fade with time. The next key US indicator is tomorrow's figure for GDP growth in the second quarter. The forecast is for an annualised drop to 1.7 per cent from the first quarter's 2.7 per cent. The yen remained weak against the D-Mark, following the Bank of Japan's half-point reduction in the official discount rate on Monday to 3.25 per cent. Traders said the Japanese currency continued to be undermined by the fragile state of the Tokyo stock market, and a new round of allegations about corruption in the ruling party. The yen finished against the D-Mark at Y86.53 from a previous close of Y86.00. Against the dollar, the yen was marginally firmer, at Y127.60, from a previous Y127.70, while in New York it improved further to close at Y127.40. Sterling firmed against the D-Mark in the morning, but retreated in the afternoon in the wake of the dollar's weakness. A gloomy quarterly report from the Confederation of British Industry on UK industrial trends had little effect on the pound, as its contents had been well leaked in the UK press over the weekend. However, the report, which said that manufacturing output would continue to fall over the next four months and that more jobs will be cut, darkened the economic gloom around sterling. The pound closed unchanged at DM2.8425. But the gap between sterling and the next weakest currency in the EMS grid, the Italian lira, widened to 2.57 percentage points on a scale measuring the currencies' strengths against the ecu. The lira was unchanged against the D-Mark at L756.2.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "No EU Referendum Until Next </F> Year"]    [Excerpts] Organized opponents of the European Union [EU]  are demanding that enough time be allowed for a citizens' debate  on Finland's possible membership in the EU and that the planned  referendum be postponed until next year.    "All the parties currently in the government promised before  the last legislative elections that Finland would not seek EU  membership during this election period. Since no EU debate was  held before the election, there should be one now, and enough  time should be provided for it," says the EU opposition's new  umbrella organization in a resolution.    The umbrella organization introduced itself yesterday. It  was  formed by the four strongest civic organizations opposing  Finland's membership in the EU, and its name is An Independent  Finland -- The Best Alternative. [passage omitted]    It is a very mixed organization, and that is its strength,  since the intention is to achieve majority support for a no vote  in the referendum, according to the organization's  representatives at yesterday's presentation.  <H5>  Tiitinen Criticized </H5>   Erkki Pulliainen noted that the current process means that  we  are passing from parliamentary democracy to domination by civil  servants and the courts.    "From the West European standpoint, that is a very much a  step in the wrong direction," he said.    Pulliainen promised that the organization would soon take a  stand on the Tiitinen Committee's proposal concerning the effect  of EU membership on the Constitution. Among other things, the  committee said that Finland's membership in the EU could be  approved by a two-thirds majority in one session of the  Eduskunta. The umbrella organization and its supporting  organizations take an unequivocally different view on that  subject.</p>

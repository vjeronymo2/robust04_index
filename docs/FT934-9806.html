			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Observer: Whitwam's path It takes more than a few jitters on world stock markets to knock burly Dave Whitwam off his stride. The chairman and chief executive of Whirlpool, the world's largest white goods company, passed through London yesterday on a whistle-stop European tour to drum up interest in his company's shares. Not the best of timing, one might have thought. But Whitwam is unabashed. Having bought the Philips white goods business in 1989 and established Whirlpool's brand name in Europe, he is now intent on building up a following among European investors. His target is for 10-15 per cent of Whirlpool's shares to be held in Europe eventually. At the moment the figure is around 3 per cent. Like hundreds of US executives before him, he hopes to attract that much sought-after species, the patient long-term continental investor. The species, whose natural habitat is Germany and Switzerland, has suffered a few knocks recently. But Whitwam reports that it is still alive and well. Indeed, at the Zurich meeting, one potential investor even had the temerity to ask a question about Whirlpool's latest quarterly results. He was nearly attacked by fellow investors for asking such a short-term question.</p>

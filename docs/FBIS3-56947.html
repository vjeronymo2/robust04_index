The Korean Central News Agency reported that the criticism  of  the alleged purchase of spectrum analyzers by the DPRK is aimed  at slandering [umyong-ul tonjigo] the DPRK and applying outside  pressure.    Last week, the Japanese authorities began to investigate a  company that is suspected of selling this apparatus to the DPRK  through China.    The mentioned spectrum analyzers are used in televisual  [telebijon] communication.</p>

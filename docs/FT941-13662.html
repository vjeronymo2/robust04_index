			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Trade News: India chooses operators for radio paging service India's telecommunications department has chosen 15 companies to operate radio paging services in 27 cities, nearly a year after more than 80 companies bid for licences. The government's letters of intent to the companies, all joint ventures with foreign partners, mark another step in India's attempts to part-privatise the telecommunications sector. Formal licences will be issued once the companies accept the terms and pay licence fees and other charges. The delay in announcing the contracts has been attributed partly to a court action by unsuccessful bidders in last year's award of contracts for cellular networks in Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, and partly to the fact that India's telecommunications policy is still under review. The government has given some companies as many as 10 licences to operate competing services in big cities. Steamers Telecom and its Indian partner, India Telecomp, owned by the Delhi-based Sanjay Dalmia group, has licences for 10 cities, including Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras and Bangalore. Hong Kong's Hutchison Max has licences for seven cities, while Arya Communications, associated with Motorola of the US, has two, for Bombay and Bangalore. Other companies involved in the joint ventures include Fones West of the US, Telecom International of New Zealand, Champion Technology of Hong Kong, Singapore Telecom International, France Telecom Mobiles, and Easycall Communications of the Philippines. As many as three operators, constrained by a stipulation that applicants have a foreign partner which could hold up to 51 per cent of the venture, will compete in 15 cities, including the four largest - Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. Customers can be charged no more than Rs150 (Pounds 3.19) a month for the service. In Bombay, the country's most lucrative market, the highest bid was Rs105m over the initial three-year period, which would mean a revenue of Rs420m (Pounds 8.9m) for the department from the four companies licensed for that city. Delhi commanded a peak fee of Rs75.6m, followed by Rs45m in Madras and Rs42.3m in Calcutta.</p>

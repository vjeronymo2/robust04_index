			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Size of RJB coal offer surprises rival bidders RJB Mining offered at least 50 per cent more than the next highest bidder to become the government's preferred candidate to buy British Coal's English mines, it emerged yesterday. The gap will raise questions about RJB's assessment of the coal market and its ability to cut operating costs. Fellow bidders and British Coal executives have been surprised by the size of RJB's Pounds 900m offer. None of the bidders will discuss its tender, but RJB's offer for the three English regions is understood to compare with considerably less than Pounds 600m from English Coal, a management buy-out team. RJB and English Coal were the only companies that bid for all three regions. However, Coal Investments, a quoted company, is thought to have offered about Pounds 510m for the two central regions, which are the bulk of the English assets. The third region, the north-east, is judged by analysts to be worth less than Pounds 80m. Some of the failed bidders hope RJB, which has a market value of less than Pounds 160m, will be unable to raise the more than Pounds 1bn it needs to finance the bid and provide working capital. However, to win the government's backing RJB and its adviser Barclays de Zoete Wedd will have provided strong evidence that the money will be raised before the scheduled completion of the British Coal privatisation on December 24. Ministers also sought reassurance on the long-term viability of RJB's business plan. Mr John Reynolds, analyst at James Capel, said yesterday that on his assumptions for the coal market and RJB's profit margins, the company would have 'crippling debt' and would provide negligible returns for equity investors after 1998. That is the year contracts with electricity generators expire. RJB assumes the electricity generators will want more than 45m tonnes of coal a year until the end of the century, but some rival bidders believe a figure in the mid-30s would be optimistic. Mr Reynolds values the business RJB hopes to buy at 'no more than Pounds 550m'. RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd are thought to be planning to raise about Pounds 400m through a share issue, including a public offer for sale. The rest of the Pounds 1bn would be provided by bank debt. The business plan is likely to suggest that most of the debt will be paid back within three years and will point to strong cash flows from existing contracts with the generators. The company will also hope to reduce the offer price in detailed negotiations over the next few months. However, the amount saved is likely to be tens of millions rather than hundreds.

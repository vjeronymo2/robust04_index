			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Arts: Anne Evans makes debut recital - The Edinburgh Festival After three encores at the end of her Queen's Hall recital, the soprano Anne Evans held up her hand to stop the audience asking for more. 'You'll have to excuse me, as this is my first recital. Ever. You've heard it all.' Since Evans has been singing for 25-odd years, this is a surprise; but this was an accomplished debut in the form. And how smart of Brian McMaster to ask her just now, while her Isolde has been making recent news, and to present her as the opening recitalist. Evans takes her place on the recital platform with simple dignity. One admires, as one seldom can with a Wagnerian soprano, her wrists, her ankles. Principally, however, the eye settles on her erect carriage and the striking bone structure of her face. From seeing her, it is hard to believe that she has already had a long career. Or from hearing her. Evans's voice has real bloom, and this is surely what has made her valued in the dramatic repertory. Where others are beefy or clarion or steely or bovine, she has fragrance. Combine that with power and commitment, and you have something rare. Her fare consisted of Berg's Seven Early Songs, Schumann's Frauenliebe und-leben, and Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder. When she greets spring in Wolf's 'Er ist's' (her first encore), everything is in harmony. She is equally eloquent in revealing her late husband's sleep of death in the Schumann, and in the softly ascents of anguished desire in Wagner's 'Im Treibhaus'. But Evans is not consistently eloquent, and the basic musicianship that gives her so sure a sense of the shape of each song has a few faults. The vowels and consonants (however clearly delivered) are not naturally married; and she is seldom free in most open 'e' vowel sounds. Her conception of legato is also imperfect. Very often she 'pings' into a new note, and then adds vibrato (a) to hoist it up into tune (b) to swell its volume. The impulse that shapes each note overrules the impulse that links the notes into a phrase. When a phrase or a song works for Evans, these flaws vanish, and her voice is completely focused in its utterance. Elsewhere, her sound is lovely enough to please an audience; she is intelligently involved in words even when she does not communicate them effectively. But she is still an immature artist. Perhaps the new challenge of the recital platform is what she needs.</p>

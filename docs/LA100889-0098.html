			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> TYPHOON HITS PHILIPPINES  </P> <P> Typhoon Angela roared through the northern part of the main island of Luzon in  the Philippines, killing at least 26 people and leaving another 40 missing,  relief officials said. The storm, with winds over 100 m.p.h., caused heavy  damage to structures and crops, with about 8,500 people being forced from their  homes. The 26 who were killed drowned when floodwaters swept through their  homes in the coastal town of Gonzaga, 270 miles north of Manila. Detailed  damage and casualty reports from remote areas may take days or weeks to reach  Manila, the capital, because of ruptured communications.  </P></p>

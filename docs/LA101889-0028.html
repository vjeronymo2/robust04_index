			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Wells Fargo &amp; Co.: The San Francisco banking company's third-quarter  earnings advanced 17% from a year ago to $153.7 million. The provision for loan  losses was $82 million, up 9%. The results were attributed in part to the solid  performance of the state's economy and its move to bolster its presence in  Southern California. During the period, the firm signed definitive agreements  to buy Valley National Bank of Glendale, Central Pacific Corp. of Bakersfield  and Torrey Pines Group of Solana Beach.  </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kawasaki Steel warns of loss due to US shake-up KAWASAKI Steel yesterday warned that it was heading for a consolidated loss this year, mostly because of difficulties with its US joint-venture, Armco Steel. The warning underlines the mounting costs which Japanese manufacturing companies face from their aggressive expansion in the late 1980s. Most of Japan's leading steel makers formed joint ventures in the US in the second half of the 1980s, partly to supply Japanese car manufacturing plants which were being set up in North America. The US steel industry welcomed the injection of Japanese capital and technology to help them out of a structural crisis. During the late 1980s, low interest rates in Japan meant many Japanese companies were able to raise funds for international expansion extremely cheaply. However, it is now thought that most Japanese steelmakers are losing heavily on their US joint ventures, which have required substantial investments in technology and management to compete effectively with low cost mini-mills. Kawasaki Steel, which is engaged in an extensive restructuring of domestic plants, said it expected to make an after tax loss of Y29bn (Dollars 240m) for the year ended March. It made a net profit of Y14bn in 1991-1992. The company's unconsolidated pre-tax profit is expected to fall 66 per cent to Y18bn on sales of Y1,320bn, down 4.2 per cent. The consolidated loss is mainly due to the cost of restructuring Armco Steel, a joint venture with Armco, the US steel maker. The joint venture declared an extraordinary loss of Dollars 300m after writing off some of its production facilities in an attempt to modernise production and reduce costs.</p>

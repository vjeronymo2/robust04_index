			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 29 (ATA) -- Albania will sell  pesticides abroad through open auctions. The pesticides were  brought into Albania as credits during favourable conditions  within the last three years. The Albanian Government has  commissioned the Ministry of Agriculture to sell the pesticides  to the producing companies and later through open auctions.    "A special commission of the Ministry of Agriculture will  follow all the international laws in pesticides sale," Hasan  Halili, minister of agriculture told an ATA reporter. Mr.  Halili said he considers pesticides selling to be the only  acceptable solution for avoiding the grave ecological and  environmental repercussions the pesticides might bring about  when they expire.    Last October, the government permitted the sale of the  pesticides inside Albania but according to the data of the  Ministry of Agriculture and food the sold quantity has been  insignificant.    Mr. Halili said the very companies which brought the  pesticides to Albania has continually made requests for retaking  them. "If the producing companies would not evade in a proper  time the pesticides, we will put them to auction after we have  received the approval of the organisms which financed their  transport," he said.    The European Union, through the Picu office in Tirana, has  been the first organism which offered its assistance for  treating the pesticides brought in Albania in the context of the  PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]  program. The specialists say they are worried about the  pesticides problem.    480 tons of pesticides were brought to Albania during the  1991-1993 period through the Italian credit, PHARE program and  the World Bank credit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Makovskaya, under the rubric the "Money </F> Market": "New System for Registration of Stock Issues: Bankers  Must Report to Future Investors"]    [Text] The Central Bank of Russia [TsBR] has published a  new edition of the instructions on the system for issuing and  registering securities of commercial banks. When this issue was  prepared, the text was not yet in official distribution, but in  the opinion of specialists, the amendments and additions made in  the document should fill in the gaps left by the instructions  which preceeded them (No 8), which have been in effect for the  last year and a half, as well as bolster the TsBR's control over  the issue of commercial bank stock.    Beginning on 15 February, all Russian commercial banks must  compile prospectuses for the issue of securities following a  form which envisions inclusion of information on major  stockholders who own more than 5 percent of the votes (as well  as, in turn, the major stockholders of those stockholders).  Furthermore, in the prospectus for the issue, bankers will have  to indicate information on members of the council of directors,  the size of their blocks of stock, and their participation in  other organizations, indicating the posts (to avoid  cross-holding of blocks of stock). The document must give the  investor an idea of the procedure for forming the bank's capital  stock and the managers of the structure in which he has decided  to invest money. Until now such information has been offered  only to the antimonopoly committee, which usually approves the  prospectus of the banks' issue after the TsBR does.    Moreover, now the Central Bank of Russia has made commercial  banks provide any investor with an issue report containing,  along with the traditional information, the information listed  above upon the first demand. If the bank employees "do not have  a prospectus available," the client has the right to present a  complaint of improper treatment to the TsBR. If the violations  do not prove to be isolated occurrences, the TsBR may suspend  the commercial bank's subscription campaign.    As the chief of the securities division of the TsBR, Andrey  Kozlov, announced at a press conference devoted to putting the  system for issuing and registering stock of commercial banks  into effect, its creators tried to protect the investor's  interests at least in the banking sector by providing him with  maximum access to all the information needed to make the right  decision in selecting an investment object. Andrey Kozlov noted  that in the West all the moral and financial responsibility is  on the investor himself when a particular financial structure  goes bankrupt, since the investor always has the opportunity to  obtain exhaustive information about the enterprise or the bank  whose stock he is buying. But in Russia some of the moral  responsibility to the ordinary citizen, who is being tempted by  one ad for huge dividends after another, lies on state organs.  Thus, the TsBR has decided to make a contribution to protecting  the investor by suggesting that he demand from the banks a  detailed issue prospectus certified by the bank manager, his  chief accountant, and the auditing firm.    The new instructions, in addition to provisions which  toughen  control, contain a nice surprise even for bankers. Until  recently, during the subscription campaign, capital obtained  while the bank stock was being placed was accumulated in a  special frozen account in the TsBR. Since 15 February, this rule  does not effect the issue of bonds, since they are the direct  financial obligation of the bank. The instructions also took  into account the desires of bankers who complained that the  system for capitalizing the profits of the bank stockholders  which were not distributed as dividends was unclear. The  document contains a social section devoted to formal accounting  for the refinancing of some of the bank's profits.    The document contains certain restrictions related to the  procedure for forming the bank's capital stock during the first  placement of stock. A bank's founders used to be allowed to make  their payments in motor vehicles, equipment, and other material  assets. From now on, during the first issue of a bank's stock,  contributions to the capital stock are permitted only in rubles,  hard currency, or premises belonging to the founders with the  right of ownership.    In explaining the Bank of Russia's position regarding those  commercial banks which before 15 February submitted issue  prospectuses in the old form to the TsBR, Andrey Kozlov noted  that "draconian measures will not follow," but each case will be  examined separately. If the issue prospectus was already  examined by the securities division of the TsBR and then got  "bogged down," let us say, in the antimonopoly committee, the  TsBR will make an inquiry of the committee and most likely  declare the bank's prospectus compiled according to the old  norms valid.    In the next issue of KOMMERSANT, we will begin  publication of the new document, which is important both to the  issuing bodies and to investors.</p>

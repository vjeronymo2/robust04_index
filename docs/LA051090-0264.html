			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOMAS O FIAICH; CARDINAL OF ALL IRELAND, CRITIC OF BRITISH RULE  </P> <P> Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, the primate of all Ireland and an outspoken critic of  the British government, has died during a pilgrimage to the French shrine of  Lourdes. He was 66.  </P> <P> O Fiaich, appointed head of both the church in the Republic of Ireland and  Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland in 1977, was taken 95 miles to Toulouse  by helicopter Tuesday after suffering an apparent heart attack, a hospital  spokesman said.  </P> <P> An announcement of the death, issued by the church's press office in Ireland,  said O Fiaich had appeared ill to doctors accompanying the group of 600  pilgrims from his seat at Armagh in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> Lourdes is a Catholic shrine where in 1858 a peasant girl reported a vision of  the Virgin Mary. Miraculous cures have been reported there.  </P> <P> While calling for a unified Ireland and criticizing British policy in Northern  Ireland, O Fiaich, (pronounced O'Fee), also castigated the violence of the  Irish Republican Army.  </P> <P> The predominantly Catholic outlawed guerrilla army seeks to end British rule in  Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish Republic.  </P> <P> "You can't unite people with bombs and bullets," the cardinal once said.  </P> <P> Two years after he was appointed spiritual leader of Ireland's 4 million  Catholics, Pope John Paul II made O Fiaich one of the first cardinals of his  papacy.  </P> <P> O Fiaich was born Thomas Fee in Cullyhanna, in south Armagh, within sight of  the border with the Irish Republic. He changed his name to the Gaelic form as  his love of the Irish language and nationalist sentiments developed.  </P> <P> He was ordained in 1948. During a 25-year academic career, he taught modern  history at St. Patrick's College in Maynooth, west of Dublin, and served as its  president from 1974 to 1977.  </P> <P> O Fiaich supported political and church appeals on behalf of Irish prisoners in  British jails and called for a review of the case of six Irishmen convicted of  killing 21 people in 1974 in IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Britain.  </P> <P> He also blasted Britain in 1988 over its decision not to prosecute a soldier  who shot dead an unarmed man at an observation post on the Irish border.  </P> <P> But O Fiaich was also quick to condemn IRA violence, making an emotional plea  to Protestants for forgiveness after an IRA bomb killed 11 people attending a  war memorial service in the town of Enniskillen in 1987.  </P></p>

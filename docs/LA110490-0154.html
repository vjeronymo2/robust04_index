			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EL CAMINO FLATTENS MT. SAC, 40-21  </P> <P> The El Camino College football team kept alive its hopes for a bowl bid by  defeating Mt. San Antonio College, 40-21, in a Mission Conference Northern  Division game at Walnut Saturday night.  </P> <P> El Camino is 7-2 overall and 5-2 in league play. Mt. SAC fell to 4-5 and 2-5.  </P> <P> The Warriors' Anthony Daigle rushed for 126 yards on 24 carries and scored  three touchdowns, one of them on a 12-yard pass from quarterback Rod Harvey.  </P> <P> Harvey completed 12 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown. He also fumbled twice  and was intercepted once, but that didn't stop the Warriors' scoring machine.  </P> <P> El Camino, which usually gets off to slow starts, scored three touchdowns in  the first half. The Warriors drove 53 yards in four plays for the first  touchdown. Harvey's pass to Daigle gave El Camino a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> Mt. SAC answered with a 72-yard drive that was capped by Marshawn Thompson's  two-yard touchdown run. The score was set up by Mike Galindo's 48-yard run.  </P> <P> El Camino regained the lead on its next possession. The Warriors drove 53 yards  in 10 plays, with Daigle scoring from a yard out.  </P> <P> Warrior defensive back Donovan Gallatin, who missed two games this season with  a concussion, scored El Camino's third touchdown of the half. The freshman  intercepted a Bill Gallis' pass and returned it 34 yards for the touchdown and  a 21-7 El Camino lead.  </P> <P> Mt. SAC scored with 4:21 left in the second quarter after guard Spencer Keala  recovered a Harvey fumble. Fred Coffee scored on a four-yard run to cut El  Camino's lead to 21-14.  </P> <P> Louis Perez kicked a 41-yard field goal with 7:08 left in the third quarter to  give the Warriors a 24-14 edge.  </P> <P> El Camino marched 75 yards on 12 plays for its next touchdown. Daigle jumped  over the Mt. SAC line for the touchdown from a yard out.  </P> <P> The Mounties answered with a four-yard touchdown pass from Anthony Calvillo to  Coffee with 6:52 left in the game. The play was set up by Calvillo's 45-yard  pass to Demetrius Baptiste.  </P> <P> Perez hit a 33-yard field goal with 3:28 remaining to increase El Camino's lead  to 34-21.  </P> <P> The Warriors' last touchdown was set up by Shannon Thompson's 60-yard punt  return. Tony DaCosta scored three plays later on a two-yard run with 38 seconds  left to play.  </P> <P> Bakersfield 21, L.A. Southwest 0 -- Southwest could have used a little offense  against the nation's No. 1 team, but couldn't generate much of an attack  against the visiting Renegades.  </P> <P> Southwest did manage to hold Bakersfield 23 points under its scoring average.  </P> <P> "You don't practice defense all year to have people to score against you,"  Southwest Coach Henry Washington said. "You've got to go in with the idea to  shut the other team out."  </P> <P> Southwest's defense failed in only one area -- the Cougars gave up big plays at  crucial times.  </P> <P> Bakersfield (8-0 overall, 7-0 in the Western State Conference) set up its first  touchdown on a 33-yard run by halfback Nathan Dupree, and capped the drive on a  20-yard first-quarter touchdown pass from Bryan Nixon to flanker Lance Patton.  </P> <P> Southwest (3-5, 2-5) got burned again by the big play later in the quarter.  Nixon passed 56 yards to Patton, which led to Shon Ellerbe's one-yard scoring  run.  </P> <P> The final Bakersfield touchdown came on a 25-yard pass over the middle to David  Dunn, with Nixon throwing only seconds before he was flattened by Southwest  linebacker Mark Fields.  </P> <P> "I thought we could have won if we could slow down some of that big-play  madness," Washington said.  </P> <P> Bakersfield held Southwest to only 110 total yards. Southwest quarterback Craig  Manigo was flushed from the pocket often and completed only 13 of 31 passes for  93 yards and was intercepted twice. Southwest's running game was also bottled  up, held to 37 yards.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  -- STUART MATTHEWS  </P> <P> Glendale 27, Harbor 0 -- Bobby Webster rushed for three touchdowns and Glendale  (6-2) held Harbor (4-4) to only 112 yards of offense.  </P></p>

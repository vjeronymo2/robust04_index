			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani participated in a TV  satellite interview with participants of the Swiss-based  International Crans Montana Forum at 1630 GMT Thursday.    In the direct satellite link, held at the request of forum  participants and broadcast simultaneously to 35 countries and  translated into five languages: English, French, Spanish, German  and Italian, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani spoke about economics,  politics, Iranian foreign relations, and other general issues of  interest.    He referred to Iranian policy regarding its neighbors as a  peaceful and friendly policy. With respect to events in  northern Iraq, responding to a question by former French Foreign  Minister Dumas, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: we respect Iraq's  territorial integrity and see the Kurds living in Turkey and  Iraq as members of these countries whose interests should be  noted.    Advising Russia not to interfere in the newly independent  Central Asian countries, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: Unfortunately,  differences have arisen in these countries. Our policy is to  solve these differences.    Referring to the tragic state of affairs in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and emphasizing that the present condition  must change, the president said: The hands of the majority of  the people of this country have been tied but a minority allowed  to commit aggression.    Addressing the participants, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: If you  and others feel unable to end the war in Bosnia you should allow  the innocent Muslims to have defense capabilities.    The president added: Iran is prepared to dispatch its peace  keeping forces to Bosnia within the context of the United  Nations.    In another part of the interview, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said  the  expansion of Franco-Iranian depends on policies of Paris. He  added: If our friends in France try to free themselves from the  effects of fabricated propaganda bilateral relations will expand  easily.    Commenting on events in Algeria, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred  to the victory of Muslims in the elections and said: The vote of  the majority was not respected. We are surprised that the  supporters and champions of human rights fail to take note.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized: The Islamic Republic of Iran  has been blamed regarding events in Algeria only because it has  spoken its views without hindrance.</p>

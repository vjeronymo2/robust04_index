			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASES MAY CHART FUTURE OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION  </P> <P> The legal effort to dismantle segregated schools began in this Kansas capital  nearly four decades ago. In the next year, it may end here.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court used a lawsuit begun by a group of Topeka's black parents in  1951 to issue its most sweeping ruling of the 20th Century. Official  segregation violates the Constitution, the court declared in 1954 in Brown vs.  Board of Education.  </P> <P> The ruling reverberated through the courts and through American society.  Because of it, racial exclusion policies in schools and colleges, on buses and  railroads, in housing and workplaces and in restaurants and hotels were swept  aside.  </P> <P> In follow-up cases, the high court said that not only must blatant segregation  end, but that school officials had "an affirmative duty" to eliminate the  "vestiges" of the old system.  </P> <P> Now, the Supreme Court and school desegregation are at a crossroads. With  official segregation long past, many school officials say, it is time to get  the courts out of the business of running schools. In three cases on the court  docket this term, school boards are urging the justices to do just that. One of  them is the Topeka case (Board of Education vs. Brown, 89-1681).  </P> <P> Today, of course, Topeka has no all-white or all-black schools. Still, more  than half of the city's black students are concentrated in four of its 26  elementary schools. Linda Brown Buckner, the original plaintiff in the Brown  lawsuit, has a grandson in a school where more than 70% of the children are  black or Latino.  </P> <P> Last year, a federal appeals court said that the Topeka school board had  practiced "a form of benign neglect" toward its minority students. It ruled  that the school district must do more to desegregate its classrooms. In April,  the school board appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "We think we've satisfied our constitutional obligation," said K. Gary  Sebelius, the school district attorney.  </P> <P> The case comes before an increasingly conservative Supreme Court led by Chief  Justice William H. Rehnquist, long a bitter foe of school desegregation. As a  parent in Phoenix in 1967, Rehnquist strongly opposed a voluntary integration  plan that was being considered by local schools.  </P> <P> "We are no more dedicated to an 'integrated' society than we are to a  'segregated' society," he said in a letter to the Arizona Republic.  </P> <P> As a Justice Department official in the Richard M. Nixon Administration,  Rehnquist drafted a constitutional amendment to forbid courts from ordering  busing for desegregation. And as a Supreme Court justice since 1972, he has  dissented every time a desegregation plan has been upheld.  </P> <P> Sitting next to Rehnquist on the bench is Justice Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP  Legal Defense Fund lawyer who represented the winning side before the Supreme  Court in the original Brown ruling. While Rehnquist thinks that desegregation  should be called off, Marshall believes that the courts should push for greater  integration and true equality between schools.  </P> <P> But at age 82, Marshall -- the last of the court's old-fashioned liberals --  has few allies left.  </P> <P> If Rehnquist can get the votes of his four fellow conservatives -- which  appears likely -- the high court can be expected to issue a decision early next  year that could free hundreds of school districts from judicial control.  </P> <P> The Justice Department says that it has a role in nearly 500 still-pending  court decrees involving school systems, most of them in the South and in border  states. Civil rights attorneys say that they believe another 200 to 300 school  districts still operate under federal court decrees.  </P> <P> In the last decade, school desegregation has faded as a national controversy,  although busing and "magnet school" plans have continued quietly in many areas.  The court decrees stayed in effect in part because the Supreme Court never said  whether they could end.  </P> <P> Last year, an appeals court in Denver ruled that the Oklahoma City school board  may not end its desegregation plan. In that case, the school board said that it  should be allowed to halt court-ordered busing and return to "neighborhood  schools." Civil rights attorneys argued that such a plan would "re-segregate"  the schools because blacks are concentrated in one section of the city.  </P> <P> The same appeals court also ruled that the Topeka desegregation order should be  kept in effect.  </P> <P> In October, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the appeal of the Oklahoma  City case. When the justices rule in that case (Board of Education vs. Dowell,  89-1080), the decision also will govern the Topeka case and a third pending  appeal from DeKalb County, Ga. In all three cases the basic issues are the  same.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration entered the Oklahoma City case on behalf of the school  boards. A brief clash between Justice Marshall and U.S. Solicitor Gen. Kenneth  W. Starr highlighted the hearing. Starr, the Administration's top courtroom  attorney, said that school boards should be freed from court control if they  have fully complied with a busing order for several years.  </P> <P> Marshall objected. By "dismantling" the busing plan, "poor Afro-American kids"  will be back in the same schools where they were before the court order, he  said.  </P> <P> "Does it still stay a Negro school?" Marshall asked.  </P> <P> "Not by virtue of state action," Starr replied.  </P> <P> "But does it still remain a segregated school?" the justice asked again.  </P> <P> "By virtue of residential segregation, it does," Starr conceded.  </P> <P> "Then it's still a segregated school and you don't think segregation is  unconstitutional," Marshall charged.  </P> <P> "With all due respect, Justice Marshall, that is emphatically not our  position," Starr countered.  </P> <P> Starr and the school board attorneys argued that a concentration of black  students that results from housing patterns is not the fault of the schools and  need not be cured by school officials.  </P> <P> Marshall and the civil rights attorneys countered that "residential  segregation" is a "vestige" of the old system and, therefore, must be remedied  by school officials.  </P> <P> An examination of the Topeka school system shows both how things have changed  and how they have stayed the same.  </P> <P> In 1951, Oliver Brown was a lay minister and a welder for what was then known  as the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad. He and his family lived just  four blocks from Sumner School, a grand 1930s-era building with carved wood  paneling and Art Deco styling. But it was reserved for white children.  </P> <P> Brown's 10-year-old daughter Linda had to walk five blocks to a main street,  then take a bus 20 blocks to the aging Monroe School, which was attended only  by black students.  </P> <P> At that time, 17 states, most of them in the South, required that black and  white children be educated separately. Four others, including Kansas, permitted  segregation by school boards.  </P> <P> The Topeka lawsuit was one of five school cases before the Supreme Court in  1953 when California Gov. Earl Warren was named chief justice. On May 17, 1954,  Warren spoke for the court when it unanimously ruled that separate schools for  black children are "inherently unequal."  </P> <P> The decision was based on the 14th Amendment, which was enacted just after the  Civil War to stop discrimination against blacks. It specifically prohibited  states from denying any person "the equal protection of the laws."  </P> <P> In the late 19th Century, however, the Supreme Court had nearly wiped this  amendment from the books. It repeatedly upheld state laws that excluded blacks  from schools, colleges, trains and boats so long as "separate but equal"  accommodations were provided.  </P> <P> The Brown decision reversed that doctrine. In response, the Topeka school board  closed its four aging all-black schools and reassigned the pupils to  neighborhood schools. Oliver Brown's younger daughter, Cheryl, attended the  Sumner School which had excluded Linda. The junior high and high schools  already were integrated.  </P> <P> But the court decision did not change housing patterns. Less than one-fourth of  Topeka's 122,000 residents are black, but they are concentrated on the east  side of town.  </P> <P> Richard Jones, a local civil rights attorney, revived the Brown case in 1979  because black children still were concentrated in a handful of schools.  </P> <P> "Nothing much had changed," Jones said. "They have not eliminated the vestiges  of segregation."  </P> <P> Certainly, Topeka today has no "segregated" schools in the old-fashioned sense  but neither are they fully integrated.  </P> <P> For example, the northeast section of the city is an area of tiny white-frame  homes that includes two subsidized housing projects. It is served by the  Belvoir School, a cramped, one-story brick facility. Approximately 72% of its  students are black or Latino, including Linda Brown Buckner's grandson. The  school's test scores are among the city's lowest.  </P> <P> The Whitson School is a 15-minute drive away on the other side of the city. It  is in a neighborhood of solid brick homes and broad lawns. An immaculate,  two-story school, Whitson has a top academic reputation. Fewer than 5% of its  pupils are black.  </P> <P> What happens next depends on the Supreme Court. If the justices turn down the  school board's appeal, the district will be obliged to come up with a remedy  for the racial imbalance between schools such as Belvoir and Whitson.  </P> <P> If, however, Rehnquist's historic view prevails in the pending Oklahoma City  case, the court would issue a brief order granting the Topeka school board's  appeal and ordering that court control of the schools be ended.  </P> <P> Regardless of the outcome, no one in Topeka, black or white, seems enthused  about cross-town busing as a remedy.  </P> <P> "We have not discussed mandatory busing," said school Supt. Gary Livingston.  "The debate should be about quality and equality of education, not just the  dispersement of students." He added that the Topeka district "has consciously  done more in resources and in support for the high-minority schools."  </P> <P> Livingston said that the school system has used its federal funds to reduce  class sizes in its predominantly black schools.  </P> <P> Linda Brown Buckner, now a Head Start teacher, does not favor busing either. "I  have a stigma about it because of what I went through. But I'd like to see them  try magnet schools," she said.  </P> <P> Others who have supported the continuing lawsuit say that it has succeeded in  pushing the school district to hire more minority principals and to upgrade the  curriculum in black schools. For example, Dale Cushinberry, the new principal  at largely white Whitson, began his education in one of the all-black  elementary schools before the Brown decision.  </P> <P> "We're trying to keep the issue of school desegregation alive because we care  about education," said Cheryl Brown Henderson, now an official in the Kansas  State Department of Education. "It's not just a question of who sits next to  you at school. We want educational equality."  </P></p>

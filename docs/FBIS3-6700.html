			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kanazawa, March 19 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe proposed Saturday [19 March] that Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa clear himself of allegations in a money  scandal or dissolve the House of Representatives to hold general  elections. "(The prime minister) should clear up the  allegations and at the same time he should seek cooperation from  the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on policies,"  Watanabe said.    If Hosokawa does not want to do so, he should dissolve the  lower house and call for general elections, Watanabe added.    Watanabe, who was both deputy premier and foreign minister  under the cabinet of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa from  1991 to 1993, made the comments in Kanazawa while stumping for  an LDP candidate in the Ishikawa gubernatorial race.    The lower house budget committee has been unable to begin  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program for more than a  week because of the controversy over Hosokawa's receipt of 100  million yen from now-defunct Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a  scandal-ridden parcel delivery trucking company and part of the  Sagawa Kyubin group. The LDP has refused to agree to budget  debate unless Hosokawa produces additional documents concerning  the scandal.    Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the money from Tokyo  Sagawa  Kyubin in 1982 to repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and to  buy a condominium in Tokyo. He said he fully repaid the money  by January 31, 1991, using part of his retirement allowance as  Kumamoto governor.    Hosokawa served two four-year terms as governor from 1983  until February 1991. The LDP and other critics suspect that  Hosokawa received the 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin  to help finance his gubernatorial election campaign.</p>

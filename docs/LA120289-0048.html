			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER TITLE GAME FOR CORONA DEL MAR AFTER 27-0 SURPRISE  </P> <P> For all those Corona del Mar High School football fans who dozed off during  their team's daze six or so weeks ago, wake up.  </P> <P>  With its 27-0 upset over Sunny Hills Friday night in a Division VI semifinal  game at Buena Park High School, Corona del Mar proved it is now a tremendous  team with a more-than-possible dream.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (10-3), a wild-card team that finished fourth in the Sea View  League, is going to the final for its second straight year. The Sea Kings, the  defending Division VI champion, will play La Quinta, a 20-7 winner over La  Mirada Friday.  </P> <P> Against Sunny Hills, the Sea Kings swept away all doubts, proving that the  inconsistent play that plagued them in the early season is far behind them. No  player symbolized that more than senior wide receiver/defensive back Weston  Johnson, who scored three touchdowns to lead Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> "I don't know what to say," Johnson said.  </P> <P> He needn't say more.  </P> <P> On Corona del Mar's first play from scrimmage, Johnson caught a perfect pass  from quarterback Todd Kehrli for a 66-yard touchdown play. That play seemed to  have a numbing effect on Sunny Hills, the playoffs' top-seeded -- and  previously undefeated -- team.  </P> <P> Johnson scored again in the second quarter on a botched field goal attempt. As  Jerrott Willard stood ready for a 31-yard try, Johnson, the holder, waited for  Mike Kelly's snap. But the ball was snapped short, so Johnson picked it up,  scrambled around the Sunny Hills defenders and dove into the end zone for a  13-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> On Corona del Mar's next possession, Brian Lucas, who rushed for 103 yards on  17 carries, scored on a six-yard run to give the Sea Kings a 20-0 halftime  lead.  </P> <P> Throughout the first half, the Lancers (12-1) could not sustain a drive; they  did not pick up a first down, nor did they cross midfield. Their well-known  trio of running backs -- Brian Pizula, Mike Sullivan and Ken Overby -- were  stopped from making big plays. Combined, they gained only 57 yards in the first  half, and Pizula was stopped altogether.  </P> <P> Pizula, who entered the game with 1,461 yards, had to leave the game with a  separated shoulder midway through the second quarter.  </P> <P> "Yeah, that hurt," Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said. "But Corona del Mar  played very well. We gave up the early score and our offense was not operating  well. Hell, they just played great football tonight."  </P> <P> In the second half, Johnson capped his best game of the season with a 20-yard  touchdown reception from Kehrli, who completed seven of 14 passes for 162 yards  and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar dominated Sunny Hills in every aspect. Its defense, anchored by  Willard, held the Lancers to 120 yards of total offense.  </P> <P> Asked if he was surprised by the final score, Sea King Coach Dave Holland said:  "Yeah, I'm very much surprised. Are you kidding? Aren't you?"  </P></p>

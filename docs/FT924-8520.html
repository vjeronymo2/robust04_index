			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 4: Focus on draft legislation - Taxation DRAFT LEGISLATION and newly-emerging corporate practices have increased the demand for advice on the tax implications on treasury management to unprecedented levels in the past few years. Emma Lubbock, lead partner in the capital markets group of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, says there has been tremendous recent change. 'It is a very exciting and rather uncertain time at the moment,' she says. 'Lots of companies are focusing on the area now.' In the UK, attention is particularly concentrated on two proposed changes to the law concerning treasury management activities being prepared by the Inland Revenue: The taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses; and The taxation of financial instruments. In addition, there are a number of draft EC directives which have implications for corporate treasurers, including the parent-subsidiary directive concerning the payment of interest between groups of companies. More widely, there are emerging trends in the location and structure of corporate treasury departments in response to variations in tax incentives across national borders. Ms Lubbock gives prime attention to the Revenue's planned changes to the taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses. 'It is one of the most significant changes in recent years,' she says. Over the years, tax legislation has fallen behind developments in financial and risk management techniques. The Revenue launched an extensive consultation exercise to rectify some of the contradictions on foreign exchange instruments which ended in January last year. A number of significant changes were introduced as a result, and now practitioners are waiting for the draft legislation with full details, which is timetabled to be included in next spring's finance bill. It could thus come into force during 1993. In essence, the legislation would subject to corporation tax gains and losses on foreign exchange differences incurred on capital borrowings overseas. At present, any realised gains can be taxed but losses cannot be offset against them. 'There has been a huge black hole created by the anomalies,' says Ms Lubbock. 'Foreign investors just think the UK system is daft. It is so illogical.' The case settled in 1989 against Woolworth, the high street retailer, raised just one instance of the problems with the present position. The company borrowed SFr50m (Dollars 36m) in two loans in 1971 and 1972 to be repaid after five years. Exchange transactions gave rise to a loss of Pounds 11.4m, which the company claimed as a deduction in computing its profits. The courts found in favour of the Inland Revenue, which argued that the losses were on capital account  -even though the loan was to generate short-term cash to stock the retailer's shelves before Christmas - and hence not allowable. Ms Lubbock argues that the mooted changes 'will not be universally welcomed'. Not only will new difficulties emerge from the legislation, but many companies have structured their operations in the light of existing rules. 'In 200 years' time, the changes may be for the better,' she says. In the rather shorter term until the full details of the new law are released, Price Waterhouse is advising its clients to avoid committing themselves to long-term structures which are likely to be affected. The second crucial legislative change concerns financial instruments for hedging interest rate risks, which do not at present qualify for tax relief. The proposals will tax payments and receipts of these instruments as income. The proposed changes are taking longer to emerge than was originally expected, and draft legislation appears to have been pushed beyond Christmas, so that it may not appear in the Finance Bill until 1994. Meanwhile, in the European Community, Ms Lubbock says legal changes are likely to be somewhat slower. While rapid progress is being made on the harmonisation of value-added tax, reform of direct taxes - including those on corporations - is moving at a far slower pace. Some fundamental change in location and practice is also taking place against the backdrop of tax restrictions. 'People are thinking about European regional structures and management across borders,' says Ms Lubbock. She stresses moves towards the centralisation of treasury functions, the enhancement of treasury as a separate specialist function, and the emergence of offshore operations. Historically, treasury management was left to the finance director, who often delegated the job to local subsidiaries in different countries, each using its own banks with little co-ordination. Now, she argues, the development of better systems, the emergence of more sophisticated treasurers and the need to achieve cost-savings, is making its mark. 'If you ignore the tax problems, they may wipe you out,' she says. Tax incentives for headquarters' operations including treasury management have led a number of companies to establish offices in Belgium and the Dublin docks. Other popular locations include Luxembourg, which recently introduced a new holding company tax regime, and the Netherlands, where legislation is amenable to long-term financing operations. She is more sceptical of the use of true offshore tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands. While there may be no tax levied in the location, payments made into the location are likely to be taxed at source. The only exception is when there are double taxation treaties - which is rarely the case for these locations. Ms Lubbock says there may need to be different structures to reflect the tax implications of the different roles of treasury departments: day-to-day management on one hand, and long-term financing needs on the other. But she also recognises the importance of pragmatism. 'Tax planning is great, but you've got to do something that is acceptable to the people and the culture of the firm,' she says. 'It has to make commercial sense.'</p>

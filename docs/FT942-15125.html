			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Shares in Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising and sales promotions group, have been performing more strongly since the start of 1994. Three directors, including the chairman and chief executive, sold a total of 477,000 shares between the end of March and the first week of April at prices between 650-674p. Each retains a sizeable quantity of stock. Bolton Group, capitalised at just over Pounds 3m, is one of the smaller players in the property sector. At present, it is a shell but its status apparently is about to change as the old guard gives way to new blood. Chairman Ivor Golethka, is resigning and his sale of 1.5m shares is a part of this process. Isotron, involved in gamma radiation processing, announced results at the end of February; these showed a modest improvement on the same period last year. The transaction carried out by five members of the board breaks down into three straightforward sales and two instances of directors exercising options and selling 100 per cent of their ordinary shares.  ---------------------------------------------------------------        DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN               COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                                                      No of Company                  Sector    Shares    Value   directors  --------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  --------------------------------------------------------------- Abbott Mead              Mdia     477,000     3215      3 Amstrad                  E&amp;EE      60,000       20      1 Bolton Group             Prop   1,515,150      500      2 Cadbury Schweppes        FdMa      11,000       51      1 Channel Holdings         E&amp;EE      43,000       26      1 Clinton Cards            RetG     200,000      320      2 Croda International      Chem      23,571       85      1 Eastern Electricity      Elec     121,107      810      1* Embassy Property         Prop   2,360,000       30      1 English China Clays      ExIn      84,677      413      1* Forminster               Text      50,000      350      1 Goode Durrant            Tran      90,000      153      1* Headlam Group            Dist      25,000       57      1 Hepworth                 BM&amp;M      50,000      193      1 Indepndnt Newspapers     Mdia      40,000      206      1 Isotron                  Hlth      76,000      230      5* Jeyes Group              HseG      38,581      137      4* Johnson Matthey          Eng        8,305       50      1* Kewill Systems           SSer      12,000       29      1 London Electricity       Elec       4,000       24      1 Low &amp; Bonar              PP&amp;P      10,508       43      1* Macro 4                  SSer      44,350      286      2* Marshalls                BM&amp;M      30,000       38      1* Morrison (Wm)            RetF      19,250       23      1 Pressac Holdings         E&amp;EE      15,882       15      1* Schroders                MBnk      22,580      261      2* Scottish&amp;Newcastle       Brew      30,000      157      1 Smith, (WH)              RetG      72,689      389      1* Spirax Sarco             Eng        5,000       20      1 The Telegraph            Mdia      15,000       90      1 Thorpe, (FW)             E&amp;EE      19,000       36      2 TT Group                 DivI      50,000      183      1 Volex Group              E&amp;EE       5,000       23      1 Wagon Industrial         Eng        5,000       25      1 Westland Group           Eng      339,202     1123      2* Wetherspoon (JD)         Brew      14,300       49      1  --------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  --------------------------------------------------------------- Aberforth Small Co       InvT      30,000       44      1 Antofagasta Hldgs        DivI       7,250       98      1 Ass.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Celso Pinto: "Lula Sparks Fears of `Nasserism'"] </F>   [Text] Senior military officials are concerned about a  possible victory of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers Party  [PT] presidential candidate, for various reasons. One of the  most serious reasons -- although not openly discussed -- is the  fear that a "Nasserist" type movement may emerge.    This was one of the topics addressed by a senior officer  close to high-placed government officials during a recent  meeting he held with more than 10 leading businessmen. The  conversation was open, and the tone was pessimistic and full of  warnings about the future. He conveyed a clear message: The best  option for businessmen is to finance the candidates who could  defeat Lula at the ballot boxes.    A crucial point of the officer's analysis is that, in the  implementation of its program, the PT could lead Brazil to an  institutional impasse. He noted that even moderate PT sectors  have criticized the fact that Lula's government program has not  taken into account the role of Congress in outlining its  projects, despite the fact that the PT program envisages major  changes "that will bring about confrontations within society,"  the officer said.    It is believed the PT will fall well short of a majority  bloc  in Congress. In practice it will have to deal with a  conservative Congress "and there will be an institutional  impasse." There is nothing new in the officer's prediction. He  said that something similar occurred in 1963 and 1964, when then  President Joao Goulart sought to impose his "basic reforms" on a  conservative congress.    When the impasse occurs, he says, Brazil will either plunge  into "lawlessness" through an anarchic process or enter "an  arbitration process" through "the action of mediators." The new  ingredient is right here. The "mediators," quoting the officer,  would be the military, although without fulfilling the role they  had in 1964. The "destructuring of the Army" could provoke an  intervention that may not be led by senior officers linked with  a conservative project, but by middle-level officers, in a  "Nasserist" type process.    The officer thus alluded to the process through which then  Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser and his "young Turks" took power in  Egypt in 1956. That is, a type of armed intervention advocating  nationalism and a planned economy. Although the officer did not  say so, it appears he was hinting that this type intervention  could be done in coordination with the PT or with leftist  sectors.    The officer acknowledges that Lula is more tilted toward  moderate PT groups and that, if moderate sectors prevail in the  government, there will be no impasse. The problem, he said, is  that there is no way of guaranteeing that the radicals will be  kept on the sidelines.    He described the PT program as "intimidating." For instance,  the PT wants to implement an agrarian reform through  expropriation of land in an area equivalent to three times the  size of Alagoas State at a cost of $20 billion. Reforms are  necessary, he said, but in a "gradual, cautious" process.    Furthermore, the officer believes, irrespective of who is  elected president, Brazil faces severe structural problems that  the constitutional revision process could have solved. Without  these changes, he said, it will be much more difficult for any  president to rule the country.    There will be a type of "legal anarchy" provoked by the  autonomy enjoyed by lower echelons, by the strangling of the  federal budget through tied and poorly used allocations, by the  "inverted stability" of public employees whereby job security is  granted to uneducated employees who could be hired on the market  and not to administrative officials of state-owned and  self-financed companies -- who are massively replaced with each  government or ministerial change -- and by the possibility of  public servants calling a strike, which is not prohibited by the  Federal Supreme Court.    As can be predicted, the businessmen fully endorsed the  officer's analysis. The doubt, one businessman said, is that it  remains to be seen who is the best anti-Lula candidate, either  Fernando Henrique Cardoso or Orestes Quercia, a subject which  was not discussed.    What this type of meeting reveals, irrespective of whether  the analysis of the officer is correct or not, is that Lula has  to go some to bridge the gap that separates him from more  conservative, and strong, business sectors and overcome the  distrust he still provokes among military leaders.</p>

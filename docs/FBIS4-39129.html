			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Today, experts  from the European Union's [EU] Technical Aid Program to CIS  Countries (TACIS) held a news conference on assistance to  Ukraine in agricultural production and food distribution.    Under the TACIS program, a total of 150 million ECU  [European  currency unit] has been provided for Ukraine since 1991. It was  agriculture, however, that Luis Moreno, EU ambassador to  Ukraine, described as a priority aspect of the program that  mostly deals with consultative and technical assistance. Around  100 million ECU worth of food will be given to Ukraine. Luis  Moreno expressed the hope that the volume of agricultural  production in Ukraine will, in 10 years, be the second largest  in Europe.    EU experts Stuart Lisor and Patrik Pyusemye spoke about the  implementation in various areas of Ukraine of aid programs to  modernize the infrastructure of baby food manufacture and  production of meat, milk, vegetables, fruit, animal feed, the  improvement of wholesale and retail food distribution, and the  privatization of food stores.</p>

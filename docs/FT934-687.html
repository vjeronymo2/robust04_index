			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Observer: Sexing the cherry Eat your heart out Dominic Lawson. The editor of the Spectator, the bumptious English weekly that claims a circulation of around 48,000 copies, could be forgiven for going green about the gills. Its near name-sake, the American Spectator, is enjoying much greater influence. A far right Washington-based monthly, it was started by editor Bob Tyrrell in 1967 as The Alternative, an off-campus rag out of Indiana University. But it has no connection with the English paper, least of all in the circulation stakes, where the readership has exploded from 30,000 to 201,000 in the past 20 months. The secret seems to have been some sizzling investigative pieces - on Anita Hill, David Koresh, the Clintons' tax returns, and now, in the January issue, on the First Couple's sex life. The right-wing foundations that back the (still loss-making) outfit may be pleased, but aren't the lawyers getting nervous? Observer glanced at the masthead to discover that it avails itself of the no doubt more than able legal counsel of Solitary, Poor, Nasty, Brutish &amp; Short.</p>

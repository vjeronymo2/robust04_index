			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tokareva report under the "At the Federation </F> Council" rubric: "Prime Minister Suggests Patience and Hard  Work"]    [Text] The head of the Russian Government demonstrated a  serious approach to the most obvious problem in our general  economic crisis -- the comprehensive nonpayment of bills. He  specially delivered a cautious and well-considered report to  Federation Council senators on the government's measures to  combat this scourge.    But the government has no intention of reverting to the  purely administrative measures that we all still remember in  terms of mass monetary "amnesties." On the contrary,  Chernomyrdin promised to begin the procedure of enterprise  bankruptcies by introducing property liability for nonpayments.  The means of formalizing nonpayments has finally been  announced, namely the introduction of bills of exchange. The  Tveruniversalbank has already advertised its system for the  introduction of bills of exchange and won the premier's good  opinion for its initiative. The Tveruniversalbank intends to  solve the crisis of nonpayments by issuing its own bills of  exchange. The stock market will then be filled with new  securities -- "outstanding" bills of exchange issued by various  banks. In that case, a process of secondary privatization will  probably take place. In the summer privatization enters the  stage of finding the "real owner." After buying up outstanding  bills of exchange in the floated enterprises the new owners will  seek out investors.    Provided that everything goes according to the premier's  plan, we will enter a new stage of upheaval and discovery.  Commercial banks are to play a major role here.    The premier said that he does not believe the state to be  bankrupt and substantiated certain top-priority steps to  strengthen the revenue side of the budget. First, the state  monopoly on the production and sale of vodka will be revived in  the near future. Apparently despite his commitment to market  means of overcoming the crisis, the premier heeded the calls  from the recent conference of vodka manufacturers. They were  vociferous in their amazement that the state has opened the  doors to illegal imports of narcotics and forgotten that vodka  has always served true state values.    As for tough state measures, Chernomyrdin promised to  investigate the practice whereby enterprises and organizations  open about a dozen accounts and sit on budget money. One  enterprise should have one account, the premier said menacingly.    The government will settle its debts, he said. By the end of  March 4.6 trillion rubles [R] of the total arrears of R7.5  trillion will have been paid. The state will pay some of its  debts by exempting various enterprises and sectors from tax.    Interestingly, the premier's audience was not unanimous this  time either. Senators with strong ties to manufacturers in  their territories proposed alternative means of solving the  crisis. Tsvetkov, leader of the Association of Manufacturers,  criticized the premier's promise to tighten up tax policy. "You  say that you are going to tighten it up, but whom are you going  to tax when enterprises are standing idle?" Interdepartmental  offsetting of state enterprise debts was then proposed.  Incidentally, some economic experts think that is what will  ultimately happen.    Nikolay Gonchar said that the country obviously does not  have  enough of a free money supply. Japan and the United States have  far more money than Russia. He disagreed with the premier's  idea that the state is not bankrupt, unlike enterprises whose  output no one wants. "A state is not bankrupt when it can pay  its debts. Money should not be spent on wages. But used to  solve the crisis of nonpayment. What is needed is tight control  over where the money is going. But first there must be money."</p>

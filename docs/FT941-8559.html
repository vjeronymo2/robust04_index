			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (8): From high volume to to high value - Richard Evans on the need for new investment An ambitious strategy is under way to change Malta's image in order to attract a different type of investment to the island. Manufacturing has always been an important element in the Maltese economy and accounts for over a quarter of national income, but there is a growing need to change from traditional low cost, high volume products such as textiles to high value technology. The process has started and initial results are promising, but progress is inevitably slow. With a small population of 350,000 and virtually no raw materials, Malta has had problems competing with the expanding, low cost economies of south-east Asia and north Africa on the one hand, and the developed world on the other. Moreover, the Nationalist government of Dr Eddie Fenech Adami, which gained power in 1987 after 16 years of Labour rule, inherited an economy dominated by the state and a country regarded with suspicion in the west because of its close political and commercial contacts with Libya, the Soviet Union, China and North Korea. The first priority was to improve the crumbling infrastructure. A big budget deficit over the past few years has enabled the government to overhaul the telecommunications network, build a smart new airport and a power station, and construct desalination plants to combat the chronic shortage of water in the summer. The programme has been largely completed and the next stage of the industrial strategy is now under way. The plan has two aspects: first, to attract higher skill industries such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, medical products and information technology to take the place of traditional employers including textiles, furniture and footwear, and second, to help the more traditional industries face up to an increasingly competitive future, particularly if Malta succeeds in its aim of joining the European Union. There is already a competitive package of incentives in place involving a 10-year corporate tax holiday for export oriented companies, no municipal or capital gains taxes, 3 per cent soft loan finance, ready-built factories at subsidised rents and generous training grants. The strategy has already had some success, as more than 200 foreign-owned companies now operate in Malta, including a big investment by SGS-Thomson in a Franco-Italian joint microelectronics venture employing 1,300, Seleco, the Italian television manufacturers, Dowty, a subsidiary of the TI Group, De La Rue, the security printers, and Baxter, the US medical equipment company. But more foreign investment and know-how are needed to develop technical and management skills in the island's workforce, which is becoming highly trained with the expansion of university and other courses. A big advantage is that Maltese wage costs are about a third of those in the UK and even less compared with Germany and the US. The task of marketing the island is the responsibility of the Malta Development Corporation under its chairman, Professor Joe Bannister. He has developed a network of representatives and consultants in key markets in Europe and the US, whose job is to target potential investors and vet them at an early stage so that scarce resources can be concentrated. The current strategy is based on the gradual enhancement of the existing technical skills base, encouraging the need for higher technology, increased added value and high quality manufactured products. An important development which is beginning to show signs of success after a slow start is Mosta Technopark, a recently built complex a few miles from Valletta. Four companies are already operating there, including International Business Intelligence, a UK software company. A further 10 projects have been approved, and all 21 units are expected to be filled by the end of the year. Prof Bannister admits that the task of changing the country's industrial structure has not been easy. 'It is a matter of changing attitudes and there is a gap in the island's culture. People still expect companies to bring machines in so that products can be manufactured immediately. But high tech is not like that . . . it is inevitably a slow process but we are succeeding.' The new industries are particularly important to Malta as virtually all raw materials for conventional manufacturing industries have to be imported with the consequent drain on the balance of payments. In the case of information technology and similar processes, the added value is a big bonus. A scheme to build a fully fledged science park near the 400-year-old university had to be shelved because of the recession in Europe, but plans are now being dusted off to see if the project can go ahead. The other aspect of the MDC's work, helping traditional industries, is about to enter a new phase. Some industries are still protected by import levies which would have to go should Malta enter the European Union, and early action needs to be taken to avoid unemployment and cutbacks. A series of meetings on an industry-by-industry basis is to start next month with the food and beverage sector, followed by furniture manufacturing, to discuss plans to meet the problems posed by the lifting of trade barriers. All vulnerable sectors should have a strategy in place by the end of the year. Prof Bannister believes that stronger companies should be able to compete in European markets, and others might be able to restructure with the help of foreign partners or the introduction of new technology or new management. 'We are getting excellent co-operation from the Federation of Industry and from Metco, the export trade corporation,' he says. A further difficulty being tackled is the need for fresh sources of finance. Banks in Malta are still state-controlled, although there are plans to introduce a bigger private sector element. They are also conservative by nature and are not geared to provide seedcorn or venture capital. A new facility, the Malta Development Fund, was announced last month to pump money into small and medium-sized local companies to help them expand and to compete in Europe. It has been set up jointly by the MDC and Hambro European Ventures and is aiming for a fund of USDollars 10m. Half the money has been pledged by Mid-Med Bank of Malta and the rest is being sought locally. Mr Jeremy Hand, assistant director of Hambro European Ventures, said at the launch: 'We are confident we will be able to invest profitably in Maltese industry. The workforce is educated, efficient and relatively cheap which makes it an attractive area for manufacturing investment.'</p>

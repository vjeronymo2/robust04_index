			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEEP HEALTH INSURANCE INCREASES FOR INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS  </P> <P> I sympathize with John Meyer regarding Blue Cross increases. I am a single  person, age 61, and healthy (no claims in several years). My premium rates have  been raised over 30% in 1988 and another 43% starting in July. My premium is  now $675 per quarter, $1,000 deductible.  </P> <P> I would like to ask the state Board of Insurance why the individual rates have  increased and not the group rates -- is that discrimination or not? I was under  the impression that California wanted to reduce the number of uninsured; by the  latest premium raise the state will find thousands more to add to the 5 million  already uninsured.  </P> <P> Blue Cross spokeswoman Jeannette Hartman made a statement that the average  increase was approximately 17%. I would like to know how she arrived at those  figures. If I can have enormous increases, what kind of increases must people  have who made claims for significant or insignificant illnesses?  </P> <P> When will the ordinary hard-working people get fair treatment?  </P> <P> YVONNE P. HIGGINS  </P> <P> Sierra Madre  </P></p>

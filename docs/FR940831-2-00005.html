			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Issues are expected to revolve around: (1) Management of wildlife and fish habitat; (2) subsistence needs; (3) location, design and impacts of log transfer facilities; (4) recreation and visual impacts; and (5) the economic health of Southeast Alaska. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To proceed with the timber harvest as proposed, various permits must be obtained from other agencies. The agencies and their responsibilities are as follows: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the responsibility for approval of discharge of dredged or fill materials into the waters of the United States (Section 404 of the Clean Water Act), and approval of construction of structures or work in navigable waters of the United States (Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899); EPA has responsibility for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System review (Section 402 of the Clean Water Act). Other agencies which will participate are as follows: State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources has responsibility for authorization for occupancy and use of tidelands and submerged lands; State of Alaska, Department of Environmental Conservation has responsibility for the Solid Waste Disposal Permit (Section 402 of Clean Water Act) and the Certificate of Reasonable Assurance (Section 404 of Clean Water Act); U.S. Coast Guard has responsibility for Coast Guard Bridge Permits (in accordance with the General Bridge Act of 1946) required for all structures constructed within the tidal influence zone. Both the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will participate as cooperating agencies in preparation of the EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preparation of the EIS began with public notification and scoping in June, 1993. EIS preparation will continue with the following additional steps: (1) Public notification and scoping (approximately 45 days beginning on the date of publication of this Notice in the Federal Register); (2) identification of issues related to the proposed action (significant issues) and a discussion of reasons for not considering other issues (non-significant issues) in this analysis; (3) identification of issues to be analyzed in depth; (4) development of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action which meet the stated purpose and need for the proposed action and address significant issues; and (5) identification of the potential environmental effects of the alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For step 1, scoping announcements will be published in the Sitka Daily Sentinel newspaper on or about August 26 and September 14, 1994, and copies of the announcement will be mailed to interested persons. This announcement will describe the timing and location of the proposed project and will request comments. It will also contain specific information about the location and timing of public involvement meetings. Scoping meetings will be held in Sitka, Alaska on September 21 and October 6, 1994, in the Maksoutoff Room of the Centennial Building from 6:30 p.m. until 9:00 p.m., and Angoon, Alaska September 28 through 30, 1994. Exact locations and times of the Angoon scoping meetings will be announced in local newspapers and on radio station public service announcements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For steps 2 and 3, the Interdisciplinary Team will review comments received during both scoping periods to determine issues which are significant and within the scope of this project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 4 will consider a range of alternatives developed to address significant issues. One of these will be the ``No Action'' alternative, in which there is no harvest or road building activity. Other alternatives may consider various levels and locations of harvest and regeneration in response to issues and non-timber objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 5 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each alternative will be analyzed and documented. In addition, site specific mitigation measures for each alternative will be identified and their effectiveness evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to commenting on the proposed action and the Draft EIS when it is released, agencies and other interested persons or groups are invited to contact Forest Service officials at any time during the planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the EPA during the summer of 1995. The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon v. Hodel, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the Draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1503.3, in addressing these points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Final EIS and Record of Decision is expected to be released in the winter of 1995&hyph;96. The Forest Supervisor for the Chatham Area of the Tongass National Forest will, as the responsible official for the EIS, make a decision regarding this proposal considering the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and supporting reasons will be documented in the Record of Decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carl M.

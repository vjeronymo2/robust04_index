			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 28 February (XINHUA)--Zhu Yucheng,  deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA News  Agency, criticized the British Hong Kong Government for changing  the Airport Authority into an airport corporation, with an aim  to shifting the debts for the construction of the new airport to  the future special administration government.    When attending a soiree yesterday, Zhu Yucheng said: On the  new airport issue, the Chinese side has all along acted in  accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on the new  airport, but the British side has delayed for a long time before  advancing its fourth financial proposal. There is still a big  problem with the proposal, that is, who will actually bear the  debt amounting to 23 billion Hong Kong dollars or so? The  British Hong Kong Government intends to turn the Airport  Authority into a so-called "corporation," saying that the debts  will be shifted to the "corporation" in the future. However, the  behind-the-scenes backer of the "corporation" is the Hong Kong  Government. Like the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, the  corporation is fully funded by the Hong Kong Government.  Therefore, superficially, the new airport's debts are shifted to  the "corporation" but at the end, they will be borne by the  future special administrative region government and will be all  shifted to the compatriots in Hong Kong.    Zhu Yucheng pointed out: The objective of the Britons before  quitting Hong Kong is very clear. Economically, grabbing the  maximum benefits and politically, making arrangements for their  group [ban zi 3803 1311], in an attempt to compel the special  administrative region government to accept it and thus exercise  British rule without the Britons. He hoped that the Hong Kong  people would cast away illusions and no longer expect that a  colonialist official could leave anything good for them.  British officials can only grab the maximum benefits for the  British side.</p>

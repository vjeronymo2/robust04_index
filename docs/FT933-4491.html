			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (6): Swedish model catches eye of radiopage operators - Andrew Adonis reports on a contrast in trends IN SINGAPORE and Hong Kong, pagers are as much fashion accessories as means of communication. You see them, brightly coloured, hanging from the hips of teenagers 'about town' - some of them not even connected to a network. Twelve to 20-year-olds are a target market for paging operators in cities in the Asia-Pacific region, appealing to youth on trendiness and their parents as a means of locating and retrieving their offspring. According to CIT Research, the London communications consultancy, Singapore has around 500,000 paging subscribers, Hong Kong 700,000, Taiwan 1.2m, South Korea 1.5m and Japan 6.5m. The contrast with the UK, where paging is seen as a poor, black-coated relation of the glamorous mobile telephone, could not be more stark. The radio pager may have got there first, providing personal communications for hospitals, police forces, fire brigades and the like decades before the first carphone, but that upstart has swept all before it in profile and profits. Industry sources give a UK paging population of about 744,000, projected to grow at between 5 and 10 per cent a year for the next decade. However, CIT thinks an annual growth rate of only up to 2 per cent is feasible between now and 2000, by when it expects the cellular telephone population to have reached 5m, treble the current number. CIT believes growth will be stronger on the continent, but starting from a lower base. By 2000 it projects France with 520,000 subscribers and Germany with 825,000. By contrast, the number of Asia-Pacific pagers is expected to double by 2002, reaching 25m users - 11m of them in Japan. 'One of the most important drivers to the paging market in the Asia-Pacific is its widespread acceptance outside the traditional business market,' says Mr Robin Meakin, a CIT analyst. Mass market appeal seems to be more important than competition: in the UK five national networks are fighting it out, while some of the largest markets - including Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea - are monopolies of the state telecommunications operator. Mr Meakin is sceptical as to whether paging will ever catch on as a consumer good in Europe. He is also doubtful that there is a large market for pan-European paging, pointing to the 'disappointing' take-up of Euromessage, which allows roaming between five countries, and the low usage of Eurosignal's roaming service option between Germany, France and Switzerland. On the potential for a European mass market, all eyes are turning to Sweden, where Telia Mobiltel, an offshoot of the state telecommunications operator Televerket, is pioneering a new consumer service. It has two key elements: agreements with distributors and retailers to sell no-frills numeric pagers through high street outlets and mail order, complete with access number and network connection; and a charging structure which places the costs on the caller per call, not a monthly subscriber fee. Between 9am and 4pm the calling charge is SKr6 (about 50p); at other times, and all day at weekends, it is SKr1.5 (12p). The price differential with mobile phones is dramatic, and the new package appears to be catching on. Since April more than 15,000 'private' pagers have been sold, and supplies are sold out. Business usage has also increased on the back of the consumer advertising, with subscriber numbers to the business network at an all-time high at the end of June. 'In cellular phones, the buyer seeks the seller: with pagers the seller needs to seek the buyer,' says Mr Jan Holmgren, marketing manager for TM's paging service, an ex-Motorola executive who masterminded the consumer launch. TM commissioned market research showing a potential paging market of 1.9m out of Sweden's 8.5m population. 'The critical factor is that it should be simple to buy and simple to sell. Distribution is the key, although the charging structure has clearly made it more attractive to the consumer.' Mr Holmgren stresses the price differential with mobile phones. 'The activity in cellular is starting to have a pull-through effect with paging, as people are finding out how high is the ongoing cost of cellular,' he says. The UK has five radiopaging network operators - Aircall Communications, BT Mobile Communications, Vodapage, Hutchison Paging and Mercury Paging (which bought Intercity Paging last year). BT has about 55 per cent of the market; Vodapage and Mercury about 15 per cent each. Monthly service charges are still the norm for all five. Efforts have been made to simplify the service, with the purchase of pagers now accepted and a streamlining of the charging structure. Hutchison has only one zone for the whole country. Vodapage and Mercury have three. BT has six, its tariffs guide resembling a railway timetable. At the moment, pagers divide into three broad categories: the simplest and cheapest is the tone-only radiopager, which bleeps to alert its owner that someone wants to get in touch with him or her. BT's option costs Pounds 10 a month to rent and use for one zone. the numeric radiopager uses a small screen to display numbers - the phone number of the person who wants you to call them, or a coded message. It costs Pounds 18.50 a month to rent and use with a bureau service from BT (one zone). the alphanumeric radiopager, which has a small screen showing text and numbers, typically up to about 400 characters though some display more. With a bureau service this costs Pounds 28 a month to rent and use from BT. All five operators are considering the 'Swedish option', though none has yet made a public move. 'With the current tariffing package we don't think it is worth going for the consumer market,' says Ms Suzanne Stevenson, paging business manager at BT Mobile. 'It might be if you pay per call, but I don't think that changing the colour of pagers is going to be enough by itself.' That is a dig at Hutchison, which is taking a first tentative step into the consumer market with brightly coloured pagers for sale in Dixons at Marble Arch, London. Its Philips-made message pagers are retailing for Pounds 99 (including first month's subscription); its numeric pagers for Pounds 79; and its tone pagers for Pounds 49 with a voice messaging service. 'We have taken an important first step,' says Mr Nigel Salomon, Hutchison Paging's marketing director. 'Our strategy is to take the world's best-kept secret and tell people about it.' Hutchison is also pressing ahead with value-added products, where it is anxious to discard the word 'paging' altogether. It recently launched 'Pulse', a 'pocketable financial information database'. Apart from a standard database providing an overview of financial markets, Pulse offers foreign exchange, various indices, equities and metals. It even bleeps when prices or indices pass pre-set levels. Horse racing results paging services are widely available in Hong Kong. Alas, the last such service has wound up in the UK, and the Swedish model appears to set little store by them.</p>

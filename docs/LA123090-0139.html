			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY GETS TO THE GULF 'FASTEST WITH THE MOSTEST';  </P> <P> LOGISTICS: THE BITTER LESSON OF VIETNAM SPURS LARGEST MOVEMENT OF TROOPS AND  EQUIPMENT IN U.S. HISTORY.  </P> <P> When the Army's 1st Infantry Division at Ft. Riley, Kan., was ordered into  action Nov. 8 as part of the second wave of U.S. troops bound for the Persian  Gulf, the clock started to run on a deployment that is still under way nearly  two months later.  </P> <P> The Army spent two weeks repainting 6,000 vehicles from the traditional  three-pattern green to a new desert camouflage. Twenty-nine trains, each a mile  long, were loaded for a two-day trip to the Port of Houston. The equipment was  transferred to 14 ships in two days.  </P> <P> By last Friday, three cargo ships had arrived in Saudi Arabia and more than  3,200 of the division's 11,500 troops had flown in by plane, picked up their  equipment and moved to the front.  </P> <P> To strategists at the Pentagon, the American buildup in the Persian Gulf is an  effort to take advantage of one of the most bitter lessons that the United  States learned in Vietnam -- that use of a massive force, rapidly deployed, is  the key to victory.  </P> <P> "The thing that drives this buildup, differently from Vietnam, is the  military's commitment to using overwhelming force and getting this thing over  as fast as possible," said a ranking Army officer who served in Vietnam and is  planning gulf strategy.  </P> <P> But overwhelming force cannot be assembled overnight, and the seemingly slow  pace has created the impression that logistic snags may prevent President Bush  from carrying out his threat to attack if Iraq doesn't pull out of Kuwait by  the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, told Bush last week that the troops will not be ready to move  until weeks after the deadline -- largely because of the time needed to get  equipment to the region.  </P> <P> Despite concerns about the Jan. 15 deadline -- set for political reasons that  are independent of the Pentagon's military timetable -- military leaders say  that the largest movement of troops and equipment in American history actually  has been an enormous success.  </P> <P> "Even with some marginal problems, we have moved a helluva force faster than  anybody else has ever done in history," said a senior Pentagon official who is  analyzing the deployment. "This will be compared to Hannibal crossing the  Alps."  </P> <P> The sheer numbers are staggering:  </P> <P> Three million tons of equipment had been moved into Saudi Arabia by  mid-December, with troops arriving at a rate of about 4,000 a day. Thousands of  military and commercial trucks, rail cars, ships, barges and airplanes are  ferrying troops and weapons to an isolated desert.  </P> <P> And, according to interviews with military officers, the few real hitches have  been relatively minor: early delays in readying some of the reserve fleet for  the sealift, a shortage of some specialized ships, a logjam at some Saudi ports  and small weather problems.  </P> <P> In the first 60 days of the buildup, nearly five times as many troops were  moved into Saudi Arabia as were sent to South Korea in the first two months of  the Korean War. More than twice as much military equipment was delivered to the  desert kingdom in that period as was deposited in Vietnam in the first two  months of that war.  </P> <P> The mobilization of the 1st Infantry Division -- known as the Big Red One  because of the scarlet number on the unit's shoulder patch -- illustrates the  challenge that the military transportation experts face.  </P> <P> Troops at Ft. Riley, which once served as home to Lt. Col. George Armstrong  Custer, first learned that they were bound for the gulf when Bush and Cheney  went on television Nov. 8.  </P> <P> As soon as the announcement came over the airwaves, three shifts of painters  began transforming vehicles -- painted green for disguise in the forests of  Northern Europe -- into equipment that would be easier to conceal in the  deserts of the Middle East.  </P> <P> Among the vehicles they painted were the division's 232 M-1 tanks -- the  mainstay of any ground attack against Iraq's fortifications in Kuwait -- 108  Bradley fighting vehicles, lighter tanks capable of carrying up to six  infantrymen, and 33 Apache and Blackhawk helicopters.  </P> <P> The equipment was loaded onto 29 leased railroad trains. Each piece, from  howitzer to tank, received a tiny bar-code sticker like the ones on groceries  in the supermarket, so it could be tracked by computer until it was turned over  to U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> When the trains reached the Port of Houston, the equipment was loaded onto 14  commercial and military vessels provided by the Military Sealift Command. The  tanks and Bradleys went aboard ships known as RO-ROs (for "roll on, roll off").  </P> <P> There is a worldwide shortage of RO-ROs because they are not as profitable to  operate as container ships. But the monster tanks are not suited for transport  by container ships.  </P> <P> "RO-RO is always much easier," said Lt. Col. William G. Byrne Jr., who was  supervising the loading of military goods bound for the gulf on a  Cypriot-flagged container ship in Bayonne, N.J.  </P> <P> Although an overnight snowstorm had delayed work, just as similar storms have  caused minor delays in Northern Europe, Byrne was upbeat: "It's been hectic,"  he said Friday. "It's been frantic, but it's been paced."  </P> <P> The logistics of this massive movement have been carried out by a triad of  military units under Air Force Gen. H. T. Johnson, chief of the U.S.  Transportation Command at Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Ill.  </P> <P> The elements of the triad are the Military Airlift Command, the Military  Sealift Command and the Military Traffic Management Command, which gets troops  and equipment to ports and airports for the other two units.  </P> <P> The MSC is using 248 ships in Operation Desert Shield, including 112 vessels  leased from foreign-flag operators. About 95% of the military cargo from the  United States and Northern Europe is going by sea.  </P> <P> Voyage time varies depending on the vessel and weight of its cargo. Most ships  make the 8,700-mile trip from the East Coast in 23 to 30 days.  </P> <P> The Navy has eight fast sealift ships that can make the voyage in two weeks,  and Army officials said they would like eight to 12 more of these. An MSC  official said that building more is financially impractical and said that the  Army needs to develop lighter weapons.  </P> <P> Even fast ships are not immune to problems. One of the eight broke down on its  first gulf voyage and had to be towed to Gibraltar, where it is undergoing  repairs.  </P> <P> The others are moving Army goods to the gulf from Rotterdam, the Netherlands,  and Antwerp, Belgium, so the Big Red One's equipment in Houston was loaded  aboard a slower armada of vessels, the last of which won't leave Houston for  another few days.  </P> <P> As the first of those ships approached Saudi ports earlier this month, the  Military Airlift Command began flying the initial contingent of Big Red One  troops to the gulf.  </P> <P> As of Wednesday, the MAC had flown 282,000 troops to Saudi Arabia. Nearly  two-thirds of them were carried under contract by American commercial lines.  The airlines have longstanding commitments to provide planes and crews in a  crisis.  </P> <P> But airplanes have transported only a fraction of the military equipment to the  area of operations because air cargo is not cost-efficient. Even the largest  military cargo plane, the C-5, can accommodate only a small amount of the  materiel that can be loaded on a ship.  </P> <P> "A C-5 can carry two M-1 tanks, but it would have to be refueled immediately  after takeoff," said Sgt. Chuck Jones of the MAC.  </P> <P> Linking troops with their equipment in Saudi Arabia depends on fairly precise  timing in a process called "marrying up." Commanders do not want troops on the  ground before their equipment arrives because there would be little for them to  do.  </P> <P> The equipment is offloaded into staging areas, where troops claim what is  theirs and move to assembly points away from the port. Saudi highways have been  augmented to enable U.S. troops and weapons to move to the battle lines in the  desert.  </P> <P> "People lose sight of what a tremendous challenge it is to move a 60-ton tank  200 or 300 miles into the desert," said Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller,  deputy commander of all U.S. forces in the gulf. "It's not something you do  with the snap of a finger."  </P> <P> U.S. commanders in Saudi Arabia have blamed logistic logjams on the fact that  planners initially gave priority to putting combat forces in place. As a  result, support operations lagged far behind.  </P> <P> For that reason, until recently, the United States relied almost entirely on a  fleet of leased cargo trucks for the distribution of goods within Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> About 250 U.S.-owned trucks have begun to operate to supplement an estimated  1,000 vehicles leased from Saudi contractors, Army Maj. Gen. Dane Starling,  logistics chief of the U.S. Central Command, told reporters at a briefing in  Riyadh last week.  </P> <P> While the process of moving troops and equipment to the gulf is still not  completed, Pentagon officials said the military has demonstrated that it can  build up a massive force in a short time.  </P> <P> And resupplying U.S. forces through the same process should be continuous and  smooth.  </P> <P> "Once you have opened the pipeline this way, you can sustain activity and you  have effectively solved your logistics problems in a large sense," a senior  Pentagon official said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Douglas Jehl and Maura Reynolds contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUPPLYING THE FRONT: THE FIRST 60 DAYS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:2.66IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Military  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Tons of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Action  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Troops Carried  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Cargo Shipped  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Operation  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 107,039  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 520,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Desert Shield  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Vietnam War  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 85,562  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 240,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Korean War  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22,716  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 400,437  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Military Traffic Management Control.  </P></p>

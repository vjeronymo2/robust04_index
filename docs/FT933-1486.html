			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Demand for wool is still holding up very well at auctions in Australia and New Zealand. Clearances are good, with as much as 97% of the offering at Sydney sold yesterday, though 90% is more typical. Prices are firm and occasionally a little dearer, with the AWC market indicator up another 2 cents to 433 cents a kg. on September 22, compared with 428 a week before. Postponement rather than removal of the Garnaut stockpile disposal threat is seen as a factor helping to bring about a more active market spell, but longer term anxieties persist</p>

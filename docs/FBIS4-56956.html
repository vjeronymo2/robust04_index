			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by Justice Minister Alexandre </F> Dupeyrat; place not given -- live]    [Text] As you all know, several public service sectors have  been demanding salary increases over the last few months. The  government admits that as a whole public employees receive low  salaries, as do most Brazilian earners of salaries. Aware of  this situation, the government has been implementing economic  and financial reforms that will soon allow the country to resume  development and, above all, improve the standard of living of  workers in general.    Despite government efforts, however, some believe they can  coerce the federal executive branch into granting special favors  to certain sectors of public employees. Within this framework  some sectors of the Federal Police, dissatisfied with their  current salaries, began a strike many weeks ago. This strike  has been hindering activities linked to public security, which  are essential for normal national life, and have been generating  violent actions against the public and against public assets.  These sectors have been doing all this in an attempt to  intimidate the federal government and exert pressure on it.    The government will not allow public order to be threatened  by those who have the duty to preserve it. It will not allow  government assets to be unduly used or raided. It will not  allow essential public services to be discontinued. Complying  with the obligations that the Constitution and the laws impose  on it, the executive branch will adopt all measures needed to  maintain public order and preserve public security and peace.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA;  </P> <P> DE KLERK REPORTS MAJOR DEFENSE CUTS  </P> <P> South African President Frederik W. de Klerk announced a major defense  reduction, cutting mandatory military service in half and promising to close  some military units and facilities. The announcement in Johannesburg came two  weeks after South Africa completed the withdrawal of its troops from Namibia,  where they had fought a bush war against pro-independence guerrillas since  1966. Ten days ago, in a reversal to longstanding policies of his predecessor,  Pieter W. Botha, De Klerk scrapped a nationwide security network that was  denounced as an unaccountable shadow government.  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Astra satellite group plans Pounds 1bn float Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg company behind the Astra satellite television system, is planning a flotation which it is believed will value it at more than Pounds 1bn. The company, which already broadcasts 50 television channels over Europe, would be floated on the London Stock Exchange and a number of other European exchanges, probably before the end of next year. A formal decision to float and the date will depend on the successful launch of the fourth Astra satellite, due in September, and the marketing of channels on the fifth and sixth satellite, which will be devoted to digital television services. Digital compression technology will enable the two satellites to deliver more than 400 channels of television. Flotation has been brought a step nearer by last week's agreement that Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the soon to be privatised German telecoms group, will buy a 16.6 per cent stake in SES for Pounds 180m - much higher than previously expected. DBP agreed to buy 25 per cent of the two-thirds of SES held privately. The remaining third is held by Luxembourg state-owned financial institutions. The German stake amounts to around 20 per cent of the financial assets of SES (because the private investors put up about 80 per cent of the finance). This suggests a current notional value of around Pounds 900m for the satellite group, which made profits of Pounds 55m last year. The DBP deal was accompanied by a Pounds 100m capitalisation to pay for the new satellites. The German deal and the new value it helps to establish for SES is important for Thames Television, an early investor in SES and now part of Pearson, the information and entertainment group that also owns the Financial Times. In 1986 Thames paid Pounds 7m for a 10 per cent stake and has had most of that back in dividends. Thames will also get Pounds 10m compensation for its stake in the enlarged SES falling to 6 per cent. Altogether, the value of Thames's SES stake could now be around Pounds 75m. Pearson paid Pounds 99m for Thames, where the other assets include Pounds 40-Pounds 50m a year in revenues from independent production, Teddington studios, a programme library and stakes in two satellite channels. DBT remains the largest shareholder in Eutelsat, the satellite 'club' of Europe's telecoms groups, and the main rival to SES. DBT's stake is a tacit admission of the success of SES but also an indication that the group wants to take advantage of SES plans to go digital next year. The DBT deal could also give SES a relationship with Bertelsmann, the international media group, and with the Kirch organisation which dominates German film rights.</p>

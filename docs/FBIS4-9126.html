			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Davorin Kracun, Slovene minister for </F> economic relations, by Guenther Guggenberger; place and date not  given: "Upswing After Recession"]    [Text] [Guggenberger] Mr. Minister, in the past few years,  production decreased while unemployment increased in Slovenia.  What are the trends?    [Kracun] In some fields there was still a decline in 1993.  However, according to the calculations made so far, there has  been an upswing in the economy as a whole.    [Guggenberger] What is your explanation for that?    [Kracun] For our economy, which exports more than 60 percent  of its production, the worldwide recession and above all the  recession in Europe was a major obstacle. Now the situation is  more favorable. It was possible to open up new markets, and we  have changed some general conditions in our country.    [Guggenberger] What do you mean by that?    [Kracun] For some time, a new law on enterprises has been in  force in our country. The next step was tax reform, as a result  of which the taxation of profits decreased to 25 percent.  Compared to other countries, this is very low. Foreign  investors can import machines and plants without paying duties.  We resolved privatization as one of the most important reform  steps. It concerns the field of the previous social property --  these were firms that were formally in the hands of the  employees, who, however, did not have any right to sell them;  enterprises owned by development funds and bank reorganization  funds, and actual state property such as steel works, the postal  service, and railroads.    [Guggenberger] How far has the privatization process  advanced?    [Kracun] Some years will pass before it is concluded. Some  enterprises have to get out of the deficit zone.    [Guggenberger] That is to say, the state will hardly act as  an entrepreneur in the future?    [Kracun] Yes, in this way we are following Western  developments.    [Guggenberger] There are plans to develop the  infrastructure.    [Kracun] In the next five years, we will build 300 km of  superhighways, above all in the southwest-northeast direction  from the port of Koper to Lendava at the Hungarian border and  the connection between Maribor and Spielfeld. The railroads will  also be modernized.    [Guggenberger] Economic relations with the European states  are of utmost importance for Slovenia. What are they to be like  in the future?    [Kracun] Several agreements with the EU and the European  Free Trade Association [EFTA] are already in force now. The  trade and cooperation agreement with Hungary guarantees us duty  free trade for about 90 percent of all industrial goods. The  trade agreement with the EFTA is not quite so favorable. At  present, we are negotiating a free trade agreement with this  group of countries. In this way, both EFTA and the EU will be  relatively open markets for us, except for agricultural  products. Moreover, there are bilateral free trade agreements  with the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The same with Hungary and  Poland will follow. We also have appropriate contacts with the  Baltic states, Romania, and Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andreas Schwarz: "Waldheim Hopes for Watch List </F> Revision"]    [Text] Vienna -- Former Austrian President Kurt Waldheim  is of the opinion that the U.S. accusations against him because  of his wartime past, which have now been published, have long  been refuted and he hopes now the "Watch List" decision will  finally be revised. Austria will now decide on what further  steps are to be taken. This was stated by Waldheim in an  interview with DIE PRESSE following the U.S. Justice Department  publication of the report that was the basis of the Watch List  decision in 1987. It accuses Waldheim of a "significant role"  in participating in or supporting Nazi activities.    "The file contains accusations that have been known for  years, have long been refuted, and have been examined thoroughly  by three investigating committees; I have never been accused of  any personally culpable behavior," Waldheim said. Waldheim  cites a few examples: The accusation that he participated in  the transport of imprisoned civilians to concentration camps was  refuted already in 1988 in the course of the investigations of  the Historians' Commission: "This was the famous Plenca  document, by which DER SPIEGEL was taken in and which then  turned out to be forged." Concerning the accusation that  Waldheim was involved in the mistreatment and execution of  imprisoned soldiers, "the investigation by the British Defense  Ministry clearly noted that I was not involved."    One cannot speak at all of any attempts to cover up his past  after his activities in the Balkans became known. Waldheim has  "repeatedly and categorically rejected" accusations in U.S.  newspapers that the Soviets knew about his past and that,  therefore, he, Waldheim, was a target for blackmail as UN  secretary general.    Yesterday Waldheim issued a statement; he also anticipates  that a clarifying statement will be issued by the Foreign  Ministry. The publication of the paper, which had been kept  under lock and key for seven years -- "it was not published  because it does not contain any proof" -- has started some  movement; he will now examine the possibilities of taking action  against the Watch List decision. Waldheim does not rule out the  prospect that the decision could be reversed.    For Foreign Minister Mock so far "only the slanderous  concoction by Mr. Sher is known" (author of the paper), now all  the papers have to be examined. On Monday [14 March] the  Foreign Ministry expressly welcomed the publication of the  report. Several international investigations have shown that  the "known accusations" against Waldheim, which it contains,  "lack any foundation."</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Technology: Solar power via a desert pipeline - Worth Watching ISRAELI technologists have built a pilot plant to test a promising commercial process for the transport of solar energy from desert regions to industrial areas hundreds of kilometres away by pipeline, writes Thomas Land. The world's first methanator specifically for solar energy applications has been built at the Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovot in Israel. It is a central component of the chemical heat pipe, which converts solar radiation into chemical energy, making it possible to store the energy. The solar facility contains 64 computer-controlled mirrors that track the sun and concentrate its energy on to a 54m high receiving tower. This concentrated solar energy is absorbed in a special chemical reactor where methane and other hydrocarbons are converted into gas. The energy-rich gas is stored and transported by pipeline. The methanator is used to convert the gas back to methane and in the process releases heat. Contacts:  Weizmann Institute: Israel, 08 343512.</p>

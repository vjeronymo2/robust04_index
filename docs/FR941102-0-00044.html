			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the Commission initially promulgated the Picture Tube Rule in 1966, most television manufacturers measured the dimensions of their sets diagonally, just as they do today. Thus, the horizontal dimension was not chosen to be the default setting based on a belief that it was the industry norm. Rather, the Commission found that almost all rectangular objects, such as blankets and rugs, were measured horizontally and vertically. Television screens were the only rectangular-shaped commodities that were measured diagonally. Thus, the Commission reasoned, if a rectangular screen was measured in the usual manner for similarly-shaped objects, then no disclosure of the method of measurement was necessary. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Moreover, the television industry has adopted the Rule's disclosure requirements as part of its routine business practice. Reversing the provision, to require a disclosure when a measurement other than the diagonal dimension is used, will provide no tangible benefit, and may cause confusion in the industry and among consumers. Finally, as one television manufacturer noted in its comment, identifying the method of measurement is useful to consumers because many would not instinctively understand the diagonal measurement. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  Thus, the Commission sees no reason to revise the Rule's disclosure requirements at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 FR 3342 (March 3, 1966). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comment of Zenith at 1&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another comment suggested amending Note 2 of the Rule to provide that a disclosure in a footnote or asterisk would constitute a disclosure in ``close connection and conjunction'' to the measurement, as required by the Rule. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  However, footnotes or other fine-print disclosures separated from the body of an advertisement may not be adequate to qualify statements in the text. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  Thus, the Commission has declined to amend the Rule to allow the disclosure of the method of measurement in a footnote or asterisk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comment of Zenith at 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See FTC's Deception Statement, 103 F.T.C. 110, 180 (1983).

Many advertisements for televisions promote multiple television sets of different sizes, and a single disclosure of the method of measurement may not be noticed by consumers. The commenter provided no evidence that multiple disclosures were burdensome. Under the Rule, advertisers can comply simply by stating ``X inches'' for picture tubes measured horizontally, or ``X inches diagonal'' for diagonal measurements. Further, almost all of the comments the Commission received indicated that the current provisions of the Picture Tube Rule are not a burden to manufacturers or advertisers. Thus, the Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed Note, or otherwise provide exceptions to the requirement that the method of measurement accompany each measurement other than a horizontal description. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comment of Zenith at 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1972, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission issued an opinion letter to the Consumer Electronics Group of the Electronic Industries Association concerning various methods of disclosing the method of measurement used for television screens. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  In the letter, staff approved a number of proposed disclosures, including ``20 inch diagonal.'' One comment maintained that the staff opinion letter approving the use ``20 inch diagonal'' is inconsistent with the Rule listing the disclosure ``21 inch diagonal set'' as inappropriate. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  The examples in the Rule apply to a television screen measuring 19 inches horizontally, 15 inches vertically, and 20 inches diagonally. Thus, the example states that the disclosure ``21 inch diagonal set'' is inappropriate not because of the description of the method of measurement, but because the 21 inch measurement is not accurate for the set used in the example. The disclosure approved in the opinion letter used the correct 20 inch measurement. While the current Rule would permit ``20 inch diagonal,'' that phrase is not included in the list of permitted disclosures. While this list is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, the Commission has decided to include this disclosure in the examples provided to remove any uncertainly that may exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Carthon A.

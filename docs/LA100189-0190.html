			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO CASES DOCUMENT AIDS TRANSMISSION THROUGH ORAL SEX  </P> <P> The San Francisco Department of Public Health has documented what are  apparently the first two cases in California of AIDS virus transmission between  two men through oral sex.  </P> <P> The researchers said the new data confirm other reports of transmission of the  human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, through oral sex and reinforce earlier  warnings from public health officials that the practice does not represent safe  sex.  </P> <P> "Exposure to semen, whether oral, vaginal or rectal, carries a risk of  transmission of HIV," Dr. Alan R. Lifson, assistant director for research of  the department's AIDS office, said in a telephone interview Saturday. Lifson  added that although oral sex may be "less risky" than anal intercourse as a  means of transmitting the AIDS virus, it is "not safe."  </P> <P> Public health officials emphasize several strategies to avoid exposure to the  AIDS virus through sexual intercourse. These include using condoms, avoiding  the exchange of bodily fluids, such as semen, and abstaining from sexual  relations.  </P> <P> The AIDS virus is contained in the semen, as well as the blood, of infected  individuals. The virus might be transmitted to a sexual partner during oral  intercourse through small cuts or sores in the mouth, diseased gums or normal  oral tissue. Researchers, however, are not certain of the exact means of  transmission.  </P> <P> Lifson said he was "confident" of the findings in the two "very recent" cases.  Both men had only one risk factor for HIV infection -- exposure to semen  through receptive oral intercourse.  </P> <P> The two men had been studied extensively over the last five years as part of a  citywide San Francisco study of thousands of gay and bisexual men.  </P> <P> In the previous studies, the two men had tested negative for AIDS virus  antibodies. This summer, they both tested positive. A test known as the  polymerase chain reaction, which is a more sensitive blood test than the  standard antibody test, confirmed that the earlier AIDS antibodies tests were  negative, Lifson said.  </P> <P> Detailed sexual and personal histories revealed that one man had receptive oral  sex with multiple partners whose HIV infection status was unknown. The other  man also had oral sex with multiple partners, one of whom was known to be  infected with HIV.  </P> <P> "The interviewers . . . were quite confident that the information they received  was accurate," Lifson said.  </P> <P> There have been several earlier reports in medical journals describing apparent  cases of HIV transmission between two men through oral sex. In September, 1987,  Boston researchers reported such a case in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  </P> <P> In January, Massachusetts researchers described a case of apparent  female-to-male transmission of the AIDS virus through oral sex. But the  reliability of the report, which was published as a letter in the New England  Journal of Medicine, was questioned by other AIDS physicians.  </P></p>

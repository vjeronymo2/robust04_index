			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, June 15, RIA -- Beginning with July 1, the  programmes of the Russian television channel will not be re-  translated in Latvia. According to the sociological data, six  percent of the Latvian citizens watched these programmes.    As to the Ostankino tv programmes (which are regularly  watched by 48 percent of the population in Latvia), they will be  broadcast only in the decimetre channel. As a RIA correspondent  was told at the Latvian tv centre, the number of the people  watching these programmes will thus decrease.    This decision has been taken by the Latvian Radio and  Television Council which explains it by the Latvian law on  television under which only a third of the tv time can be used  for the programmes not in the official language, that is, in  Russian, to be more precise.    According to the chairman of the Latvian Radio and  Television  Council, all these changes are an experiment and may possibly be  revised next year.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Placer Dome net income halved in first quarter PLACER Dome, one of North America's leading gold producers, suffered halved first-quarter income, with lower prices, higher costs and slack base metal sales more than offsetting a 5 per cent rise in bullion output. The Vancouver-based company reported net earnings of CDollars 17.6m (USDollars 15m), or 7 cents a share, down from CDollars 35.1m, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues fell to CDollars 256.8m from CDollars 299.9m. Gold earnings tumbled to CDollars 10.6m from CDollars 25.9m. The company's share of production rose to 357,000 oz from 337,000 oz, thanks to the contribution of the new Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea, which produced a total of 224,800 oz in the quarter. But the realised gold price of USDollars 410 per oz was 6 per cent lower than a year earlier, and total production costs advanced to an average of USDollars 336 from USDollars 321 per oz. Cash costs were up 27 per cent. The higher costs were ascribed to lower output at the Campbell Mine in northern Ontario, the Misima mine in Papua New Guinea and the Kidston property in Australia. Earnings from other metals, notably copper, silver and molybdenum were CDollars 1.5m, down from CDollars 7.2m. Placer said hedging will ensure it receives at least USDollars 435 an oz for 61 per cent of its 1991 gold output. A study on the Mount Milligan property in British Columbia should be completed this summer. Preliminary studies point to a mine with a capital cost of CDollars 440m, which could produce 280,000 oz of gold and 80m lbs of copper a year.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (1): Hungry to succeed - Restoring the prosperity of Saxony, once one of Germany's richest regions, is an important task in the difficult and costly reconstruction taking place after the country's east-west reunification. Andrew Fisher reports on progress so far ONE OF the greatest economic transformations of the century is taking place in eastern Germany, and the exciting, arduous, and highly frustrating process is at its most visible in the state of Saxony. Anyone visiting the region today would find it hard to imagine that Saxony was once one of the richest parts of Germany, with an industrial tradition that would have kept it at the forefront of European prosperity but for 12 years of Nazi tyranny (including the devastation of the Second World War) and 40 years of Communist domination. Despite the surge of private and public investment into the state and the intense efforts being made to improve the ragged infrastructure, it takes only a brief walk round any city, town, or village to realise that the task of reconstruction is enormous. Many roads are still rutted, rail travel is slow and unreliable and the dirt and neglect of decades is proving hard to scrub away. Yet the same walk is also likely to reveal enormous progress. Before the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, and the German border was flung open, East Germany's streets were drab and lifeless, the range of goods in the shops was pathetic by western standards and queuing was a way of life. Today the queues are gone. Shop windows are varied and colourful and city streets are full of life. Because the economic, social and psychological relics of the past are proving more costly and time-consuming to overcome than most people expected  -and many politicians led them to believe - the transition from communist central planning to the opportunities, and risks, of the free market is accompanied by much discontent and protest, as well as hope and optimism. On balance, the positive still outweighs the negative in most people's minds. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) prime minister of Saxony, constantly quotes opinion polls which show that people in Saxony are still generally more satisfied with their present situation, and with the future outlook, than they were previously. He has never hidden the awkward truth of the real state of the old East Germany, and the immense costs and efforts required to drag it up to western economic standards. 'People do not lack confidence and they mostly see the future positively,' he says. Because he was not one of those who painted too rosy a picture of prospects in the election year of 1990, people in Saxony are mostly prepared to believe Mr Biedenkopf when he talks of the tremendous opportunities in store for the state. Certainly, the local Social Democrat (SPD) opposition has no-one with anything like his stature, and knows full well that attacking him would not bring it popularity. One of the strengths of Saxony, with a population of 4.9m, is its strong sense of identity - although the communists tried to obliterate this when they abolished the individual states. Cities in Saxony, notably Leipzig, were a powerful source of grassroots opposition to the scorned regime of Erich Honecker in its final days. Like Dresden, Leipzig had been in constant struggle with East Berlin, the former East German capital which enjoyed extensive political and economic privileges. Today, Dresden is the capital of Saxony, with Leipzig developing as a commercial and financial centre. Both places are full of building sites, around which essential road repairs and improvements cause constant traffic hold-ups. But these inconveniences show the speed at which reconstruction is proceeding, despite the horrendous handicaps of property disputes, administrative delays caused by inexperience and the sheer weight of work, and the economic disruption stemming from the collapse of the old economic system. The challenge is inspiring, however, and often dispiriting. Numerous officials, managers and other experts have come from the west to participate in the economic, political and social rebuilding of Saxony. With good accommodation in short supply (and outrageously priced when available), and a crushing workload, such a degree of commitment is not to be entered into lightly. One such 'transplant' is Mr Rudiger Thiele, state secretary at Saxony's economics ministry and a former senior official in the Bonn Chancellery. Like many of his colleagues in Dresden and in the rest of the state, he sees the task of restoring the state's prosperity as invigorating, essential in the creation of a new identity for a country still coming to terms with unification between the capitalist west and the once-communist east. 'In west Germany, people have become rather smug and self-satisfied,' Mr Thiele says. 'Years of prosperity make people lethargic. Here, people are hungry to succeed. A new generation is developing which has to be tough to be successful against the established systems and structures of the west.' This view is in line with Mr Biedenkopf's assertion that east Germans are capable of bearing more economic and social burdens than people in the west because of efforts they have made to break with the past and their belief that their lives will improve. For the moment, though, they are living in a very uncertain present. Unemployment and short-time working are high. The least competitive, most inefficient, and most environmentally offensive of the old companies have closed; the survivors struggle to become more productive by shedding staff and closing peripheral operations. A new layer of Mittelstand (small- and medium-sized) businesses is growing up in what was formerly East Germany to provide a much-needed dose of entrepreneurial vigour. Under the old regime, these were squeezed into big industrial combines, so that the Mittelstand's contribution to economic prosperity, vital in West Germany, was crushed. At this stage it is hard to assess the impact Mittelstand companies will have on Saxony's economy, or how robustly they will develop. More attention has been directed to the big headline investments such as those of Volkswagen, Siemens and other German and foreign concerns. It is these which give Saxony a positive sense of its economic destiny, and offer hope that today's tribulations will be tomorrow's successes. But Saxony's future also depends on the survival of its cultural heritage, kept alive through the years of dictatorship and Stalinism. This ranges from the big opera houses and orchestras of Dresden and Leipzig - where Kurt Masur, a key figure in the events that toppled the East Berlin regime, conducts the famed Gewandhaus orchestra - to smaller establishments around the state. While these are a vital part of Saxony's attractions, they are proving increasingly hard to pay for. It is unclear how far Bonn will continue helping to finance Saxony's cultural assets. Mr Hans Joachim Meyer, the English professor who is minister for science and culture, is doing his best to prise more money out of the German federal government. But the provision of funds for culture depends on the health of the economy, and the Bonn government is trying desperately to control the flow of money to the east. 'We have to accept the need for a prolonged period for the reconstruction of east Germany,' Mr Meyer says. 'People here will have to accept lower standards of living for a longer time and people in west Germany will have to pay for the east for longer.' In Saxony, people are resigned to some difficult years before their efforts and patience pay off. When they do, however, the state will be ready to take its place among the most prosperous and vibrant, as well as scenically attractive, parts of Germany.</p>

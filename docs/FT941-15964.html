			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Oracle, Bell Atlantic in TV pact Oracle, the US computer database software company, is emerging as a leader in software for interactive television (I-TV) services. Today it plans to announce an alliance with Bell Atlantic, the US regional telephone company, to offer jointly the first commercial I-TV service in the US. While several US companies have begun experimental trials of I-TV, Bell Atlantic and Oracle say they will establish the first commercial US I-TV service in Washington DC, starting in March. Oracle will provide new multimedia database software and systems integration services. The two companies also announced long-term plans to market jointly interactive information technology to telecommunications and cable-TV companies. The Oracle software will manage multimedia databases containing thousands of films for 'movies on demand' services as well as video, audio and text for on-line shopping and information services. Bell Atlantic has been one of the most aggressive 'Baby Bells' in moving towards interactive information services. Last October, it announced plans to merge with Tele-Communications, the largest US cable-TV company. Oracle's new multimedia database software is designed to run on a variety of computers. Bell Atlantic will run it on a parallel supercomputer developed by nCube, of California. In the UK, British Telecom has adopted a similar configuration of Oracle software and an nCube supercomputer for a test of interactive television being conducted at its Martlesham laboratories.</p>

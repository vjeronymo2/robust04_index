			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARING FOR DISABLED  </P> <P> The article by John Hurst "Home for Retarded, Disabled to Close" (Metro, Feb.  5) did not completely depict the situation at Lynwood Care Center or at any  large intermediate-care facility for the developmentally disabled operating in  California.  </P> <P> During the last two years there has been a concerted effort by the California  Department of Developmental Services to depopulate the larger homes serving the  developmentally disabled and move these clients into a more home-like  environment, specifically 6-15 bed homes. This philosophy though strong in  idea, has left a void in the health care system serving the developmentally  disabled client because not all clients are independent enough to function in  these environments. The clients not suitable for smaller homes are profoundly  retarded and require continuous assistance.  </P> <P> Facilities such as Lynwood Care Center are now responsible to care for a much  more involved client, requiring an intense amount of both professional and  direct care time to meet the needs of these clients. This change in client  needs has caused the costs of services to soar. The industry serving these  clients, along with Beverly Enterprises, is making every effort to provide the  quality care these clients deserve. Yet the resources required to meet these  needs far exceed the reimbursement level set by the state. As an example, this  variance would have been a negative $850,000 for this current year at Lynwood  Care Center.  </P> <P> This situation is an industry-wide problem that requires immediate attention.  Beverly Enterprises is working with state officials to find a solution to this  problem.  </P> <P> We are proud of the care our employees deliver to our residents in all of our  nursing facilities. If any of your readers would like to see one of our  facilities firsthand, please feel free to contact the facility directly for a  tour.  </P> <P> WILLIAM A. MATHIES  </P> <P> Vice President, Operations  </P> <P> Beverly Enterprises, Region 10  </P></p>

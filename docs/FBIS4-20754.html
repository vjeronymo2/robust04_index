			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hanan Abu Diya': "Employees Reject Next </F> Cost-of-Living Pay Increase and Demand That Government Fix  Prices!"]    [Text] A few days ago a committee, chaired by Dr. Husayn  Ramzi Kadhim, head of the Central Regulation and Administration  Agency, held a meeting in which the subject of discussion was  the draft of a new law for government employees. The committee's  discussions focused on means to guarantee that salaries will not  be frozen. One of these principal means would be making the pay  grades open-ended at the top, since this would lead to direct  salary increases that would not be dependent on promotions.  Another proposal discussed by the committee involves freeing  periodic pay increases so that they would not stop at the top of  the pay scale, or preparation of new salary tables that would  include making the pay grades open-ended at the top. Still  another proposal would grant a single pay increase that would  include both the periodic pay increase and the cost-of-living  pay increase and would amount to about 10 percent of one's  salary.    Unfortunately, however, increases in salaries--however  slight--are always followed by increases in prices, and the two  increases do not match each other. Although 10 percent annual  cost-of-living pay increases, amounting to an overall increase  of 110 percent, have been added to salaries during past years,  prices, according to statistics, have increased 224 percent. The  strange thing is that officials are still fumbling around  concerning the next pay increase, and every day we hear about a  new opinion that already gets changed the following day.    On 12 February of this year a meeting was held in the  Ministry of Finance for the purpose of discussing the  implementation of the decision by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi, concerning combining the periodic pay increase with the  cost-of-living pay increase and having this be in effect  starting with the new budget next July. An official in the  ministry has said that Dr. Sidqi's decision is the result of the  government's endeavoring to grant a cost-of-living pay increase  to government employees when the new budget goes into effect, in  accordance with the policy of achieving a balance between wages  and prices and lightening these employees' burdens!!    He said that the amount of the cost-of-living pay increase  to  be paid out with July's salaries will be finalized during the  month of April. He pointed out that there are several different  proposals being studied by the government, including keeping the  cost-of-living pay increase as it is, that is, separate from the  periodic pay increase, or combining the cost-of-living pay  increase with the periodic pay increase.    During this period of time the government will study the  expenses involved in putting into effect the new 10 percent  increase in government employees' wages next 1 July, and will  also study the expenses involved in combining the cost-of-living  pay increase with basic salaries--and these expenses amount to  about 150 million Egyptian pounds.    Dr. Sidqi has previously stated that the government intends  to grant the cost-of-living pay increase next July, in  accordance with the policy of achieving a balance between wages  and prices and lightening employees' burdens. He said that the  amount of this cost-of-living pay increase has still not been  determined, that there are ongoing studies dealing with  instituting it, and that there are different proposals being  studied by the government, including keeping the cost-of-living  pay increase separate from the periodic pay increase.    He said that he personally would get a pay increase of 21  Egyptian pounds, and that a minister's pay increase would amount  to 15 Egyptian pounds.    During the same month, Ahmad al-'Awami, minister of manpower  and employment, announced that the percentage of the  cost-of-living pay increase for government employees still has  not been determined and that this matter would, in due time, be  discussed with the ministries concerned.    This information also appears at a time when the media has  published a statement by Dr. Sidqi to the effect that, during  the next few days, he will look into the demands of the  Federation of Labor Unions and Heads of Labor Unions concerning  raising the percentage of the cost-of-living pay increase, to be  paid out next July, from 10-20 percent.    Of course, all of these statements have aroused resentment  on  the part of employees and workers with limited incomes. All  during the last few years they have heard and read such  statements, and the only thing that has happened has been the  payment very small cost-of-living pay increases which have  lagged far behind pay increases!!    All of the above has concerned government employees. As far  as employees in companies are concerned, the holding companies  have recently prepared wage tables that have the following  features, among others: Level 3 of the civil [service]  positions, including Categories 6, 5, 4, and 3, would have  starting salaries of between 100 and 300 Egyptian pounds. For  Level 2 of the technical, administrative, and specialist  positions requiring intermediate level and high level  qualifications, including Categories 4, 3, and 2, the starting  salaries would be between 120 and 300 Egyptian pounds. For Level  1 of all higher positions, including even the director of a  department, the starting salaries would be between 150 and 400  Egyptian pounds. The wage tables also would include the fact  that the proposed periodic pay increase be from 5 to 40 Egyptian  pounds.    All of these things discussed above are merely proposals and  declarations made unilaterally, that is, made by officials in  charge. But how do things really stand, and what is being said  by the employees themselves, the people most concerned?    First of all, the proposal being discussed which concerns  abolishing the top end of the pay scale for the grades of the  various positions, if applied, would constitute an important  achievement, especially since, at the present time, employees  are not allowed to receive any pay increases after arriving at  the top of the pay scale, unless the law stipulates otherwise.  There is nothing stated in Law 47 of 1978 which permits this.  However, we note that Law 6 of 1977, which was issued in order  to grant an additional pay increase to employees as of 1 January  1977, does permit the granting of this pay increase, even if an  employee, by receiving such a pay increase, would have pay which  would go beyond the top pay scale stipulated for his position.  This law has been in effect in this area, and it predates Law 47  of 1978.    Another legal passage of this type that constitutes an  exception is the passage in Article 103 of Law 47 of 1978  dealing with transfer regulations that stipulates that employees  shall have either the starting salaries of the positions to  which they are transferred or a pay increase, whichever is  greater, even if this means that they would thus have pay that  goes beyond the top end of the pay scale, and this pay increase  shall not affect the employees' periodic pay increases.  According to this passage, an employee shall be granted an  additional pay increase even if this means that his pay will go  beyond the top end of the pay scale for the position's grade.  There is also Passage No. 52, which constitutes an exception and  which stipulates the granting of an incentive pay increase even  if this means that the employee's pay would go beyond the top  end of the pay scale for his grade.    Rushdi Muhammad says: "I have been a Category 1 employee for  10 years. I don't care about grades or pay increases after  seeing that my salary, incentive payments, and allowances are  not enough to cover my life's basic necessities for even 10 days  out of every month!! I suggest that the government be interested  in people as such before engaging in talk about cost-of-living  pay increases. We actually do get a lot of cost-of-living pay  increases, but the increases in prices are far greater and our  salaries are not enough to meet our basic needs. They are not  even enough for our food alone, much less for clothes, housing,  and medical expenses." He added: "The government is always  announcing that it has lowered taxes for employees and given  them wage increases. The truth is that it has taken all this  away many times over in the form of prices for services such as  electricity, water, and transportation."    Sayyid al-Hujurati, an employee in the water utility, had  the  following to say: "What can I do with a 10-percent pay increase  with the high cost of living that we have? Even though salaries,  as they say, have increased 100 percent during the last 10  years, they have not enabled Egyptians to even have enough for  the basic necessities of life." He feels that it would be more  worthwhile to fix prices than to give pay increases, and said:  "I used to buy a kilogram of meat for 68 piasters. But today the  price of this meat in the 13 consumer cooperatives has gone up  to 1 Egyptian pound. Is the 10 percent enough to take care of  the steep rise in the prices of meat, bread, and only the basic  necessities?" He went on to say: "For three years the officials  have been saying that they are looking into the matter of making  pay grades open-ended, but unfortunately this has not happened.  If it does happen, I believe that it will significantly decrease  the effect of the high prices which employees suffer from."    Samir Muhammad al-Nu'man, an employee in the Egyptian  Commercial Medicines Co., says: "Giving one a pay increase that  amounts to 10 percent of one's salary will not add much to the  salary and will not decrease the burdens on an employee's  shoulders. Whatever the pay increase is, it is always far less  than the insane increase in prices. This is particularly true  because the pay increase is never linked to the increase in  prices and the current actual value of the Egyptian pound."    Dr. Faruq 'Abd-al-Salam says: "As for the matter of  achieving  a balance between the system of periodic and cost-of-living pay  increases now in effect and a permanent pay increase amounting  to 10 percent of one's salary, this is something that will  neither hasten nor delay--to either a large or a small  degree--the problem that afflicts our worn-out Egyptian people.  We are only talking about a difference in milliemes, which  cannot keep a person alive. There are three basic reasons for  saying this. First of all, changing the type of pay increase,  whether this involves the various kinds of pay increases or  regular raises, amounts to nothing more than a sedative. This  would be true even if the regular raise were 100 percent of  one's salary. The reason for this is that prices nowadays have  become a vicious monster, which is dozens of times greater than  any increase in pay that the government might give to its  employees."    Mayisah 'Abd al-Rahim , an employee, says: "By means of  simple arithmetic I found out that the value of a pay increase  would not increase my salary by more than 10 Egyptian pounds,  most of which would be spent on transportation within only a  two-day period. I would not be able to make use of this pay  increase to buy anything that I want to buy, especially since  prices continually go up. I believe that pay increases should be  in line with price increases and should not be fixed."    'Abd al-Rahman Mustafa 'Iraqi, director of a consumer  cooperatives company, says: "The pay increases, no matter what  they are, will not be enough to cover the basic necessities of  average Egyptians. I do not believe that a 10-percent salary  increase will benefit our citizens. Such a pay increase is not  enough even to buy just one kilogram of meat or 20 flat loaves  of bread. If an Egyptian wants to buy a new shirt, he has to  save the money earned from this pay increase for at least four  months. The ideal solution is to link the pay increases with the  rises in prices."</p>

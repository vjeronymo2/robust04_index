			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Estimate of Election Outcome (Based </F> on past and present polls from HSRC [Human Sciences Research  Council], Markinor, MRA [Market Research Africa] and MMR  [Marketing and Media Research])"]    [Text]  <H5>  LOYALTY </H5>   The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] may not have a huge number  of supporters, but those who say they will vote for it are  certainly the most loyal. Of those who were asked if they would  stand by their choice "no matter what" 97 percent of PAC  supporters said they would.    Worrying for the DP [Democratic Party] must be the result  which shows that only 59 percent of its supporters are certain  nothing can change their minds.  <H5>  CHANGE </H5>   What would make people who have made up their minds switch  their vote?    Nothing, said 88 percent.    If the party did something I strongly disagreed with, say 4  percent.    If another party made promises or policies I strongly agreed  with, say 4 percent.    If someone threatened or intimidated me, say 2 percent.    If parents, partner or friends sway me, say 1 percent.    A few gave reasons such as if their party withdrew, if  minority groups were disregarded, and if their party changed its  policies or broke its promises.  <H5>  UNCERTAINTY </H5>   Why are people uncertain about their choice?    The two main reasons are uninterest and ignorance.    These were the answers by people who are still undecided  about their choice: I'm not interested in politics or the  election (25 percent, who were more likely to be coloureds or  Indians).    I don't know what is going on politically (19 percent,  coloureds, Indians, lower income, over-50s).    I like more than one party and can't decide which to vote  for  (15 percent, upper income whites).    I don't know what each of the parties stands for (12  percent), and I don't like or trust any of the parties or  leaders (9 percent).    Minor reasons were: I don't know how to vote; I don't know  where to vote; my vote won't make a difference; promises are not  being kept; have not decided yet; parties are changing their  policies and, lots can still happen.  <H5>  FREEDOM FRONT, 7 PERCENT? </H5>   General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front (FF), the electoral  vehicle of conservative whites, is the wild card in next month's  election.    A late entrant to the race, the front's showing is  unpredictable as fieldwork was conducted before it decided to  take part in the election.    However, if we assume a large proportion of CP [Conservative  Party] and some white IFP and most Volksfront [National Front]  supporters will vote for it, the FF could get as much as 7  percent of the vote.    This is not a scientific research prediction but only an  estimation.  <H5>  NATAL </H5>   Natal is the area where those who want a free and fair  election just do not know what is going to happen. Will most  people be able to vote? How much violence and intimidation will  there be? Will voting in all areas be declared valid after the  election? There are all these doubts, but of those who were  prepared to name a party 85 percent had no doubt they would  stick to this party "no matter what happens".    Only 54 percent of people polled were prepared to name their  choice. The remainder were either not sure who to vote for (19  percent), not prepared to say (15 percent) or said they could  not or would not vote (12 percent).    Of all those polled in Natal, 22 percent said they would  vote  for the ANC, 16 percent for the NP [National Party], 12 percent  for the IFP and 4 percent for "others". The overall result  could be greatly effected by those who go to the polls and those  who stay away either because of intimidation and violence or  because they want to vote for the IFP and no other party.  <H5>  The main findings: No dramatic shift in the past three months </H5> <H5>  THE ANC </H5>   Has shown a 5 percent loss, mainly from Indians who have  switched to the NP. Another big loss is in the upper-income  category.  <H5>  THE NP </H5>   Is recovering some of the support it lost over the past year  or so and has grown (about 6 percent) mainly at the expense of  the ANC.  <H5>  THE PAC </H5>   Has shown a 1 percent gain in black and coloured  communities,  the 25-35 age group and in the Cape and Free State.  <H5>  THE FREEDOM FRONT </H5>   Is difficult to assess as fieldwork was carried out before  it  decided to take part in the election and, therefore, there is no  shift pattern.  <H5>  THE DP </H5>   Has remained static with moderate gains among coloureds. Of  all the main parties it showed the least loyal supporters.</p>

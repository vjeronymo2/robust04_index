			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, acting parliamentary group </F> leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Anna Dano; place  and date not given: "It Is Not Worth It for the Power Alone --  What Are the Guarantees of Cooperation?"]    [Text] On 5 June the convention of the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] made a decision behind closed doors and gave  authorization to the executive body to start talks on forming a  government with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. When the  coalition talks are completed, the SZDSZ will decide at another  convention whether to approve the draft coalition agreement. We  interviewed Gabor Kuncze, a leading member of the SZDSZ, on the  conditions set by the Free Democrats.    [Dano] Do you still see yourself as a prime ministerial  candidate?    [Kuncze] After the second round of elections, the Free  Democrats do not have a chance to name a prime ministerial  candidate.    [Dano] Were there any concrete facts in the Socialists'  offer for negotiations?    [Kuncze] There were not any. However, we assume that both  sides are open and ready to make compromises, and that they are  thinking in terms of the whole negotiating package. Within  this, we have to have detailed talks on the program of  governmental cooperation and the elements of efficient  governmental and parliamentary work, and we have to decide on  personnel and the distribution of the ministries.    [Dano] Is it possible that the person filling the  presidential post will also be discussed?    [Kuncze] If this issue is raised then the SZDSZ insists on  Arpad Goncz.    [Dano] Do you disregard the SZDSZ's former statement that  [MSZP Chairman] Horn's nomination for prime minister might stop  the SZDSZ from entering the coalition? Generally, can any of  the MSZP's offers make the SZDSZ accept Horn as prime minister?    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ has not yet withdrawn this statement but  the situation is fundamentally different. The MSZP gained an  absolute majority and we have to take this into consideration at  our talks.    [Dano] Can the MSZP give guarantees for a liberal economic  policy?    [Kuncze] It is not worth partaking of power for power's sake  alone. The stake of the negotiations is whether the SZDSZ can  receive guarantees that make it possible to implement elements  of our ideas -- naturally, through compromises. If these  guarantees do not exist then the SZDSZ must not enter the  coalition because, in this situation, it would only be given  various positions. A guarantee could be if the principle of  majority voting cannot automatically prevail in the coalition.  My meaning is that the SZDSZ's effective influence in the  governmental work must not become doubtful. Therefore, at the  negotiations, both sides will have to show a large degree of  willingness for compromise, and empathy, and the talks will have  to be conducted with absolute openness and goodwill.    [Dano] Do you think it possible that the economic ministries  will be merged in the new government?    [Kuncze] The governmental structure will be an issue at the  coalition talks. According to the SZDSZ, one person has to be  responsible for the economic policy within the government. One  kind of economic policy is needed, rather than three kinds that  characterized the previous government's activities. The  question is whether the economic top minister should be  responsible for the economic ministry or the finance ministry.    [Dano] Do you insist on having one of the economic  ministries to yourselves?    [Kuncze] Again, we can only answer this during the  negotiations. The size of the MSZP's majority cannot be  questioned. This has to be accepted and the ministries have to  be distributed accordingly. On the other hand, the MSZP  obviously accepts that it is only worth for the SZDSZ to enter  into a coalition if it can also be given important ministries.  These can also be economic ones.    [Dano] You mentioned that you will reconsider the  governmental structure at the negotiations. Is it possible that  establishing a position of deputy prime minister will be raised?    [Kuncze] This position might be created. If it is then the  constitution has to be amended because this position is not in  it. If this position is created then the deputy prime minister  will also be responsible for the activities of other ministries,  but he will not have the right to instruct other ministers.    [Dano] Do you require any of the ministries of armed forces?    [Kuncze] It would not be fortunate to insist on anything in  advance. However, the SZDSZ would be capable of supervising the  Interior Ministry.    [Dano] What are your views on the suggestion that the MSZP  would subordinate the civil secret service to the Interior  Ministry?    [Kuncze] Numerous versions are possible. For us it is  inconceivable that a minister without portfolio should continue  to be responsible for this area. However, it is not certain  that the Interior Ministry is the best place for the secret  service. It might be better placed in the Justice Ministry.    [Dano] Would you ban government party deputies questioning  the ministers in parliament?    [Kuncze] This cannot be banned because this ensures the  independence of the deputies. However, we would not like the  government party deputies to question the ministers in  parliament and take the opportunity away from the opposition  deputies. Questions to ministers are the most important tool of  the opposition. However, the government party deputies have to  be given the opportunity to turn to the minister in a given  situation and the minister has to be compelled to give an answer  within a certain period of time. If the minister's reply cannot  be accepted then the problem has to be dealt with in the  parliamentary groups.</p>

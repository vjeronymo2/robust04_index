Security Council message on the North Korean nuclear wrangle at  Thursday's [31 March] foreign ministers' meeting.    Visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu meets  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and sources say they  are likely to agree on issuing a statement by the council  president rather than adopting a resolution -- but carrying the  same strength in tone.    Han told Korean reporters that if the council opts for a  presidential statement, all permanent members including China  will speak in favor with North Korea the only country opposing  it.    "This will make public the fact that China is on our side,"  Han said.    But he suggested that the tone of the statement should be  stronger than what China has proposed, putting in print the  deadline by when North Korea should allow international  inspection of its nuclear facilities and a warning on sanctions  if Pyongyang fails to comply.    On whether Seoul and Washington would resume their joint  military maneuvers, Team Spirit, Han said the United States has  always respected Seoul's position and decisions.    "This time, we would be asking what Washington thinks  instead  of consulting them on our own position," Han said.</p>

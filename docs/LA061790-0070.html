			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POLICE HIT WITH ROCKS AFTER CLOSING CLUB  </P> <P> Hundreds of people angered by the closing of a crowded Latino social club  pelted police with rocks and bottles early Saturday during a window-smashing  rampage that took three hours to quell.  </P> <P> Police asked owners of the members-only Quisquellano Lounge to clear out an  estimated 250 patrons about midnight after an officer saw a window break, Lt.  Joseph Rowe said.  </P> <P> "It was unsafe and overcrowded," Rowe said, adding there was no official  occupancy limit. "After several requests were made both in English and in  Spanish directing everyone to leave the area, people refused to leave . . . and  a kind of mob psychology took over."  </P> <P> Reinforcements were called in to help control the crowd that swelled to about  500 and flooded the streets surrounding the Boston suburb's central square.  </P> <P> "They eventually blocked the entire street. When the first arrest was made, the  crowd turned on the officers and pelted them with bottles and stones," he said,  adding that fights broke out in alleys and that store windows were smashed.  </P> <P> Fifteen people were arrested, most for investigation of disorderly conduct or  failure to disperse. All face arraignment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rowe said no injuries were reported and the disturbance stopped short of  becoming a riot because police "showed restraint . . . (and) did not attack the  crowd."  </P> <P> Manuel Ortiz, secretary at the club where owners have applied for a nightclub  license, said it has no liquor license and serves only soft drinks.  </P> <P> "We've never had any trouble here in 15 years," he said in a telephone  interview from the club.  </P> <P> Rowe said he did not know whether alcohol was being served at the lounge, but  "certainly people were under the influence."  </P></p>

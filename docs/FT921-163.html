			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lucas in the spotlight Since Lucas has launched three rights issues in the last six years, it is just as well that the Seventh Cavalry has now turned up with a Pounds 90m pension fund surplus. The company has been spared an agonising debate over whether the dividend should be chopped, or whether precious capital spending projects should be sacrificed instead. Capital expenditure, it seems, is likely to be broadly unchanged for the year as a whole, while an 8 per cent yield on the shares reflects the market's confidence that there will be no diminution in the payout this time. One wonders, though, what the year to mid-1993 holds in store. The pension loophole is unlikely to come to the rescue again, especially if there is a Labour government. It is always possible that the group's main markets in cars, civil aircraft and defence will finally come good, but this is what Lucas was saying a year ago and the damage is now evident in its increased working capital requirement and underlying rise in balance sheet gearing. From virtually nothing 18 months ago, this will probably be 40 per cent at the end of the financial year, close to the limit of what is comfortable. Investors in the sector face a stark choice between Lucas and T&amp;N on the one hand - would-be world-beaters but desperately capital-hungry - and the likes of GKN and BBA which have been ruthlessly running their businesses for cash in the current recession and eschewing fancy technology. No prizes, of course, for guessing which variety the stock market prefers. Short-termism or not, it is worth bearing in mind when assessing their chances that the combined sales of these four UK companies are equivalent to the automotive division of Bosch.</p>

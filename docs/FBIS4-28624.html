			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 KYODO -- Japanese and South Korean  foreign ministers agreed Saturday [11 June] that sanctions  against North Korea for its failure to guarantee nuclear  transparency should be gradual, Japanese officials said.    Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and his South Korean  counterpart Han Sung-chu met for one and a half hours in Seoul  and confirmed that planned U.N. Security Council sanctions  against North Korea are aimed at encouraging Pyongyang to hold  dialogue for a negotiated solution, the officials said.    Kakizawa and Han pledged close bilateral cooperation in  dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development  program, they said.    The Japanese foreign minister made clear that Japan will  "make utmost efforts within the Constitution" if the Security  Council decides to adopt sanctions.    Kakizawa dismissed reports that Japan is intransigent on  taking punitive steps against North Korea, in an apparent denial  of an article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on Thursday  claiming Japan is reluctant to levy sanctions.    They also verified a trilateral agreement between Japan,  South Korea and the U.S. on June 4 that the three countries  would hold close contact while the U.N. discusses measures.    The ministers reiterated that China's role in defusing the  nuclear crisis is important, saying they must urge China not to  use its veto when the Security Council votes on sanctions.    Kakizawa told Han he will urge China to play an active role  in settling the nuclear dispute when he visits China on Sunday.    In Beijing, Kakizawa is expected to ask Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen for China's support for a resolution by  the Security Council against Pyongyang.    China has repeatedly expressed hope that the North Korean  nuclear crisis could be resolved through negotiations.    Kakizawa also held a meeting the same day with South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam, in which Kim said relatively lengthy  U.N. Security Council discussions on sanctions against North  Korea may help Pyongyang return to the negotiating table, the  officials said.    Kim called such discussions a meaningful process for urging  North Korea to make its nuclear program more transparent, they  said.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Emu doomed to failure without political union, says Tietmeyer A STRONG warning that European monetary union could be 'doomed to failure' unless it was coupled with continent-wide political union was given yesterday by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the German Bundesbank. 'Further progress towards political union is probably indispensable for the lasting success of monetary union,' he told a German chamber of commerce lunch. There was a risk Europe could 'take a step backwards' unless politicians widened horizons towards extending the Maastricht Treaty fully to the political sphere. He stressed the importance of a 'common basis' of economic and fiscal policies to make the plan work properly to move to a single currency by the end of the 1990s. Mr Tietmeyer rejected drawing up the list of countries to participate in Emu on anything else except stringent economic criteria. There could be 'no political assessment' of the eligibility of countries to join when the first decisions on Emu are taken in 1996, he said. Foreign holders of D-Marks would have to be assured that the new European currency would be at least as stable as the D-Mark. 'Absolute assurance is not possible in this world. For this you have to wait until heaven,' he said, but did not, however, indicate whether he expected to wait so long for Emu to be in place.</p>

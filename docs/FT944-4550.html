			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Rwanda aid given 'to criminals' Maj Gen Paul Kagame, Rwanda's vice-president, yesterday accused the international community of giving aid to 'the criminals who committed the genocide' in his country, in preference to the 'needy people' both inside Rwanda and in the refugee frontier camps. In a speech in London Gen Kagame said that whereas foreign troops had not come to protect people from genocide, there had been a massive flow of aid to refugee camps after several hundred thousand people fled across the frontiers into Tanzania, Zaire and Burundi. He said there was more need of this aid inside the country.</p>

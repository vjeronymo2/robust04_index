			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOTTI INDICTED IN 1985 MURDER OF CRIME BOSS;  </P> <P> MAFIA: PROSECUTORS SAY EVIDENCE AGAINST THE REPUTED MOB CZAR INCLUDES SECRETLY  TAPED CONVERSATIONS.  </P> <P> New Yorkers are calling it "The Godfather: Part IV" -- a real-life drama now  unfolding here that calls to mind the three-part Hollywood saga of the  fictional Corleone family.  </P> <P> In yet another attempt by authorities to nail reputed East Coast mob czar John  Gotti, federal prosecutors Wednesday charged the 50-year-old "Dapper Don" with  the 1985 murder of the man he allegedly succeeded as head of America's most  powerful organized crime family.  </P> <P> Gotti, a silver-haired, barrel-chested man with a penchant for expensive,  tailor-made suits and a flair for favorable publicity, has avoided conviction  so many times before that he has earned the nickname of "The Teflon Don" and  gained a reputation as something of a local folk hero.  </P> <P> But prosecutors seeking his conviction in this latest legal effort said that  their hopes are buoyed by the strength of the evidence they have amassed,  including key witnesses and secretly taped conversations between Gotti and his  henchmen.  </P> <P> "We feel it's a very strong case," U.S. Atty. Andrew J. Maloney of the Eastern  District of New York said at a news conference in the Brooklyn federal  courthouse to announce the indictment.  </P> <P> Once the trial begins, Maloney confidently predicted, the public will see Gotti  for what he really is. "He's a murderer, not a folk hero," Maloney said. "His  real job is boss of the most powerful crime family in this country."  </P> <P> The 23-page, double-spaced indictment charges Gotti with four murders, chief  among them the bloody slaying of Gambino family boss Paul Castellano in front  of a Manhattan steakhouse almost exactly four years ago.  </P> <P> Castellano's murder catapulted Gotti to power as head of the Gambino family,  the largest of New York's five organized crime families, and made him "boss of  all the bosses" for organized crime, law enforcement officials said.  </P> <P> The sweeping indictment, brought under federal anti-racketeering laws, also  charges Gotti with gambling, loan-sharking, obstruction of justice, tax evasion  and conspiracy to murder a fifth person.  </P> <P> Three other Gambino family members are named in the indictment. They were  identified as "consigliere" or counselor Salvatore (Sammy Bull) Gravano, 45,  and "underboss" Frank (Frankie Loc) Locascio, 58, both of whom serve as No. 2  men to Gotti, and "capo" or captain Thomas Gambino, 61, son of former boss  Carlo Gambino.  </P> <P> All three are charged with gambling and loan-sharking. In addition, Gravano is  charged with two murders, conspiracy to murder, solicitation to murder and  obstruction of justice, while Locascio is charged with conspiracy to murder,  obstruction of justice and aiding Gotti's alleged tax evasion.  </P> <P> "This is the first time we have taken down the entire hierarchy of an organized  crime family -- the boss, the underboss, the consigliere," said James Fox, head  of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York.  </P> <P> Bruce Cutler, Gotti's attorney, claimed that his client is the innocent victim  of a vendetta by law enforcement officials. Gotti has been tried and acquitted  three times before on either federal or state charges of racketeering and  assault.  </P> <P> "It's the same kind of crap that we dealt with in 1986 and 1987," Cutler said.  "The same kind of Mafia-madness nonsense that starts with a two-week blitz in  the newspapers. I know it's a vendetta. It's happened three times before."  </P> <P> During his last trial, Gotti captured media attention and the public fancy by  handing out $50 bills to the homeless outside the courthouse. They responded by  carrying large placards reading: "Free Gotti Now!"  </P> <P> The latest indictment is the culmination of a five-year investigation involving  federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> Gotti, Gravano and Locascio were arrested by FBI agents and New York City  police detectives about 7 p.m. Tuesday at Gotti's Manhattan hangout, the  Ravenite social club in Little Italy, authorities said.  </P> <P> Gambino was taken into custody at about the same time as he left the Garment  District office of his trucking company.  </P> <P> Gotti, who maintains that he is a salesman for a plumbing company and for a  firm that sells zippers and hangers to the garment industry, was carrying  $6,000 in cash at the time of his arrest, officials said.  </P> <P> Gotti pleaded innocent at his arraignment Wednesday afternoon before U.S.  District Judge I. Leo Glasser. Glasser ordered Gotti held without bail until  Monday, when Maloney is to present further evidence to support his claim that  Gotti is a danger to the community.  </P> <P> Gravano and Locascio also were ordered held without bail, but Gambino was  released on a $500,000 bond.  </P></p>

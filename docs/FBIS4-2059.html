			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 5 (CNA) -- Thanks to its outstanding  export performance in recent years, the information industry has  overtaken the electronics industry to become the backbone of  Taiwan's export business, sources said here Tuesday [5 April].    Taiwan's info product exports totaled nearly U.S.$10 bill on  last year, and the figure is expected to climb by 15 percent  this year, the semi official Information Industry Institute  said, adding that Taiwan is already the world's No. 1 producer  of several info products such as monitors and motherboards.    In contrast to the booming information industry, the once  flourishing electronics industry experienced a big decline in  exports last year.    Statistics made public by the Industrial Technology Research  Institute (ITRI) show that exports of consumer electronics  products dropped by 16.9 percent last year from 1992 to  U.S.$1.29 billion, with items such as electronic clocks and  watches, audio-visual equipment, video games, and calculators  posting the biggest falls.    However, imports of those items in 1993 surged by 5.7  percent  from a year ago to more than U.S.$1 billion, indicating that the  industrial upgrading by local manufacturers has fallen short of  the public's expectations, and that fierce competition from  Southeast Asian countries has strained the market, an ITRI  official said.    He said many local manufacturers of traditional, low-end  electronics products have been forced to relocate their  production sites overseas to cut down on costs, which is the  main factor behind the continuous decline in exports of those  items by Taiwan makers.    The manufacturers who have chosen to stay in Taiwan, he  said,  must start producing more value-added products in order to  survive, and need to spend more money on software development  rather than simply acting as manufacturers for foreign buyers.</p>

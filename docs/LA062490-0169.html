			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE TO CONSECRATE CONTROVERSIAL BASILICA IN IVORY COAST  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II will consecrate a controversial basilica in Ivory Coast and  give his blessing to a hospital that is to be built next to it at his request,  the Vatican said Saturday.  </P> <P> The Pope will stop in the West African country on Sept. 10, at the end of a  10-day African trip that will first take him to Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda,  papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said.  </P> <P> Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro, in Ivory Coast's capital, cost about $200  million, an expense that drew criticism in the poor country. Plans called for  it to be almost as big as St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Christendom's largest  church.  </P> <P> Last year, in a private audience with the Pope at the Vatican, President Felix  Houphouet-Boigny offered the Pope ownership of the church as a gift, Navarro  said.  </P> <P> "Accepting this donation, the Holy Father asked that the works carried out be  integrated with other projects of assistance and social nature on the property"  next to the church, Navarro added.  </P> <P> A hospital, planned to handle 300 to 400 outpatients a day, will be built next  to the church, and the Pope, along with consecrating the basilica, will bless  the cornerstone of the hospital, Navarro said.  </P> <P> Navarro said that an international foundation will be established to manage the  site, which the Catholic Church hopes will become a center of pilgrimage for  African Catholics.  </P></p>

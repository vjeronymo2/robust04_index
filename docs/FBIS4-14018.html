			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)--An official source in the  Ministry of Interior has stated that terrorist Tal'at Muhammad  Yasin Hammam, who was killed today, is considered the primary  leader who controlled the "Afghanistan Returnees" organization  and its military wing. He was sentenced to death in Case No.  24/1993 on military felony.    In a statement this evening, the source revealed that Hammam  was the primary source of instructions to implement terrorist  operations in the country and the supreme commander at the  domestic level. He was also the major link between the inside  and outside, since he was the primary source of financing for  terrorist schemes.    The source pointed out that Hammam received funds directly  from financing elements abroad and redistributed them among the  groups in charge of carrying out the operations in accordance  with a plan prepared in advance.    In his statement, the security source revealed that a  search of the terrorist's home yielded large amounts of local  and foreign currencies, long distance telephone cards, and  official documents ready for use in the various terrorist  operations.    The search also yielded some important documents on how to  make explosive and incendiary charges, including those used in  the assassination of Major General Ra'uf Khayrat, deputy chief  of the State Security Investigation in charge of religious  activity, in addition to charts of his residence in the Pyramids  area, the route he took, and the location selected for carrying  out the assassination.    A detailed list of the names and addresses of some banks and  companies targeted in previous operations and in the future was  also found in the terrorist's home.    The security source said in his statement that papers  containing detailed information about political, executive,  security, judicial, and media figures and detailed drawings of  their places of residence and the routes they traveled were also  discovered.    The State Security forces that stormed the place found a  German- made pistol with a loaded magazine, a facsimile machine  with a collection of messages faxed previously, and a detailed  list of the names and addresses of foreign news agencies and  newspapers, of their correspondents, and of some local  newspapers.    The security source pointed out that the killed terrorist's  movements confirmed that he was in charge of issuing statements  on behalf of terrorist organizations and sending them to several  news agencies abroad.    He added that the State Security forces also found a  collection of very important organizational papers, in addition  to ciphering terms and detailed information on some of the  companies that produce and export movie features and soap  operas. [passage omitted]    The source noted that the State Security Investigation  forces, assisted by the central security forces, have launched  synchronized search operations in 12 governorates, during which  58 active terrorist elements that took part in recent operations  were caught. They are being interrogated, he said.    The source added that the State Security service is  monitoring all the elements on which information indicating  involvement in terrorist operations have been obtained.</p>

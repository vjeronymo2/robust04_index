			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): New York buying lifts coffee A strong opening at New York's Coffee, Cocoa and Sugar Exchange helped to lift the London coffee futures market out of its pre-holiday lethargy yesterday. The November delivery position at the London Commodity Exchange leapt more than Dollars 130 in the afternoon as the transatlantic rise was fuelled by roaster buying. At the close it stood at Dollars 3,710 a tonne, up Dollars 157 on the day and Dollars 394 on the week. In late trading the New York December position was up 13.45 cents on the day at Dollars 2.11 1/4 a pound. A strong rally that added Dollars 257 to the LCE November price on Monday and Tuesday had petered out in mid-week as continuing speculator and trade buying was matched by technical selling and some trade liquidation. But concern over the dry weather persisting in Brazilian growing regions prevented the sellers from getting the upper hand. Selling was also discouraged by the publication on Thursday of German statistics agency FO Licht's latest assessment of the Brazilian crop situation. It cut its estimate of the 1995-96 crop, flowering for which was damaged by severe frosts in June and July, by 8.5m bags (60kg each) at 18m. New York traders attributed yesterday's dramatic rise to heavy investment fund and speculative buying as stop-loss buying orders were triggered by the December position's move above the 199.5-cent mark. 'There is clearly technical money coming into the market,' one told the Reuters news agency. But he cited fundamental justification for the rise. 'Why were we able to get to the stops?' he asked. 'Because there is increasing concern that the coffee trees in Brazil need rain now, not a month from now.' Another trader told Reuters that there appeared to be some short-covering in the market and suggested that more stop-loss buying might be triggered above 210 cents. Coffee's sudden break-out helped cocoa prices to end a lacklustre week on a more constructive note. 'There appears to be some sympathetic buying from coffee,' one New York trader said as the CSCE December position rose Dollars 21 to Dollars 1,432 a tonne in late trading yesterday. News that the main crop in Bahia, Brazil's main cocoa-producing state had been helped by favourable weather during the flowering period but was likely to suffer losses from Witch's Broom disease was largely discounted, he added. The LCE's November futures position gained Pounds 25 yesterday at Pounds 1,059 a tonne, but that was still Pounds 15 down on the week. At the London Metal Exchange most base metals contracts yesterday surrendered some of the gains they had registered earlier in the week as traders squared their books ahead of the long weekend. The exception was copper, which closed at Dollars 2,427.50 a tonne, up Dollars 13.50 on the day and Dollars 20 on the week, for three months delivery and then moved on to Dollars 2,445 in after hours trading. As with coffee, the buying began in New York and in thin conditions. It was later fed by speculative buying, Chinese interest, short- covering and stop-loss orders. 'There's no news,' one London dealer told Reuters. 'It looks like the aim of the initial push was to flush out the shorts and hit stops. . . The market is also anticipating (a rise in) fourth quarter demand.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium              -10,975  to  2,456,200 Aluminium alloy            -80  to  26,080 Copper                  +4,800  to  360,450 Lead                       -75  to  366,850 Nickel                      -6  to  138,186 Zinc                       -25  to  1,234,150 Tin                       +265  to  31,690  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

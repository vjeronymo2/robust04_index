			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Maks Khazin article: "Barannikov Versus Filatov. </F> Background to Former Russian Security Minister's Suit"]    [Text] The plaintiff did not show up for the first  session. I do not think he will appear for the second or for any  of the subsequent sessions -- however many there may be. But  the trial will take its course, because the reason for the  plaintiff's nonappearance is a very good one -- the jail  governor will not let him out.... Nonetheless, nobody has the  right to forbid even someone under arrest from using the legal  process to uphold his honor and dignity. V. Barannikov has  availed himself of this right. Yes, it is the very same man who  was formerly minister of internal affairs and subsequently  Russian security minister.    Just who defamed his honor and dignity so painfully that the  twice ex-minister -- who, judging by everything, will have by no  means the last place in the dock during the criminal trial  (which, you will agree, would seriously distract anyone from  worldly concerns) -- sufficiently for him to bring a civil suit?    It is clear from his statement that the suit was prompted by  the TV program "Moment of Truth," in which the interviewee --  Sergey Filatov, leader of the Russian Federation President's  Administration -- termed Barannikov's behavior "treachery,"  clearly claiming that he had "worked for two camps." It is  these expressions in quotation marks that the plaintiff is  seeking to refute through the courts.    Without in any way predetermining the court's ruling or  impinging on its prerogatives and powers, I would nonetheless  like to dwell initially on two purely formal points.    First, why was the defendant named as the "All-Union (?)  State Television and Radio Company"? What millennium are we  living in, Dear Friends? Where is that Union?    Second, why was presenter Andrey Karaulov named as a  defendant? After all, as is well known, he is an interviewer, he  asks questions -- he has no responsibility for the quality or  accuracy of the answers. Did he perhaps suggest the answers?  The plaintiff does not make this claim. Consequently, the  defendant is a man who listened (like millions of viewers) to  what the interviewee said. In Barannikov's opinion, this should  cost him dear. But more of that later....    We say notion of the fact that this is an attempt to rebut  not a widespread and allegedly inaccurate report, but an  assessment of someone's behavior -- a judgment that any citizen  is legally entitled to make. A patient, while not denying that  he had numerous symptoms of a certain disease, could with equal  success angrily contest the diagnosis reached by the doctor.  This is all the more pertinent as Barannikov does not dispute  the fact that he was indeed in a different "camp" during the  famous events.    But, I repeat, the courts will decide all this. S. Filatov  and A. Karaulov do not need my help or protection; their lawyers  are highly qualified and have repeatedly confirmed their  reputation as very experienced counsel.    But there is one aspect whose importance goes beyond this  particular case.    The law allows plaintiffs in cases of this sort to seek  compensation from defendants for the moral wrong done them,  setting the sum at their own discretion. And it is envisaged  that people concerned about their reputation will not be  unrealistic and that they have two true friends -- logic and  common sense.    How much do you think V. Barannikov wants for this  "dishonor"? Don't be shy, let's talk big money, using the  minimum wage as the starting point -- 100,000, 200,000, 500,000?  Wrong. Surely not a million? Wrong again. How much then? One  hundred million. Per person. A total of 200 million.    Well, I could understand if the suit were against some  commercial structure -- best of all foreign -- with the ability  to invite the wives of high-ranking law enforcement officers to  Switzerland at its own expense, put them up in a swanky hotel,  and pay for them to visit jewelry and fur stores.  (Incidentally, there is no information from Barannikov or  Dunayev to refute this report). The firm could stand it. But,  even if we seriously suppose that the courts find for the  plaintiff, how can two, albeit presumably highly paid, state  servants be expected to come up with this much?    The fact is that nobody expects them to. It is no more than  a bold gesture. And no allowances should be made for the  stressful situation in which the plaintiff finds himself, or for  his being unaccustomed to this situation and the prison regime.  Another court is hearing a suit brought by his nearby cellmate,  former Vice President A. Rutskoy. This suit is again for 200  million, but it was brought by him, before his arrest, from the  unstressful quiet of his own office.    I have written about this too (IZVESTIYA No. 197 of 15  October): These absurd lawsuits against the mass media emerge  because the plaintiffs have been relieved of the necessity to  pay the state's costs. Any other plaintiff seeking more than  1,000 rubles [R] through the courts is obliged to pay 15 percent  of the sum sought before the trial starts. Otherwise the judge  will not accept the suit. Incidentally, there has been a  proposal to extend this procedure by presidential edict to  defamation cases as well.    Doctor of Juridical Sciences Professor I. Noy, a well-known  academic, replied to the previous article. He too agrees that  the situation is abnormal, but proposes a simpler solution --  abolishing Paragraph 11 of Russian Federation Supreme Soviet  Decree No. 11 of 18 August 1992 "On Certain Issues Arising  During Court Hearings of Defamation Cases Against Citizens and  Organizations." Indeed, this paragraph allows the courts to seek  state costs under such cases only in the amount of...R10. I.  Noy believes that the law "On State Costs" has been wrongly  interpreted in this instance.    Changing the existing procedure would have no impact on the  right of citizens and corporations to uphold their honor,  dignity, and business reputation. But it is these nonmaterial  categories that will take priority in attempts to bring court  cases. The desire on this basis to win a couple of hundred  million (or simply to scare people) should, in our view, incur a  natural commercial risk.</p>

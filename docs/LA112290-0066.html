			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TUNING IN THE SPIRIT;  </P> <P> LIKE A GARRULOUS PATRIARCH, TELEVISION NOW PRESIDES AT MOST HOLIDAY GATHERINGS  </P> <P> Ah, holiday memories.  </P> <P> Remember the year we couldn't afford a turkey, so Pa had to go out and shoot  one?  </P> <P> Or was that the Thanksgiving we visited "The Waltons"?  </P> <P> Then there was the time those children got sick on Christmas Eve, so we all  gathered at the orphanage and sang carols.  </P> <P> Or was that the Christmas we spent with "Doogie Howser, M.D."?  </P> <P> And what about that New Year's Eve we all got together and blew up the cruise  ship that was holding Father Time hostage? Or was that "The A Team"? "Ozzie and  Harriet"?  </P> <P> Like much in our culture, American holiday traditions have become inextricably  entangled with their televised versions. From the moment Grandpa clicks on the  Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade till a bleary-eyed Aunt Ethel passes out during  the Rose Bowl wrap-up, the American family is bombarded with video images of  jive-talkin' turkeys and sincere sitcom Santas. Between today and the first of  the year, the networks will broadcast an estimated 743,000 football games, and  everyone from the New Kids on the Block to Dolly Parton will assault the nation  with good cheer.  </P> <P> So pervasive is this saturation, that holiday rituals themselves have changed;  in some cases TV has become the ritual. And that's not always so merry and  bright.  </P> <P> The Zemlicka family of Manhattan Beach began a new holiday rite several years  ago. Now, each Thanksgiving morning, Kellie Zemlicka gives her husband, Brian,  a card that celebrates this meaningful new tradition.  </P> <P> The card depicts a Thanksgiving table. At one end, a woman sits eating turkey.  At the other, a man wearing a football helmet stares at a small television.  </P> <P> On the other hand, some of Kevin Aucello's fondest holiday moments radiate from  the electronic hearth. "At Christmas, you're so psyched by all the shopping,  all the wonder, all the products -- and TV shows are a part of that. They get  you into the mood for all the good feelings."  </P> <P> When he returns to his hometown in Florida this Christmas, he and his family  will probably gather to watch "Miracle on 34th Street" or "Babes in Toyland."  But the "big three" events of the holiday season remain "Rudolf the Red-Nosed  Reindeer," "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas," and "Frosty," the 31-year old San  Diego banker says.  </P> <P> And since he doesn't go home until Christmas week, he has had to modify his  holiday ritual a bit. "Now I call up one of my buddies and say, 'Rudolf's' on  tonight. What are you doing?.' "  </P> <P> The TV set has become as integral as the Thanksgiving turkey or the Christmas  tree to America's holiday season.  </P> <P> "Television does not reflect culture any more, it is our culture. It's at the  center of everything we do," says Neil Postman, author of "Amusing Ourselves to  Death" and chair of the Department of Communications at New York University.  "Every tradition, every icon, every personage that is central to the culture  really comes to us through television now, and television, of course,  transforms them in the process."  </P> <P> That's what happens in the current film "Avalon," which follows a large  inter-generational family of immigrants over the course of several decades.  </P> <P> As the movie unfolds, the family celebrates three Thanksgiving dinners,  separated by untold years. The first scene, before television, is a cacophony  of family chatter, laughter, and the sort of storytelling that binds people  with a shared mythology. At the second Thanksgiving, some years later, a  television flickers in the living room as the huge clan, already beginning to  unravel, shares its meal in the dining room.  </P> <P> And at the third dinner, the cluster of cousins and aunts and nephews and  grandparents that once held regular family circle meetings has disintegrated,  and a lone young couple and their children silently eat Thanksgiving dinner on  TV trays, transfixed by a glowing television screen.  </P> <P> Family therapists who have seen that scene find it rich with significance. But  none is willing to point the finger directly at television as a holiday  home-wrecker. Nor are most families.  </P> <P> "In my family, if there's a holiday meal, and say, the Rose Bowl game is on,  it's a tossup as to whether to eat around the table or eat in the family room  and watch the game," says Kenneth Sereno, an associate professor of  communications at USC, and an expert on family communication.  </P> <P> That contrasts sharply with the holiday meals Sereno, 55, recalls from his  childhood. Back then, the family, like the family in "Avalon," would converse  and share stories.  </P> <P> "But I didn't think we had much sparkling conversation. We ate, and there was  routine small talk. It wasn't particularly exciting."  </P> <P> Bill Schreiner, a Mt. Washington screenwriter and former director of the  Groundlings improvisational troupe, has seen television change the dynamics of  his large Catholic family. But not necessarily for the worse.  </P> <P> Each holiday season, he and his wife Dana and their son join his parents and  his seven brothers and sisters and their spouses and their children at the  family home in Virginia.  </P> <P> "It used to be that the big dinners, Thanksgiving, and all those holidays were  very much oriented around traditional things: Thinking back over the year,  discussing accomplishments. . . , " he says.  </P> <P> The one family ritual that hasn't changed is Christmas Eve. The Schreiners  still attend midnight Mass en masse, and then return home to sing Christmas  carols around a fire.  </P> <P> But when his father retired from his practice as a physician, he also retired  his lifelong disgust with televised football. Now "the holiday season is  oriented around what the NFL teams are doing that day," Schreiner says.  </P> <P> But that doesn't bother Schreiner, even though he isn't a big football fan.  Because at least it gives the family another reason to congregate. "That  ballgame is going to be watched come hell or high water, and if you want to  hang with the gang, you've gotta watch. It hasn't really displaced anything in  our holiday proceedings, it's a new event," Schreiner says.  </P> <P> But some observers lament the passing of un-mediated traditions.  </P> <P> Historically, virtually every human tribe would gather around the campfire at  important moments to sing and dance and tell stories, says Michael Real, chair  of the Department of Telecommunications and Film at San Diego State University.  These gatherings allowed them to feel each other's presence and share what the  particular event was about -- whether it was preparing for battle or the  harvest or a religious holiday.  </P> <P> Now, at traditional holidays -- and created ones such as the Super Bowl --  folks gather around their surrogate fires in huge numbers, Real says. But while  that experience may create a sense of mass solidarity, it doesn't foster deep  connections between people, nor does it instill the same rich mythology.  </P> <P> In his book "Prime Time Society," University of Michigan anthropologist Conrad  Kottak examines the way the rise of television can change the way a society  celebrates holidays -- in one example, the way Brazil celebrates Christmas.  </P> <P> There, as here, Kottak found, television's effects are "comparable to those of  humanity's most powerful institutions -- family, church, state, and education."  </P> <P> In Brazil, Christmas was traditionally an intimate religious holiday,  celebrated locally and without much razzmatazz. Since television spread into  the majority of households, though, Christmas has become a national event --  "an occasion for spending large sums of money on gifts and feasting," Kottak  writes.  </P> <P> And while sales statistics suggest that this new tradition has made Brazil's  retailers jolly, older citizens lament the loss of more private rituals.  </P> <P> The motivations behind the ho-ho-hoopla are easy to guess, however. "It is  easier for manufacturers to plan products to appear at a particular season than  to stagger production and distribution," Kottak writes. Also, "fads, which  stimulate sales, are easier to sustain for a few weeks than a year."  </P> <P> So it's little wonder that instead of menorahs and mangers, Brazilian families  now encounter popular Christmas icons each time they turn a channel --  including one department store's team of Santas, who fan the holiday spirit by  clapping wildly and bounding around on trampolines.  </P> <P> Sound familiar?  </P> <P> In America, says Postman, "There still exist family and regional traditions  that have little to do with television, but they're increasingly on the  periphery of the culture. The main events occur on television. Television  really gives us the images of what Thanksgiving and Christmas should be like.  It tells us what we should eat, what we should wear, if we should sing songs.  It defines what family means."  </P> <P> In the United States, the pervasive media celebration has sandblasted away the  finer edges of families' unique rituals. One often-cited example is the Jewish  holiday of Hanukkah. Historically a relatively low-key event, it is  increasingly accompanied by distinctly Christmas-like hype and fanfare.  </P> <P> In a country as ethnically diverse as the United States, this homogenization is  troublesome, says Janine Roberts, associate professor of family therapy at the  University of Massachusetts. Most cultures have a unique way to mark the winter  solstice, for example. Yet some of her clients, including immigrants from  Puerto Rico and Vietnam, complain that the televised flurry of American holiday  images excludes their less mainstream traditions and obliterates the quiet  power of old-fashioned storytelling. Children in particular, begin to doubt the  validity of their heritage.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, all the ersatz warmth and good will emanating from the set can  injure more than a family's aesthetic sensibilities, some therapists warn.  "Holiday blues," for instance, can be triggered or exacerbated by all those  perfect families laughing and singing and sharing expensive gifts on the tube.  </P> <P> Dysfunctional families, lonely widows, divorced men, just about anyone who  doesn't have a Cosby Christmas can "feel like like they're pressing their nose  against the glass, looking at a life they can't share," says John Murray, the  head of the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Kansas State  University.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Thoman, executive director of the Center for Media and Values at USC,  suggests that families turn the tables on their television, using a video  camera to record their family rituals in the form of a story, rather than  letting the tube dictate their holiday rites.  </P> <P> She also advises families that watch commercial television to "Be picky. Don't  let it dominate the whole day like video wallpaper." And finally, she suggests  that the family use the holiday season to examine and challenge the  commercialism and materialism with which the media indoctrinate them  year-round. "Don't just be recipients of the messages that we're nothing unless  we have something else."  </P> <P> In America, the television "has become a member of the family that has to be  dealt with like any other member," she says. Most people, however, never  acknowledge the new member, let alone examine how it affects them. "We'd like  to see people take advantage of this new member of the family, and encourage it  to be disciplined."  </P> <P> Oddly enough, there are an increasing number of Baby-Boom types who seem ready  to pull the plug on their television-tied holiday traditions.  </P> <P> In the '50s and '60s, "people were into streamlining everything," including the  holidays, says Maureen O'Hara, a San Diego-area family therapist. Parents  didn't have time to pass on recipes for plum pudding, or to teach the proper  way to make Christmas wreaths.  </P> <P> But now, O'Hara frequently encounters people of Baby Boom age and younger, who  are eager to recapture those old pre-TV recipes and rituals.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the young families tend to botch things a bit, she says. It's  not really their fault, though.  </P> <P> If sister's singing around the Christmas tree has the odd inflections of a  young Susan Dey, if decorating the tree evokes images of Hoss and Adam and  Little Joe; if a heartfelt gift exchange resonates with the Dick Van Dyke  Christmas scenes in "thirtysomething," it's no coincidence.  </P> <P> Lacking the storytelling rituals that transferred information through  generations, today's families get their nostalgia for pre-TV holiday  traditions, as well as their information concepts of what those traditions  should be, from their newest but most trusted family member: the television.  </P></p>

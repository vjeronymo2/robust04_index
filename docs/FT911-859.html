			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Observer: Spoken for Aptly named Larry Speakes, who put his own words into Ronald Reagan's mouth while serving as the US president's chief spokesman, has found a new job that will carry his voice to British ears. He is to be communications vice-president of Canadian telephone-equipment group Northern Telecom, which lately bought control of STC. Little has been heard of him in the three years since he quit as public relations chief at Merrill Lynch amid a fuss over his book, Speaking Out, in which he admitted occasionally inventing Reaganisms. One came in 1985 when, feeling the president was being upstaged by Mikhail Gorbachev in their summit meeting, Speakes spread the myth that Reagan had told the Soviet leader: 'There is much that divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are talking here together.' Speakes later acknowledged he was wrong 'to take such liberties'. Northern Telecom, for one, has clearly forgiven him. Its chairman, Paul Stern, says his new mouthpiece is an experienced professional who will be 'a real asset'.</p>

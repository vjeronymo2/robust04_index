On January 4-5 he had  talks there with Serbia's Minister of Transport Zarko Katic,  Yugoslavia's Minister of Transport Blagoje Lucic and Serbia's  Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic. They agreed on the  technicalities concerning the transit carriage by road of  Bulgarian goods across Serbia which was allowed by the UN  Sanctions Committee in late November 1993.    "We discussed the details of organization and the conditions  for transit transportation and the necessity of monitors and  people escorting the trucks," Mr. Ermenkov said. Bulgarian  goods will be carried only in convoys of ten to fifteen sealed  trucks, and up to two convoys a day will be allowed to transit  Serbia. There will be an escort in each trucks, and trucks will  be weighed on crossing into Serbia and on arrival in Hungary.  The border check points of entry and exit will be notified  electronically.    Only goods allowed by the UN Sanctions Committee will be  carried: Meat and meat preparations, agricultural produce and  medicines. Serbia will charge 50 percent of the road and highway  tolls specified in the bilateral agreement for the transit  traffic. This percentage may be reduced further, as both  countries wish to increase the traffic across Serbia, the  minister of transport said.    Serbia was given a list of the monitors, employed by the  state-owned road hauler So Mat. Representatives of the Union of  Private Carriers and the State Automobile Inspectorate will be  added to the list in the coming days.    A resumption of rail transportation through Yugoslavia was  also on the agenda, Mr. Ermenkov said.    Mr. Ermenkov would not commit himself to predictions about  the effect of the special corridor on the Bulgarian economy. He  does not doubt, however, that the losses caused by the embargo  against Serbia and Montenegro will be decreased.</p>

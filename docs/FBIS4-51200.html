			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "State Grants Broader Powers to Tax </F> Collectors"]    [Text] Tax collectors have been empowered to improve their  role in the country's market-oriented restructuring.    The State Council gave final approval for a programme  spelling out more specifically what tax collectors can do to  gather revenues, the State Administration of Taxation said.    The State Council, China's cabinet, wants tax collectors to  have broader authority in order to increase State revenue and  better regulate the market economy.    Tax collectors are also asked to foster a growing sense of  tax obligations among the public.    Although the country's tax revenues registered steady growth  in recent years, tax collectors still struggle with tax evaders,  among them both enterprises and individuals.    The administration seeks to speed up tax collection and help  sustain fast and healthy development of the national economy.    The administration will increase its involvement in drafting  tax laws, regulations and detailed rules, and studying,  improving and implementing the tax reform programme.    The changes are also expected to strengthen the role of  taxation in carrying out national industrial policies,  readjusting the economic structure, and more rationally  allocating resources to ensure fair competition.    The goal is to establish a standardized and more rational  tax  collection system.    By the end of February, the country's industrial and  commercial tax revenue increased 32.2 per cent from the  corresponding period of last year.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Bayer pre-tax profits decline BAYER, the least recession-prone of the three German chemical giants, yesterday reported a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to DM880m (Dollars 517.6m) for the first quarter of 1991. Turnover fell by 2 per cent, although Polysar, the Canadian rubber company which Bayer bought for Dollars 1bn last year, was included in the group figures for the first time. Bayer is partially protected from the recession by its large and highly profitable pharmaceuticals business, which increased turnover by 8 per cent. 'Our performance was still hampered by the recession in the US and UK and by the economic slowdown in Europe, which is gaining momentum,' said Mr Hermann Strenger, Bayer chairman. Apart from health care, all parts of Bayer suffered from the slow-down in business. Industrial products were worst hit, with a 14 per cent fall in sales (Bayer does not break down quarterly profits by sector). Looking forward to the rest of the year, Mr Strenger said: 'There are some positive factors that give us confidence and encouragement, even though the economic climate has worsened.' Bayer would benefit from the strengthening of the US dollar against the D-Mark during April and from the low prices of petro-chemical raw materials, he said. Profits for the whole year might be close to the 1990 level of DM3.4bn, if the dollar did not weaken again. Mr Strenger took the occasion of Bayer's financial press conference yesterday to issue his strongest warning so far against 'the avalanche of costs bearing down on us' as a result of recent and proposed environmental legislation in Germany.</p>

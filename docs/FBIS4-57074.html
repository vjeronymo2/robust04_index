			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Real Expectations"] </F>   [Text] To what extent is an economic plan that depends on  fiscal austerity, and which is crumbling away because of the  congressional delay in approving the 1994 federal budget, solid?  How can this plan be implemented when no progress has been made  in the constitutional revision process concerning tax reforms  and the streamlining of the state, and when expenditures  continue to be greater than revenues?    These doubts, which have overwhelmed economic agents and  have  provoked two days of sharp declines in the Rio de Janeiro and  Sao Paulo stock markets, were only temporarily dispelled  yesterday when Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero announced that  the date and details for the implementation of the real will be  announced on 9 May.    JORNAL DO BRASIL has published a study by economist Eduardo  Felipe Ohana, former deputy secretary in the Finance Ministry  and an expert in public finances, who has shown that it will not  be possible to obtain a budget surplus this year, despite former  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's assurance that a  budget surplus would be guaranteed by the economic stabilization  and deindexation plan, through the creation of the real.    According to Ohana, the 1994 draft budget that was just  submitted to Congress will not yield the expected $7 billion  surplus but will, rather, result unexpectedly in a $15 billion  deficit. The reasons for this unexpected reversion of trends  are the excessive increase in personnel and health spending that  was transferred from the social security budget to the federal  budget, and the excessive growth in payments to federal  government employees and social security beneficiaries.    By contrast, economic deindexation and the reduction of  monthly inflation to virtually zero will do away with financial  speculation. Consequently, fiscal revenues from the IOF  [financial operations tax] and IPMF [provisional tax on  financial operations] will decline markedly. Ohana estimates  this drop, which was not duly measured by the formulators of the  budget, in $3.5 billion. To make things worse, the government  will have to adopt a tighter monetary policy, with high real  interest rates, to prevent a flight of savings toward  consumption from stimulating demand and from pushing prices in  reals upwards. This will put an additional burden on public  debt servicing.    Some economists, including some of those working for the  government, have conceded that the failure of the constitutional  revision process has jeopardized the possibility of eliminating  the deficit. Following the virtual deadlock of the proposed  constitutional changes in the economic area, which would entail  the revision by Congress of monopolies and the treatment of  foreign capital, no one believes in the possibility of  far-reaching reforms concerning tax laws, such as a redefinition  of the federal government's accord with states and  municipalities, or a reformulation of the bankrupt social  security system.    A redefinition of the size and functions of the state was  and  continues to be fundamental to eliminating the tax burden  Brazilian society would have to pay to maintain the public  sector in operation. From there on, it would also be possible  to make decisive progress in the privatization program, and the  proceeds obtained through the sale of properties considered to  be superfluous for the new Brazilian state could be used to  repay Treasury debts.    Because these premises appear to be no longer feasible, the  path for stabilization has become narrower and more dangerous.  Brazilian society is therefore anxiously waiting to hear  encouraging words from Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero when he  introduces the real on 9 May.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Irish rail strike looms over plan to modernise A national rail strike is looming in Ireland in a dispute over modernisation and working practices. The country's main rail union yesterday recommended that its members take strike action to protest against the plan. Irish Rail, the state-run rail company, is currently losing more than IPounds 70m (Pounds 68m) a year. Its management wants to introduce radical changes in outmoded working practices, introduce modern and more powerful locomotives and rolling stock, one-man train operations, and new ticketing and signalling systems. It is estimated that IPounds 800m needs to be spent on the Irish rail network to bring it up to modern EU standards. IPounds 275m is earmarked to be invested up to the end of the decade with the assistance of EU structural funds. Some three years of negotiations between management and unions have failed to produce an agreement, however, and the proposals finally put to the company's 5,000 staff were rejected by the majority of them last month. Last week, the company decided to push ahead with its plans and began suspending staff who refused to participate in training programmes for the introduction of new technology. Mr Tony Tobin, the senior negotiator for SIPTU, the main trade union involved in the dispute, blamed the management. 'We believe there is still ground to be made by sitting round the table, but management have not used all the labour relations machinery available.' A management spokesman acknowledged this was the case, but said: 'The last agreement took 18 months of talks. We have now sat through 14 Labour court conciliations and the proposals have been rejected by the unions. If we don't kick-start this programme, things will just drift and we could lose some of the European funds.' Staff were being balloted on a strike yesterday and the results are expected early next week. If approved, a stoppage would follow seven days later. Irish Rail carries 25m passengers a year and 3.3m tons of freight. In addition to disruptions for passengers, the principal cargoes that will be delayed by a strike are beer, cement, chemicals, mineral ores and concentrates and peat, around 85 per cent of which is import-export business.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Peace talks centre on new division of Bosnia LEADERS of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia yesterday met international mediators in a fresh attempt to work out a peace settlement, which everyone now recognises would entail substantial modifications to the Vance-Owen plan. Lord Owen and his fellow mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian foreign minister, met the three leaders - Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia - in a villa near Geneva for their first face-to-face meeting since the abortive peace plan agreed in Athens last month. The meeting is unlikely to produce an immediate solution, despite the risk of a new flare-up over the Serb-populated Krajina region of Croatia. At the weekend Krajina Serbs are likely to vote in a referendum to join an independent Bosnian Serb state. This risks triggering a Croatian military offensive to prevent such a development, unless Mr Milosevic and Mr Tudjman can agree their respective territorial ambitions. Mr Izetbegovic has refused  -publicly, at least  - to envisage giving up any land allocated to the Moslems by the Vance-Owen map. Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg, who has replaced Mr Cyrus Vance as the United Nations mediator, have been forced to admit that the original map dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces is no longer realistic. Apart from the new reality resulting from Serb conquests, the Vance-Owen plan has been undermined by the joint action plan agreed by the US, Russia, France, Britain and Spain in Washington last month, providing for the creation of six UN-protected Moslem enclaves. The Washington decision gave the impression that the main western countries had accepted Serb territorial gains and would not insist on a roll-back of Bosnian Serb forces to the Vance-Owen borders. That does not mean that the mediators are yet prepared to accept the demands of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who said before meeting Mr Milosevic yesterday that he would like to see Bosnia divided into three mini-states. Anxious to avoid accusations that they are prepared to reward the Bosnian Serbs for their aggression, Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg will not want to go as far as that. While reluctantly accepting that their map will have to be adjusted, they will insist that the Bosnian Serbs, who occupy 70 per cent of Bosnia, should give up a significant proportion of their territorial gains. Thousands of people yesterday were on the move towards Vares, central Bosnia, after the mostly Moslem Bosnian army seized control of nearby Kajanj. Sarajevo radio said Serbs intensified their shelling of Gorazde, the south-eastern Moslem enclave proclaimed a UN safe area. Unconfirmed reports said 17 people were killed in an overnight attack by besieging Serb forces. It accused the Serbs of sending in reinforcements and more heavy weaponry despite a renewed ceasefire pledge by their commander, General Ratko Mladic. Two teams of UN military observers last night were due to arrive in Gorazde as part of the ceasefire agreement.</p>

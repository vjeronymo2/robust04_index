			<p>BFN     [Text] Kourou, French Guiana, 17 Jun (AFP) -- The European  Ariane 64 rocket was successfully launched from the Kourou Space  Center in French Guiana at 0407 local (0707 GMT) this morning.  The rocket put into orbit three satellites, the large  Intelsat-702 of the International Satellite Telecommunications  Organization, Intelsat, and two British military experimental  satellites, 20 and 25 minutes after launch time. This success  erases the failure of Ariane 63's launch attempt on 24 January,  which grounded the Arianespace Corporation's rockets for nearly  five months.    A former attempt at launching Ariane 64 aborted on 4 June  because of a technical problem at the liftoff tower. One of the  holding arms failed to separate from the launcher's third stage,  and the computers prevented the rocket engines from firing up.    Placed in a geostationary transfer orbit, Intelsat-702,  which  weighs 3,695 kg and is the second satellite in Intelsat's  seventh generation, will fire up its engine in a few days, which  will put it in the apogee of its orbit and directly above the  Gulf of Guinea at longitude 1 degree west. The satellite will  thus be incorporated into the network of approximately 20  Intelsat satellites that handle most international  communications.    For Arianespace, this successful launch marks the resumption  of the flights suspended four months ago. The leaders of the  enterprise that markets the Ariane rockets throughout the world  hope to carry out 10 annual launches to win a bet that they can  make 30 such launchings before 1996.    The next launch is scheduled to be made on 8 July and  involves a U.S. satellite, Panamsat-2, and a Japanese satellite,  BS-3N. These launches are to be followed by those of the  Turksat-1B and Brazilsat-B1 satellites on 30 July. After  launching Ariane 64, Arianespace still has 39 satellites, worth  $3.1 billion, to be put in orbit.    Intelsat, headquartered in Washington, D.C., is the only  satellite telecommunications operator that covers the entire  planet. The corporation uses approximately 20 satellites in  orbit above the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.    SRTV-1A and SRTV-1B are two mini-satellites built by the  United Kingdom's Defence Research Agency (DRA) for the British  Defense Ministry. Those small 45-cm-wide, 45-cm-deep, and  47-cm-high cubes, which weigh 50 and 53 kg, are designed to  conduct several experiments over a 12-month span involving the  static charge on the satellite's outer surface, wear on new  materials, new solar cells, and cosmic radiation.</p>

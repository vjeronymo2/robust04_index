			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Iraq assures UN over Kuwait Iraq formally submitted a series of documents affirming its recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and the United Nations-designated border between them to the UN security council yesterday. Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, insisted that this justified an early lifting of the economic embargo, but a US spokesman said no change was in prospect as the result of the council's 60-day sanctions review period. He also linked Baghdad's belated concession to the firmness of the US and other council members in response to menacing Iraqi troop movements near the border last month. Before the US and Britain, which have veto power, will consider lifting sanctions Iraq must fulfil other obligations including the return of captured Kuwaiti armaments and property. There must also be total compliance with the UN commission charged with eliminating Iraq's nuclear, long-range missile,and chemical and biological capability. Mr Aziz's case has not been helped by information from American officials that funds have still been found to rebuild President Saddam Hussain's palace and other buildings at a cost of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 610m). Mr Aziz termed this 'rubbish'. Ms Madeleine Albright, US representative and council president, who received the documents from him, acknowledged that members would be very pleased. Iraq had finally done what the international community had long demanded. But continuing American scepticism was evident in the brevity and coolness of the meeting, which lasted barely two minutes and at which Mr Aziz was characterised as 'not his usual ebullient self'. For the occasion, Ms Albright wore a brooch in the form of a reptile on her plain blue dress. This was her response to the recent publication by an Iraqi newspaper of an unflattering poem in which she was called a snake.</p>

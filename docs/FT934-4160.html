			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Tracey still tops - Jazz A month away form his 67th birthday, pianist Stan Tracey is celebrating an eventful half century in music which began with the Ted Heath Orchestra and has only recently been rewarded with a 'major' recording contract (with the Blue Note label). Not that the pianist's teetering piano style and expansive big band writing has ever been hidden from view. Self-produced recordings (some recently re-released) which quickly became collectors' items, 21 commissioned suites commissioned for big occasions and a long stint as house pianist at Ronnie Scott's, followed by much touring, have all combined to keep Tracey at the top in British jazz - and always in the best possible company. The golden jubilee celebration held at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Tuesday featured, as a result, some of the country's best lived-in sounds (Alan Skidmore and Don Weller) as well as the freshest young talent (Guy Barder and Gerard Presencer) in exuberant duo, quartet, sextet, octet and flying big band formations. Kicking off the retrospective in a quartet alongside longtime partner Art Themen, bassist Dave Green and son Clark Tracey on drums, the leader ambled appropriately into Monk's 'I Mean You'. The pecking keyboard technique and crazy arpeggios owe much to Monk and the duo with young trumpet star Gerard Presencer on the late bebopper's 'Pannonica' which followed, was touching enough to attract an early encore. The Octet, which featured the sweet and sour tones of altoist Peter King and the gruff tenor of Don Weller, showed off Tracey's relaxed but purposeful accompaniment in samba-ish excerpts from the highly recommended Blue Note record Portraits Plus (BCDP 7806962). A tender solo reading of Duke Ellington's 'Sophisticated Lady', was greeted like an old friend and the 14 piece big band, swinging through the changes with sparks flying from the horns, made strong the connection with Ellington. There are not may jazz musicians who can write, lead and accompany with such understated inspiration. Back in the 1960s, Sonny Rollins, now noted for his use of slavish sidemen, was said to have been jolted by Tracey's angular accompaniment. Glad to say the prodding and percussive Tracey sound remains as idiosyncratically appealing as it is challenging 30 years on. Sponsored by Unison</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. State Department's annual report on human  rights in Cyprus for 1993 is not only incompatible with truth  and justice, but also with the supposed policy of the United  States for protection of human rights worldwide.    The above is stressed by the International Association for  Protection of Human Rights in Cyprus. The association adds:  The report ignores the decisions of the United Nations and  other international organizations regarding the Turkish invasion  and the illegal pseudostate. It also ignores the decisions of  the Council of Europe's Committee on Human Rights, which in 1976  and 1983 decided that Turkey was guilty of mass and continuous  violations of the Greek Cypriots' human rights in the occupied  part of Cyprus.    In substance, the association notes, the State Department's  report recognizes the division of Cyprus as permanent, gives  legal status to the Turkish Cypriot "administration" and  indulgence to the Turkish troops, deceives on basic issues and  distorts the facts against the Cypriot people. Especially on  the pseudostate, there is reference to "free elections" and  respect of "human rights."    The association also stresses that the report becomes even  more scandalous if one bears in mind that it follows similar  reports in past years, and the fact that the real events were  always very well known. The inaccuracies and distortions of  previous reports have been pointed out by a delegation of the  association to the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus in order to avoid a  repetition in future reports.</p>

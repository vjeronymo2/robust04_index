			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National News Hookup" or "Night News" program] </F>   [Text] The information center of the Second Session of the  Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and the Second Session  of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held a news conference  at the Great Hall of the People this morning. Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the State Council and concurrently minister of  foreign affairs, was invited to answer reporters' questions on  the international situation and China's foreign policy.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified XINHUA reporter] I am a  XINHUA reporter. I wish to ask Minister Qian: In Detroit the  day before yesterday, U.S. President Cinton expressed  disappointment over the results of Secretary of State  Christopher's visit to China. What is your view in this regard?  What is your estimation of the possibility of the U.S. granting  China most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment? Thanks.    [Qian Qichen] Concerning Secretary of State Christopher's  visit, I am also somewhat disappointed. Because it could have  made more achievements [cheng guo] as was expected. However,  now through this visit, we have reached a number of agreements.  We have still made some achievements, but the achievements are  not as many as expected. Meanwhile, regarding the MFN treatment  I think it should be said that if it can be maintained, it will  be good news to both China and the United States; otherwise, it  will be bad news for both countries.    [Unidentified reporter] My question is that following the  announcement of the joint communique of the Chinese and French  Governments, relations between the two countries have been  normalized. Not long ago, the French parliamentary speaker  visited China and it was learned that the French premier will  visit China next month. I wish to ask Vice Premier Qian what do  you think is the outlook for relations between China and France?    [Qian Qichen] In the Sino-French Joint Communique on  resuming normal relations between the two countries released on  12 January this year, the French Government promised that in the  future it will not plan to approve French enterprises' taking  part in arming Taiwan. The meaning is quite clear. Later, I  made an official visit to France. An important part of which  was to make preparations for Premier Balladur's visit to China.  Therefore, I am convinced that Premier Balladur's visit to  China is a major event in relations between the two countries.  It will have an important bearing on promoting bilateral  relations, including economic and trade relations. The visit  will take place in early April. [An international reporter  starts to ask question but is cut off by an unidentified  moderator] [end recording]    Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also answered reporters'  questions on Sino-British Relations and relations between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>

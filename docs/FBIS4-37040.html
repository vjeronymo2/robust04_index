			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Besharati's Visit to Turkey"] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister 'Ali Besharati-Jahromi is in  Ankara on a three-day official visit. His objective is to hold  talks on regional and international developments and political  and security matters between Iran and Turkey. In a statement  after his meeting with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, 'Ali  Besharati-Jahromi recalled the favorable relations between the  two countries and stressed that neither a security nor a  political problem exists between Iran and Turkey. He also  described the cooperation between the two countries on the  struggle against terrorism as a positive outcome of the  uninterrupted contacts between the officials in Tehran and  Ankara and outlined Iran's uneasiness over the activities of  certain anti-Iran elements in Turkey.    The situation in northern Iraq and the bearing it has on  security in the region was a focus of the talks 'Ali  Besharati-Jahromi had with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.    Iran and Turkey have established strong relations because of  their historic, religious, and cultural ties as two neighboring  countries. The cooperation between the two countries within the  framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization is a factor  that enhances their relations. Meanwhile, the meetings of the  Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee in Tehran and Ankara  constitute one of the results of the important agreements the  two countries have reached to promote their cooperation on  security matters. Iran's approach is based on the principle of  non-interference in the internal affairs of foreign countries.    'Ali Besharati-Jahromi stressed that the friendly relations  between Iran and Turkey are motivated by the concept of  good-neighborly relations and noted that Turkey's enemies have  no place in Iran. He also stressed that Tehran is well aware of  Turkey's problems and regards Turkey's foes as its own enemies.    The Iranian and Turkish officials had discussed the question  of peace and security on the common border between Iran and  Turkey and the developments in northern Iraq several times in  the past. Tehran and Ankara support the maintenance of Iraq's  territorial integrity. In view of that, the two sides call for  an urgent solution to the problems in northern Iraq. The  continuation of the clashes will further complicate the  situation and create instability in that region. A tripartite  meeting will be held on the matter in Damascus between Iran,  Turkey, and Syria. The outcome of the assessment of the  developments in Iraq will be very important.    Meanwhile, matters concerning relations between Iran and  Turkey will be discussed once again when President Suleyman  Demirel visits Tehran in July. The two countries are expected  to draw up an effective plan to strengthen their bilateral  cooperation in the near future.</p>

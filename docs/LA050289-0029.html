			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: RESEDA PLAYERS BARRED FOR PART IN BRAWL  </P> <P> Reseda High officials have barred three players from playing on the baseball  team following their participation in last week's game-ending brawl with Grant,  according to Reseda Coach Mike Stone.  </P> <P> Gone for the remainder of the season are senior left fielder Robert Gauteraux,  senior first baseman Ron Stricklin and junior center fielder Joey Tushnet.  </P> <P> All were starters and all were batting better than .300, led by Stricklin's  .404 average. Gauteraux was hitting .328 and Tushnet was batting .320.  </P> <P> Grant Coach Tom Lucero has so far taken no disciplinary action against his  players. City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness is reviewing reports on the  brawl that ended Tuesday's Valley Pac-8 Conference game after five innings.  Grant won, 13-1.  </P> <P> Harkness ordered the indefinite postponement of last Thursday's rematch between  the teams and may cancel the contest. He also has the option of barring players  who participated in the fight for the rest of the season.  </P> <P> Stone objects to what he calls an injustice in the punishment meted out so far.  </P> <P> "I stand by our administrators and I don't want to see any Grant kids kicked  off the team," he said. "But I'd like to see some balance, some equality. I  just want it known that we aren't the only ones punished. I'd really like to  see our kids back playing, but I don't think that is going to happen."  </P> <P> Rich Aude, a senior third baseman for Chatsworth High, has signed a letter of  intent to attend UC Santa Barbara in the fall.  </P> <P> Aude, a two-year varsity member, is batting .443 with five home runs -- both  team highs -- 28 runs batted in and 14 stolen bases.  </P> <P> Rob Samuelson, a senior outside hitter for Cal State Northridge, has been  selected to the All-Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. second team.  </P> <P> Samuelson, 6-foot-6, was third in the conference in kill average (6.36 per  game).  </P> <P> Northridge finished 11-20 overall and 5-15 in conference play.  </P></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie frets over funding pressures THERE WAS no let-up in the downward pressure on London's equity market, which moved significantly lower for the sixth consecutive trading session, still fretting over the massive PSBR funding programme needed this year, the prospect of big cash calls from companies and niggling worries about the UK Budget. Sentiment was given an additional blow very late in the session by reports that the Bundesbank had indicated that there was little scope for any early cuts in German interest rates. International markets had been expecting an early move by the Bundesbank to lower its Lombard and discount rates after the recent reduction in its Repo rates. The market was further shaken by news in the mid-afternoon of a substantial restructuring of Guinness's distilling interests which will lead to a charge of Pounds 125m in this year's figures. The day's economic news, detailing input and output prices for December, was said to have been in line with market expectations and failed to produce any substantial reaction in either the equity or foreign exchange markets. Dealers marked share prices higher at the outset of trading, reflecting the modest improvement on Wall Street overnight and hopes that five successive days of selling in UK equities could have left the market oversold. The first couple of hours of trading saw the FT-SE 100 Index edge higher to record a rise of around five points, with much of that coming from the pharmaceuticals sector. Here, Glaxo, with a significant weighting in the Footsie, made good early progress, as did SmithKline Beecham, another of the market's heavyweight stocks. Both were lifted by renewed heavy buying from domestic and overseas sources, although Glaxo later turned off sharply to end lower on balance amid worries about its Zantac anti-ulcer drug. There was little real impetus in the market upturn, however. Strong selling of the March Footsie future developed, upsetting the cash market. Thereafter, support for the market virtually evaporated and the FT-SE 100 gradually gave ground to touch the day's low point of 2,757.4, some 16 points off, before closing a net 15.5 down at 2,757.9. Over the past six trading days the index has fallen 103.6, or 3.6 per cent. The Footsie Mid 250 index was riddled with big losers and continued its recent steep decline, settling a further 10.7 lower at 2,879.2 for a three-day decline of 61.1, or 2.1 per cent. Turnover yesterday was a healthy 666.4m shares, continuing the strong run since the turn of the year. The 666.4m included exceptionally heavy activity totalling around 70m shares in the two classes of BT stock. Towards the end of the session some 36m of the fully-paid and 35m of the partly-paid changed hands amid hints of switching. Figures released by the Stock Exchange showed that the value of market turnover continued above the crucial Pounds 1bn level on Monday, when business worth Pounds 1.29bn was transacted. Some marketmakers continued to take the view that the market has now overreacted on the downside to worries about gilts funding, rights issues, the turbulent international situation and nervousness about the Budget. Others, however, maintain that the market was overbought on the prospect of big takeover bids.</p>

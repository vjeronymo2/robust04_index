			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sokol Terihati; passages within </F> quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] Sixty-eight strikers -- representatives of 24  villages with approximately 5,000 families from the Kukes and  Has districts -- today entered the fifth day of their hunger  strike. They are striking for economic reasons and because of  the extremely difficult situation created years ago by the  construction of the Fierze Hydroelectric Power Station. As a  result of the continuation of the strike, the strikers' health  is deteriorating. So far two have been taken to the city  hospital, while four others are receiving medical treatment in  the hall where the strike is being staged. Jahir Trota, strike  committee chairman, told television the following:    [Trota] "Our demands are for annual rent for the land on  which the Fierze Hydroelectric Power Station stands; financial  compensation for the flooded areas rather than securities;  compensation for the value of the houses, which has been denied  us; money for the fruit trees and other real estate property  created with our labor; the organized evacuation of part of the  population, which is at a subsistence level; assistance with  long-term credits facilitating conditions for new buildings; the  purchase of buildings; and the development of private  enterprise."    Deputy Chairman Hakik Sopi had this to say:    [Sopi] ``The Fierze lake has taken away our land. Under  conditions of a market economy, we have no land today. Land is  the most sacred thing for every citizen and nation. We are  forced to see people in a miserable economic situation with no  bread when they all used to work for state enterprises, which  have now been privatized. We were an agricultural enterprise.  The agricultural cooperatives took the land that we had before,  so we are left without. Worst hit are the villages of Gosil,  Kenete, Rahac, Kukes, and Drinas. The land that has remained  does not even have any olive trees. In the forest, you cannot  even keep one cow. The land has been open for agriculture.    ``We ask that during these days and without delay, the  government should meet and decide on the fate of 30,000  inhabitants, how they are to survive, as well as issue a  government decision to consider the views of our  representatives, our association leaders, who are present  there.''    We also interviewed Faik Kastrati, representative of Has  district:    [Kastrati] "Our vital problem is economic, because under  current conditions there is no way for us to live. In general,  the Kukes and Has areas are isolated in several respects, but  mainly economically, and we are suffering every day and our  wishes are impossible to realize. We have persistently been  putting forward these points, which are now publicly known, and  ask that they be satisfied in every respect. Otherwise, we are  at a very critical stage of survival."    [Unidentified striker] "We ask that the government helps us.  We are 20 families who are now living in Kamez, in Tirana. I  have 10 children. I am living in a hut in Kamez, with no water,  no electricity, nothing. No one knows how our days have passed  and will pass. That is why I am asking the government and all  the state bodies to solve these problems of the strikers,  regarding the life of the children, as our children are in such  difficult conditions that they cannot live."    For the hunger strike to end, the strikers want the  government to make some decisions, accept their demands, and  release three representatives of the association that represents  the interests of the inhabitants of these areas.</p>

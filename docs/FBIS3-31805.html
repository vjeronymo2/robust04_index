			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "There Would Not Be a Cleanup"] </F>   [Text] The foreign policy strategies of the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] can be brought into harmony but further consultations  are needed on certain issues, the two parties' representatives  announced after their foreign policy consultations on 22  February.    As [Fidesz deputy] Jozsef Szajer and [SZDSZ deputy] Istvan  Szent-Ivanyi said, at the meeting they had mainly discussed  European affairs and security problems, and exchanged their  views on what kind of foreign affairs structure the two parties  would form if they both came to government. There is no dispute  about the country's orientation between the two liberal parties,  they said; both organizations consider early European Union [EU]  and NATO membership their fundamental goal. In connection with  this, the participants of the meeting thought that the Hungarian  Socialist Party's [MSZP] NATO policy is not unequivocal but,  according to Szajer, downright "confusing." The Fidesz would  not consider it a campaign measure if the government submitted a  formal request for EU membership in the coming weeks. However,  the SZDSZ considered it important to hold prior inter-party  consultation on this issue.    The liberals find the establishment of a unified foreign  affairs management desirable. Accordingly, they would wind up  the Ministry of International Economic Relations, in spite of  the fact that this would not mean budget savings in the short  term. In their view, it is important that the diplomatic body  develops in the direction of public service. If they come to  power, the liberals envisage 10 to 15 appointments in the  foreign affairs leadership and the same number in ambassadorial  positions. They do not want to perform a political cleanup in  the Foreign Ministry's staff; the professionalism and loyalty  that can be expected from public service employees will be the  basic criteria in assessing diplomats.</p>

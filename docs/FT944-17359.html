			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Brazil rain hits coffee futures Coffee prices tumbled at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday as reports of rain in Brazilian growing areas 'spooked' speculators holding long positions. The market had been set up for a big fall by an overnight plunge in New York prices. That had been factored into London values by the midday close, when the January position was quoted at Dollars 3,675 a tonne, down Dollars 168, traders told the Reuters news agency. But the sellers were not yet done. As New York prices fell still further in early business LCE futures followed suit, and with more rain reported in Brazil the close the January price was down at the close to Dollars 3,523 a tonne, having lost Dollars 320 on the day and Dollars 332 on the week. At one stage it dipped to a six-week low of Dollars 3,499 a tonne. 'There has been a lot of nervousness and people do tend to panic a little when they have seen the rain,' one trader explained. 'If we see more rain over the weekend, we will come in Monday and be under pressure again.' At the London Metal Exchange copper and zinc values lost ground yesterday. But the relatively modest declines, which dealers attributed chiefly to profit-taking, left them both with net rises on the week. Copper prices began on Tuesday to claw back the heavy falls suffered late last week after an earlier strong advance boiled over. At yesterday's close the three months delivery position stood at Dollars 2,535 a tonne a tonne, up Dollars 44.50 overall but Dollars 43 short of last week's 3 3/4 -year high. Scarcity of supplies available for immediate delivery kept the cash quotation at a premium to three months. The three months price had peaked at Dollars 2,542 a tonne early in the day after the announcement of a big fall in LME warehouse stocks. But that had been widely expected and the price slipped back to Dollars 2,524 before buyers were tempted back into the market in any numbers. The sellers regained the upper hand, however, once the afternoon ring was over. In after hours trading the price was hovering only a few dollars above Dollars 2,500 a tonne. 'The market is still nervous after last week's sell-off and it still fears a further wave of investor liquidation,' a trader told Reuters. The zinc market has been lagging the other LME metals for most of this year as continuing overproduction and, therefore, rising stocks have weighed down sentiment. But this week the investment funds that have been so influential in the recent strength of the copper and aluminium markets appeared to decide that it was time for this metal to benefit from their ministrations. A sharp price jump in mid-week was trimmed back slightly yesterday following another rise, though a relatively modest one, in LME stocks, but at the close the three months quotation was still showing a Dollars 40.25 rise on the week at Dollars 1,069.75 a tonne. Dealers suggested that the market was poised for further gains to push it past the 20-month high reached on Thursday. Aluminium prices meanwhile headed back towards their recent highs, encouraged by European merchant demand. The three months afternoon ring close of Dollars 1,651.25 a tonne yesterday, near the day's high, was up Dollars 3.75 on the day and Dollars 33.75 on the week. But the price edged back below Dollars 1,650 in after hours trading. Fears of US interest rate rises put the gold price under pressure early yesterday. But supported at Dollars 392 a troy ounce held once again.  ------------------------------------------             LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------------ (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------ Aluminium            -24,950 to 2,267,800 Aluminium alloy       unchgd at    25,560 Copper               -12,000 to   347,375 Lead                  -1,575 to   368,750 Nickel                +1,392 to   146,352 Zinc                  +4,350 to 1,237,250 Tin                      +50 to    32,185  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Strong demand pushes car output up 9.9% UK car production increased by 9.9 per cent year-on-year in November, as output for the domestic market rose strongly and offset the decline in production for export markets. Both car output and new-car sales are forecast to achieve further growth next year, with increases of 7 per cent and 6 per cent. Car production in the first 11 months of the year was 1,288,594 - 7.7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1992 and in contrast to the steep fall in output in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Car output for export markets has fallen by 6.4 per cent in the first 11 months of this year to 500,817, but this has been compensated for by a 19.1 per cent surge in production for the home market to 787,777. The UK has been virtually the only new-car market in western Europe where demand has been growing significantly this year. New-car sales in Britain in the first 11 months rose by 12.6 per cent in contrast to an overall fall of nearly 15 per cent in the whole of western Europe. According to forecasts by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders UK car production will rise again next year by about 7 per cent to 1.46m from 1.36m this year. Sales of new cars are forecast to rise by about 6 per cent to 1.86m from 1.77m in 1993. Car production in November totalled 128,401 compared with 116,799 a year ago, according to figures released by the society. Output for the home market in November rose by 77 per cent to 76,841, while production for export markets fell by 30 per cent to 51,560. Car output in the month was boosted by rising production from the Rover group, Jaguar and IBC Vehicles and increased production and from the UK plants of Japanese carmakers Toyota and Honda. The improvement has been helped by the UK industry's leading presence in the production of four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicles. The leading producers in this sector are Land Rover, part of the Rover group, and IBC Vehicles, a 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu which produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. Leisure/utility vehicles continued to gain market share, at the expense of sales of conventional passenger cars. The higher level of car output in November was achieved in spite of short-time working by some manufacturers, including Nissan, Vauxhall and Ford. Commercial-vehicle output rose by 14.3 per cent in November to 21,914, the first monthly year-on-year increase since January. In the first 11 months output in this sector was still 22 per cent lower than a year earlier at 182,144.</p>

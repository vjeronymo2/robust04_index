			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MAISKY WITH L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> Mischa Maisky is a swashbuckler of a cellist. A compact, bearded man in a shiny  gray shirt, he played Haydn's Concerto in C -- with the Los Angeles Chamber  Orchestra at Ambassador Auditorium Thursday -- with an aggressive intensity  little short of ferocity. Not exactly a stylistic marriage made in any purist's  heaven, but it proved undeniably exciting.  </P> <P> That was made immediately clear with his gruff, big-toned, heavily accented  entrance. Maisky is capable of a pointed lyricism, though it seems more a  calculated contrast than a natural effusion.  </P> <P> The excitement level climbed precipitously in the Adagio, when Maisky broke a  string. The cellist finished the movement in obvious distress, improvising a  forgivably desultory cadenza on one string.  </P> <P> He then swapped instruments with LACO second-chair cellist Nils Oliver.  Apparently feeling he had nothing to lose, Maisky attacked the finger-busting  finale with vigorous abandon. He never lost control of the music, however,  playing cleanly and clearly on the unfamiliar instrument, and with remarkable  elan.  </P> <P> The orchestra, led by Iona Brown from the concertmaster's seat as usual,  accompanied Maisky handsomely. Balances were always supportive and tempos  accommodating in a performance that overcame stylistic incongruity and  instrumental trauma with sheer verve.  </P> <P> The rest of the program displayed the sonic polish of the LACO strings to fine  effect. Brown and Co. began with the Ricercar from Bach's "Musical Offering,"  in an imaginative arrangement by Neville Marriner, and continued with a crisp,  buoyant account of Handel's Opus 6 Concerto Grosso in B minor, to which  harpsichordist Patricia Mabee made a distinguished contribution.  </P> <P> At the end was a luminous account of Schoenberg's "Verklarte Nacht." Attacks  were occasionally ragged, and the dramatic line of the tone poem sagged at  times. But for sustained aural reverie -- plush, richly romantic sound, yet  transparent in texture when needed -- this was a cherishable performance. JOHN  HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Yesterday, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  president, His Excellency Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, together  with other officials, visited people residing in Byumba. In  Byumba, they found many Kigali citizens.    Between 4,000 and 5,000 people took refuge in the Amahoro  Stadium in Kigali. Selfless RPF fighters did everything  possible, despite a crossfire, to use their skills to take all  these people to safety. These people are currently within an  RPF-controlled zone outside of Kigali. As you may recall,  government forces shelled the stadium where these people had  taken refuge, killing more than 25 of them and injuring over 50.    The RPF continues to come to the rescue of the population,  as  it has been doing all along, saving the lives of those people  who were still breathing in the various parishes. This work is  part of our country's war for liberation. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] plans  to increase significantly the number of inspection experts and  send them to Pyongyang in order to restore the continuity of  inspections, which was greatly damaged by the suspension of  operation of monitoring equipment in North Korean nuclear  facilities and by North Korea's refusal of inspections.    A relevant IAEA high-ranking official said that through  overall inspections [chonmyon sachal], which will be resumed in  the future, the IAEA plans to restore the damaged continuity of  inspections of North Korea. Toward this end, it will send the  inspection team to Pyongyang after adding three or four  additional experts.    He stressed that the IAEA plans to send an inspection team  of  approximately seven experts to Pyongyang for the nuclear  inspection of North Korea, which will be resumed in the future.  He said he was not sure if North Korea would accept the seven  experts because the IAEA has not received an official message  from the North Korean side yet. He said, however, that the IAEA  plans to discuss the issue with North Korea through  consultations.    He stressed that the inspections must be regularly conducted  in order to completely restore the continuity of inspections and  he expressed the hope that North Korea will respond positively.  He said that the inspection team, which is ready to go to North  Korea now, is standing by in order to change monitoring  equipment in North Korean nuclear facilities, including six  monitoring cameras and over 40 pieces of sealing equipment  [pongin changchi] and to check in detail the total stock of  nuclear material that has not yet been examined.</p>

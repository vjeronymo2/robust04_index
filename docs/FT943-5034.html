			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: A banker explains A couple of weeks ago Observer got a call for help from financial advisers Pointon York. It wanted an English translation of a letter from the Bank of Scotland giving notice that it had 'retrocessed, reponed and restored. . .' There has been no shortage of suggestions from readers. Andrew Martell of Wise Speke suggested that what the bank was trying to say was, 'here's what we nicked from you'. C. E. Fuller of ERF (Holdings) claimed the letter means that the bank had found a way of charging you for something they did in the past, which you did not know you had to pay for, and which they had not previously thought of charging. However, Viv Edwards of The Royal Bank of Scotland (who else?) came up with the correct answer. The notice refers to an asset provided to the bank as security. The English translation is 'you can have it back'.</p>

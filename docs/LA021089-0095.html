			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  DNA EVIDENCE TO BE USED IN MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has announced that evidence derived  from genetic fingerprinting will be used to prosecute two suspects in the rape  and murder of a Pasadena woman last October.  </P> <P> This would be the first time the county has used the technique, which involves  matching the genetic makeup of a suspect with blood or semen samples.  </P> <P> Ronald Anthony Jones and George Marvin Trone have been charged with kidnaping  26-year-old Lois Haro at the Plaza Pasadena Mall, raping her and then killing  her.  </P> <P> Tests concluded that the genetic patterns found in semen and blood samples were  almost perfect matches for both defendants, officials said.  </P> <P> DNA, found in all cells, carries each individual's genetic blueprint and  determines everything from hair color to gender. Each individual's genetic code  is unique, except in the case of identical twins.  </P> <P> A lawyer for one of the suspects said he will contest introduction of the  findings at a preliminary hearing scheduled for March 21. Both suspects have  pleaded not guilty.  </P></p>

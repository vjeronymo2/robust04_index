			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PIPER CLOSES PLANT FOR 2 WEEKS, LAYS OFF OVER 75% OF WORKERS  </P> <P> Financially troubled Piper Aircraft Corp. shut down its plant here for two  weeks today and laid off more than three-fourths of its workers, a company  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Joe Ponte, director of marketing, said that the layoffs are the result of a  severe cash crunch and that the company does not plan to seek protection from  creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.  </P> <P> About 580 workers will be on an extended layoff, he said. The rest of the  nearly 1,100 employees will return to work March 12, after the shutdown, he  said.  </P> <P> "We have a tremendous backlog in aircraft on order," Ponte said in an  interview.  </P> <P> About 300 people remain on the job to help deal with backlogs in aircraft  deliveries, he said.  </P> <P> Piper, which manufactures aircraft for general aviation, was purchased by  California investor M. Stuart Millar from Forstmann Little &amp; Co. in 1987.  No purchase price was disclosed.  </P> <P> Ponte said the company will go to a four-day workweek after the shutdown to  help the company get back on its feet.  </P> <P> He said the problems resulted from a rapid expansion of the company after  Stuart Millar bought the company in 1987.  </P></p>

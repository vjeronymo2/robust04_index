			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Accountancy: Little has changed in a quarter of a century - The first edition of Accountancy Age sees a continuity of issues over 25 years Twenty five years ago, Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the moon, Concorde made its inaugural flight, parliament abolished the death penalty and the London School of Economics was closed by student protests. Predictably enough, things were rather more static in the conservative world of British accountancy. But not everything stood still. On Friday December 5, 1969, a new weekly specialist journal came into existence which continues to thrive: Accountancy Age. The senior editor was Robert Willott, now in charge of Willott Kingston Smith, a specialist London-based accountancy firm. The advertisement manager was Maurice Saatchi, who later decided to go it alone. The publisher was Michael Heseltine's Haymarket group. Some 62,750 copies were distributed free to all qualified accountants, including members of the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants (now Chartered Institute of Management Accountants) and the Association of Certified and Corporate Accountants (now the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants). Others could pay two shillings for the privilege of hearing an independent voice for the profession. Flicking through the 32 pages of the first issue, the format looks strangely familiar to readers of the Age today. There are differences, of course. In common with many newspapers at the time, there were no by-lines on the stories to indicate who had written them. One article makes references to the tight restrictions imposed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales: advertising or soliciting for new business by accountancy firms is prohibited. Members could give their names and call themselves 'chartered accountants' if quoted on television or in print, but they were forbidden from mentioning the name of their firms. Salaries also reflected the era. The advertisement section tantalises with some jobs paying as much as Pounds 5,000, and remuneration for an equity partner designate in an accountancy firm of Pounds 3,000. There is a piece about the Canola 1200 electronic desk calculator, 'probably the cheapest of its kind available in this country' at Pounds 325, which is able to multiply and divide numbers. Its dimensions were 10.5 inches by 13 inches. On the same page, the Decimal Training Company is selling plastic replicas for training purposes of Britain's new decimal coins, scheduled to be introduced in February 1971. 'Experience has shown that even when checking-out cashiers have been trained it is realistic to expect that checking out will take longer,' it warns. One of the most happy and visible changes since that early era is the disappearance of an enormous number of sexist advertisements, with skimpily-clad women draped around the most mundane products on the slightest pretext. Even the editorial judgments were affected. Page two of the first issue includes a large photograph of Gail Renshaw, Miss USA, and runner up in the Miss World contest. The justification for her appearance was that she was studying for her CPA qualification with a firm in Lexington, Georgia. But perhaps the biggest surprise to a contemporary reader of the original edition of Accountancy Age is how little the issues of the day have changed in the last quarter of a century. The most prominent front page story deals with 'staff shortages and legislative complications' at the Inland Revenue threatening a 'tax crisis'. The board of the Revenue had called for a three-year standstill on all new tax legislation, while the accountancy profession was demanding in its 'annual plea' simplification and removal of anomalies and 'hastily conceived' proposals. Mr N C Price, deputy chairman of the board, complains that 'we do say in the most forcible terms that we do not want anything new until we have had time to digest what we were given in 1965.' Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry was criticising tax changes 'for not having been thought out sufficiently well in advance'. The Revenue also seemed concerned that youth clearly had its mind more on Bob Dylan and drugs than on matters fiscal, since it bemoaned the difficulties in retaining staff and the need to remove both the 'material and psychological barriers' to the recruitment of graduates. The tension of the 'dual role' of accountants also featured prominently: an article highlighted the claimed conflict of interest when auditors also act as consultants, accountable in the first role to shareholders and in the latter role to the board. One anonymous consultant complained to the Age that the role of the accountant as the statutory auditor should be made more 'constructive', and that management information services provided by the firms should be restricted to these areas. The story was triggered by apparent concerns from management consultants under threat because the Institute had lifted its ban on marketing for the consulting arms of the firms - a move welcomed in one of the Age's first editorials. A second editorial supports calls from Lord Shawcross, then chairman of the City Takeover Panel, for the accountancy profession to clarify current practices. He was concerned about the inconsistencies in financial reporting, and the fact that the existing limited guidelines issued were not mandatory. Ironically, the first profile of a 'leading figure' was Sir Joseph Latham, who had quit AEI after its takeover by GEC at the end of a hotly contested battle. Disputes about the profit forecasts made by AEI  - to which Shawcross was in part referring - became the starting point for the creation of the Accounting Standards Committee, forerunner of the Accounting Standards Board. 'I could sit down with auditors in most big companies, produce two widely different forecasts and convince the auditors of the validity of each,' Sir Joseph says. He makes a plea for accountants to present 'reality' not the figures as shown in 'an orthodox accounting statement'. Mr Ronald Leach, yet to be knighted in 1969 but that year's president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and senior partner of Peat Marwick Mitchell, was also quoted in an extensive interview with the magazine. His most important concern? The ill-fated attempt to integrate the different professional accountancy bodies. His view was that modernisation and consolidation was essential, and the chance to merge the bodies might never be possible again. He talked about the possibility and complexities of the incorporation of accountancy firms, partly reflecting their desire to try to raise external capital to help fund their operations and also to protect them from unlimited liability at a time of rising legal claims and escalating insurance costs. He discussed rotation of audit firms - on which he was open-minded - and the tensions of auditors getting too close to management - which he argued did not in his experience jeopardise independence. Leach suggested there was likely to be greater consolidation of the firms, a shift of clients towards large firms and a single worldwide auditor, and predicted a move towards accountancy becoming a graduate profession. Some of his predictions have clearly held true. Yet overall, the message of the Age seems to be that little of substance has changed at all in its first 25 years. When it celebrates its 50th anniversary, much of the profession might take some secret comfort from that.</p>

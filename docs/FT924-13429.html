			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Japanese airline to buy Boeing jets AIR Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, said yesterday it would buy 15 B737-300 Boeing aircraft for an estimated Y80bn (Pounds 373m). The Japanese regional airline said a selection committee, after 'exhaustive evaluations', had chosen the model ahead of the Airbus A319, the British Aerospace 146, the Fokker F100 and the McDonnell Douglas MD87. Government officials insist that aircraft purchases are made on the grounds of quality, and not politics, but the European Community has complained that some purchases appear to be designed to appease Washington. The EC has become more concerned as Japan's trade surplus with the US has risen, apparently putting more pressure on the country's airlines to increase purchases of US equipment.</p>

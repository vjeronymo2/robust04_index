			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This comment suggests a misunderstanding of the TAA program and the effects of the 1988 Amendments and earlier changes. Since the addition of section 236(a)(3) (now 236(a)(4)) in the 1986 Amendments, the switching of training costs from other funds to TAA funds has to be subject to the controls set out in that section. In the 1988 Amendments those controls were retained, and authority was added to mix TAA funding with funding from other public and private sources and to use funding solely from other sources for TAA training. That is why, in GAL 15&hyph;90 (and earlier in GAL 7&hyph;88) and in amended &sect;617.25, greater emphasis is given to entering into prearrangements for sharing the costs of training with other funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. With training becoming an eligibility requirement for basic TRA in the 1988 Amendments, the same emphasis upon prospective treatment must now be given to basic TRA as has been given to additional TRA and, to a somewhat lesser extent, TAA funds for training. Additional TRA has not been paid for retroactive weeks, nor, under &sect;617.22(c), have previously incurred training costs been payable from TAA funds. This same rule must now be applied to basic TRA, as well as additional TRA and TAA training funds, and it is this rule that is reflected in amended &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) as well as in amended &sect;617.22(c). Under the 1988 Amendments, therefore, TAA funding will not follow automatically from approval of training under &sect;617.22(a), nor will approval of training that commenced before approval under &sect;617.22(a) imply or justify payment of previously incurred training costs from TAA funds, or payment of any TRA for any week that ended before such approval was documented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the foregoing reasons, no substantive change is made in the final regulations to accord with PDLI's comment. Changes are made in &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii), as well as in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.22(c), however, for purposes of stating the prospective rule as clearly as possible and to furnish a regulatory response to the PDLI's multi-faceted question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Retroactive payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (OBES) commented that &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) specifies that the eligibility period, during which additional weeks of TRA are payable to a worker in approved training, if such training is approved after the training commences, begins with the first week such training is approved. Approval of such training after the training has commenced shall not be deemed to authorize the payment of TRA for any week which ended before such approval was documented. The OBES explained that, at the present time, many individuals are enrolled in training programs which were not TAA approvable prior to the 1988 Amendments because the costs of training were paid with non-appropriated funds. While these individuals are being made aware of the change in the law that now authorizes the use of non-appropriated funds to pay the costs of training, there are unavoidable delays in documenting sources of training funds and approving the training under part 617. These delays result in lost worker eligibility for weeks of additional TRA. OBES recommends that the final rule provide for retroactive payment of the additional weeks of TRA in such cases, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least to the date of application for approval of such training. Sections 617.22(c) and 617.67(f) would also need to be modified for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OBES presented the problem as one that existed at the time the letter was written; that is, when the OBES's comments were made in December 1988. Although the Department understands that such a problem may have existed in late August and in September 1988, the operating instructions in GAL 7&hyph;88 were issued to State agencies some three months before the OBES comments were made. Accordingly, the Department has decided not to relax its long-standing rule against retroactive payments expressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.22(c). See discussion under the preceding item. It was not expected that the new authorization for sharing costs of training would furnish a viable solution to all existing cases. One of the safeguards built into the new system was to require that sharing of costs be under conditions arranged before the training was approved under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.22 and undertaken by the worker. There is no intent to approve the payment of additional TRA for weeks a worker is not actually participating in training nor to approve retroactive payments that are not allowable under &sect;617.22 (c). The expectation is that cooperating agencies will enter into shared cost prearrangements for training not funded wholly from TAA funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Department has decided to make no change in the regulations in response to this comment, but notes under item 3 that clarifying technical changes are being made in &sect;&sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) and 617.22(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualifying separations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (MDLIR) commented on paragraphs (t)(1), (t)(2)(ii) and (t)(3)(ii) of &sect;617.3 in the proposed rule, which define ``first separation'', ``qualifying separation'', and ``first qualifying separation''. Since a worker must have a total separation on or after August 23, 1988 to qualify for TRA, the MDLIR asked why the definition of ``partial separation'' should not be eliminated if it takes a total separation to establish eligibility for TRA?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department retained the definition of ``partial separation'' because the qualifying requirements in section 231(a)(1) and (2) continue to permit workers to have a total or partial separation from employment to qualify for TRA prior to August 23, 1988, and for TAA services other than TRA whether a separation occurs before or after August 23, 1988. The amended law does not require that a worker have a total qualifying separation on or after August 23, 1988, in order to qualify for basic or additional TRA for weeks beginning after August 23, 1988. Workers will continue to be eligible for basic and additional TRA after August 23, 1988, based on a partial or total qualifying separation that occurred before August 23 under the prior law. Although the amended law requires that a qualifying separation must be a total separation to qualify initially for basic TRA (or to move the eligibility period based on a prior qualifying separation under the same certification), a partial qualifying separation will be used for purposes other than the basic TRA eligibility period. For example, under &sect;617.15(b) an application for training must be filed within 210 days after the date of the worker's total or partial separation referred to in Section 231(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1). (See item E. above, and item 25, below, concerning changes to &sect;617.15(b) on the application of the 210-day rule.) Further, the weekly and maximum amounts of TRA payable to an individual are based on the first total or partial separation. However, with respect to qualifying separations to which amended section 233(a)(2) applies, a worker's eligibility period for basic TRA is based on total separations only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

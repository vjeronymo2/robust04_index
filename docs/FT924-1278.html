			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Money Markets: French cash rates rise THE Bank of France decided not to raise official interest rates at its Thursday repurchase operation in spite of continuing pressure on the French franc on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. There had been much expectation in recent days that France would increase the rates at which it offers cash to banks through the five to 10-day lending window, in order to reverse the currency's fall to within a centime of its ERM floor against the D-Mark. The authorities yesterday left the intervention rate unchanged at 9.10 per cent, while the five to 10-day repurchase rate stayed at 10 per cent. The franc briefly fell below the FFr3.42 level against the D-Mark in the wake of the move, but there were no signs of significantly greater pressure on the French currency. One London-based dealer suggested that the French decision was, tactically, the right move. He said that a rise in rates would have created a new atmosphere of crisis over the franc. The French authorities have realised that the market is now putting a new premium on growth, and actually fears that rate increases are fundamentally bad for the economy, he added. Cash rates in the French franc market again firmed yesterday, with three-month money rising as high as 12 per cent. In the franc futures market, there was erratic trading in the March contract, which opened at around 90.40 and fell back to 90.25 on fears of the rate rise. The authorities' decision pushed the contract up again, to close a net 3 basis points higher at 90.43. Short-dated Euromark futures rose sharply yesterday in spite of what was considered a hawkish monthly report from the Bundesbank. The March contract rose 12 basis points to close at 92.05, a level which assumes that three-month money in late spring will be at 7.95 per cent. Rates in the German cash market softened a little yesterday, but remained on the comparatively high side because of end-of-year pressures. Three-month money averaged about 9.07 per cent yeasterday, having been at around 8.90 per cent last week. In the sterling market, three-month money was unchanged at 7 1/4 per cent. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 400m, which was fully removed.</p>

Ian Burchett, Canada's consul in Mexico City, said that the  goal for 1994 is to even out the trade balance.    Currently, Canadian imports from Mexico are greater than its  exports. However, Burchett noted that the interest showed by  over 5,000 Canadian companies to do business with Mexicans  within the framework of NAFTA will encourage Canadian exports.    Burchett told EL FINANCIERO NORESTE EMPRESARIAL that  investors are conducting a huge advertising campaign in Mexico  to increase their exports since Mexico stands out as Canada's  leading commercial partner in Latin America.    Figures provided by the Canadian Consulate in Monterrey  reveal that Canadian exports to Mexico from January to November  1993 amounted to 714,254,000 Canadian dollars compared with  710,298,000 million for the same period in 1992. For that same  period, Canadian imports reached 3,289,591,000 Canadian dollars  while they reached around 2,542,320,000 dollars during the same  period in 1992. These figures reveal that the Canadian trade  balance with Mexico has followed a positive trend.    In 1991, Canadian companies exported some 500 million  dollars  [as published] to Mexico while Canadian imports from Mexico were  in the amount of 2,833,687,000 Canadian dollars. The Mexican  market has been a priority for Canada, vis-a-vis other Latin  American countries, even before implementation of NAFTA.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: West misjudges a stubborn nationalism - Owen puts faith in Milosevic; US wants quick action; UN to create 'safe areas'; Bosnian Serbs triumphant / Rejection of the peace plan has left the outside world as divided as ever THE rejection by the Bosnian Serb parliament of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia leaves the international community with the same agonising choices as before the Athens summit of the warring parties last weekend. After the combined pressure of the west, Russia and Serbia had forced Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to sign the plan, many of the world's leaders had confidently predicted that the Bosnian Serb assembly would follow suit. But they were wrong. Once again, they underestimated the stubbornness and mystical nationalism of the Bosnian Serbs and the cunning of their leader, who made his signature conditional on his assembly's approval of the plan. In spite of the impassioned pleas of Balkan leaders such as President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece, they effectively voted down the plan dividing Bosnia into ten semi-autonomous provinces, by an overwhelming majority in what was described by Lord Owen, one of the two mediators, as an act of 'dangerous folly'. The task confronting the western allies and Russia if the Bosnian Serb assembly had approved the peace plan would have been difficult enough. By common agreement, implementation of the plan would have required the rapid deployment of 70,000 international peacekeeping troops to monitor the withdrawal of the warring parties' forces and heavy weapons to designated areas and to patrol provincial borders and throughways. But with the US and Russia both agreeing to provide substantial forces, coupled with the willingness of France and Britain, with peacekeeping troops already on the spot, to increase their contributions, the task was not as insuperable as at first appeared. Such a deployment, however, has almost certainly been indefinitely postponed. None of the potential contributing nations, including the US, is prepared to risk the lives of their peacekeeping troops in a war situation. They would only be sent in to oversee the implementation of a peace agreement once it had been endorsed by all the warring parties, not to impose it by military force. At the same time there is no agreement yet, even between the US and its western allies, on the precise alternative strategy to be pursued in the event of a final rejection of the peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs, as discussions between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, and European leaders have shown this week. Mr Christopher has found no takers for his proposal that the international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia should be lifted selectively to help Bosnian Moslems. Britain and France are the strongest opponents of such a move, because they believe that it would not only prolong the conflict but endanger their peacekeepers on the ground and the UN's humanitarian operation. The other military option proposed by the US - surgical air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply lines - has also been greeted with little enthusiasm by Britain, France and Russia. Air strikes have not been ruled out by any of the government leaders whom Mr Christopher has seen, but they have all made clear that further discussions would have to take place before embarking on such a step. Mr Christopher himself repeated yesterday that the US did not want to act unilaterally but in concert with other members of the western alliance. Following yesterday's failure to endorse the peace plan, the chorus in the US, EC and Nato in support of 'tougher measures' has again reached a crescendo, but such sentiments will not be translated into military action until it is specifically authorised by a Security Council resolution. 'Our focus will be very sharp on the new stronger measures,' Mr Christopher said in Brussels yesterday after seeing EC and Nato ministers. However, in European capitals, there still appears to be a residual hope that military intervention can be avoided, in the immediate future at least, and that the new package of tougher sanctions will bring the Bosnian Serbs to their knees. Lord Owen, while recognising that the international community was 'getting closer' to military intervention in Bosnia, nevertheless spoke out against rushing into such a decision. In common with British and French leaders, Lord Owen appears to be putting his faith in the Russian and Serb leaders, Mr Boris Yeltsin and Mr Milosevic, to reverse the Bosnian Serb assembly's decision. That faith seemed to be rewarded last night when Serbia announced it was halting all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian Serbs - a measure earlier urged by both Lord Owen and Mr John Major, the British prime minister. But the cutting of a key supply line for the Bosnian Serb army may have had more to do with the humiliation Mr Milosevic suffered when the Bosnian Serb assembly so decisively ignored his appeal to them to accept the peace plan. However, while the watchword in Europe remains an intensification of pressure, mainly in the form of an economic blockade, the signs are that President Bill Clinton may be losing patience. He said last night the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the peace plan 'threatens to widen the conflict and foster instability in other parts of Europe.' The time had come for the international community to unite and act quickly and decisively, the president emphasised. That does not sound as if Washington is prepared to wait much longer for the Bosnian Serbs to change their minds.</p>

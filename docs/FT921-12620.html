			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lose ground as account ends WORRIES that Lonrho's dividend-cutting exercise could initiate a domino-effect among some of the UK's most important companies over coming months prompted another widespread decline in the equity market as the two-week trading account ended. The FT-SE 100-share index, under pressure for much of the week, succumbed to periodic bouts of selling pressure yesterday, which affected a generally unwilling market, and closed 14.9 points lower at 2,510.4. At its worst yesterday, within an hour of the start of trading, the index was substantially below the 2,500-mark, touching 2,493.2 or down 32.1. The index's best showing was recorded in mid-afternoon when it showed a decline of 9.6 at 2,515.7. At the outset of trading, all eyes in the market were glued to the Lonrho page on the Seaq trading screens as the international trading group's shares, battered during late unofficial trading on Thursday night, fell to 107p minutes after trading commenced, compared with the previous session's official closing level of 164p. Turnover in Lonrho topped 32m shares and easily outstripped that of any other stock in the market. Thereafter, the market slowly regained some of its lost composure. Senior marketmakers, expecting a wave of selling after the Lonrho dividend cut, were surprised at the relatively light weight of actual selling pressure at the outset but reported another late flurry of selling as the market closed. This followed a statement from the US authorities about potential bank failures which was said to have upset Wall Street as London closed. There were also suggestions around the market, that the weekend Press will include at least one opinion poll favouring Labour. During the week, the Footsie has fallen just over 26 points. Specialists attribute much of the decline in London to the weakness of international markets. Wall Street has fallen in excess of 20 points over the same period while Tokyo has lost substantial ground. Market turnover, yesterday, reached 614.6m shares, well ahead of Thursday's 573.4m and Wednesday's 515.6m and only a fraction below Tuesday's programme-trade-inflated 619.4m. News that the Trade and Industry Secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, had asked the European Commission for permission to refer the Steetley/Tarmac joint venture in building materials to the Monopolies and Mergers prompted a slide in both share prices and fears that Redland's full bid may also be referred. Among other big movers in the Footsie, British Aerospace took another pasting in response to a broker downgrade. Retail, or strictly customer business in equity markets this week picked up after a very slow start responding to heavy programme trading.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Canberra aims for budget deficit cut THE Australian government yesterday foreshadowed a tightening of fiscal policy to achieve its target of bringing the budget close to balance over the next four years. Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said there would be no 'precipitate' attempt to eliminate the forecast deficit of ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7.50bn) for the year to June, equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). But the federal budget in August would include specific measures intended to reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996/97. 'The government has shown in the past its willingness to adjust fiscal policy as circumstances require. I can assure you that we will not flinch from dealing with the emerging policy requirements.' The treasurer's comments were underlined by Mr Ralph Willis, the finance minister, who said the government would not rely entirely on economic growth to reduce the deficit. 'I would think that we need to take some positive steps and not just rely on the recovery  .. to reduce the deficit,' he said. The ministers' comments contrast with reports official suggestions last week that Mr Dawkins regarded the deficit as less important than a reduction in unemployment from its near record level of 11.1 per cent. Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, have made it clear that a reduction in the deficit is regarded as essential by the financial markets. Mr Dawkins also announced a review of national savings and plans for increased budgetary co-operation with state governments.</p>

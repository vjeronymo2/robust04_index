			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHERS;  </P> <P> MARATHON: MEMBERS OF THE TEAM IN TRAINING WORK TO CONQUER BOTH THE 26.2-MILE  DISTANCE AND LEUKEMIA.  </P> <P> It's too early for visions of sugar plums to be dancing anywhere as yet, but on  the eve of the San Diego International Marathon, the dreamscapes of some 6,000  runners will likely include some of the following:  </P> <P> * Leaders looking nervously over their shoulders to see who's breathing down  their necks.  </P> <P> * First-timers looking nervously over their shoulders to make sure someone's  breathing down their necks.  </P> <P> * Then there will be the Barbara Egans, wondering how their toenails are  holding up, and the John Flemings, hoping their bodies aren't tricking them  into picking up the pace too early.  </P> <P> * The Betty Murphys will be wondering what part of their body they will call  upon to accommodate that extra six miles, and the Alex Sandies will be planning  the easiest way to get into and out of their kilts. OK, so only one Alex Sandie  will actually be doing that.  </P> <P> * And, as will most everyone, the Dennis Ahlmans will be wanting the whole darn  thing to end.  </P> <P> But Ahlman, the director of the Leukemia Society of San Diego, is one of 24  runners representing "Team in Training" and as prepared for this 26.2-mile joy  ride -- his second attempt to finish a marathon in 10 years -- as he'll ever  be.  </P> <P> "I'm a little scared but excited," said Ahlman, who commissioned the help of  Mark Zeisinger, San Diego Athletic Club general manager, and SDAC Fitness  Director Thom Hunt in forming the Team in Training six months ago.  </P> <P> Ahlman had worked closely with Zeisinger and Hunt in past Leukemia  Society-sponsored Coronado bridge races. And he didn't hesitate to approach  them with his proposal for a unique fund-raiser used in the New York City  Marathon by the Westchester/Hudson Valley Leukemia Society of New York.  </P> <P> According to Ahlman, flat sums and per-mile pledges raised by the runners added  $300,000 to the coffers of the New York charity in the last marathon. He felt  it would work here but wanted to take it a step further by implementing a  training program as added incentive.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be a great way to raise money and give something to  first-time runners," Ahlman said. "For the public, the marathon is such a  nightmare, and this is a service we can provide."  </P> <P> While Team in Training runners are dedicated to raising money for the Leukemia  Society, the creators are dedicated to preparing members to enjoy the difficult  run as much as possible.  </P> <P> "Not to take away from it," said Hunt, coach and director of Team in Training  and the marathon's official spokesman, "but a marathon is something most people  can do. Some just aren't as sure of it as I am. And I can make it a more  enjoyable experience."  </P> <P> According to Hunt, two-thirds of the members are first-time marathoners who  weren't sure they could face the training alone or complete the race.  </P> <P> "They wanted to do it," he said, "they just had no idea as to how to get  there."  </P> <P> So Hunt has guided them step by step. In June, eight runners attended the first  meeting. They ran three miles.  </P> <P> Since then, they have met twice a month to exchange progress reports, take  long-distance runs and get workout and diet information from Hunt.  </P> <P> "Our program is different," Hunt said. "Some groups are much more specific. The  running is tied in with the fact that we're here to raise money. It's not as if  these people hired a personal coach."  </P> <P> Maybe not, but members felt Hunt gave them as much coaching and support as if  they had.  </P> <P> "Thom's both a motivator and expert," said Barbara Egan, a novice who had a  zero running base when Hunt gently coaxed her into the group.  </P> <P> "No thing was too small to ask of him," she said. "I remember calling him late  one night telling him my toenail hurt and asking what I should do. He's a  psychologist and trainer at the same time. There's always something he can help  you with."  </P> <P> Said John Fleming, a loan officer at Home Federal Bank and former recreational  runner who has decreased his mile pace by two minutes: "I have a lot of respect  for him, for his knowledge in training someone."  </P> <P> The group peaked with 35 members, but 24 stuck with the commitment of turning  in mileage cards and gathering pledges, which in some cases has turned their  lives topsy-turvy.  </P> <P> "My husband is very sick of this," said Egan, a real estate agent for Paydar  Properties and a Leukemia Society board member.  </P> <P> Hunt approached Egan because he needed a running partner for beginner Missi  Santana. The two have since formed a buddy system. Now, Egan is up at 4 daily  to get in her morning run.  </P> <P> "Your personal life changes because everything revolves around the marathon,"  she said. "I'm a little late to work these days, I wear flat shoes now, my  eating has changed. And I'm always talking about it. It's a regimented life."  </P> <P> A former swimmer, she said she had always wanted to do a marathon, but lacked  the discipline.  </P> <P> "This was the perfect opportunity," she said. "I have a running buddy who  expects me to be there and a coach who expects me to turn in my mileage."  </P> <P> In New York, pledges of $5,000 were required, but each Team in Training member  is responsible for raising $2,500. So Egan found herself accountable to her  financial backers as well, some of whom requested periodic training updates.  </P> <P> "The people who were pledging money were always asking me how training was  going," Egan said. "It's kept me very honest."  </P> <P> The group is linked through a two-fold desire to raise money for the Leukemia  Society and to eventually finish.  </P> <P> "The common goal is successfully completing the marathon," Fleming said. "It  doesn't matter how fast. And it's a good way of raising money for a good  cause."  </P> <P> Last year's San Diego International Marathon was Alex Sandie's first. Sandie,  of Edinburgh, Scotland, joined Team in Training to help the cause. He will be  the guy in a full kilt for the first and last miles.  </P> <P> "My training goals were set," he said, "I joined mainly to help raise money.  But I still benefitted from Thom's knowledge."  </P> <P> Hunt said the only criteria for joining Team in Training was the desire to  raise money for a cause that has his personal interest.  </P> <P> "My stepfather died of leukemia," said Hunt, the 1986 Heart of San Diego  Marathon winner and four-time NCAA All-American at Arizona. "That made it all  the more important."  </P> <P> So can Betty Murphy, co-owner of Murphy's Bookkeeping Service.  </P> <P> "I volunteered my services on many other charities, and I always get stuck with  the bookkeeping," she said. "This seemed like the perfect opportunity. I  volunteered my services on another level."  </P> <P> Although she has been running 15 years, Murphy's longest races have been  half-marathons.  </P> <P> "I was so dead after the half, I thought I could never go another 13," Murphy  said. Then after a Team in Training 20-mile training run, "I told Thom that I  had absolutely no idea how I'd find another six miles in this body."  </P> <P> Hunt's sure she will. After all, he said, the key to finishing a marathon isn't  speed.  </P> <P> "Training the body to keep moving for three to five hours," he said. "That's  the biggest physical challenge. You need to adapt training so it's not too much  come race day."  </P> <P> For most, the goal isn't a time but a finish that leaves them feeling like  they'll someday try it again.  </P> <P> "I just want to complete the distance and feel good," Egan said.  </P> <P> Said Fleming: "To finish the race pain free is a goal. I'm trying for a  eight-minute pace for the first 15 miles. If I'm doing good, toward 20 miles, I  may pick it up."  </P> <P> Fleming is, according to group members, one of the bigger success stories of  Team in Training.  </P> <P> "John is one of our stars," Ahlman said. "He's lost lots of weight and raised  lots of money for us."  </P> <P> Fleming, 6-feet, 164 pounds, dropped 16 pounds during the intense training  regimen. Eighteen months ago, Fleming ran with Hunt's elite group and got a  lesson.  </P> <P> "It was awful," he said. "Now, most of the time I can keep up with them."  </P> <P> Hunt said the runners' worries include apprehension about proper preparation  and what they'll eat and drink on the course.  </P> <P> " 'Can I do it? Am I really ready? What will it be like?,' " he said. "Those  are the kinds of questions they have."  </P> <P> One of Fleming's concerns was the time constraints that training would create.  </P> <P> "I was worried about how time consuming it would be," he said. "Also, that I'd  have to be disciplined and run when I didn't want to."  </P> <P> Egan said she feared failure.  </P> <P> "I wasn't sure I had the mental strength," she said, "But Thom is great at  getting fears away. He's so knowledgeable about the mind and running. He's good  at convincing you that you do feel good."  </P> <P> Good enough to join Team in Training again next year, which Ahlman said he  hopes to see.  </P> <P> "This is going to be an annual event," he said. "We would like to see it really  take off. We think it will be a major thrust for us."  </P> <P> Sign Murphy up. "I would recommend this to anyone," she said. "If they have it  next year, I'll do it for sure. I could have never done it on my own."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL MARATHON FACTS WHERE: Starts and finishes near Hilton  Beach &amp; Tennis Resort on East Mission Bay Drive.  </P> <P> WHEN: Sunday, 8 a.m. start for wheelchairs, 8:05 for runners.

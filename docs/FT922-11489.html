			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Bonn spurns US criticism of budget policy THE German government yesterday angrily rejected US criticism of its swollen budget deficit, setting the scene for a sharp confrontation over the issue at this weekend's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations. Separate statements yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Horst Kohler, his state secretary and chief international negotiator, made it clear they regard the criticism as both untimely and unjustified. Mr Kohler directly attacked Mr David Mulford, the US treasury secretary, for what he described as 'one-sided and partially false judgments' on the state of the German budget deficit. He rejected the US criticism as 'unacceptable' on the eve of the G7 meeting, and quite contrary to the principle of G7 co-operation - that 'every country should keep its own house in order'. Mr Mulford warned on Thursday that Germany's large fiscal deficit, run up to pay for the cost of unification and subsidising east German industry, could prove structural and long-lasting. It was a direct cause of high interest rates and low growth in Europe, and a factor contributing to unemployment, he said. The angry German response suggests that Bonn is not only acutely sensitive on the point, but remains unwilling to bend to international pressure for sharp spending cuts or tax increases. Mr Waigel said he was committed to a moratorium on the level of state spending until the mid-1990s: every new payment must be matched by an equivalent saving. From 1993-96, combined public sector budgets must be kept to a growth of under 3 per cent, or half the expected growth of nominal gross national product. He said the forecast German budget deficit this year, at 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product, was well under the 4.7 per cent level in the US, 4.8 per cent in the UK, and 9.9 per cent in Italy. Meanwhile, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, revealed that the German economy recovered to a probable 4 per cent annual growth rate in the first quarter - albeit largely thanks to unseasonally mild weather - after three successive quarters of decline.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, several commenters disagreed with certain safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors specified in NGV2. CGA, PST, SCI, and NGV Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported a higher safety factor for containers using unproven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials. In particular, they were concerned with containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinforced with carbon fiber overwrap, for which NGV2 specifies a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.25 safety factor for all carbon reinforced containers, Types 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3, and 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV Systems stated that a safety factor of 2.25 constitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ``unacceptable safety risk,'' given the industry's limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience with carbon fiber and lack of a significant data base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating this materials safety and reliability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, NGV Systems supported a safety factor of 3.5 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what it termed unproven designs, which may then be lowered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more experience and data accumulate. CGA recommended safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors of 2.5 for all Type 2 containers and 3.33 for all Type 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 4 containers, stating that these are used on all fiber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinforced compressed gas containers now in commercial use. CGA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that unlike other fiber overwrap used in the past for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation pressure vessels, there is no commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience with the safety of carbon fiber reinforced containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for motor vehicle applications to justify a 2.25 safety factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such containers. CGA stated that NGV2 does not adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address damage tolerance concerns for carbon reinforced fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wrapped containers with low safety factors. PST recommended 3.33  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for carbon fiber Types 3 and 4 containers. That commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended such conservative safety factors until substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data are accumulated on the use of carbon fiber containers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual service. SCI provided similar comments, and recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factors of 3.33 for the fully wrapped containers, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are Types 3 and 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters stated that a single safety factor was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. CNG Pittsburgh, a consulting firm, stated that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factor of 3.50 is conservative but reasonable for CNG fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers. AAMA stated that adopting NGV2's approach with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various safety factors depending on the material and design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved would limit a manufacturer's choice of container designs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and materials. EDO recommended a safety factor of 2.5 for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA decided to issue an SNPRM proposing to pattern the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burst requirement more closely on NGV2, based on its consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other Federal agencies, its review of comments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1993 proposal, and other available information. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explaining its reason for issuing the SNPRM, NHTSA stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there did not appear to be any procedures that could adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test a container's susceptibility to degradation over time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it believed that specifying a single safety factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not protect in all instances against these problems since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the strength of some containers is dependent on the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material and method of design. Therefore, NHTSA decided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose a burst test that would link the use of particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs and materials to compliance with safety factors tailored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to those designs and materials. The agency tentatively concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that such an approach might be necessary to ensure the safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of pressure vessels used for fuel containers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency further noted that international standards addressing CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel containers, including regulations of Transport Canada and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those being drafted by the International Standards Organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ISO) link the use of particular designs and materials with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strength requirements suitable for those designs and materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the SNPRM, NHTSA requested comment on the appropriateness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of requiring CNG containers to meet design and material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, such as those specified in NGV2, and to meet safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors tailored to those requirements. The agency also asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the effect of adopting NGV2 on future container technology,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the only way a container manufacturer could comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal standard would be by producing a container that uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those materials and designs specified in NGV2 if the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated NGV2's material and design provisions in the FMVSS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an alternative approach, the agency asked whether it should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify a catch-all high end safety factor for any container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose design and materials are not specified in NGV2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received 18 comments to the December 1993 SNPRM about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopting the design and material specific approach of NGV2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sixteen commenters, including NGVC/AGA, CGA, CNG container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, public utilities, and two bus manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported the proposal to incorporate NGV2 into the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. Eleven commenters supported the safety factors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2. Five others were concerned about the level of some safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors in NGV2 or the use of relatively new materials, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon fiber. CGA and SCI referenced their earlier comments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NPRM, again recommending safety factors of 2.5 for all Type 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers and 3.33 for all Type 3 and Type 4 containers. AAMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Ford opposed the design and material specific approach of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2. AAMA stated that some of NGV2's requirements limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for future development of advance container design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or materials that may not fit in the specifications in NGV2. No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter favored having a catch-all high end safety factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the available information, NHTSA has decided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require CNG containers to meet the safety factors applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the design and material requirements specified in NGV2, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for carbon fiber. Specifically, the agency is specifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate safety factors for containers using various materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., fiberglass, carbon, steel, aluminum) and different designs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (non-composite, hoop wrapped or full wrapped composite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, and welded). The agency believes that this approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will result in the manufacture of safe containers for CNG powered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has decided to adopt the specific safety factors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related requirements set forth in NGV2, except for those safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors specified for carbon fiber. While NGV2 currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifies a safety factor of 2.25 for Type 2, 3, and 4 carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiber containers, NHTSA has decided to specify a safety factor of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.5 for Type 2 carbon fiber containers and 3.33 for the Type 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 4 carbon fiber containers. The agency is requiring a higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factor for Type 3 and 4 containers since the fibers on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those containers carry a greater proportion of the load than on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Type 2 containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA made this decision after reviewing all of the comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and information obtained in response to both the NPRM and SNPRM;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings with container manufacturers, CGA and NGVC/AGA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions with other Federal agencies, including RSPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and information were presented to support safety factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for carbon fiber containers, ranging from 2.25 to 3.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brunswick, in particular, submitted substantial test data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other technical information in support of NGV2's 2.25 safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor for carbon fiber, including testing it performed on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers which showed favorable results. RSPA recommended a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factor of not less than 3.0 for carbon fiber, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with its FRP&hyph;1 and FRP&hyph;2 standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATO PLANS TRIP-WIRE GERMAN DEFENSE;  </P> <P> MILITARY: CONGRESS IS TOLD THAT A THIN LINE OF TROOPS WILL GUARD THE NATION'S  EASTERN BORDER.  </P> <P> In the wake of German unification, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is  adopting a strategy in which a thin trip-wire line of troops will guard  Germany's border with East Europe, in place of the shoulder-to-shoulder  contingents that have been facing the Iron Curtain, a senior Pentagon officer  told Congress on Thursday.  </P> <P> But in the first Senate hearing on the unification treaty signed by the United  States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the two former German states,  lawmakers expressed reservations about its possible impact on U.S. national  security.  </P> <P> Although Bush Administration officials remained upbeat about the pact,  described as "the peace treaty of World War II," there were indications that  U.S. and German interests already are diverging as a result of unification and  a separate agreement between Bonn and Moscow governing the withdrawal of Soviet  troops.  </P> <P> Defense and State department officials were pressed at Thursday's hearing, for  example, to explain provisions of the unification pact that authorize the  presence of more Soviet troops than U.S. forces on German soil for the next few  years.  </P> <P> "How does NATO defend borders with Soviet forces garrisoned within them?" asked  Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who presided over  the hearing. "What will be the mission of American troops? Where will they be  deployed? Against what threat?"  </P> <P> Other senators noted pointedly that the cost of maintaining the Soviet forces  will be paid by the Germans under a recent agreement between the two countries,  while U.S. troops in Germany will remain a financial burden on hard-pressed  American taxpayers.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. John Sewall, representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the  new NATO strategy in Germany as seeking "to transition from forward defense  toward forward presence."  </P> <P> Forces near the German border will be "smaller, with greater emphasis on  mobility and versatility than in the current NATO structure, to allow maximum  flexibility in times of crisis," Sewall said.  </P> <P> The general said that nuclear weapons would "continue to fulfill an essential  role in overall alliance strategy to deter war," although future emphasis would  be placed "on making nuclear weapons truly weapons of last resort."  </P> <P> Sewall said that NATO deployments now involve huge contingents stationed side  by side.  </P> <P> The new doctrine will place a smaller force in position not so close to the  border, with a larger mobile reserve in the rear ready to move to counter any  attack. "I'd call it defense of the border, rather defense on the border,"  Sewall said.  </P> <P> He noted, however, that the unification treaty prevents any NATO forces from  being stationed on East German territory. Only German territorial forces, akin  to border guards and operating outside the NATO structure, may be deployed  there until Soviet troops are withdrawn by the end of 1994, according to the  treaty and a separate Soviet-German agreement.  </P> <P> Even after the Soviets leave, only German troops can move into the eastern  territory. U.S. and other NATO forces will be required to get permission from  the German government to fly over or conduct ground exercises in the area, said  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James F. Dobbins Jr. Such exercises  probably will be limited to 13,000 or fewer troops.  </P> <P> The restrictions on U.S. forces, Sewall said, "are acceptable."  </P> <P> He added: "Extended warning time and the virtual removal of possibilities for a  short-warning attack on NATO countries by the Warsaw Pact dramatically reduce  the risk associated with these restrictions."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Josip Manolic, chairman of the Chamber of </F> Counties of the Croatian Assembly, by Heni Erceg; place and date  not given: "Susak Must Go"]    [Excerpt] [Erceg] To what extent will the Washington  agreement, which envisages the end of the war between the  Muslims and Croats, help toward the settlement of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina? How can the Bosnian Serbs be won to sign  the agreement?    [Manolic] This agreement is opening the door to the  settlement of all problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, it  is much easier to solve the problem between the Muslims and the  Croats than that with the Serbs. The war between the Muslims  and the Croats should have never started, and was more the case  of unfortunate circumstances than of policies working in the  interests of either the Muslim or the Croat sides. In the search  for the answer to the question of how to include the Bosnian  Serbs in the negotiations, one should go back to the beginning  of the Serbian aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic  cleansing, and the killing, which resulted in the conquest of  about 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Despite this, Serbia did not manage to force its opponents to  capitulate. This fact will actually affect their future  conduct. They will have to decide whether to carry on with the  war to the end, until the military defeat of one or the other  side, or stop at this point and join efforts to solve the future  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic and those around him will, in  any case, have to explain to their people why the war was waged  and why lives have been lost.  <H5>  Why Were Lives Lost? </H5>   [Erceg] Will the Croatian politicians who accepted the war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina have to answer the same question?    [Manolic] Yes, this question will also be raised here,  although I think that it is more important at present to  concentrate efforts on the consistent implementation of the  agreement. This means observing peace, searching for an  internal solution that would suit everyone in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and providing constitutional guarantees to  each group.    [Erceg] You are therefore not questioning common life in  Bosnia, like some other politicians who have been claiming for  some time that cohabitation in this state has always been false?    [Manolic] Those who have been advocating such views, in the  Assembly and outside it, should today feel ashamed of their  statements, because these statements were not founded on either  Bosnia-Herzegovina's past or present.    [Erceg] So, there is a sudden turnabout in attitudes toward  the Muslims. President Tudjman says that the current denouement  is the result of "consistency in Croatia's policies." What do  you think about this? Has this policy indeed been consistent?    [Manolic] The thesis that is in circulation, as you can see,  is that there is no turnabout in the policy and that this policy  has consistently been implemented. However, if one looks at the  development of Croatian-Muslim relations, one could see  turnabouts and changes. Did we not first wage a war with the  Muslims against the common enemy, the Serbs, did we not then  clash with the Muslims, and are we not, today, again looking for  ways of cohabiting in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a peaceful solution  to the conflict? Every normal person will conclude that two  turnabouts were made. I do not have anything against everyone  adhering to their own assertions and theses. However, one  should not impose one's own views, by using deceits and by  passing the ball to the opponents' court, that all those who  have been claiming that the war against the Muslims should never  have taken place, or that such destruction and genocide, for  which both sides are responsible, were unnecessary, were wrong.    [Erceg] You, Stipe Mesic, and some other people were in  favor of preserving Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole. Why were you  not listened to?    [Mesic] The situation in politics is not the same as in the  army. The dispute in the Croatian Democratic Community, which  happened over the policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, was won by  the faction that, favoring the war option in Bosnia, did not  anticipate all the consequences for Croatia and its interests.   <H5>    Minority Was Right </H5>   [Erceg] The struggle between two factions in the Croatian  Democratic Community was in fact a struggle for Tudjman's  support. The solution to many problems, including that of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, depended on this support.    [Manolic] It is normal that a faction that prevails in  politics should play the lead role. One can remain in a  minority with his own views, but this, of course, does not mean  that one is wrong. This only means that one should let time  reveal the value of his policies.    [Erceg] Will the proponents of such a Croatian policy be an  obstacle to the realization of the Croatian-Muslim agreement or  will they have to go?    [Manolic] The values of the multiparty system are such that  even the line detrimental to the state can win sometimes. The  Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina in the last two years  has been between a rock and a hard place. While the opposition  and the ruling party were united over the Serbian aggression,  they were divided over the clash between the Croats and the  Muslims.    [Erceg] I will repeat the question: Will some people  represent an obstacle....?    [Manolic] Yes, a number of people will be an obstacle to the  realization of the agreement with the Muslims.    [Erceg] Who are these people?    [Manolic] Gojko Susak [defense minister], for instance. He  should not be seen only as a carrier pigeon between Zagreb and  Grude, but also as a man responsible for that policy, as well as  for statements and moves regarding the clash between the Croats  and the Muslims.    [Erceg] Why do such people not resign and why is the  institution of resignation almost unknown in politics in Croatia?    [Manolic] This only means that the mechanism of democratic  institutions is not sufficiently effective to force the people  responsible for the conflict to resign.    [Erceg] Were you ever afraid of a conflict among the Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the duality in the Croatian  politics: Two completely different policies were applied toward  the Croats in Herzegovina and the Croats in central Bosnia.    [Manolic] You know, about 10 months ago a proponent of the  war option asked me: "Why are the Herzegovina Croats fighting at  all when one half of the Croatian nation is against their  Herceg-Bosna?" This question has not been answered to this date.  Both history and the proponents of that policy will have to  answer this question. [passage omitted]</p>

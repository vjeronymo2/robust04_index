			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: The FO mandarins decoded - Robert Mauthner enjoys some diplomatic inside knowledge INSIDE THE FOREIGN OFFICE by John Dickie Chapmans Pounds 20, 338 pages MORE THAN any department of state, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has succeeded in shrouding itself in an aura of mystique and elitism which has elicited both the admiration and irritation of the public and Parliament. In the words of the latest work attempting to break down its hallowed portals: 'Those on the inside are bound by a code of confidentiality which inhibits the disclosure of affairs of state in any detail that might be damaging to the best interests of the country. Those on the outside . . . are not normally trusted to have access to anything or anyone in the Foreign Office which could result in the outside world getting to know what is really going on inside.' Things are not quite as bad as they are sometimes painted, however. Foreign Office mandarins, though often imbued with a sense of their own superiority  -just like those of the Treasury or the grands corps in France - have proved to be more accessible during the last decade or two. Nowadays, some are even prepared to talk to journalists they know well, ('off the record,' of course), though the knowledge imparted in these conversations is only rarely of the kind to produce banner headlines. John Dickie, the immensely experienced, if sometimes endearingly irascible, Diplomatic Correspondent of the Daily Mail from 1960 until his retirement last year, has been more successful than most of his fellow mortals in penetrating the veils of secrecy which envelop Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's impressive Victorian palace in King Charles Street. One of the last of the dying breed of Fleet Street prima donnas, Dickie, habitually sporting a carnation even in the desert, can claim to have covered most of the major international events and conferences of the last 30 years. He has liberally drawn on his long experience, complemented by as many as 150 interviews with senior diplomats, international civil servants and politicians, in his book, Inside the Foreign Office. This is a painstaking and thoroughly researched study of both the way the FO works, the personalities and policies of the Foreign Secretaries who have led it, from Lord Home to Mr Douglas Hurd, and some of the most dramatic events in which they and their officials were the leading actors, the work highlights both the department's strengths and weaknesses. In particular, Dickie tempers his admiration for the intellectual brilliance of some of the most outstanding mandarins of the period covered - Sir Nicholas Fenn, Sir Michael Palliser, Sir David Hannay, Sir John Kerr, to name but a few of those earning a place in the author's hall of fame - with telling statistics underlining the restrictive nature of the FO's recruitment system. In spite of recent efforts to broaden the selection process, the great majority of candidates recommended for appointments in the Diplomatic Service - about 70 per cent over the last few years - still come from Oxford or Cambridge, while women continue to obtain no more than 30 per cent of the places , at the very most. Without professing to be a political history of the 30-year period during which the author had a grandstand view of the conduct of British foreign policy, the book affords some illuminating insights into what happened behind the scenes of major events. The patience and dedication shown by Lord Carrington and his officials, including the present Ambassador to the US, Sir Robin Renwick, in negotiating against tremendous odds the Lancaster House agreement leading to the independence of Zimbabwe, is analysed in some detail, as is the same Foreign Secretary's failure to read the writing on the wall before the Argentine invasion of the Falklands. As one would expect from a journalist, amusing anecdotes are not lacking about 'the helmsmen' at the Foreign Office, but he never descends into caricature. Thus Lord Home, whose nomination as Foreign Secretary in 1960 by Harold Macmillan was described by the Daily Mirror as 'the most reckless political appointment since the Roman Emperor Caligula made his favourite horse a consul,' is shown to be a particularly tough and effective negotiator with the Russians, as demonstrated by his expulsion of 105 suspected Soviet agents. Neither is George Brown's often intemperate behaviour allowed to distort the picture of a Foreign Secretary wholeheartedly dedicated to getting Britain into the European Community. The much-publicised conflicts between the Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street during Margaret Thatcher's last years of office are put in their proper historical perspective. The author stresses that this phenomenon is nothing new. Churchill dominated Eden at the Foreign Office, while he, in turn, did the same to Selwyn Lloyd. Wilson did not hesitate to take over foreign policy in spite of the resentment of his Foreign Secretaries Michael Stewart and George Brown. But at the end of the day, even Mrs Thatcher surrounded herself with Foreign Office mandarins as her close advisers, including, notably, her all-powerful private secretary, Charles Powell. She may not have liked the institution, but she certainly respected and liked its top of the range products.</p>

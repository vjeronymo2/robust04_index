			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Stores receive customer praise MOST shoppers believe high-street retailers generally provide good service, although a significant minority have strong grievances about grumpy staff, says a report from the National Consumer Council published today. The organisation's survey of almost 2,000 shoppers in March showed that a quarter of respondents thought at least one type of store provided poor customer care. Many complained vociferously about unhelpful staff, poor service and long check-out queues at supermarkets. 'Little seems to have changed since we last asked about the high street 12 years ago,' the council said. Consumer Concerns 1992. National Consumer Council, 20 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W ODH.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLD COMFORT;  </P> <P> BOUILLABAISSE: SOME LIKE IT COLD;  </P> <P> FISH SOUP: THIS CHILLY VERSION IS MOLDED LIKE A SALAD.  </P> <P> It's never too hot for bouillabaisse. When the temperature gets out of hand,  you simply eat it cold. The idea comes from Michael Hutchings of Michael's  Waterside in Santa Barbara, who makes a chilly version that is molded like a  salad.  </P> <P> Hutching's soup is not for quick-and-easy cooks. The procedures aren't  difficult, but they require time and patience. An expert like Hutchings can  prepare a rich fish aspic that sets naturally or with a little help from leaf  gelatin, which most of us can't obtain. We've taken the frustration out of that  step by adding enough ordinary gelatin to guarantee a perfect result.  </P> <P> Hutchings sets off the mold with a vibrant tomato relish seasoned with  licorice-tasting fennel. An infusion of saffron and white wine finishes off the  rouille, the mayonnaise-like sauce that traditionally accompanies bouillabaisse  along with crisp slices of French bread.  </P> <P> WATERSIDE BOUILLABAISSE  </P> <P> 1 pound salmon fillet  </P> <P> 1 pound white sea bass  </P> <P> 1 pound snapper fillet  </P> <P> 1 pound choice of other fresh fish  </P> <P> 1 cup julienned carrots  </P> <P> 1 cup julienned leek  </P> <P> 1 cup julienned fennel  </P> <P> 2 1/2 quarts Fish Gelee  </P> <P> 30 shrimp  </P> <P> 30 medium black mussels  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons lightly chopped fennel fronds  </P> <P> Tomato Relish  </P> <P> Sauce Rouille  </P> <P> Lightly toasted sliced French bread  </P> <P> Cut salmon, sea bass, snapper and selected fresh fish into 2-ounce portions.  Steam each fish until just done, 3 to 6 minutes. Chill until completely cold.  Blanch carrots, leek and fennel in salted water until crisp-tender. Drain and  chill.  </P> <P> Place layer of melted Fish Gelee in bottom of 3-quart bowl. Refrigerate until  set. Arrange some of shrimp, mussels and fennel fronds in attractive pattern  that will show when bouillabaisse is unmolded. Add another layer of gelee and  chill until firm. Continue layering fish, shrimp, mussels, fennel, julienned  vegetables and gelee until bowl is filled. Chill several hours or overnight.  </P> <P> To serve, invert bowl on large chilled platter. Place hot cloth on bowl to  release gelee, then remove bowl. Garnish with Tomato Relish. Pass Sauce Rouille  and French bread.

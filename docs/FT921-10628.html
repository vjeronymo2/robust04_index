			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Appointments: Electricity shops around The joint retailing venture between Eastern Electricity and Southern Electric which opens its doors on April 1 has hired 43-year-old Eamon Bradley, managing director of Swan National Motors, as its new chief executive. His finance director will be Neal Gossage, 36, formerly chief accountant at Argos, and Malcolm Byrne, until now retailing business manager at Eastern, becomes director of marketing. Byrne acknowledges the going will be tough - as underscored by Rumbelow's recent exodus from high street retailing. But he believes that by sharpening up the image, moving increasingly out of town and expanding in home leisure products, the privatised companies' merged resources can appeal to a younger and more up-market clientele. Speaking yesterday from a conference on compact disc interactive systems, he suggested that tuning into the next generation of consumer goods was one way to claim a leading position in electrical retailing. Eastern Electricity has moved Bill Watson, engineering director since 1986, to the new position of business development director. Watson's old job goes to David Mee, who was previously area general manager for Thameside. Neil McCrossan is promoted to sales director of EURODOLLAR UK. ***** TI has promoted Kenneth Templeton to the new position of finance director of Bundy International and Miles Vere-Hodge to the new position of finance director of John Crane International. ***** Nick Cannar, who specialised in intellectual property licensing while head of the legal department and company secretary of BAT, is moving to become a partner of Phillips &amp; Buck, a member of the Eversheds national practice. ***** David Newcombe, formerly finance director, is appointed to chief executive of PHILIP HARRIS HOLDINGS. ***** Manfred Herwig has been appointed md of THERMOFIL POLYMERS (UK). ***** Christopher Smart is promoted to president and md of JETSAVE, in place of Ronald Blakey who becomes chairman. ***** Kevin Prichard is appointed md of LAB M, a subsidiary of Amersham International. ***** Stephen Greenwood, formerly finance director of TURRIFF, is appointed finance director of BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. ***** Richard Case will become md of WESTLAND HELICOPTERS in May following the retirement of John Varde at the end of April. Case joined Westland as an apprentice in 1961. ***** Karen Thomas is appointed property development director of the WELSH DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. ***** Kembrey, the Slough-based electrical components manufacturer plagued by months of boardroom acrimony, has looked outside its immediate circle of troubles by appointing David Burnet as the new non-executive chairman. Burnet's name came up from the 3i panel for the promotion of independent directors. 3i, which has a considerable call for nominee directors in the course of its activities, is a shareholder in Kembrey. Michael Cleary, back in the chief executive's seat after being ousted last December, says that an independent chairman acting as a cohesive force was necessary to convince institutional shareholders that Kembrey was back on course. Former chairman Bob Burns, who with Cleary owns 26 per cent of the company, remains a director. Burnet, 64, an Australian, currently chairs two management buy-out companies, Test-link and CMR. He has had a fair amount of experience reorganising companies in difficulties, including Bardsey, the hand-tool distributor, of which he was non-executive chairman until 1990, the year in which it was acquired by the Beckenham Group.</p>

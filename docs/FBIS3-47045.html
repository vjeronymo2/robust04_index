			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Jan 94 Morning </F> Edition]    [Text] According to a survey the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] conducted of Diet members affiliated with the  party, a majority of SDPJ Dietmen favored joining hands with the  Japan New Party [JNP] and the Sakigake [Harbinger] Party in the  event of a regrouping of political parties. On the issue of the  consumption tax, around 60 percent of the pollees expressed  conditional approval.    The SDPJ organ SHAKAI SHIMPO conducted a survey of all Diet  members belonging to the SDPJ-Goken Minshu Rengo [Democratic  Alliance to Safeguard the Constitution, the SDPJ's floor  grouping in the Diet] from late November to early December.  Results of the poll were published in the 1 January issue of  the paper.    Valid answers were received from 112, or 74.3 percent, of  all  pollees.    To the question "which parties should the SDPJ join hands  with in the forthcoming regrouping of political parties?" (more  than one answer possible), 30.4 percent favored the JNP, topping  the list, followed by 29.5 percent opting for Sakigake, and 28.6  for the United Social Democratic Party. Both the Komeito and  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] received minimal support at 3.6  and 1.8 percent, respectively, indicating the strong antipathy  toward these two parties. While none of the pollees cited the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the Japan Communist Party as  possible partners, as many as 21.4 percent of the SDPJ Dietmen  polled preferred to cooperate with "certain LDP members."    As to the decisive political value in the regrouping of the  political parties (more than one answer possible), 42.9 percent  said the crucial issue would be whether a party "gives priority  to human rights, welfare, and the environment, or to development  and economic growth," followed by 41.4 percent stressing whether  it "favors dominant power for the consumers [seikatsusha,  consumers in the broad sense] or for the state," and 39.3  percent attaching importance to whether it "defends the  Constitution or attempts to amend it."    With regard to the "steering of the coalition government," a  considerable majority, 53.6 percent, favored "enhancing unity in  the administration while gradually realizing the SDPJ's  political ideas." On the other hand, those attaching more  importance to the coalition, asserting "the party's basic  policies should be further revised to support the coalition  government more forcefully" made up only 18.8 percent, while  17.9 percent favored cooperation outside the framework of the  cabinet, and 0.9 percent advocated secession from the coalition.    According to the poll, 58 percent expressed the opinion that  the consumption tax "should be tolerated somehow," far exceeding  the 22.3 percent who opted for "abolition" of the tax -- which  was a SDPJ electoral promise -- or the 11.6 percent who favored  "changing this to a specific-purpose tax."    SDPJ Deputy Secretary General Masanori Goto wrote in the  SHAKAI SHIMPO that "Our stance is different from that of the  Komeito and Shinseito. The image the SDPJ wants to create has  become quite clear. I think the `social democratic label' will  be the key word in the regrouping of political parties."</p>

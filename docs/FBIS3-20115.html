			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radical leader Marco Pannella by Marco </F> Stanganelli; place and date not given: "Pannella: `I Will Tell  You Who the Real Demon Is'"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Stanganelli] Why are you  running alone...?    [Pannella] I had asked [Italian Popular Party, PPI,  Secretary] Martinazzoli, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, [former  Socialist Prime Minister] Amato, and [former Italian Liberal  Party Secretary] Zanone to constitute a pole against the  alliance between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [National  Alliance leader] Fini in Rome. They did not even answer. We  made a "free" offer to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left],  Greens, and AD [Democratic Alliance] to provide "reformist"  support against the MSI [Italian Social Movement] candidates in  all the center-south. They did not even say no. In reality,  they much prefer Fini who for them is not only "better than  Berlusconi" but also better than Pannella. We have all heard  [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto say that he likes Fini. What  happened between 1976 and 1979, when only half of the MSI  candidates became part of the "national unity" will happen again  under the new legislature. This time they will all enter with  flying colors.    [Stanganelli] But was Achille Occhetto's comment not simply  a  gesture of electoral fair play?    [Pannella] Fair play! In the clash against the "demon"  Berlusconi, they brought a well-known respected person like  [Budget Minister] Spaventa, who is undisputably a layman, into  the game. Instead they put an amiable Rete member, who is  entirely innocuous against Fini. Even this is a sure sign that  they are now officially ready for national unity as far as the  MSI leader is concerned. Anthropological and cultural unity for  those who were antifascists and who could not be distinguished  from the fascists for many years. [passage omitted]    [Stanganelli] There is already talk of the postelection  government. The Left is talking of Ciampi whom you supported  some time back. What about now?    [Pannella] I supported the financial bills of the Ciampi and  Amato governments with loyalty, but when the Ciampi government  completed its task, became a branch of the progressives and  [President] Scalfaro, and misgoverned with tens of decrees, I  drew my conclusions. It should be remembered that the role of  the governors of the Bank of Italy was substantially to cover up  for the dysfunctions and the rotten nature of our economic,  financial, and banking system. The "good" Ciampi is politically  innocuous, disarmed, at the mercy of the existing powers who  still want him at Palazzo Chigi [government seat] or in the seat  of the uncomfortable Scalfaro.    [Stanganelli] A lot of people want to see your friend  Scalfaro retire ahead of time.    [Pannella] I think that he was and remains the only  constitutional, reasonable, and honest barrier against the  increasingly more corrupt politics, parties, and newspapers.  They tried, and will try to lynch him and knock him down using  any means possible: from [LA REPUBBLICA editor] Scalfari to the  progressives, from the red magistrates to the "moderate" press,  from the fascists and troublemakers to the secret service.    [Stanganelli] Who do you consider to be most suitable head  of  government in Italy for the Second Republic?    [Pannella] Contrary to what Segni and Berlusconi seemed to  think, the new parliament will decide who the prime minister  will be, that is the Sunday [27 March] elections will decide.  Foreseeably, this means the former PCI [Italian Communist  Party], DC [Christian Democratic Party], and MSI: the actors I  fear will ruin our country, making it worse than before, if we  are not there. Without boasting, our possible absence -- if the  gray card for the proportional vote is not used to guarantee our  presence -- could risk being a heavy burden. If it was not for  us we would have had Arnaldo Forlani [DC] or Giulio Andreotti  [DC] at the Quirinale [president's palace] in 1992.    [Stanganelli] Finally Pannella, given the difficulties of  your list, do you not think that you are running the risk of  being expelled from parliament after almost 20 years? How will  you face your second 60 years as a full-time, round-the-clock  politician?    [Pannella] If the voters -- of the Right, Left, center, or  whoever they may be -- do not vote for the Pannella list on the  gray card to make us get more than 4 percent, we will no longer  be in this republic nor in parliament. For 30 years they said  that if it was not for us they would have had to invent us.  They can "invent" us if they like. We are not the ones that  should be afraid. We have, once again, opted for solitude  because as [20th century philosopher] Benedetto Croce said, in  the history of a country it is sometimes necessary to have men  for whom "Paris is not worth a mass." I chose seat 24 in Rome  and the proportional lists because if you do not take a risk you  cannot reap the benefits of things that are worth being  attempted. Neither for myself, nor for the others.</p>

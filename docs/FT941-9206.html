			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / MPs put financial regulation under the microscope: Roland Rudd and David Wighton on the parliamentary probe into a system that is supposed to protect investors The first detailed parliamentary scrutiny of the regulation of financial services since the establishment eight years ago of the Financial Services Act begins today. Against a background of controversy over the mis-selling of personal pensions and home-income plans, MPs from the all-party Commons Treasury and civil service committee believe the timing of their inquiry could not be better. During the next five months the committee will take evidence from the existing self-regulating organisations, the fledgling Personal Investment Authority, the Securities and Investments Board, and Treasury ministers before compiling a report to be published before the summer recess. Mr Nicholas Budgen, a Conservative member of the committee, says the MPs involved begin the investigation with different, but strongly held prejudices. 'Most of the Labour members believe that a good look at the regulatory system will uncover the rottenness of the capitalist system.' While not sharing such sentiments Mr Budgen, a rightwinger, will be probing the witnesses to see whether existing regulations serve the market. Mr John Watts, the Conservative chairman, has identified five main questions that his committee will try to answer. To what extent is self-regulation working? The decision of three leading companies to oppose plans for the PIA, which is intended to act as the self-regulating organisation for the retail financial sector, has infuriated ministers. Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life which has withdrawn its support from the PIA, will argue that the present regulatory structure was set up to accommodate self-regulation that has 'in practice faded out of existence'. Mr Stretton, who is giving evidence to the committee on March 9, says: 'I fear that in the short term the course of regulation is set and that the PIA will come about. But I very much hope that the committee will take the view that regulation has not reached its long-term resting place.' What is the cost of regulation? Mr Neil Hamilton, the DTI minister responsible for de-regulation, has questioned whether the Financial Services Act had not given rise to too much costly red tape. For many Tory members this goes to the heart of the problem of trying to roll back the boundaries of regulation without damaging the existing regulatory structure. Is it still appropriate for Lloyd's and the insurance industry to be regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry? The Treasury has kept its distance from this role for two main reasons. First, the department did not want to 'take on more than it could chew', as one official put it. Second, it has never liked the concept of being directly responsible for regulation of an industry. There is a strong body of opinion among some members of the committee that the Treasury should take over responsibility for all regulation. For that reason the MPs also question the Department of Social Security's responsibility for pensions. How will regulation on the Continent affect British consumers? Will companies try to register in Luxembourg, for example, which has less strenuous regulations than Britain, only to operate in the UK? Mr Watts says his committee is concerned that there is no 'regulation arbitrage' in the future. Is the government co-ordinating regulation efficiently? The Home Income Support Group, which is giving evidence today, has voiced its concern to Mr Watts that there was no lead regulatory co-ordinator to turn to when people lost out on investments. Investment-linked home-income schemes were devised in the late 1980s as a way for (mostly elderly) investors to unlock capital in their homes. Many of the schemes were sold as 'safe' investments, with people unaware of the risks. 'For all the Treasury's reluctance', says one senior member of the committee, 'it would be surprising if it was not forced to take on an even bigger regulatory role following our investigation.'</p>

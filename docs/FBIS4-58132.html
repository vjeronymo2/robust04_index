			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] Jordan will send an observer to a round of  multilateral talks on Middle East disarmament scheduled to be  held in Doha, Qatar, this week. Diplomatic sources said Jordan  will continue to send low-key participants to the multilateral  talks until action was taken on the siege of al-'Aqabah.    This is the second time that Jordan will be staying away  from  active participation in the Middle East multilateral talks since  it announced that rejoining the talks hinged upon an end to  interceptions by Western warships of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels.    The naval inspections, which are part of the enforcement of  sanctions against Iraq, have cost the Kingdom $1.3 billion in  extra freight and delays caused by diversions of ships from the  port of al-'Aqabah.</p>

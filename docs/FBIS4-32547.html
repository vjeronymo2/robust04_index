			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] S. Padori reports on the expanding  capacity of the REK (Republic Electric Power Combine) "Bitola"  in an article on page 7 in the Macedonian-language Skopje daily  VECER, published on 19 May. The Bitola plant, which is the  largest in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM),  will expand its generating capacity by 45 megawatts when the  overhaul is completed toward the end of September. According to  Padori, the three heat and power units that have generated 210  megawatts each will be renovated, raising the capacity of each  unit to 225 megawatts, thus increasing the Bitola plant's  capacity to 675 megawatts.    The idea of expanding the capacity of REK "Bitola" dates  from  the signing of an agreement with Russian partners from Saint  Petersburg in October by Mr. Podoljski. According to the  assistant director of the Bitola plant, Pande Lazarevski, it is  significant that the increased power capacity can be obtained  with the small investment of $4.5 million, or about $100,000 per  megawatt.</p>

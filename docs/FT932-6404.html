			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Leading Article: A welcome thaw in Beijing MR CHRIS PATTEN might have longed to be part of the traffic in Downing Street yesterday. But in the governor's mansion in Hong Kong, he can take heart from a thawing of the Chinese freeze on discussions imposed in response to the constitutional proposals he made last October. The business of the Joint Liaison Group, the body overseeing the detail of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty, has resumed with China's approval of franchises for electricity, cable television and land-fill. It was announced yesterday that the Sino-British Airport Committee would meet on June 4 to discuss financing for Hong Kong's new airport - China has withheld agreement on funding arrangements because of its opposition to Mr Patten's proposals. Most important, talks in Beijing on Hong Kong's constitution have progressed through three rounds and appear to have gone beyond the initial exhaustive statement of principles. Though they seem still some distance - perhaps months - from the end, they are evidence of a more practical approach from Beijing. Six-month aberration Critics of Mr Patten's style of dealing with China say that London-Beijing relations have returned to previous practice after a six-month aberration caused by his proposals. What they mean is that things were successfully agreed in secret discussions in Beijing, and then announced to the people of Hong Kong. Mr Patten broke with that style, announcing his proposals without consulting the Chinese, and trying to expand the role of Hong Kong's legislators in the decision-making process. But according to the critics, Sino-British dealings have now reverted to the smoke-filled room: a secretly negotiated deal will emerge, to be nodded through by the Legislative Council. If an agreement does emerge from the Beijing talks, it is certainly difficult to imagine Legco stopping it - though it is to be strongly hoped that it will be framed with the need for its approval in mind. Such an accord may well represent a substantial watering down of Mr Patten's plan to broaden the electoral franchise. However, it would be wrong to suggest that Mr Patten's approach had been fruitless. It has already produced lively, democratic debate in Hong Kong itself, of precisely the nature China did not want to see. Mr Patten may succeed in broadening democracy while preserving convergence with the post-1997 Basic Law. Beijing's invective The invective which Beijing has hurled at Mr Patten has neither forced him to back down nor undermined his popular support in Hong Kong. The cards which Mr Patten holds - the importance of Hong Kong's prosperity to China's growth, the huge investment stake held by China in the territory - have gradually asserted themselves as factors which China must take into account. And China has returned to the negotiating table. China has larger reasons for wanting a smooth transition which secures Hong Kong's prosperity. Its international image has become increasingly important to it. China desperately wants to be awarded the Olympic Games in 2000. It wanted - and has all but obtained - renewal by President Bill Clinton of its most-favoured nation trading status. It has tried hard to keep such issues away from Hong Kong which it regards as something separate, to be negotiated only with London. But the country's increasing openness to the world inevitably means that issues become linked. China's desire for reunification with Taiwan - its highest foreign policy priority - is the biggest reason for Beijing to want to ensure stability in Hong Kong. The growing desire in Taiwan for de jure independence from China  -anathema to leaders both in Beijing and Taipei - has already led to 'unofficial' mainland/Taiwan talks and agreement to hold more. China will want to be seen as a good landlord in Hong Kong because its actions will be closely watched from Taiwan. This may be Hong Kong's best and longest-term insurance policy. It certainly underlines the importance of a sensible outcome to the Beijing talks, not only for the participants, but also for anyone with a stake in this dynamic region.</p>

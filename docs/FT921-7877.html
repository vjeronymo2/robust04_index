			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cape fruit welcomed back to the fold - Life after sanctions for South African exporters WHEN MRS Margaret Thatcher visited South Africa last May, she was rapturously received by a business community deeply grateful for her committed stand against sanctions over the years. The deciduous fruit industry went so far as to name a new cultivar of nectarine Margaret's Pride in her honour. Ironically, when Unifruco, the overseas marketing arm for the industry, tried last December to send Mrs Thatcher a sample of the first crop, it fell foul of the customs authorities and was impounded for two days. Unifruco have been more fortunate, however, in their own commercial activities. Indeed, the lifting of most trade sanctions against South African goods has been an enormous boost to the local fruit industry. Earlier this month Mr Louis Kriel, Unifruco's chief executive, was in Europe, partly to celebrate a century of fruit exports from the Cape and partly in an effort to increase further the market penetration of South African agricultural goods into European markets. He wears a slightly bigger hat than a year ago when Unifruco was only concerned with the export of deciduous fruit. Since then arrangements have been struck with the citrus and wine industries whereby Unifruco will also have a hand in distributing their products. On the citrus side, a joint venture company Fresh Fruit Services was set up. The logic of the tie-up is that it allows the two industries to rationalise service functions, like promotion, quality control, logistics and finance and systems, because their seasons are largely complimentary, although overlapping for a short period. The result is a ten month season over which to utilise resources. The deal also boosts Unifruco's negotiating clout. Mr Kriel comments: 'We can negotiate on behalf of 70m boxes of fruit instead of 40m (deciduous) and 30m (citrus) in Europe'. A further reason for the deal is that although the Citrus industry for the most part is in the Northern Transvaal, with the deciduous fruit industry in the Western Cape, many Cape farmers are planting soft citrus fruits as a means of spreading risk and to take advantage of the growth in the market. Unifruco's venture into wine is through a company called Vinfruco, an export company launched late last year as a joint venture between Unifruco and a consortium of co-operative wineries and independent estates in the Stellenbosch region. Mr Kriel says Vinfruco is a response to requests from some of their farmers and European supermarkets who discerned a demand for South African packaged wines to return to their shelves. 'South Africa has the potential to be the latest fashionable new world wine discovery' says Mr Kriel. Vinfruco, which has launched two red and two white wines under the 'Oak Village' label, will focus on the supermarket trade. Mr Kriel says their aim is to sell 30,000 cases in the first year, with ambitions to 'multiply that extensively'. In terms of their existing market, Mr Kriel says that post-sanctions Unifruco is finding it can at last compete with its competitors as regards promotional activities. 'We are being measured only on the intrinsic value of our product. That gives us a lot of confidence because we can see how we're gaining on our competitors.' He estimates that in the new southern hemisphere season, Unifruco has supplied at least 30 per cent more fruit to Europe than in past years, and demand has certainly not grown by that amount. He says their aim is to get to more than 50 per cent of European Community southern hemisphere imports. In the 1990-91 season Unifruco exported 35m cartons of fruit, earning R1.4bn (Pounds 280m) gross. Mr Kriel says at the rate things are going, they will reach their target of 50m cartons before 1995. Another change, apart from being able to compete on equal terms, he adds, is that 'we're being treated by a number of organisations who were previously prevented by board decisions from supporting us as long-lost sons'. These organisations believe they suffered by not being able to stock the premium Cape label. Mr Kriel cites the Albert Hein group in Holland as stocking Cape produce for the first time in seven years, and in volumes to rival the large British supermarkets. Mr Kriel says they are under tremendous pressure from the trade to re-enter the American market with a bang. He comments: 'We will be returning, but we will be rebuilding the market. We must recreate the premium image and then develop the volumes'.</p>

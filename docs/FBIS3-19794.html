			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Research: Future of </F> European Research Reactors Fails To Impress"; from Brussels  EUROPE ENVIRONMENT]    [Text] Belgian attempts to guarantee a future for its  experimental nuclear reactor at Mol by making the European Union  [EU] responsible for its survival appear to have been scuppered,  at least for the moment. The draft Council Resolution on the  subject submitted to the Council of Ministers' Research/Atomic  Questions Group during the Belgian Presidency has been struck  off the agenda of the March 4 Research Council after the United  Kingdom, Germany and Ireland insisted this was a problem for the  individual reactor operators to handle, not the EU. The draft  Resolution would need unanimous Council support to be adopted.    The proposed text arguably seeks to kill at least two birds  with one stone. Belgium has never been happy about the  perceived unfair competition from the EU-funded Joint Research  Centre experimental reactor in Petten, the Netherlands, whose  costs -- decommissioning for example -- are calculated on a  somewhat different basis from those of Mol.    The proposal argues that the viability of test reactors (and  EU research reactors in general) depends on finding a long-term  solution for the problem of initial fuel supply and final waste  disposal. Some observers suggest that turning fuel supply into  a Union responsibility could be seen as an attempt by Belgium to  encourage the EU to allow Russia to sell its cheap nuclear fuel  on the EU market. Belgium, with its large nuclear industry but  no domestic nuclear fuel production, would be the obvious  beneficiary.    The Commission is currently negotiating a new Euratom  Agreement on behalf of the EU with the United States on nuclear  materials trade and services amid an international tussle over  whether the United States should take back the spent enriched  uranium it has been supplying to research reactors in Belgium,  Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and  Switzerland.    The main problem area of the Euratom Agreement negotiations  concerns the U.S. demand that it should be able to monitor the  movements of nuclear material of U.S. origin within the EU -- a  proposals which the EU adamantly refuses to countenance. The  proposed text for the Resolution nevertheless includes a clause  stating that the Commission should highlight the importance of  finding a solution for disposing of radioactive waste from  European experimental reactors in its negotiations with  Washington.    EU Energy Commissioner Abel Matutes is expected to take up  the issue of consent rights with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher at a meeting in March.</p>

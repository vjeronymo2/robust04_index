			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / San Marino joins IMF THE International Monetary Fund (IMF) took a step towards its goal of global membership this week as the republics of the former Soviet Union lined up to sign the Washington-based institution's articles, George Graham writes from Washington. But the IMF's 173rd and newest member is a republic of much older vintage: the tiny mountain enclave of San Marino. San Marino has something in common with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, which just beat it to the tape in signing the IMF articles. From 1978 to 1986 it boasted the only communist government in western Europe, and earlier this year, it ousted the former Communist party, which changed its name in 1990 to the Progressive Democratic party, from the governing coalition. Unlike the former Soviet republics, however, San Marino's economy seems unlikely to cause many sleepless night for the IMF staff. Mr Clelio Galassi, secretary of state for finance and the budget, says the government's finances are in balance, with no public debt - the first tenet in the IMF's economic doctrine. Nor does Mr Galassi expect to have to borrow from the Fund.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PASSED BALL IN SEVENTH DOES IN TITANS  </P> <P> One sloppy defensive play by Cal State Fullerton and two outstanding plays by  USC led the Trojans to a 5-4 victory over the Titans in a nonconference  baseball game Tuesday night at USC.  </P> <P> A passed ball charged to Matt Hattabaugh allowed USC to take the lead in the  seventh inning after the Titans had tied the score, 4-4, in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> USC's Bret Boone pinch-hit for Billy Morris to lead off the seventh and doubled  when his hit caromed off the third-base bag. Boone took third on a groundout  and scored on the passed ball to give USC the lead for good.  </P> <P> Fullerton (25-17) had the potential tying run on second base in the ninth  inning. the Titans' Kevin Farlow, who transferred from USC this season, lined  the ball down the left-field line to lead off the inning, but Murph Proctor  made a diving catch.  </P> <P> Phil Nevin followed with a single. Mate Borgogno then hit what appeared to be a  double-play ball toward short, but the ball hit the mound and deflected behind  shortstop Boone. But Boone reached back and made a strong throw to catch  Borgogno at first.  </P> <P> With two outs, Nevin was at second and Rich Gonzales came up to bat. But Jeff  Cirillo got Gonzales to ground out to second to end the game.  </P> <P> The Titans now are 2-8 in one-run games, including a 6-5 loss to USC April 10.  </P> <P> In the fifth inning, Farlow led off with a single and Nevin homered to left,  his 13th of the season and third in the past two games.  </P> <P> Fullerton scored first. Frank Charles led off the second inning with a single,  went to second on a sacrifice, and scored on Matt Hattabaugh's single to left.  The Titans then loaded the bases, but stranded all three runners.  </P> <P> USC's Mark Smith led off the bottom of the inning with a single. Brett Jenkins  then hit his second home run, 400 feet to center field. But Fullerton starter  Rich Faulks retired three consecutive batters to get out of the jam.  </P> <P> USC (32-16) added two runs in the third on Cirillo's two-run home run to take a  4-1 lead.  </P></p>

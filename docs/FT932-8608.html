			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pebereau takes over at BNP MR MICHEL Pebereau, chair-man of the French bank Credit Commercial de France (CCF), is to become the head of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the state-controlled bank that is set to be privatised later this year. The appointment of Mr Pebereau, who succeeds Mr Rene Thomas at the helm of France's third-largest bank, is the first leadership change at a state-owned enterprise since the new government won power seven weeks ago, pledging a sell-off of state assets in order to liberalise the economy and to help reduce the budget deficit. However, the change of leadership at BNP, announced yesterday, bears little resemblance to the politically-motivated personnel changes which occurred when power last alternated between left and right in the 1980s. Mr Thomas, aged 64 and not in the best of health, had indicated he wanted to retire last year, but the then Socialist government was unable to agree on a successor. The 51-year-old Mr Pebereau is well placed to take BNP into the private sector, since he did the same with CCF in 1987. CCF - where Mr Charles de Croisset, one of two managing directors, is tipped to be named later today to succeed Mr Pebereau - has done well since privatisation. It was one of the few French banks to announce a rise in profit last year, up 7.6 per cent to FFr978m (Dollars 181m). By contrast, BNP announced a 26 per cent drop in profit last year to FFr2.17bn. However, this was far better than the 1992 performance turned in by Credit Lyonnais, France's other big state-owned bank, which recorded a FFr1.85bn loss, and keeps BNP in the forefront of institutions that may be privatised. Under Mr Thomas' stewardship since 1982, BNP has had a reputation for cautious expansion. This is not expected to change dramatically, since Mr Daniel Lebegue, one of the internal candidates to succeed Mr Thomas, is staying on as BNP managing director. BNP's main foreign venture has been an agreement to co-operate with Dresdner Bank abroad, particularly in eastern Europe, with the French and German banks eventually aiming to take 10 per cent holdings in each other. This arrangement was endorsed by Dresdner shareholders last week. BNP shareholders - the French state (which holds 72.9 per cent), UAP, the state-owned insurance company (10 per cent) and private shareholders (17.1 per cent) - are expected to endorse the Dresdner deal at their annual meeting later today. But BNP privatisation may be too much for the depressed Paris bourse to digest at one go. At its current share price, BNP, with a FFr1,429bn balance sheet at end-1991, is valued at more than FFr40bn. When the Conservatives were last in power in the mid-1980s, their biggest single sell-off was Societe Generale bank, for FFr18bn.</p>

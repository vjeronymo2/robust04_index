			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW TV SEASON;  </P> <P> THE FALL SEASON: FROM THE OUTER LIMITS TO REAL DOWN TO EARTH PROBLEMS;  </P> <P> NOT EVERYBODY LIVES HAPPILY FOREVER AFTER  </P> <P> A wedding is about to take place on the military chapel set between Maj. John  D. (Mac) MacGillis of the U.S. Marine Corps and Polly Cooper. He's a Vietnam  vet embarking on his first tour of marital duty, she's a liberal-minded  reporter, widowed with three daughters, ages adorable to adolescent.  </P> <P> But before the vows can be said, a matter of protocol must be settled. All  activity has ceased while the proper way to hold swords for the traditional  cutlery canopy through which the couple will exit is discussed. Military buff  and series star Gerald McRaney finally settles it. "You don't hold the blade  down toward the honored couple," he says. The rehearsal for the fourth episode  of CBS' new fall series "Major Dad" can continue; the newlyweds will safely  exit down the aisle. (The episode airs Monday at 8 p.m.)  </P> <P> What can't be so easily settled is what will happen to the couple after they  leave the chapel. They'll be setting off on a path that statisticians claim  real people take 1,300 times a day in this country: They'll be forming a  stepfamily. By the year 1990 (a mere three months off), the Stepfamilies of  America Assn. predicts that step- and single-parent families will outnumber the  traditional nuclear form. By the year 2000, stepfamilies are expected to be in  the majority.  </P> <P> If Mac is anything like the 35 million American stepparents before him, he'll  be faced with emotions and incidents that can frighten, anger and threaten to  tear this union asunder. If things work out, he'll be rewarded with warm and  lasting relationships.  </P> <P> Or, he could end up like previous television stepfolks in such cheerful  fantasies as "The Brady Bunch." If, as the advertising campaign for "Major Dad"  claims, they're just "looking for a few good laughs," reality may not be  allowed to interfere.  </P> <P> Television hasn't been totally blind to the changes in American society over  the past 20 years. It took great delight in exploiting the phenomenon of  single-parent households with such '80s hits as "Who's the Boss?," "Kate &amp;  Allie," "My Two Dads" and "Full House." But these tended to avoid the messiness  of real life. Ex-spouses were conveniently dead or forgotten and children  weren't troubled by the specter of a stepparent. Indeed, Mom or Dad were rarely  allowed to bring their dates indoors . . . unless they happened to be living  under the same roof, as was the case of the hired help in "Who's the Boss?"  Remarriages usually didn't work, ratings or storywise: When Allie landed a man  after five years of living with Kate, he was transferred to a job in another  city -- in what must be a common stepchild fantasy.  </P> <P> There were also some ill-fated attempts at portraying stepfamilies during this  period. Among them was NBC's 1983 mid-season series, "The Family Tree," which  starred Ann Archer and Frank Converse in a tense, hourlong family drama of a  couple's efforts to bring together two sets of kids. Possibly too real for its  time, it was soon axed. That fall, ABC had "It's Not Easy." The half-hour  sitcom sought humor in two remarried exes living across the street from each  other and sharing custody of a pair of kids. The premise proved as impossible  as it might have been in real life and lasted just five episodes.  </P> <P> This season, the networks have introduced a new community of prime-time  stepfamilies. Sunday nights, ABC's "Life Goes On," about a family coping with a  Down's syndrome child, includes a daughter from the husband's first marriage.  NBC is running two limited series featuring stepfamilies on its Sunday night  "Magical World of Disney" hour. In "Parent Trap," Hayley Mills (who as a  teen-ager in the 1961 original "The Parent Trap" played a set of twins scheming  to get their divorced parents back together) will marry the widowed father of  triplets. Referred to by industry insiders as "The Brady Bunch in Hell," "A  Brand New Life" is an hourlong drama-comedy that Perry Simon, NBC's senior vice  president of series programs, says will "capture the bitter as well as the  sweet" of stepfamily life. Barbara Eden plays a divorced waitress and mother of  three who marries Don Murray, a widowed attorney and father of three.  </P> <P> Monday nights on CBS will be the stepfamily hour as "Major Dad" is followed at  8:30 by "The People Next Door." This half-hour sitcom features a widowed  cartoonist with two kids, a new wife and an imagination with a life all its  own.  </P> <P> Among returning shows, "The Cosby Show" on NBC has Lisa Bonet rejoining the  Huxtable fold with a new husband and a 3-year-old stepdaughter. J.R. Ewing's  new bride from last season continues as stepmother to his son on "Dallas," and  among CBS' mid-season replacements is "His &amp; Hers," about a  husband-and-wife marriage counseling team who have custody of his teen-age son  from a previous union and hopes of starting their own family.  </P> <P> So is television ready to tackle the truths of this patched-together family  form? Not necessarily.  </P> <P> "TV doesn't want to do stepfamilies," says Earl Pomerantz, co-executive  producer of "Major Dad." "It's too complicated. Mom and Dad is easier."  </P> <P> Pomerantz, a former producer of "The Cosby Show," drew on his own experiences  as a stepfather for the 1988 mid-season series "Family Man." It was critically  well received, but it was bounced from the schedule for the more traditional  family fare of "The Ten of Us," a "Growing Pains" spinoff.  </P> <P> "It's hard for TV, especially comedy, to do stepparents and do it funny,"  Pomerantz says. "A buffoon dad is easy. What is a stepdad? They're not the most  winning characters. . . . A divorced mother marries another guy, she's not  getting back together with Dad. I don't know what's funny about that."  </P> <P> "Major Dad" did not begin life as a stepfamily show. When CBS committed to  doing a sitcom with "Simon &amp; Simon" star McRaney, he was pitched as a  widowed Marine trying to cope with raising a family alone. The network added  its spin by making the household totally female, to contrast with his all-male  work environment. And rather than making him a widower, co-executive producer  Richard C. Okie says, they paired him with a widow, "so there's a live, adult  relationship happening along with the parenting."  </P> <P> Television, like many stepfamilies, seems to have the most trouble dealing with  the ex-spouses. "Major Dad" is no exception. Okie's instinct and Pomerantz's  personal experiences led them to kill off the stepchildren's biological father.  </P> <P> "We thought it was cleaner," Okie says. "If you add a father, where does he  live, when does he come in and what's his relationship with the family? There's  competition with Mac and already we're into a whole other potentially heavy and  less humorous area."  </P> <P> They have discovered a payload of humor in the power that Polly's three girls  have over Mac, a common situation between stepparent and child.  </P> <P> "They jerk his chain," Okie says. "(The kids) realize they have the reins here  and they enjoy it. I know it happens in stepfamilies. There are cards that  stepkids can play."  </P> <P> And while many stepfamilies would hope for harmony as soon as possible, "Major  Dad" will benefit, its creators believe, by keeping Mac and the children at a  distance for at least the first year.  </P> <P> "We started out with characters who are at A and Z," Okie says, "and we don't  want them to rush to the middle of the alphabet too fast." Mac may melt to the  point of adopting his charges, Okie assures, but it probably won't be until at  least next season.  </P> <P> NBC decided to give its "A Brand New Life" stepfamily a full hour in which to  explore the laughter and the tears. "An hour was better suited to the more  complicated situation a stepfamily poses," Perry Simon says.  </P> <P> The premise is that of a working-class waitress and divorced mother of three,  played by Eden, who marries a successful lawyer and widowed father of three,  played by Murray. On the surface, it might sound familiar, producer-writer  Chris Carter acknowledges, but "it's as far as you can get from 'The Brady  Bunch.' 'The Brady Bunch' had a laugh track, it could be silly, sweet,  schmaltzy, smarmy. It was a product of its time. This show will be a product of  its time."  </P> <P> Thus, there will be stress aplenty. The kids will have clashing values and  territorial battles, while the new wife dukes it out with the old housekeeper.  </P> <P> The new wife's former husband will live nearby, occasionally invading their  lives. When they decide to put her teen-age daughter in private school, the  biological dad will show up to protest. Things probably won't get much  crankier, for now. "I would love to explore the more tragic parts of a blended  family," Carter says. "It's something you have to build an audience for."  Because his immediate goal is to have audiences and the network begging for  more episodes, he feels "the time is not right to test some of those darker  waters."  </P> <P> Thomas Seibt, a therapist and instructor specializing in stepfamilies at the  California Family Studies Center in North Hollywood, fears television will  continue to take the easy way out in confronting step issues. "If people get  the impression that 'these people are able to work it out, then why can't we?  We must be failures,' there's a danger they'll feel pressure to do better  rather than look realistically at their own situation."  </P> <P> "The reality is, it's a struggle, and you don't always succeed," Seibt adds.  The statistics are indeed discouraging: 60% of stepfamilies fail, with 49%  divorcing within the first four years.  </P> <P> Still, Seibt is encouraged by the potential benefit to stepchildren when they  see families like their own on television. "It helps them feel they're not so  out of place," Seibt says, "(that) being in this family is normal."  </P> <P> "When I formed my stepfamily 15 years ago, I naively said, 'You'll love this;  it will be just like 'The Brady Bunch,' " recalls Mala Burt, a licensed  clinical social worker and president of the Stepfamilies of America Assn. "Back  then, there wasn't much information for stepfamilies. (My husband and I) just  loved each other and we thought that everything was going to be wonderful -- to  the point of denying any potential trouble."  </P> <P> Television was doing the same. "Most of the shows left the impression that you  could solve issues in 20-30 minutes," Burt says. "The realities were glossed  over. There were no ex-spouses in 'The Brady Bunch.' Everyone called the  parents Mom and Dad, so the real relationships were never acknowledged. There  were no good role models for stepfamilies showing how to deal with previous  families. It was unrealistic both for kids and adults."  </P> <P> When Donald Reiker and his writing partner and real-life spouse, Patricia  Jones, wanted to add more "heat" to the concept for "His &amp; Hers," a  half-hour comedy about a husband-and-wife marriage-counseling team, they gave  the husband (played by Martin Mull) a previous marriage and custody of one of  his two kids. They also gave him a wisecracking ex-wife. Taking the place of  the more typical sitcom fixture -- the mildly irritating next-door neighbor --  she would hang around the couple's house and compare notes with the new missus.  </P> <P> When CBS tested the show, however, audiences found the character confusing and  unrealistic. The writers had hoped to portray -- particularly among characters  who are mental-health professionals -- a healthy divorce situation. "People had  a great deal of trouble accepting the fact the new wife could be friendly with  the ex-wife," Jones says. "We were shocked." They agreed with CBS, however, to  write the character out.  </P> <P> "We think it's an area that should be tapped," Reiker adds. "If we had the  courage to stay with it, audiences might have loved it."  </P> <P> Earl Pomerantz says he'll continue to try to slip some of life's truths into  his shows where he can, but not at the expense of entertainment. And while  stepfamilies may soon be an audience majority, he doesn't believe they want to  see a mirror of their lives.  </P> <P> "Television still likes 'ALF,' " he says, "things from another planet that are  cute and cuddly. They don't want to see something with built-in dark clouds."  </P></p>

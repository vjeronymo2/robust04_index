Around noon, a few  hundred demonstrators, who had at first participated in a  peaceful rally against the Republikaner, tried to break through  the security cordons around Danube Hall. Policemen pushed them  back, sometimes using truncheons.    At the rally, Ulm Mayor Ivo Goenner (Social Democratic Party  of Germany) warned against "philistines and intellectual  arsonists." A democratic republic does not need "these  Republikaner," he said, addressing approximately 3,000 people.  Siegfried Pommerenke, land chairman of the German Trade Union  Federation, warned the parties against "adjusting to the  right-wing extremists in the race for votes."</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): There's reason for cautious optimism - Gilts / Graham Bowley finds that good news on the economic front has reinforced hopes of recovery Owners of UK government bonds, or gilts, may well be wondering where the next blow will come from after the rise in US short-term interest rates this week. The increase, the sixth this year, was the latest attempt to dampen future inflation in the world's largest economy, which is continuing to grow strongly. The first, in February, was a watershed, sending shock waves through the world's financial capitals and leading to a bear market that has given bond investors in all countries a painful lesson in how global the capital markets have become. Bond prices tumbled world-wide on fears that economic recovery in the US and Europe would be inflationary and lead to sharply higher interest rates around the world. The price of 10-year gilts fell by more than 19 per cent from their highs in January, and yields rose by almost 3 percentage points to a peak of around 9 per cent in September. The UK gilts market was hit particularly badly, partly because the country's economic recovery was further advanced than that of its fellow-Europeans and partly because of the British authorities' poor track record in controlling inflation. The large size of the UK government budget deficit, and the enormous amount of new gilt issues that this implied, also weighed heavily on investors. Almost 10 months later, however, and the fears about inflation and higher interest rates have yet to materialise. British base rates have edged upwards, from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent, but this was received generally as a well-timed move to head off future inflation. What is more, the UK's 'economic fundamentals' are looking increasingly favourable for gilts. Economic data published this week reinforce the fact that inflation, at a 27-year low, remains subdued and that Britain's finances appear a lot healthier than those of other European countries. It was for this reason that gilts rallied this week despite the rise in US rates. Many City analysts and fund managers believe, however, that this cannot continue for much longer. 'Gilts have now gone a long way against the US market and it is becoming very tight,' said Edmond Warner, head of strategy and economics at investment bank Kleinwort Benson. 'That puts a big external constraint on gilts. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the US.' Warner pointed out that the latest rise in US interest rates narrowed the gap between the US and UK to a quarter point, the smallest margin for more than six years. He thinks this now puts pressure on the chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, to raise UK interest rates as early as Budget day on November 29 rather than risk damaging the government's anti-inflation credentials. As ever, however, opinion is divided and some fund managers have a more optimistic view of the direction gilts will now follow. In particular, many believe Clarke will use his Budget to reaffirm his commitment to a strong stance on public spending, which could see gilts rally significantly. David Kauders, a portfolio manager based in the west of England, with about Pounds 22m under management for private clients, expects the bull market to resume within the next six months as investors realise that inflation and interest rates are set to remain low. Many managers point to the extremely attractive returns gilts can offer the long-term investor. 'Gilts offering a yield of close to 9 per cent should play a part in any balanced portfolio,' said Tim Knowles, director of Fleming Investment Management. 'There are good, solid reasons for being optimistic about gilts,' he added. 'The problem is that the shock to confidence this year has been so great that it could take some time for this to be reflected in prices.' Others echo this caution. 'Although we do not think inflation is about to take off, we are holding off on gilts until after the next interest rate rise, which we think will come soon,' said James Higgins, of financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe. Given the unpredictability of the gilt market this year, and the many uncertainties that lie ahead, the wise investor could be the one who errs on the side of caution.</p>

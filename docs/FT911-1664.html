			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Chemical unions threaten series of strikes UNION LEADERS are threatening a series of strikes in the chemical industry following the refusal of employers in national talks to reduce hours. Mr Fred Higgs, national officer at the TGWU general workers' union, said that if the talks broke down he and other union leaders would consider building a fund for strike action at individual companies. The threat follows the successful use of similar tactics in the engineering industry after the break-down of national talks two years ago. The chemical industry is one of the few which still has a national agreement, with talks covering 25,000 workers in 100 companies. This year the Chemical Industries Association has offered to increase pay by 6 per cent and is refusing to reduce the 38-hour working week. Employers also want a deferment clause, to allow a pay pause for companies in 'severe economic difficulties.' The unions are seeking a pay increase at the rate of inflation, and are pressing for a 'move towards' a 35-hour week over the next three years. In the engineering industry many employers have agreed to a two-hour reduction in the previous norm of 39 hours. Mr Higgs, secretary of the joint council negotiating pay with the association, said that unless there was substantial movement on the part of the employers, there would be no settlement. The unions are currently consulting with local branches and will tell the association of the response in three weeks' time. It said there was a strong feeling among members that there should be no movement on hours. There were no plans to increase the financial offer. Unions representing 1,200 employees of British Sugar are recommending industrial action in protest against an 8 per cent offer. The eight unions representing foremen, clerical staff and workers in processing and packaging sites say that the proposed deal is an insult in view of the company's profits. The TGWU is recommending industrial action over a 5.75 per cent offer for 20,000 workers in wool textiles. Lloyds Bank said it saw no room for manoeuvre on its 5 per cent offer to non-managerial staff. Lloyds Group Union told the bank the offer was difficult to justify in view of settlements elsewhere.</p>

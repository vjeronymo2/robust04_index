			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Arts: Ashton's indestructible 'Cinderella' - Ballet There can be no better Christmas fare in London than Frederick Ashton's romantic, funny, dreaming, brilliant 1948 three-act ballet Cinderella. Charming on first encounter, it rewards multiple viewings. Despite the celebrity of its earliest interpreters (Ashton and Robert Helpmann continued as the Ugly Sisters until 1976), it succeeds with several casts at each revival. Even if the comedy flounders, even if Cinders and her Prince fail to convince as love's young dream, the ballet still offers endlessly absorbing choreography. The scene that best repays repeated viewing is Act Two - the ballroom. This is a strangely intense realm, mysteriously sophisticated. Steps ricochet around in beguiling theme-and-variations patterns as if this were a hall of dance mirrors. Why are the Prince's four gentleman dancing steps that we saw the Season fairies dance in Act One? Who are these courtiers, endlessly echoing the steps and characteristics of the Jester, or the Prince and his friends, or Cinderella and her fairy retinue? How come Cinderella - who in the kitchen was the beating heart of the whole ballet - is now the most mysterious and elevated person in the whole ballroom? Why is the choreography often turned around, so that we keep seeing the dancers' backs instead of their faces? Through all this shimmering neoclassic construction blunder the vain, hapless Ugly Sisters, in desperate pursuit of all remotely eligible members of the male sex. Everything - including the peculiar staccato emphasis of the steps - keeps accumulating. Till midnight: when the most thrilling, most terrifying episode of the whole ballet occurs. Time catches up with Cinderella; and hems her in. Fairies, courtiers, jester, prince all bar her way, trap her, keep hammering down steps into the floor and into the music's twelve midnight strokes of doom. As danced today, the roles of the Ugly Sisters are weary collections of stale business. In this season's first two casts, only Derek Rencher is tolerable - a credible gorgon, looking like the Duchess in Alice - though he has no real wit. But David Bintley's funny walk is unfunny; and Steven Wicks and Oliver Symons are worse. These sisters have been conceived without affection, or coherent detail. Facial mugging abounds; the steps are under-danced. The clue to these characters lies in their choreography. (If you want to see how the Oompah Trot should look, watch Gracie Allen in the 1937 Astaire movie A Damsel in Distress.) Cinderella, however, remains a beautiful role - and challenging. Viviana Durante (first cast) shows dance detail of ravishing clarity and liquidity. This performance, in terms of three-act stamina and musical timing, marks a new high in her career. So what do I miss amid all her accomplishments? A certain through-the-body decisiveness - and sheer heart. Cinderella, like all Ashton characters, has a real nervous system: which only entered Durante as she recalled the ball in Act Three. Her Prince, Bruce Sansom, could not have been more pretty or correct or Charming; but as a romantic hero he is all too Phillip Schofield. The Bolshoi guest artist Nina Ananiashvili, though coping much less perfectly with the role's footwork and musical timing, is one of nature's Cinderellas - forlorn in the kitchen, blithe in the ballroom, tender and generous. I love her natural expansiveness, the elegant mobility of her torso, and her sweet good manners. Stuart Cassidy - always a model of virile charm, though slightly too solemn and with no particular brilliance - partnered her beautifully. No prince in this ballet has been so believable since David Wall. Though Cinderella is among the most indestructible ballets Ashton made, the omens for its future are not cheering. As in The Dream this winter, there are few dancers amid the Royal's current corps or soloists who have the fleet, neat footwork or vigorous torso called for by Ashton choreography. Rarest of all is the knack of coordinating upper and lower body to rich and intricate effect; and without strain. As the Jester, Tetsuya Kumakawa - in no way an Ashton stylist - spins like a top, jumps like a gnat, grins like a chimp and is wholly unbearable. No texture, and no humanity. The most elusive dance in the whole ballet is the Fairy Godmother's solo, because its musical phrasing (fast, to a slow melody) picks out a near-inaudible beat; Nicola Tranah is miscast in speed so delicate. Among the four season fairies, Karen Paisey (Spring) is pert and wispy, Genesia Rosato glamorous but insecure. Darcey Bussell dances with grand sweep, but with (her only serious flaw) a tight upper torso. The most exemplary dancing in the whole ballet came from Nicola Roberts (Autumn). Clean, light attack; youthful verve; natural harmony; musical incisiveness. Unless more people start to dance her way, Ashton's ballets at Covent Garden will die in our time. In repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, until February 3</p>

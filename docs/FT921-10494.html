			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / ANC officials renew foreign loans warning THE African National Congress has repeated a threat to renege on foreign loans to the current white government, despite a personal assurance from Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, that all such loans would be honoured if the ANC came to power. Earlier this week, Mr Mandela repudiated ANC statements suggesting that a future ANC government would refuse to repay loans made now to the National Party government. He said they represented the personal views of officials, and were not policy. 'We are obliged to honour these loans or else we will be in a great deal of trouble,' he told journalists at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Yesterday, however, the ANC repeated that it might not honour loans made to the 'present illegitimate South African regime and its agencies' before a multi-racial interim government had asked for financial sanctions to be lifted. The main proponent of this view within the ANC is Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general, whose influence within the organisation rivals that of Mr Mandela. The public dispute between the two men highlights the confusion over economic policy within the ANC, with officials repeatedly contradicting each other over crucial issues such as nationalisation. Yesterday's incident raises doubts over Mr Mandela's assurances at Davos on nationalisation. Asked whether he could assure investors that new investments would never be nationalised, he said: 'We have made this clear. . . we are well aware that if you cannot co-operate with business you cannot succeed in generating growth. . . we would like to create the conditions for investors to invest without any fear of their properties being nationalised, or of not being able to repatriate their profits and getting a safe return on their investments.' The threat to default on foreign loans is made with a strategic goal in mind: ANC officials believe that access to new lending will strengthen Pretoria's hand in constitutional negotiations; they see the threat of default as a potent weapon against government, which has recently re-entered international capital markets blocked since the mid-1980s. However, Mr Gerard Croeser, the government's director general of finance, warned: 'The ANC has a simple choice: if they think they are going to be the government and they think they will need loans in future, renege on the first one and you won't raise a cent ever.' ANC opposition has already blocked a planned foreign issue by the Independent Development Trust, a quasi-government organisation which is spending R2bn (Pounds 400m) on black housing and education. Yesterday's statement was aimed at blocking a foreign bond issue planned by the Development Bank of Southern Africa, a parastatal organisation. Confusion within the ANC might not matter but for its proximity to power. The organisation wants to share economic power with Pretoria in an interim government but concrete policies remain distant, as advisers and officials indulge in endless debate.</p>

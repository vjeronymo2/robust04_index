			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Gardening: Monsters on the loose - Robin Lane Fox wants his cypresses cut to size In this kind autumn, my garden has its successes at last: a second season on the yellow-flowered clematises of which the Bill Mackenzie variety is much the best; yet more flowers on a new deep blue salvia called Indigo Skies which looks much too good to survive a hard frost; better Asters, of which more soon, and a stupendous crop of berries, already set on Sorbus vilmorinii, that superb small tree. Successes are heartening, but they are overshadowed by progress in another department. The greatest garden monster ever let into Britain has put on another growth spurt and, in the next few days, the survivors will cost me several hundred pounds in order to reduce them to size. Why ever did we let Leylandii cypress trees on to general release? Uninformed gardeners buy them for good reasons: privacy, boundaries and fear of the neighbours and their ideas of bearable architecture. The little trees grow wildly at first, but we now know to what heights this wildness goes. No-one knows it better than I, who bought a garden with more than 200 Leylandii, planted in the early 1970s. In open country, the first principle of Leyland management is much the same as the one now applied at UK motor plants: engage gear and charge the assets head-on with a hired JCB digger, its front bucket will then eliminate the roots. Tree surgeons will quote you prices as high as a Leylandii for felling it scientifically, but the tree snaps easily when charged with a digger. The roots come out easily with a little bucketing because they do not go far and wide. They tend to point downwards like the sides of a modern corkscrew. The JCB method is much the cheapest, but it would not be popular in a heavily built up area. As my Leylandii approach their 25th birthday, they are 60 ft high and increasing ominously in girth. Old age accelerates their progress: the upper 20 feet have been put on in the last six years. I have tried to view them artistically, like those great cones of greenery in the background of the highly-prized paintings by David Inshaw in the 1970s. The attempt has failed because the texture, colour and scale of these trees are all awful. So I have applied Leyland management principle number two. In the early years of their arrival, the books used to say that an old Leylandii would never recover if it was severely cut back. This advice is now known as the Lord Stokes principle. In fact, these sprawling monsters are almost forgive-able if they are severely reduced in height and slimmed in size. If you cut back into old wood, it will soon be covered by a renewed curtain of grey-green feather. This week I am having to fork out for a severe Leylandii reduction, knocking 30 ft off the top with the only consolation that the huge clippings can be recycled through the shredder as next year's mulch. If a Leylandii essential to your garden plan is overpowering you, ignore the experts and cut it neatly: it will soon recover from the wound. After reduction, the trees can be brightened up using an idea which occurred to me three years ago. Use the remaining hedge as a support for vigorous climbing roses. I have started a race between some of the best-known white-flowered ramblers. The winner is the spectacular Rambling Rector, followed by the lesser-known - and much scarcer - Long John Silver. Varieties with heavy tangles of growth are less satisfactory because they refuse to lie flat against the cypresses' soft curtain of feather. Bobbie James is always a sound bet, but the weight of growth is a problem. White-flowered roses show up very well, but this year, I have found their equal in a pale buff-yellow variety which is ignored in garden centres. Among roses, the one equal to the monstrous cypress is the stupendous white rose called Kiftsgate. The original plant, in Kiftsgate gardens, Gloucestershire, is still powering away up tall beech trees and along a thicket which is now hundreds of yards wide. Few people know that this terrifying rose once fathered a child: somewhere, it leapt on a defenceless Hybrid Tea variety and the result is known as Treasure Trove, sold by Peter Beales in Norfolk. Its young growth and leaves are plum-red and it races up Leylandii with some of the vigour of its wayward parent: the small flowers appear freely in clusters during late June and turn to a shade which reminds me of pink grapefruit. I may have introduced an equal monster, but so far I think that Treasure Trove is a find for anyone who has been landed with these frightful hedges. At ground level, there is one seasonal compensation. A few feet away from the roots of your reduced Leylandii, you should plant flowers, the hardy Neapolitan cyclamen, in shades of pink and white, is perfect for this time of year. On the sunny side of the hedge, you can add the large-flowered Colchicums which look like huge crocusses in autumn: they must have sun if they are to flower properly, whereas the cyclamen will prosper in shade. Leave them to seed gradually, assisted by passing ants and your own careful distribution of any visible seedlings. This ant-like activity in the shadow of a 'hedge' is one small compensation for the dreary, loose curtain of feathery green above.</p>

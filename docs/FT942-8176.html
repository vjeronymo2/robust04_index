			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Is a national lottery just the ticket?: With the winner of a national lottery licence to be announced next week, Antoin E Murphy examines the history of an institution which has been blamed for poverty, madness, crime and suicide Lottomania is nigh. Suppressed since 1826, though variants in the form of Premium Bonds and the pools subsequently popped up, the first fully fledged national lottery is about to re-emerge as a potent force in British society. Its rebirth will continue to generate debate on the morality of gambling, on the wisdom of allowing people to win huge prizes, and on the reputation of the government permitting its citizens to be entrapped by a scheme which Sir William Petty in the 17th century dismissed as a tax on 'unfortunate self-conceited fools'. The winner of the UK's National Lottery licence is to be announced at 10am on Wednesday and a great deal of cant, humbug and hypocrisy is going to reappear in the newspapers and be voiced in churches and on television. The lottery will be extolled by its promoters and the government for the good works that it finances; it will be vilified by many adopting the strong puritanical and paternalistic streak of opponents to the lotteries from the 16th century onwards. It was Queen Elizabeth I who permitted the drawing of the first state lottery in 1569. However, lotteries have a longer history than this. The word lot is believed to come from a Teutonic root hleut meaning a pebble that was cast to settle arguments arising over the division of property. In Jewish history one finds accounts of selection by lots in order to determine who would kill the survivors of sieges such as that of Massada. Christ's clothes were drawn by lot. In Greek mythology the distribution of the world among the gods was decided by lot, Hades losing out when drawing the underworld. The lottery defined in court as 'a scheme for the distribution of prizes by lot or chance' was discovered by governments as a convenient supplementary method of taxation, and by private merchants as an effective way of disposing of goods that were slow to sell. The first national lottery in Britain, drawn in 1569, consisted of 400,000 lots at 10 shillings each. Religious ministers today, as they prepare their sermons against the lottery, may be surprised to learn that this first national lottery was drawn at the west door of St Paul's Cathedral, London, starting on January 11, 1569. As every single ticket was drawn, it continued day and night until May 6. One doubts whether Richard Branson - the favourite of the bookmakers, if not the specialists, to be awarded the lottery concession - will be applying to the Dean of St Paul's for similar facilities. The profits from the lottery were used to repair harbours and ports. So began the state's involvement in lotteries, one that would continue for 250 years. The state was first in a long list of groups that benefited from the lottery. At times the lottery became an essential tool of public finance. This was the case during the final stages of the War of the Spanish Succession when the over-burdened Exchequer, strapped for cash, tapped the market for Pounds 1.5m (1710), Pounds 3.5m (1711), Pounds 3.6m (1712), Pounds 0.5m (1713) and Pounds 1.4m (1714) through interest annuity lotteries. These were very large amounts when judged against the Pounds 1.2m that investors lent to the government in return for obtaining the privilege of establishing the Bank of England in 1694. Later, the lottery provided more than Pounds 70m for the war with the American colonies. The lottery was also used by the state to finance long term infrastructural investments such as the building of Westminster Bridge and the establishment of the British Museum. We are still enjoying the benefit of these 18th century lotteries. The second grouping that benefited from the lotteries were the 'people of quality'. As the tickets were usually priced at Pounds 10 and, at times as high as Pounds 100, they were not within the reach of the common people. A Pounds 10 ticket could represent the equivalent of a year's income for many, while rich nobles purchased considerable quantities: a letter from Lord Falmouth to Thomas Pelham requested Pounds 12,000 in lottery tickets. He was granted Pounds 9,000 worth. Such purchases were probably destined not to gratify mad gambling urges but to make a profit by dividing the tickets into shares which were sold at a premium. This system of the rich buying quantities of tickets persisted until 1788 when the Treasury sold all tickets to lottery contractors. Ostensibly, the high price of tickets was to preclude the poor from participating, to keep them out of harm's way. But ingenious methods were quickly found to permit and indeed encourage their participation. The tickets were broken up into shares of a half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth and then sold on at a premium to a far larger market. As the time for the lottery approached, and high powered marketing techniques built up a fever of excitement, the premiums for shares in tickets could go very high. In one handbill for the lottery of 1793 it was calculated that there were only 500,000 'persons of property' in a total population of 10m in England and Ireland. As there were only 50,000 tickets in this lottery there was only one tenth of a ticket for each of the persons of property. Add on the 'middle classes', which the writer reckoned bought 30,000 tickets, and his conclusion was easy to proclaim: 'Can we possibly doubt that tickets this year will be at least 18 guineas?' At this price the tickets were selling at a premium of 89 per cent indicating that there was a lottery within the lottery for those lucky enough to obtain large quantities of lottery tickets. Responsibility for generating excitement lay with the stockbrokers and lottery contractors. Stockbroking and lottery contracting went hand in hand, led by such stockbrokers as Bish, Carroll, Martin, and Webb. Modern day stockbrokers may be surprised to learn that their predecessors made a handy living out of selling numbers. While the government, the rich nobility and the stockbrokers/lottery contractors were the prime beneficiaries of the lottery it also spawned a sizeable underground bookmaking industry in what was known as 'insurance'. This practice started in the 1740s and was known initially as 'riding a horse in the lottery'. For a fee an individual could hire a ticket in the lottery for one of the days during the drawing of the lottery. If the ticket was drawn on that particular day the individual was entitled to the prize once he paid for the ticket. As the drawing of each lottery was a very long drawn-out process lasting 42 days (later, legislation of 1802 reduced the drawing period to eight days) there was enormous scope for betting on the numbers through 'insurance'. It took so long to conduct the draw because every ticket was drawn. The print for a drawing of the State Lottery in 1763 shows a boy from the Bluegate school drawing a ticket from one wheel and another boy drawing either a prize or a blank from the other wheel. The commissioners then had to examine each drawn ticket and its corresponding prize/blank and register them in a book. It was a time-consuming process. It has been estimated that the betting on 'insurance' was as great as the amount wagered on the lottery itself. At its height there were more than 2,000 agents offering 'insurance' and they employed 7,500 commission agents, known as the Morocco men, to extend their business. A variant on this has developed in the current Irish lottery with bookmakers offering 4/1 against a punter nominating one of the seven numbers drawn, 28/1 on nominating any two numbers and 12,500/1 on nominating any five numbers drawn. To clamp down on 'insurance' the government declared it illegal and offered rewards to informers. This in turn spawned a further industry as fraudulent charges were laid against innocent people of setting up 'insurance' schemes by extortionists looking for rewards in order to drop their fictitious charges. The beneficiaries did not end there. An incipient advertising and marketing industry was developing to extol the merits of the lottery. The artwork used in producing posters and hand bills became increasingly more sophisticated as they urged people to participate in lotteries with prizes of up to Pounds 20,000, freehold property in the city lotteries, and pipes of port. Many dreamed of winning the lottery. One footman put his thoughts to paper as to how he would spend his winnings: 'As soon as I have received the money, I will marry Grace Towers; but, as she has been cross and coy, I will use her as a servant. 'Every morning she shall get me a mug of strong beer, with a toast, nutmeg, and sugar in it; then I will sleep till 10, after which I will have a large sack posset. My dinner shall be on table by one, and never without a good pudding. I will have a stock of wine and brandy laid in. About five in the afternoon I will have tarts and jellies, and a gallon bowl of punch; at 10 a hot supper of two dishes. 'If I am in good humour and Grace behaves herself, she shall sit down with me. To bed about 12.' He did not win the lottery and having invested his life savings of 20 years in acquiring two lottery tickets he committed suicide on discovering that they had drawn blanks. He was not the only lottery suicide. In 1787 a young gentleman shot himself after cursing 'the head that planned, and the heart that executed, the baneful, destructive plan of a lottery'. The greatest 18th century lottery contractor must have been Thomas Bish, a man with a natural flair for publicity. Born in 1779, Bish attained a dominant position as a lottery contractor very young, probably through a brilliant series of creative advertisements which convinced ordinary people that there was only one place to buy lottery tickets and that was at Thomas Bish of 4 Cornhill, or 9 Charing Cross. Bish was the first to offer wines and port as extra sweeteners for lottery participants. He also had his publicity posters translated into Welsh in order to encourage the men and women from the valleys to participate in the lottery on St David's Day, March 1, 1817. Many commentators have credited the demise of the lottery to the public opinion whipped up against it by its opponents including such distinguished economists as Henry Thornton and David Ricardo. Was pre-Victorian Britain becoming prudish about the lottery? This seemed to be the growing perception judging by a parliamentary report of 1808 which stated that as a result of the lottery 'idleness, dissipation and and poverty were increased; the most sacred and confidential trusts were betrayed, domestic comfort was destroyed, madness was often created, suicide itself was produced, and crimes subjecting the perpetrators to death were committed'. There had always been a strong literary tradition against the lottery and this by itself would not have been sufficient to force the government to abandon the lottery. More importantly, as James Raven has recently shown in The Historical Journal (1991), the net profit to the government from the lottery had started to dwindle so that by 1819 it was contributing less than one per cent to the ways and means income of the government. This contribution deteriorated further between 1820 and 1822 due no doubt to the economic slump of those years. Thus, when the decision was taken to abolish lotteries in May 1823 the system had lost its zest and was contributing little to the Exchequer. The difficulties of selling tickets for the final lottery of 1826, as evidenced by postponements of the draw in order to sell off surplus tickets, shows the extent to which it had declined. In spite of abolition in 1826, (the last one, in fact, was the Glasgow lottery of 1831) the spirit of the lottery never died. It continued initially in newspaper competitions where readers were asked to find a missing word in a text; and it was practically resurrected with the establishment of the pools. Entering then pools is deemed not to be participating in a game of chance but a game of skill and as such is not a lottery. De facto, if not de jure, Harold Macmillan reinstated the lottery with the establishment of premium bonds in 1956. Macmillan denied that the scheme was a lottery while Harold Wilson described it as a 'squalid raffle'. Most fascinating was that the scheme was almost a replica of the interest annuity lotteries of the early 18th centuries. The lottery has been in a semi-torpor since 1826. It has now been fully re-awakened. Whether it is to be judged as an awakening Snow White or Frankenstein depends on your judgment. One way or another, the numbers game is back in town.</p>

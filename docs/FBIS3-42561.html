			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Makarov and Dmitriy Ragozin: "Around </F> Zhirinovskiy. A Political Portrait"]    [Text] The fashion of writing books that has swept over  Russian politicians in recent years has not bypassed Vladimir  Volfovich. But as distinct from others, he has written his, but  he dictated it without worrying about editing and without being  at all concerned about style or even grammar. This kind of work  is commonly called "stream of consciousness." But this is also  what makes it interesting.  <H5>  The Essence of His Brain </H5>   "This is an analytical narrative intermingled with the  biographical canon, the quintessence of my philosophical and  geopolitical views on modern reality. This is the essence of my  brain, the limit I have reached in my 46 years"--this is how  Zhirinovskiy begins his book, which he called "the last rush to  the south" and published precisely on the eve of the December  elections in an edition of 75,000 copies.    Introducing himself to the reader, Zhirinovskiy immediately  touches upon a spot that is sensitive for him--the question of  his paternity: "My first name is Russian--Vladimir, but my  father was named Volf, and that is what was written on my  father's birth certificate and passport. But mama called him  simply Volodya and it would have been simpler for me to be named  Vladimir Vladimirovich, but because of bureaucratism or red  tape--I do not know, one or the other--I am Vladimir Volfovich.  I am proud to bear any name since it is my father's name,  although it sounds a little strange to the Russian ear."    Sensitivity to the "Russian ear," for which passive  anti-Semitism is no rarity, has distinguished Zhirinovskiy since  the very beginning of his political career. Extreme nationalism  has also distinguished certain of his "party comrades" with whom  he went through the early stages of the establishment of the  LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Those who know  Zhirinovskiy assert that in reality he has a very vulnerable  soul and he was offended when journalists grabbed on to his slip  of the tongue, when he said that his "mama is Russian but father  is a lawyer."    The problem is that Zhirinovskiy is trying to please  everyone  at the same time. In a recent interview in the Israeli newspaper  MAARIV he stated that his late father was a Jew. The leader of  the LDPR added: "Jews are in a special position in Russia.  Ninety percent of the Leninist party were Jews and 90 percent of  the members of my party are Jews as well."    In general Zhirinovskiy's book could serve as an ideal aid  for people studying psychoanalysis. Here is a little example of  his recollections of day nurseries in Almaty: "I recall how we  were awakened at 2300 in the evening. They put us to bed at 2100  and awakened us at 2300 to make sure that we urinated in the  bucket. The boys went to urinate in one bucket and the girls in  another. And that was perhaps the first time, at three or four  years of age, that something sexual stirred in me, when I saw  girls completely naked."    And here is how political thinking awakened in the young  Zhirinovskiy: "I ran through the corridor of the kindergarten  and saw the attendants standing by the loudspeaker...they were  standing there and weeping. It seemed that they had just  received information that somewhere in Moscow a certain Stalin  had died. And to me, a child, of course, who still knew  absolutely nothing about politics, it was quite incomprehensible  why so far from Moscow, in the corridor of the kindergarten,  adult people, attendants, nurses, teachers--were standing there  and weeping...perhaps this was my first flash of political  awareness, my first protest against the personality cult."  <H5>  The Institute </H5>   Since childhood the young Volodya was pursued by the dream  of  getting away from the backwater Almaty, from his family, where  he was the sixth child, to run away from his stepfather whom he  did not like (his father died when the boy was less than a year  old). Zhirinovskiy wanted to become a diplomat or at least an  officer. "Ultimately...I decided to go to Moscow and enter if  not the MGIMO [Moscow State Institute of International  Relations] then its Eastern version--the Institute of Eastern  Languages under Moscow State University."    In 1964 when the 18-year-old Zhirinovskiy crossed the  threshold of the Sovetskiy Rayon Committee of the VLKSM  [All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League] of Almaty in order to  obtain a character reference for admission to Moscow State  University, he assured the Komsomol leaders that he would still  "become the pride of Kazakhstan." True, he received average  marks on his entrance examinations to the Institute of Eastern  Languages at Moscow State University, where he was assigned the  Turkish language, which is not difficult to study and not very  promising on the level of further work.  <H5>  Dark Spots in the Biography </H5>   Zhirinovskiy was a good student, even excellent, and  therefore it is not surprising that he was sent for temporary  duty in Turkey for the construction of the metallurgical combine  in Iskenderun. We do not know precisely what happened there.  Zhirinovskiy himself in a conversation with one of the authors  said the following in this regard: "The Turks wanted to accuse  me of disseminating communist propaganda because I gave a Turk a  badge on which, they thought, was a picture of Karl Marx. And  when they understood that they were mistaken and that the badge  depicted Pushkin, they apologized to me." But that is his  version.    And although Zhirinovskiy asserts that he never spent time  in  a Turkish jail, it was with considerable difficulty that he was  rescued from the clutches of the Turkish authorities. To be sent  out of a country at midnight for any reason meant, at the  beginning of the seventies, the end of one's career, even if it  had not begun. According to recollections of Zhirinovskiy's  teachers and fellow students, before this trip he was a cheerful  person and a joker, but he returned anxious and morally broken.    Zhirinovskiy had no hope of any more trips abroad, even as a  translator, but nonetheless he found the strength within himself  to graduate from the Institute (with honors), after which he was  drafted into the army for two years and sent to Tbilisi, where  he served as a staff officer.  <H5>  Was Zhirinovskiy a Member? </H5>   With his reverent attitude toward communist ideals even  today, God himself willed Zhirinovskiy to be in the party, but  still he remained a "nonparty communist." Why? People who know  him say that he tried to enter several times, but...his grim,  quarrelsome disposition and his squabbles with those around him  made it impossible for him to do this even in the army where it  was not difficult to enter the party, especially for an officer  working in specialized propaganda. And after that, when he  became a "private citizen," working in institutions where there  were long waiting lists to enter the CPSU, he could not even  dream about it.    The fact that he was not in the party served as an excuse  for  him to leave the Committee for Defense of Peace, where he worked  for two years as a translator after leaving the army.  <H5>  Zhirinovskiy and the KGB </H5>   The fact that the future leader of the LDPR was not in the  CPSU predetermines the answer to the question of whether or not  he was a "combatant on the invisible front." At least he was not  a staff worker. This required going through training in a secret  KGB school, which Zhirinovskiy did not manage to do in spite of  all his attraction to training.    Here is what one of his former deputies and close advisers  in  the LDPR, Leonid Alimov, has to say about this: "I do not think  he could be a KGB worker. For some reasons which only he knows,  he is extremely afraid of the committee. But Zhirinovskiy has  met with its workers repeatedly. When he went to Vologda and  Chita during his election campaign, the first place he went was  to the local KGB division."    Zhirinovskiy, however, considers all discussion of his work  in the KGB to be intrigues of bearded journalists and members of  Democratic Russia: "They are all bedeviled by the fact that I  was in neither the party nor the KGB nor the nomenklatura! This  bedevils them because they themselves all came from insane  asylums, jails, or out of immigration. I am a rare bird among  them."  <H5>  Diagnosis: Political Figure </H5>   Zhirinovskiy has apparently always been a "rare bird." Even  as a second-year student he went to the rector of the institute  with a plan for reorganizing all Eastern studies education in  the USSR. They slapped him on the shoulder and sent him back to  study some more. But he was not satisfied with this. "On 15  April 1967," he writes in his book, "I sent a letter to the CPSU  Central Committee and in an address to the country's leaders I  suggested conducting reforms in the areas of agriculture,  education, and industry." In the view of psychiatric specialists  who have observed Zhirinovskiy's career from the very beginning,  this person needs "light psychiatric treatment or consultations  with a psychoanalyst. One can state with a great deal of  confidence that his difficult childhood and lack of a father  were subsequently manifested in the development in the  personality of delusions of grandeur and a fervor for reform.    "In principle the desire to be known and the wish to reform  society are not in and of themselves a manifestation of a  psychological illness. But their sharply expressed form and an  inclination to exaggerate indicate psychological deviations  inherent in a given individual."    His hysterical behavior, which is especially marked in his  speeches in the Duma, and the physical violence that has begun  to attract him recently are causing alarm even among his  supporters. Zhirinovskiy himself when speaking with one of the  authors of this article answered a question about this as  follows: "I am prepared at any time to undergo an official  examination of my health. I suggested having this done even  before the presidential elections. Let the best doctors of  Russia give a complete diagnosis from head to toe. I am ready.  All these insulting tricks do not affect me."    The problem, however, is that Zhirinovskiy is constantly  changing his image. First he is a communist by conviction, then  a democrat, first he is in favor of the State Committee for the  State of Emergency, then he is against it, first he is for  peace, and then he is for war.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (5): Is the industry over-reacting? - London Office Market / In the deepest recession in memory, with a fifth of central London's offices empty, the prospect of shortages is emerging TWO bruised and battered birds symbolise the crisis in London's office markets. The canary is immediately recognisable as the label of that monolithic Docklands tower block which typifies the heights of ambition reached during the 1980s boom - only to crash into bankruptcy. A semi-comatose duck in a sailor suit is more puzzling, yet it sums up just as vividly what went wrong. In cartoons, Donald Duck rushes off a cliff and is several steps into thin air before realising he is standing on thin air. Then down he crashes. Developers made the same mistake, building so hard and fast that they were over the precipice before noticing that no-one was taking the space. Now they lie broken on the ground. 'The recession started the day after Black Monday in 1987,' says Mr Geoff Marsh of Applied Property Research. Net absorption turned negative a year later - in other words new offices plus the old space that movers dump on the market began to exceed demand. But no-one seemed to notice. Even between mid-1990 and mid-1991, when demand had obviously collapsed and vacancy rates were soaring, the flapping continued. Only 2.5m sq ft was cancelled, according to consultants Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. Finally, in the past 12 months, some 20m sq ft of potential development has been scrapped. Ironically, the industry may be over-reacting. In the deepest property recession of living memory, with a fifth of central London's offices standing empty and rents in free-fall, the prospect of shortages is emerging. That sounds ludicrous when central London has a supply for between 10 and 15 years, yet certain types of space are running out. Location and quality are important again, and there are gaps in the map of prime space. Westminster, for example, has hardly more than a dozen or so top-class blocks bigger than 50,000 sq ft - and almost as many leading companies looking for that sort of space. The area could see supply and demand balancing by the end of next year, says Mr Marsh. Narrowing down further to the primest of prime areas - Mayfair and St James's - only four new buildings of more than 25,000 sq ft are available, says Mr Rupert Dodson of Healey &amp; Baker. These quirks produce a wide spread of rent levels. Poorer second-hand space was letting for Pounds 15 a sq ft or less in the three months to June while prime was fetching Pounds 20 to Pounds 30, according to Jones Lang Wootton. Yet Healey &amp; Baker and Nelson Bakewell extracted a reputed Pounds 55 a sq ft from Cadbury Schweppes for a 50,000 sq ft Randsworth Trust block in Berkeley Square, confirming that some buoyant companies will pay highly for quality space in the right place. The City of London might seem immune from shortages after vast over-indulgence by developers during the boom. This left a vacancy rate approaching 20 per cent and helped cut prime rents by 40 per cent to Pounds 37.50 a sq ft - not counting incentives which average an equivalent three-year rent-free period. Yet Mr Colin Hargreaves of Healey &amp; Baker predicts a 'material shortage' in the core EC2 area by next year. Mr Gareth Davies at Grimley J R Eve picks out potential problems in finding new, high-quality units of 1,000-3,000 sq ft because 1980s buildings were designed for large-floor users. At the other end of the scale, movers would be hard-pressed to find anything over 250,000 sq ft for a new headquarters since MEPC stole Chemical Bank away from Canary Wharf to take half of Alban Gate. Numerous blocks in between are the real problem. Many are so old, badly designed or poorly located that some may never find a tenant. But they help contribute to a total central London stock which Edward Erdman Research calculates would require a 25 per cent expansion in the workforce to fill. Even the more realistic target of reaching 'manageable' vacancy rates of 5 or 6 per cent would require the replacement of all 100,000 jobs lost since the end of 1989. This seems unlikely when the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is predicting 30,000 financial services job losses by the end of this year and the latest Jones Lang Wootton Business Confidence review shows 20,000 office jobs will disappear across the whole south-east in the next 12 months. JLW also predicts total demand for only 3.7m sq ft for the whole region, a third of which is pre-let and a quarter being built for owner-occupation. But Mr Gerry Blundell of JLW finds a bright spot in the West End, where potential demand has soared. Mr Marsh also sees openings for developers, because land held at historic or nil cost - which must take in many central London pitches - can yield a juicy return of 14.5 per cent on a 50,000 sq ft block at rents of only Pounds 25 a sq ft. That presupposes finding a tenant to pay this modest amount, although this may not be over-ambitious if lower interest rates manage to kick-start the economy. In the City of London alone, KFR Research found almost 30 per cent of tenants wanted to expand into new premises and were held back only because they could not shake off existing space or new buildings were not good enough. In fact, Healey &amp; Baker estimates there is pent-up demand for nearly 9m sq ft of City space - about three years' average net absorption. This is the invisible thread holding up developers still building in London. Whether they are revealed as Donald Ducks remains to be seen but they must be looking down nervously at the dead ducks lying broken and bloody below.</p>

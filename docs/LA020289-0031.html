			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SISTINE CHAPEL CHOIR SINGS AT CHANDLER PAVILION  </P> <P> After enjoying something of a boom in the heyday of Roger Wagner, Robert Shaw  and others, Renaissance choral polyphony is now most commonly encountered on  campuses. Early music specialists have gravitated to smaller ensembles and ever  more esoteric repertory, and the large semi-professional choruses tend to offer  showier, orchestrally accompanied music.  </P> <P> The music of Palestrina and his heirs -- both ancient and modern -- is the  daily bread of the Sistine Chapel Choir, however. Tuesday the 44 men and boys  of the Capella Sixtina sang a taut program at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,  beginning a series of local engagements.  </P> <P> Directed by Domenico Bartolucci since 1956, the choir is a flexible,  well-drilled instrument. Its sound was dominated in the concert hall's acoustic  by clear, powerful sopranos and occasionally revealed hard edges, surely  conditioned for a more reverberant environment.  </P> <P> The first half of the effectively designed and ordered concert was devoted to  Palestrina, in unhackneyed examples. Bartolucci began with "Bonum Est," and  continued with five motets on texts from "The Song of Songs," revealing a  characteristic penchant for moderate tempos, caressive word painting and linear  punch.  </P> <P> The post-intermission portion took a more narrowly liturgical direction,  beginning with Lassus (a stately sung "Jubilate Deo") and Victoria (a deeply  probing, emotionally exhausting "Caligaverunt"), and ending with more  Palestrina (a highly stylized account of the Credo from the "Missa Papae  Marcelli," building to a truly monumental Amen).  </P> <P> In between came three works by Bartolucci himself, clearly formed on  traditional styles and language but with agreeably quirky idiosyncrasies as  well. His six-part "Accessistis ad Jerusalem" suggested the influence of  Eastern Orthodox music, his "Quo Abiit" -- another "Song of Songs" text --  employed a deceptively simple soprano solo in an almost folk-like setting,  while the most conventional was his Marian "Inviolata."  </P> <P> Within this far-from-confining repertory, Bartolucci and his charges proved  alert to textual and textural nuance. The Sistine intonation sounded piquantly  untempered -- sometimes simply out-of-tune -- and lines stretched but never  broke under Bartolucci's almost note-by-note ministrations.  </P> <P> Two encores completed the concert. The choir is also scheduled to sing Friday  at El Camino College in Torrance, Saturday at Citrus College in Glendora, and  Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.

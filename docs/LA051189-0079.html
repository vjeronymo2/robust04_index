			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSMETICS GIANT EXPECTED TO REJECT BID;  </P> <P> AMWAY OFFERS TO BUY AVON FOR $2.1 BILLION  </P> <P> Amway Corp. on Wednesday offered to buy Avon Products, the 103-year-old giant  cosmetics firm, for $2.1 billion in cash.  </P> <P> The deal would unite two companies that made their mark in business by selling  door-to-door. Amway now also sells its household products by mail order, while  Avon, long known for its "Avon Lady" direct sales force, is offering such  fragrances as its Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern lines through  department stores.  </P> <P> Amway's bid came one week after the Ada, Mich., company and Minneapolis  investor Irwin L. Jacobs disclosed that they had acquired 10.3% of New  York-based Avon's stock and might make a bid for the concern. On Wednesday,  however, Amway announced the buyout offer on its own and did not indicate  whether Jacobs would participate in the proposed deal.  </P> <P> Avon Chairman James E. Preston last week rebuffed the initial overture, saying  the company was not for sale. He reaffirmed that stance in a letter to Amway  Wednesday responding to the takeover bid, but said Avon's board will meet its  legal obligations to its shareholders by reviewing the buyout proposal.  </P> <P> Industry analysts predicted that Avon will reject the offer, at least  initially, but added that the company has few defenses against a possible  hostile takeover bid. Avon does not have enough cash to keep its stock out of  Amway's control by buying large amounts of its own shares, said Bonita Austin,  an analyst at the investment firm Wertheim Schroder.  </P> <P> Austin said Avon, saddled with about $1.1 billion in long-term debt, lacks the  cash to engineer a management buyout or to buy back much of its stock.  </P> <P> Ultimately, Austin said, she believes that Avon "will just try to get a higher  bid from Amway. "Avon doesn't have a lot of options."  </P> <P> Prospects for finding a "white knight" to acquire Avon are not very promising,  Austin said. Ronald O. Perelman, a takeover artist who is Revlon Group's chief  executive, might be interested, but there are no other serious prospective  buyers, she said.  </P> <P> Even so, Avon's stock climbed $3.875 a share to close at $39.875 Wednesday on  the New York Stock Exchange, apparently indicating that some investors believe  that a bid higher than Amway's current $39-per-share offer will emerge.  </P> <P> Avon may rely on an existing defense, a provision that gives its shareholders  the right to buy the company's stock at half price should another party  accumulate more than 20% of the shares. Anticipating that a raider might  challenge the legality of that provision, Avon on Monday asked a New York state  court to declare that provision valid.  </P> <P> "A lot depends on the shareholders rights provision," said Eileen Gormley, an  analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities. "Avon may have to depend on that  provision if it wants to remain independent."  </P> <P> Gormley and other analysts said the $39-a-share offer was a fair price.  However, a suitor may have to offer $42 or $43 a share to get Avon's board to  endorse an acquisition, she said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Amway might have difficulty getting financiers to provide  funding for any deal involving more than $41 a share, said Andrew Shore, an  analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Shore, who expects Avon to eventually accept  an Amway offer, said Avon stock would be selling in the $20-to-$25 range if not  for the speculation over the takeover bid.  </P> <P> Shore, noting that Avon had a 1988 loss of $404.5 million, said the cosmetic  company's directors were already under some pressure from shareholders and thus  are not likely to use a "poison pill" takeover defense.  </P> <P> "After disappointing earnings, they don't want to engage in a slash and burn  policy of doing something to weaken the company to discourage Amway," he said.  </P> <P> Amway referred to the possibility of a poison pill in its buyout proposal.  Amway said it "reserves the right to reduce the per-share price of its offer"  if Avon redeems the stock or takes any other action to reduce the value of the  company.  </P> <P> "After careful consideration," the proposal said, "we have concluded that our  respective businesses are complementary and that a business combination would  generate substantial benefits for both companies, their respective distributor  organizations and their respective shareholders . . . . Our offer is, of  course, subject to negotiation."  </P> <P> Noting the conditions for the offer, Avon spokesman John Cox said the proposal  "is not a firm offer -- it's conditional." Cox said Avon's board would meet  soon to consider the offer.  </P> <P> Amway today is expected to file a document with Securities and Exchange  Commission providing some details on how it would operate Avon.  </P> <P> Avon's 1.4-million-member independent sales force sells cosmetics, fragrances  and small gift items for the home. The company had 1988 sales of $3.06 billion.  </P> <P> Amway's product list includes toiletries, cosmetics, soaps and home-care,  health and fitness goods.  </P></p>

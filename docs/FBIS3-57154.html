This place has now  become a magnet for journalists. The reason for this is not the  smooth, romantic curve of the ancient boulevard covered with a  Christmassy carpet, nor the monument to Nadezhda Krupskaya in a  white cap pulled down over her eyes. The reason is an old  building giving onto Sretenka or, rather, its inhabitants. The  top two floors of the four-story building house the headquarters  of LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, whom some people call a buffoon, others the new  "fuehrer," and yet others the savior of Russia's national idea.    ...I encountered the first cordon in the vestibule, right  after the entrance doorway covered in posters bearing the  leader's portrait. Two dashing guys dressed in army peacoats  carefully examined my journalist's ID card. "Fourth floor. Do  you have an appointment?"    A broad marble staircase with broken edges to the steps and  a  gaping empty shaft in the middle (all that is left of the  elevator). A guard outside the door. Through it I could see  another checkpoint: a table, a chair, and a man approximately  50 years old. A not very affable welcome. "About 40 of you  guys have already arrived. Go to the organization department."  The department was in a muddle. "Have you spoken with Viktor  Vasilyevich Kobelev?" "Yes." "Then go to him," a blond woman  waved me away. The senior checkpoint man raised the "barrier,"  but, just in case, he gave me an escort.    For your information. The Sretenka building has been leased  by the LDPR for approximately two years. It mainly houses the  party's apparatus, broken down into departments: organization,  transport and economic, agitation and propaganda, youth, and  others. In all, there are approximately 25-30 people on the  staff. Here, too, are Zhirinovskiy's waiting room and office  and the premises of the Moscow organization's leaders. Work  with regional organizations is conducted from here.    The higher council meets regularly -- once every two weeks  --  in the Sretenka building. It is the team which decides  political directions and the strategy and tactics of the  struggle. "We are like the CPSU Central Committee Politburo,"  LDPR First Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Vengerovskiy explained to a  journalist. The "LDPR Politburo" was reelected a year ago. To  all appearances, the work of the special services is one of its  chief spheres of interest. Thus, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy is in  charge of the party's secret service and is drawing up a project  for a "Russian Intelligence Service." Deputy director of a  Moscow scientific research institute (and a graduate of Moscow  Aviation Institute and the Foreign Trade Academy), he has made a  careful study of the history of the MOSSAD -- Israeli  intelligence. Sergey Abeltsev, another council member, is  responsible for counterintelligence issues and the creation of  defense structures. He is currently working as deputy chairman  of a joint-stock company based on one of the largest collective  farms in Moscow Oblast. He has had a military education.    Despite the higher council members' fine-sounding titles and  the garish publicity surrounding their spheres of activity,  Zhirinovskiy's real right-hand man has the modest post of deputy  chairman of the LDPR. Although also a member of the  "Politburo," Viktor Kobelev keeps in the shadows. But he is the  man who is "boss" of the headquarters, in charge of all its  activity. It is Viktor Kobelev who tightly coordinates the  activities of the party (approximately 120,000 members), as was  clearly manifested during the election campaign.    The original LDPR candidates' list contained 160 names,  which were reduced to 147. The candidates' average age is 46.  The list contains just nine women (the first of them occupies  only the 32d position on the list). In terms of profession half  of the first 60 names (the actual number of deputies' seats) are  economists, jurists, entrepreneurs, or journalists. Persons  engaged in physical labor make up no more than 10 percent.    The LDPR's federal list includes representatives of half of  the regions of Russia, although the regions' representation is  patchy. Muscovites make up half the list (80 percent of the  first 60 names). The following are represented by several  candidates (in decreasing order): Vologda, St. Petersburg,  Pskov, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh, Krasnoyarsk, Komi, and  Udmurtia. The LDPR has its strongest positions in northwest  Russia, the Volga region, and central Russia. It is weak in the  south, in the Urals, and beyond the Urals.    A brief conversation with the building's "boss" proved  profitable. He agreed to the idea of a reportage. Could I see  Zhirinovskiy? He was leaving for the airport in an hour, and  there were lots of journalists wishing to see him. Maybe I  could go in for a few minutes with those who had been standing  in line.    "Viktor Vasilyevich, the boys and I have gotten hold of 30  tonnes of gasoline. You have to give a woman a little gift."  "OK, go on. Then you go!"    The presence of a journalist plainly did not fit in with the  "nerve center's" operation. I was given to understand that it  would be more convenient if I waited in the waiting room.    Initially the youth policy department somehow won people  over. Particularly as the "Zhirinovskiy Rock Store" was located  behind the stairs between the building's first and second  floors. The range included black "metal" jackets, T-shirts,  posters of hard rock stars, LDPR symbols, and...a constant din  from loudspeakers. But here, behind the office door, it is all  quiet. The young men in the department obviously do not get  their clothes from the "rock store" -- their clothes and their  hairdos are neat and tidy. From their conversation: "I am  working in the security service now. Here is my valid ID card."  "That's OK, that's good. We will register you, and then we  will be in touch." Obviously, people were not being received  into the Young Pioneers or the Boy Scouts. A young man evidently  wanted to join "Zhirinovskiy's falcons" and was demonstrating  his professional suitability.    From closed sources. For official use. The election results  in the closed precincts of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry  of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Security showed that,  on the whole, the mood of the power ministries' personnel is no  different from the sympathies of the majority of Russia's  population. Moreover, the overall voting results in the closed  precincts are still more depressing for "Russia's Choice" than  in the country as a whole. On average, in closed precincts in  Defense Ministry subdivisions the LDPR got 34 percent of the  votes, the Communists 9 percent, and "Russia's Choice" 11  percent respectively. It is characteristic that the opposition  got the largest number of votes among servicemen serving in "hot  spots" (the Dniester region, Tajikistan). The LDPR got the  smallest number of votes (19 percent) among Black Sea Fleet  personnel, and the largest number (49 percent) among personnel  of the Northwest Group of Forces. At the same time the LDPR  garnered 31 percent of the votes among Military Space Forces  personnel and 32 percent among servicemen in Strategic Missile  Forces units.    "...Have you read my book `Push to the East'? Read it."    Zhirinovskiy's office is very different from the other  rooms.  Here you will not see ill-assorted furniture or the worn  oriental carpets laid in the waiting room. A plush sofa and  chairs are ranged along the wall. Above them hang reproduction  portraits of Suvorov, Kutuzov, Nakhimov, and Ushakov. An icon  in the corner. Behind the chairman's chair is a picture  depicting the outline of Russia with Alaska adjacent to it.  Over all this hovers a falcon with a fluttering ribbon banner:  "Freedom, LDPR, Law."    The office's chief feature is an old-style T-shaped oak  table  in the middle of the room. It is surrounded by carved chairs  covered in dark velvet with raised roses on it. The unusually  tall and pompous chair backs are surmounted by heraldic  triangular shields with a watchtower carved in the center. An  oak bookcase is in the same style -- a stand with carved doors.  (According to the bosses, all this was made by a party member,  a master cabinet maker). The book "Through the Cordilleras"  lies on the case. The overall picture is completed by a  political map of the world.    The LDPR leader is in his element.    "We are against preserving the CIS, just as we are against  recreating the USSR. If anybody wants to join Russia, they are  welcome, only with the rights of a territorial unit: a province  or oblast. No national-state formations.    "In Europe we have an alliance with Germany, because it is a  major country. But Poland lies between us, and there are  problems there. I know the mood in Germany -- to get back  eastern Prussia, but that is part of Poland.... These, however,  are Polish-German problems.    "We are pro-Europe. As regards India, for example, it is our  strategic ally in the East. We must set up a new axis:  Germany-Russia-India. We will resolve the question of the  Kuril Islands jointly with the Japanese...."    The conversation took place under specific conditions.  Floodlights were suspended from above, behind the LDPR  chairman's chair -- two on each side, directed at the visitor.  The strong, concentrated light created the illusion of being  either on the stage or in the office of a Lubyanka investigator  in the thirties.    [Zaripov] Are you worried about the problem of  Zhirinovskiy's physical removal?    [Zhirinovskiy] No, because there is no getting away from  fate. Lincoln had to be killed, so they killed him. Kennedy --  they killed him. Palme -- they killed him....    [Zaripov] But you have guards.    [Zhirinovskiy] O-o-oh! Twenty counterintelligence officers  who have been through Afghanistan, Abkhazia, and the Dniester  region. Excellent guys; they handle all types of weapons.  (According to Vengerovskiy, men who once guarded Brezhnev are  Zhirinovskiy's personal bodyguards -- R.Z.). Half the people in  my office are guards. Even at night I have a guard by me. If  necessary, they will blow up this entire building.  [Zhirinovskiy ends]    The conversation ended on this optimistic note. Zhirinovskiy  broke off his "stream of consciousness," which is almost  impossible to do from the outside. The silence which was on the  point of ensuing was broken by the voice of his secretary,  coming through the half-open office door: "Mind, you have to  pay to speak with Vladimir Volfovich. Three minutes cost $100."  A mental calculation left me in no doubt: The possible cost  would easily pay for a ticket to, let us say, the Cape Verde  Islands. It was high time to retire home, to the motherland.</p>

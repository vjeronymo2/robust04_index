			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Improved terms win Finanzauto for Bibby J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural conglomerate, announced that its Pounds 86.2m hostile bid for Finanzauto, the leading distributor of earthmoving equipment in Spain, had been accepted in respect of 89 per cent of the capital. The acquisition, which was secured after Bibby improved its offer by 13 per cent last month, marked the first hostile takeover in Spain of a domestic company by a wholly foreign-owned corporation. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman of Bibby, said the future development of Finanzauto, the sole distributor of Caterpillar equipment in Spain, would be a joint effort between Bibby and Barlow Rand, the South African group which owns 79 per cent of Bibby. Finanzauto, which controls some 25 per cent of its domestic sector in Spain, faces a bleak immediate future, for official construction tenders in Spain have fallen by 56 per cent in the first four months of this year and are at their lowest level since 1987. Its group profits fell by 68 per cent to Pounds 4.8m last year. Mr Mansell-Jones said there was no 'quick fix' for the Spanish company and that it would be two years before the benefits of the acquisition filtered through. 'Our highest priority will be to reduce (Finanzauto's) indebtedness and not to produce dividends,' he said. Bibby was likely to dispose of the Spanish company's leasing division and other non-core assets.</p>

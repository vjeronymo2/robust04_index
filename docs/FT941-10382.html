			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Degussa sees further gains after strong term Degussa, the Frankfurt-based metals and chemicals group which has recently completed the bulk of a rationalisation programme, yesterday reported group earnings up 25 per cent for the three months to December. It predicted further gains for the rest of the financial year to September. First-quarter pre-tax profits rose by a quarter to DM60m (Dollars 35.3bn) on turnover up 5 per cent to DM3.5bn, due mainly to a large increase in earnings from the chemicals division which benefited from rationalisation and improved demand. KWU, the power-generation and distribution arm of the Siemens electronics and electricals group, increased turnover by 32 per cent to DM8.7bn in the year to September.</p>

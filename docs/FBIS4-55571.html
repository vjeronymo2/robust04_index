			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F> Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Oliver Vujovic in Skopje;  date not given: "`A Balkans War Always Was the Basis for a  World Conflict'"]    [Text] [Vujovic] What is the balance sheet of your  country's three years of existence since 1991?    [Gligorov] We achieved our independence by peaceful and  legitimate means: by the referendum, a new constitution, and  democratic elections. This independence has fulfilled the  national dreams of entire generations. Our people fought for  this for 150 years. But we live in a region where there is a  war going on that led to UN sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro, and we have had an embargo imposed on us by Greece.  These two things make it difficult for the Macedonian economy  to develop. Our major connecting routes for people, goods, and  capital have been interrupted. Our future lies in association  with the European Union.    [Vujovic] Balkans experts fear that the conflict might  spread to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM].    [Gligorov] As long as there is a war in our region, there is  obviously some threat. The Kosovo problem is also a danger to  us. That is why we have called upon the United Nations to send  us observers for preventive reasons. It has since emerged just  how correct this measure was. But I would also like to point  out that we are conducting a clear-cut policy: good relations  with all our neighbors. Thanks to this policy we have hardly  any problems with Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia. We even  have very good economic and cultural relations with Bulgaria and  Albania. We used to have very good economic relations with the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which we are trying to maintain  under the embargo today. Everything will certainly be back to  normal once the war has ended and the sanctions have been lifted.    [Vujovic] Recent signals coming from Serbia are not all that  encouraging. President Slobodan Milosevic's policy is very  pro-Greek. Many Serbian politicians consider Macedonia to be  part of Serbia. Is that a real danger or are these just verbal  threats?    [Gligorov] Yes, there are such threats. The independent  state of Macedonia is a reality in spite of the Greek embargo.  I am sure that a Balkans war would break out if Serbia or  another neighbor tried to enforce their claims. And a Balkans  war was always the beginning of a world conflict. That is why  it is also in our neighbors' interests to renounce such historic  burdens.    [Vujovic] Greek-Macedonian relations are the biggest problem  today.    [Gligorov] There is no objective reason why there should be  conflicts between Greeks and Macedonians. There are no  territorial claims. Cooperation is in both countries' interest.  None of the things going on between Greece and Macedonia are in  the interests of our states. It is all just a matter of  emotions, which unfortunately play a great role in the Balkans.    [Vujovic] There have been speculations lately about  Macedonia wanting to change its flag and coat of arms. Is that  right?    [Gligorov] That is just gossip. But we are determined to  discuss all the questions with Greece and to find solutions that  are acceptable to both sides. We will talk this over in the  next few days.    [Vujovic] Many observers believe that the United States is  using Macedonia as a base in that part of the Balkans. What is  the role that the United States plays in Macedonia?    [Gligorov] There are no U.S. bases here; these are mere  speculations. We asked the United Nations to send peacekeeping  troops to Macedonia for preventive reasons. That was a good  move. Even UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has called  Macedonia a good example, a model that the United Nations should  use in the future. Preventive measures always achieve much  better results than war does. At the beginning there were only  Scandinavian UN troops stationed in Macedonia, but, today, about  half the contingent are U.S. troops, the other half are  Scandinavians. That is it, the Americans are here only as part  of the UN peacekeeping contingent, not as U.S. Army.    [Vujovic] The Macedonian Parliament has given the go-ahead  for NATO membership. Why?    [Gligorov] It is not easy for a small country to survive  today without being part of a collective security system. The  United Nations is certainly the most important organization.  But it does not have a military structure of its own, its  possibilities are limited. NATO is the only collective security  system that is still in existence. The Partnership for Peace  offer is a real possibility for all those seeking protection  today. Our parliament's resolution is to be seen as a statement  of general orientation. Joining the Partnership for Peace would  be a first step for us that could be realized as soon as we are  a member of the CSCE.    [Vujovic] Is Greece the only country preventing Macedonia  from joining the CSCE?    [Gligorov] Yes, it is.    [Vujovic] What is your view of Austria-Macedonia relations?    [Gligorov] We have a tradition of good relations and good  economic cooperation with Austria. Austria supported our UN  membership. But Austria is still cautious in establishing full  diplomatic relations; we are still waiting for an Austrian  ambassador to come to Macedonia.</p>

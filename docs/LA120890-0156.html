			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RELIGION NOTES / DAYE CLARK: PROCESSION WILL HONOR PATRONESS  </P> <P> The Diocese of Orange, in cooperation with the Fiesta Marketplace and the  Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn., will conduct a religious procession down 4th  Street in Santa Ana on Sunday.  </P> <P> The procession, which starts at 3 p.m., is in anticipation of the Feast of Our  Lady of Guadalupe, which is celebrated on Wednesday.

Norman F. McFarland, bishop of Orange, will bless a  newly installed mosaic of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the official patroness of the  Diocese of Orange.  </P> <P> Msgr. Jaime Soto said: "The devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe has always been  among the strongest expressions of the fervent religiosity of the Mexican  people. This potent religious character is an essential part of all Latino  cultures. Our celebration on the 9th of December will coincide with the first  Mass, celebrated at the Basilica in Mexico City, in honor of blessed Juan  Diego, who was among the first evangelizers of the Americas. It is my hope that  this public celebration by the Catholic community will help engender a respect  for the cultural roots of the Latino people as well as foster an appreciation  for their profoundly rich religiosity."  </P> <P> Information: (714) 974-7120.  </P> <P> The black-tie "Celebration of Lights" Hanukkah ball will be held Sunday at the  Anaheim Marriott.

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Norwegian financial sector losses NORWAY'S ailing financial sector has suffered losses on loans and guarantees of an estimated NKr80bn (Dollars 14.3bn) in the past decade, according to the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission, the country's financial watchdog. The bulk of the sector's losses have occured during the last four years. BISC's composite figures for the first half of this year - which cover commercial banks, savings banks, finance companies and credit institutions - indicate that the worst may be behind the sector with interest earnings showing signs of revival as costs are being reduced. First-half combined net interest earnings rose to NKr10.81bn from NKr10.39bn last year as costs fell to NKr8.2bn from NKr9.2bn. Last year was by far the sector's bleakest year with combined losses hitting a record NKr21.33bn; in other words Norway's financial institutions operated at a loss of NKr58m a day in 1991. In the first six months of this year the sector's combined losses have been reduced to NKr5.3bn from NKr8.1bn in the same period last year. BISC believes the latest figures may indicate that losses for the year as a whole could be lower than last year's record level. 'This is dependent on (Norway's) economic development in the second half. Experience shows, however, that losses have been greater in the second half than the first half.' The level of second-half credit losses is uncertain and the securities markets have developed more weakly as money-market rates increased, From end-June 1991 until end-June this year the sector has reduced combined assets by an estimated NKr70bn to NKr740bn, or by 9 per cent.</p>

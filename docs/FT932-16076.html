			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Poland's banking privatisation given Dollars 12.7m injection POLAND'S long-delayed bank privatisation programme got under way yesterday following a decision by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to invest 210bn zlotys (Dollars 12.7m) in Poland's Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK) ahead of a public share offer due to open next week. The government hoped to attract a foreign commercial bank to buy into the WBK, the first of nine state-owned commercial banks carved from the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the central bank, four years ago. However, the Polish finance ministry, advised by Shroders, the UK merchant bank, was unable to find a foreign bank willing to take a minority stake at this stage. The EBRD has spent six months running a due diligence examination of the bank's loan portfolio. It agreed to acquire 28.5 per cent of the WBK's equity, while private foreign and domestic investors are being offered 1.74m shares, or 27.2 per cent, through the public share offer. Last year, WBK reported a net profit of 237.4bn zlotys on a balance sheet of 14,659.7bn zlotys. That followed a 1991 loss of 706.6bn zlotys, due largely to provisions for bad debts on a balance sheet worth 11,367bn zlotys. The WBK remains relatively unencumbered by bad loans and has swapped debt owed by the Warsaw steelworks for equity in the company's Dollars 200m joint venture with Lucchini, the private Italian steelmaker. More than one-third of the bank's loan portfolio, some 2,589bn zlotys, has been classified as 'doubtful and overdue', with provisions set at 1,100bn zlotys. More than 40 per cent of the bank's loan portfolio is with private-sector companies. The share price for the public offer has been set at 115,000 zlotys, giving the WBK a price equity ratio of 2.7, roughly comparable to the 16 stocks now being traded on Warsaw's fledgling stock exchange. The state treasury will retain a 30 per cent stake. The bank's 3,500 employees are to be offered 14 per cent at half the price of the shares on offer to the general public. At least two foreign banks are considering a stake, Mr Guy de Selliers, the EBRD's deputy head of merchant banking, said in London. The EBRD has already committed Ecu550m (Dollars 649m) to Poland, and the stake in the WBK is not only its largest investment in a financial institution in Poland but also the forerunner of similar investments elsewhere in central Europe. Half the estimated Pounds 1.6m (Dollars 2.27m) cost of the WBK sale is being borne by the British government's Know How Fund. The Polish government is continuing to look for foreign commercial banks willing to take important stakes in the nine commercial banks up for privatisation, Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister, confirmed yesterday. Next on the list is the forthcoming disposal of the Bank Slaski, which is being handled by Paribas. The WBK has 41 branches and 252,000 clients with deposits of 9,600bn zlotys. It is receiving management advice from the Allied Irish Bank under a three-year 'twinning' contract. The EBRD's present investment in the WBK will bring the bank's capital adequacy ratio up to 12 per cent, the general target for the government's World Bank supported domestic bank debt restructuring programme.</p>

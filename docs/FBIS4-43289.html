			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Industrialists Take a Defiant </F> Stand"]    [Text] This time the government is facing some concrete and  potentially damaging defiance by the industrialists, who say  they will no longer repay their debts to the banks in view of  Turkey's growing economic problems.    The industrialists argue that the government's mistaken  policies on taxes and interest rates have landed them in their  current indebtedness, and thus they too will become militant and  will not honor their debts.    This is bad news for the government, which has been trying  to  overcome all kinds of problems on many fronts.    The coalition government set up between the True Path Party  (DYP) and the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) is on the  rocks. There are too many fundamental differences between the  partners. The coalition parties are facing serious problems  inside their own parliamentary groups. Thus the going is very  tough for Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister  Murat Karayalcin.    Besides that, Ciller is confronted by criticism from all  sides that she has failed to manage the economy properly. Until  recently the problem was whether the government was making  mistakes in fiscal and monetary policies. Now the problem has  become an economic crisis where the country is plunged into  recession and high inflation.    This has prompted major industrial groups to say the  economic  crisis today is unmatched in the 70-year-old history of the  Republic.    But now the economic crisis taking a turn for the worse as  Ciller displays complete incompetence in facing the challenges.  Industrial giants have started laying off workers in view of  falling demand. There are estimates that in the past two months  nearly 350,000 have become redundant. As unemployment grows,  consumption falls, and so do prospects of the increased sales  necessary to bring us out of the recession.    So the prime minister tells the industrialists to start  exporting. Yet we see that exporting under current conditions,  with high interest rates on bank credits as well as a lack of  government incentives for foreign trade, has become mission  impossible. Ciller cannot tell the industrialists simply to  sell their goods abroad without providing cheap loans for  financing inputs and without meaningful incentives.    So all avenues are closed to industrialists for the time  being, and the incompetence displayed by the government suggests  that it lacks the ability to do much.    All the government could do was to try to save its own skin  by further complicating internal market conditions in borrowing  nearly 30 trillion TL [Turkish lira] from the nation through  treasury bond sales in the past two weeks, at a net three month  interest of 50 percent. That means in three months time the  government has to pay back 45 trillion to the public... This has  pushed up credit rates and thus halted investments, while  increasing the interest rates of existing debts.    Furthermore, the government, in trying to close the huge  budget gap, has introduced new taxes for corporations, which has  further angered companies already pushed for hard cash. Thus  the industrialists were forced to confront the government. In  June many business concerns who work on bank credits have to pay  back the interest payments on their loans. They tentatively  decided on Monday not to make any repayments to the banks as an  act of defiance. Now the banks will have to confiscate their  factories or just throw in the towel and ease the credit  conditions.    This is a dangerous turn of events. Soon the workers and the  industrialists will all be confronting the Ciller  administration. Will she survive all this? We will see in the  near future...</p>

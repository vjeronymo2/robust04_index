			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Hearings on attorney general nominee Reno begin today THE SENATE judiciary committee today begins hearings on the nomination of Ms Janet Reno, a state prosecutor from Miami, to be the next attorney general of the US. Ms Reno, 54, was chosen by President Bill Clinton after Ms Zoe Baird withdrew her nomination following revelations she had hired illegal immigrants as household help. Later, Judge Kimba Wood also took herself out of consideration for related 'nannygate' reasons. No serious opposition to Ms Reno has yet surfaced, although some right-wing lobbies, including the National Rifle Association, have circulated rumours, denied by the White House and several prominent senators, that she had been stopped by the police on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. The NRA is exercised because she is known to be a staunch advocate of tougher gun controls. Another conservative group, the Free Congress Foundation, yesterday issued an indictment of Ms Reno's qualifications, pointing to her lack of federal law enforcement experience and objecting to her record as a social activist who commands the support of leading US feminist organisations. Ms Reno can also expect to be questioned on her position on the death penalty. She said when nominated that she was personally opposed to capital punishment but had sought it as a state prosecutor in certain cases according to the dictates of Florida law. Assuming her confirmation as the first ever woman attorney general, the stage will then finally be set for the appointments of a new upper echelon to the justice department, still under the acting management of Mr Stuart Gerson, a Bush administration official. Of particular importance will be the nominations of a deputy to Ms Reno and of a solicitor general, who argues government cases before the Supreme Court.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GULLS' FOUR-GAME STREAK SKIDS TO A HALT IN ALBANY  </P> <P> Last-place Albany brought the Gulls' string of four victories to a halt Tuesday  night with a 5-2 International Hockey League victory at Knickerbocker Arena.  The Gulls fell to 7-3-1 on the road.  </P> <P> It marked the 19th time in 24 games the Gulls have allowed the first goal. This  time, the scoring was opened by Nicholas Beaulieu, who got his ninth goal of  the season at 8:10. Teammate Mike Golden, who ended up with a hat trick, scored  his first goal of the year at 14:20 for the 2-0 lead, then scored again in the  second at 4:12.  </P> <P> Clark Donatelli pulled the Gulls (12-10-2) to 3-1, scoring his ninth goal on  the power play at 8:20, with assists by Derek Mayer and Brent Sapergia. It was  the Gulls' 36th power-play goal of the season, a league-leading total.  </P> <P> "We weren't as sharp as we have been lately," Coach Mike O'Connell said. "But  that happens sometimes on the road."  </P> <P> Dennis Holland took a feeder from Charlie Simmer to record his ninth goal at  14:15 in the second and pull the Gulls to 3-2. It was as close as they would  get.  </P> <P> The Choppers (7-14-3) scored twice in the third, at 18:30 on a goal by Yeves  Heroux, then with 50 seconds left, Golden got his third goal of the night --  and the season -- to close the scoring.  </P> <P> Goalie Alain Chevrier stopped 15 of 20 shots and the Gulls outshot Albany  35-20. Chevrier is 2-1 since joining the team Saturday.  </P></p>

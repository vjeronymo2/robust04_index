			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi on Privatization and Lira"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 29 -- The ongoing process of  privatization in Italy is "a reality in continual evolution and  it is right that it be debated upon even for the general rules  for joint stock companies" outgoing Italian premier Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi said here Friday [29 April] at a press conference  called to review his year in office.    The former bank of Italy governor went on to state that he  had no intention of getting involved in the polemics,  highlighted in the press, over the recent privatization of Comit  [Italian Commercial Bank].    However, in answer to charges that Banca Commerciale  Italiano  had been taken over by a small "hard-core" of stockholders,  Ciampi recalled how while 20 percent of shareholders had,  indeed, organized, "there always remains 80 percent of  shareholders which can organize and find the ways and means to  do so.    Turning his attention to monetary matters, Premier Ciampi  expressed his hope that the lira would return to the European  Monetary System (EMS) as quickly as possible.    "In 1992" he recalled, "the EMS suffered a crisis much worse  than that of the lira" adding how for "national pride  adjustments had not previously been made to parities which would  have avoided the increase in rates."    Looking at the independence of the Bank of Italy Ciampi  stated how in his fourteen years at the head of the central bank  he had always fought to boost its independence which was  achieved "starting in 1981 when the Bank of Italy was no longer  obliged to purchase unsold state paper put up for auction and  ended with its freedom to set the discount rate."</p>

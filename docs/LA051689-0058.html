			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CYCLAMATE LIKELY TO BE EXONERATED -- 20 YEARS LATER  </P> <P> Federal health officials, who banned the artificial sweetener cyclamate 20  years ago in the midst of one of the biggest health scares of the 1960s, are  now widely expected to reapprove it, possibly this year. Once accused of  causing everything from bladder cancer to birth defects, cyclamate is now  widely thought to be harmless.  </P> <P> "I have no reluctance in saying that with cyclamate we made a mistake," said  Robert Scheuplein, acting director of the office of toxicological services for  the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  </P> <P> A group of monkeys at the National Cancer Institute provides evidence of the  mistake. Each of them has been fed the amount of cyclamate that would sweeten  30 cans of diet soda every day, five days a week, for the last 17 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> They're Doing Fine  </P> <P> In February, the institute issued its first progress report: The monkeys are  doing just fine.  </P> <P> The agency's reversal on cyclamate promises to add to the growing public debate  about how government health officials evaluate potential health risks.  According to scientists and industry officials involved in the controversy, the  evidence exonerating cyclamate was available years ago and the fact that the  agency took two decades to concede its mistake shows how large a role politics  can play in decisions presented as scientific.  </P> <P> Cyclamate was one of the world's most widely used artificial sweeteners when,  in the late 1960s, its safety became a matter of public concern.  </P> <P> In 1969, after the completion of a study showing that some rats with cyclamate  pellets implanted in their bladders were developing tumors, the FDA restricted  the sale of the chemical. The following year, it was banned entirely.  </P></p>

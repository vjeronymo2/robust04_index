			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Mar 18 (CNS)--Mr Yan Hongmo, member of the  CPPCC and director of the National Bureau of Oceanography, said  that Hainan Province would set up a department of oceanography  to strengthen management over the Nansha, Xisha and Zhongsha  archipelagoes and the surrounding waters.    Hainan Province is China's biggest ocean province with more  than three million sq. kilometres of sea and the three  archipelagoes of Nansha, Xisha and Zhongsha.    The province hopes to speed up its economic development and  expand opening to the outside world by taking advantage of its  environmental and ocean resources. Governor of the province Mr  Ruan Chongwu said that the province would speed up the  utilization and development of its ocean resources to strengthen  its foreign exchange and cooperation with foreign countries and  regions.    The department of oceanography in the province will plan the  development, utilization and protection of ocean resources,  giving priority to the development of ocean-related industries.    Mr Yan said that the output value of such industries had  increased eightfold since 1979 but that value still did not  match the size of China's population and the country's long  coastline.</p>

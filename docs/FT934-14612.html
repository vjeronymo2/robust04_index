			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Banks gag on money market illiquidity - Volatile overnight rates are causing disquiet FOR decades, London has been one of the world's most attractive financial centres, with a strong tradition of deregulation that has attracted trading in currencies, bonds and international equities. Recently, however, some commercial bank dealers have been concerned by what they regard as unfair competition in an important arena of financial trading in the City: the sterling money markets and the operations of the Bank of England in them. One of the primary functions of the Bank of England is to ensure commercial banks have an adequate supply of wholesale cash to meet their daily requirements. The price at which the central bank offers wholesale cash to the banking sector is critical in determining the level of money-market interest rates. In theory, there should be a steady and even flow of cash through the system, ensuring that there are no liquidity shortages - and therefore no sharp fluctuations in short-dated interest rates along the money-market yield curve. But, recent months have seen acute daily liquidity shortages in the sterling cash market. Some commercial banks have been unable to acquire wholesale cash when they need it - and the cost of overnight money has soared as high as 20 per cent. By contrast, call money in Germany has hovered between roughly 6.5 per cent and 8 per cent, despite an exchange rate mechanism crisis which caused acute problems in German money markets. The volatility in sterling rates is of concern to dealers. Commercial bankers might lend money for repayment in 6 months, 'funding' that position by borrowing interbank cash at overnight rates. 'Predicting what the overnight rate will be is like predicting the British weather,' says the head of money markets at a leading US investment bank in the City. 'We simply do not know what the cost of money will be on any given day.' Other dealers believe that the volatility reflects faultlines in the Bank of England's money market operations which need to be repaired. 'The root of the problem is that the power to control overnight rates now lies in the hands of a few of the major London clearing banks who dominate the system,' said the head of money markets at a leading French commercial bank in London. Critics are reluctant to speak publicly. They are concerned not to compromise their relationships with the central bank. But they have three complaints: First, they argue that the Bank of England removed a substantial pool of liquidity at the heart of the banking system by changing the rules of liquidity management in the UK in the late 1980s. Under the old rules, commercial banks had to deposit minimum sums of cash, called 'club money', with a group of intermediaries called discount houses. In the late 1980s, the rules were changed. Banks were placed under less rigid obligations to provide reserves to discount houses. Instead, they were allowed to hold these assets in the form of bills on their books as a means of meeting minimum reserve requirements. Several UK clearing banks have a substantial advantage over other market players because their activities give them huge holdings of these eligible bills, which are essentially a post-dated cheque mainly issued by companies and the principal instrument which the Bank accepts in return for lending wholesale cash. Some dealers say that the holding of eligible bills by two of the UK clearers - NatWest and Barclays - is so great that they have effectively 'cornered' the market. These clearers are certainly operating within their rights. But they are thought to control the trade in 30 to 40 per cent of all eligible bills between them. If they are in a net lending position, it is in their interests to keep the overall shortage of cash in the discount market very large, thereby ensuring a high overnight interest rate. If they are in a net borrowing position, it is in their interests to remove the shortage quickly and bring the overnight interest rate down. The government's expected public sector borrowing requirement - at Pounds 50bn - has exacerbated the strains on the system. The PSBR is funded through sales of gilt-edged securities, which pass liquidity from the banking system back to the central bank. The stock of assistance that the Bank has provided in the past 12 months has been large - and this has created regular money market shortages, giving even more power to those clearers with the power to remove the shortage through their holdings of eligible bills. Commercial bankers want to reform the system. Some are calling for the introduction of a gilt repo (repurchase) system, which would allow them to offer gilt-edged securities to the Bank of England in return for cash borrowings. This would widen the collateral which could be offered for funds beyond the use of commercial bills - and hence reduce the power of those who dominate the market. Others are calling for the introduction of a German-style banking system, with direct dealing relationships between the central bank and commercial banks, minimum reserve requirements and a system in which interest rates fluctuate inside a 'corridor.' Bank of England officials acknowledge that the growth of the stock of assistance has put strains on the dealing system. But they argue that the problem will diminish with time as the level of gilt sales is reduced. One official said recently: 'We would be happier if there were less volatility in the overnight rate.' But that concern does not extend to any reconsideration of how the system operates. Following the heavy intervention in support of sterling in the exchange rate mechanism last year, the Bank started to provide special facilities which allow for cash borrowing in return for gilts and other securities. Officials say that the system may be extended. But, they have said that the introduction of a gilt repo system would only take place if that were in the interests of the gilt market, first and foremost. Nevertheless, the unhappiness in the market is unlikely to die down. 'We used to take very big positions in sterling money markets because we were reasonably certain how the system would operate,' says one foreign commercial banker in London. 'Now we are reducing our exposure. the whole thing can't be good for London as a financial centre.'</p>

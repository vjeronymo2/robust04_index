			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The alleged German top terrorist  Johannes Weinrich obviously was planning to assassinate former  U.S. President Ronald Reagan. This has been reported by the  Hamburg STERN magazine [to be published on 10 March]. The  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] found a document  among Stasi files in which Weinrich noted that the "President of  the United States of America" was a targeted person and where he  described the weapons he needed: "Two Beretta submachine guns  and handguns with silencers."    Weinrich is regarded as the brain behind the attack on the  "Maison de France," the French cultural center in Berlin. In  the 25 August 1983 attack, one man was killed and 23 persons  injured. It has been learned from legal circles in Berlin that  the state prosecutor also has information that might point to a  possible assassination plan. However, in this connection no  preliminary investigations have been initiated yet against  Weinrich, who is regarded as close confidant of top terrorist  "Carlos."    The investigating state prosecutor in the "Maison de France"  case has meanwhile confirmed that an international arrest  warrant has been issued against Weinrich for aiding and abetting  murder. In addition, another arrest warrant was issued in  connection with Weinrich's role in the attack against the Saudi  Arabian ambassador in Athens in 1983. The ambassador survived  the attack only by coincidence.    The state prosecutor has further announced that he would  soon  request a third arrest warrant against Weinrich, namely in  connection with the attack against "Radio Free Europe" in Munich  in 1981, when many people were severely injured. According to  the information of German security authorities, Weinrich is in  Syria at the moment. The FRG has requested that the Arab  country extradite Weinrich.</p>

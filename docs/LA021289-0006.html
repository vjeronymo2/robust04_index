			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Thanks, NBC, for the exciting miniseries, "Brotherhood of the Rose." I had  thoroughly enjoyed reading the novel and looked forward to the TV adaptation. I  was not disappointed. Great acting and a well-chosen cast combined to make the  characters in the book come to life.  </P> <P> Elaine Schaeffer, Agoura  </P></p>

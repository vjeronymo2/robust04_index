			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Motoring: Treats to tempt the guilty speedoholic - Stuart Marshall tries out four very different fast cars IT IS MOST unfair. I am like an overweight chocoholic trying to kick the habit whose friends keep bringing gift boxes of sinfully fattening hard and soft centres. My problem is fast cars. Deep down, I disapprove of the kind that sacrifice the qualities which sensible motorists seek, simply to achieve performance that is unusable legally and indefensible socially on public roads. But what happens when I am invited to drive one? I give in as easily as a chocoholic who yearns to be slim but cannot resist just one more praline. Four fast cars, all quite different, have been my recent undoing: a Porsche 911 Carrera 2 cabriolet; an AC Mark IV Lightweight; a Subaru SVX and a BMW M5. The Porsche, in an eye-catching emerald green with matching leather interior, was a Turbo-look limited edition. It had the Turbo's wide wheels and tyres, brakes and suspension but a normal 3.3-litre, air-cooled, flat-six engine producing 250 horsepower against the real thing's 320. I have to say that 250 horsepower - and masses of torque (or pulling power) from only 2,000 rpm - seemed more than enough. Most of the time I had the car, it rained. It is imprudent to take liberties with 911s on wet roads but, driven with conditions in mind, the Turbo-look did not put a foot wrong. The engine pulled so well low down the speed range that town driving was never fraught. On the open road, a gently depressed right foot in fourth or fifth gave vigorous acceleration. The effect of a prod on the pedal in second or third was like pulling a trigger. At Pounds 67,689, I rated the Turbo-look 911 Cabrio a lovely toy for the wealthy and self-indulgent. One could say the same for the AC Mk IV Lightweight, only more so. This re-creation of the AC Cobra of the 1960s is the muscle car personified. A huge five-litre, 325-horsepower, Ford V8 engine has been shoe-horned into a tubular steel chassis topped with an open two-seat body, hand-beaten and rolled from aluminium sheet. Before the war, AC advertised its individually-built cars as 'true products of the Savile Row of motordom.' The barrel-chested Mk IV Lightweight is true to this tradition. An AC Competition two-seater with cut-away doors and fold-flat windscreen cost Pounds 500 in 1937, when a Savile Row suit was about Pounds 15. Both have gone up a bit since then. Savile Row suits now cost around Pounds 1,500. The key-in-hand price of a hand-built AC Mk IV Lightweight is close to Pounds 100,000. For this you get a macho machine, arrogantly impractical as an everyday car but, even at legal speeds on public roads, joyously exciting to drive, It has been timed at 4.2 seconds from 0-62 mph (0-100 kmh), 10.6 seconds from 0-100 mph. On a private circuit, it must be breathtaking. Never mind the modern engine - it has the appeal (and wood-rimmed steering wheel) of an aristocratic 1930s' sports car. But its squat, ultra-grippy tyres and enormous disc brakes make it much easier and, in today's traffic, safer to drive. When I visited the AC factory near Brooklands, some of the same artist-craftsmen who make the cars were running up the Merlin engine of a second world war Hurricane fighter they have rebuilt. A thrilling sound - but no more so than the song of a Mk IV Lightweight in second at 6,000 rpm. Nothing could be more different from Porsche or AC than the Subaru SVX. Its 226 bhp, 3.3-litre, 24-valve, flat-six engine drives all four wheels. The transmission distributes the power individually to each wheel, according to tyre grip. ABS does the same for the braking effort. Of the quartet of high performers, none impressed me as much as the SVX. Styled strikingly with the windows curving up into the roof, it is a genuine four-seater with a good boot. Automatic transmission, air-conditioning, leather seats (the front ones heated, the driver's power-adjusted), cruise control, power-operated windows and sun roof all are standard. Satisfying, yet undemanding to drive, the SVX feels glued to wet or dry roads, makes little mechanical, wind or tyre noise and, remarkably, gave me a shade over 26 mpg (10.8 l/100 km). I cannot think how Subaru and its British concessionaire, IMI Group, manage to sell it for only Pounds 28,000. Finally, the third-generation BMW M5. This has just gone on sale in Britain at Pounds 48,950, or Pounds 55,575 with air-bag, leather trim, air-conditioning, remote-control anti-theft system and electric seats, and without any chromium trim. The charge for getting rid of the glitter is Pounds 90. The M5 combines the virtues of a four/five seat, big-booted 5-Series saloon with super-car performance. While top speed is limited to 155 mph (250 kmh), it gets from 0-62 mph in 5.9 seconds and - more importantly for a business driver - from 50-75 mph in 6.9 seconds in fourth gear. The engine is a 3.8-litre in-line six developing 340 horsepower. The 17-inch wheels give sharp steering response and seemingly unlimited cornering abilities, but at the cost of bumpiness on rough roads. Electronically controlled damping adapts nicely to a driver's mood, although the ride is on the firm side of luxurious. The M5 has a dual personality. At 30 mph and a shade over 1,000 rpm, it pulls unprotestingly in fifth gear. But drop into third and let the engine spin and it takes off like a rocket. Manual transmission would not be my choice in a car of this class but the gear-shift is good and, in view of the power it has to transmit, the clutch is light.</p>

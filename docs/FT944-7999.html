			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Stitched together for better or worse: Baby Bell phone companies and US cable TV operators are increasingly chasing the same market Across the US, telephone companies are clubbing together to get into cable television. Cable companies are clubbing together to get into telephony. Telephone and cable companies are getting together with each other - and with the entertainment business. Next month's Dollars 10bn-plus auction of mobile phone licences by the US government is triggering a transformation of the communications industry. But the strategic issue is wider than a race for licences. Companies are positioning themselves to supply America's homes with an enormous range of services, from simple phone calls to dial-a-video and armchair shopping. The two main groups of contestants are the regional phone companies, otherwise known as Baby Bells, and the cable TV operators. Technically, each group is now capable of doing the other's job. But as regulated local monopolies, they have been kept apart by government decree. Now technological change is creating new opportunities for them to sell each other's services that are outrunning government's ability to police their separation. The barriers between them are breaking down. In the short term, the results could be damaging for both industries. As Salomon Brothers' telecoms analyst Mr Jack Grubman points out, neither local telephony nor cable is a growth market in the US. Annual turnover in US local telephony is put at Dollars 90bn (Pounds 55bn), cable at Dollars 20bn. More than 90 per cent of US homes have a telephone, and local telephone sales are rising only in line with inflation. The cable companies pass 90 per cent of homes and serve 75 per cent. 'Anybody who doesn't have cable,' says Mr Grubman, 'doesn't want it, can't afford it or has a satellite dish.' If these two powerful industries invade each other's territory with investment plans totalling billions of dollars, the inevitable result will be vastly increased supply and plunging prices. Yet both industries are planning to spend Dollars 1,000 per customer to duplicate each other's business, says Mr Grubman. Some would dispute the figure - the cable companies, in particular, argue their investment will be smaller. They already have sophisticated networks in the ground that can carry both TV and telephony, while the phone companies' networks still consist mostly of old copper wire that cannot carry TV. But a battle between the two is now inevitable. Mr Fred Salerno, vice-chairman of New York regional phone company Nynex, says: 'We see two full service providers passing houses in America: one a cable company that looks like a telephone company, the other a telephone company that looks like a cable company.' And, he concedes, it will be costly. 'There's no doubt the market will be somewhat bloodied for a while. Margins will shrink and market shares will shift.' The telephone companies, he argues, have three basic advantages. First, since they need to modernise their networks anyway, adding the capacity to carry entertainment services comes virtually free. 'We can almost justify putting broadband networks out there just on grounds of cost reduction, so the incremental cost of new services is correspondingly low.' Second, he says, the phone companies have much stronger balance sheets. This is true in most cases: as long-established monopolies, the Baby Bells have enormously strong cash flow; cable is a relatively young industry, still carrying debt from its start-up investment and facing the costs of a new round of competition. The cable companies retort that their shareholders know all about that. As the chief executive of one large cable company puts it: 'Our investors permit us the luxury of big capital investments for future growth. The Baby Bells are income stocks and are expected to pay dividends, which is a huge capital requirement every year.' Third, Mr Salerno says, customers prefer the telephone companies for reliability. Historically, the cable companies were created to entertain, not to provide an essential service. Understanding entertainment gives them a valuable edge in the coming battle with the phone companies. But their record in providing service and fixing faults has been correspondingly poor and, while they claim to have made great strides lately, their image may still tell against them. The telephone companies, by contrast, are utilities with a statutory obligation to provide universal service. If a phone line goes down in the small hours of a Sunday morning, it is their job to fix it. 'Our primary research suggests,' says Mr Salerno, 'that if we can offer the same services as a cable company, we'll get the business.' However, the battle between telephone and cable companies will be complicated by the growing competition in mobile telecommunications. In the past, mobile telephony in the US has been restricted by statute to two networks per region. Typically, these are old-fashioned analogue systems with limited capacity; as they are upgraded to digital technology, their capacity will increase at least threefold. On top of that, the government will next month auction broadband mobile frequencies for personal communications services (or PCS), which will carry mobile telecommunications but also other data. There will be as many as six per region by 1997-98. The result, says one cable executive, is that 'we will be awash with wireless capacity'. Charges for mobile telephony are likely to fall as a result. At present, says Mr Grubman of Salomon, mobile telephony does not eat into conventional local telephone services. 'When it costs 50 per cent less (than now),' he says, 'it could start to.' Yet both telephone and cable companies are forming alliances with each other, with the long-distance operators and with the entertainment business to bid for the new networks. One might therefore ask why the telephone and cable companies are so keen to join the bidding. It is here that one runs up against a buzz-phrase in the industry: the value chain. A continuum, it is said, has developed all the way from wires in the ground to Hollywood movies or interactive video games: or, as the jargon has it, between conduit and content. The telephone and cable companies fear that the value will migrate from the conduit end of the chain to the content end. Hence last month's alliance between three of the Baby Bells and a leading Hollywood talent agency, the aim being to secure a supply of films and other entertainment to put through the Baby Bells' new cable networks. At present, this is understandable: the explosive growth in the cable/phone networks is running ahead of the entertainment industry's ability to feed it. The logical safeguard against such uncertainty is to be in everything at once. As Mr Salerno of Nynex puts it: 'Since you don't know where the value is in the chain, you need to be all the way up and down it.' There will be two notable absentees from the bidding: MCI, the second-biggest US long-distance phone company, and media giant Time Warner, America's second biggest cable company. Both are working on a simple premise: that as overcapacity develops, they will be able to pick up mobile phone licences cheaply in their own time. For the industry as a whole, however, the flourishing alliances involve much duplication of resources. Inevitably some of the investments now being made will in the future look to have been a monstrous waste. Mr Richard Bodmin, head of strategy at AT&amp;T, the biggest US long-distance phone company, says that the duplication is necessary. 'The way we get more efficient in this country is through experiment,' he says. 'It's only wasteful from the standpoint of a philosopher king with a view of how it ought to work out.' Mr Bodmin adds that the risk of industry overcapacity is prob-ably not serious over a 15-year period. 'You're going to get periods of oversupply in given areas, and if you take any one part of the network, there might be a year or two when it looks kind of black. But over 15 years, we're nowhere near the end of good ideas to put down the line.'</p>

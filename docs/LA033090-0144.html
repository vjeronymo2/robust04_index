			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> CHAMBER MAY DROP TRADITIONAL PARADE  </P> <P> After 36 years, the once-popular Fiesta La Cristianita Parade may be canceled  by the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce due to lack of interest.  </P> <P> Although the chamber's board of directors has yet to vote on the issue, the  parade regularly scheduled in May is not on the group's calendar this year.  </P> <P> "Attendance has dwindled in the last few years," said Mimi Collier, chamber  director. "(The parade) has been a drain on our volunteers."  </P> <P> Last year, the chamber scaled down the annual event.  </P> <P> Formerly a professionally run operation featuring marching bands and floats,  the 1989 parade was a parody event run similarly to the annual Doo-Dah Parade  in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The chamber also shifted the date of the parade to May from its traditional  slot during the monthlong Fiesta La Cristianita in July.  </P> <P> Collier hopes some other community group will resurrect the parade.  </P></p>

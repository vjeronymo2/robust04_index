			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Pay deal raises fears for German inflation THE Bundesbank yesterday warned that Germany's inflation rate could approach 4 per cent by the end of the year, in the wake of a landmark 7 per cent pay deal in the metal-working industry reached at the weekend. Mr Lothar Muller, president of the Bavarian regional central bank and a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, ruled out interest rate cuts in coming months as a result of the 'stiff breeze' blowing on the inflation front. Mr Muller said the annual rate of price increases was likely to rise to 3.5 to 4 per cent by the end of the year, fuelled by tax increases as well as by latest wage settlements. This compares with the present rate of 2.5 per cent. The weekend pay deal, coming after a week of warning strikes organised by the IG Metall trade union, was reached for 700,000 workers in the pace-setting North Wurttemberg-North Baden region in south-west Germany. Made up of a 6.7 per cent rise plus other top-up payments, the accord is likely to become the norm for nearly 4m west German metal industry workers. The agreement is also expected to be adopted for 1m east German metal-workers.</p>

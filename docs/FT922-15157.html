			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Insurance ruling THE rights of policyholders to have insurance claims paid even if their insurers go out of business could be limited by a Commercial Court ruling yesterday. The ruling came in a case involving three policyholders of subsidiaries of London United Investments, which went into administration in 1990. Under the Policyholders Protection Act of 1975 policyholders can claim a sum equal to 90 per cent of claims from insurance companies which have gone into liquidation. Mr Justice Webster ruled that contingent liabilities - where an event giving rise to a claim has occurred but the amount due has still to be determined - are excluded from protection under the act.</p>

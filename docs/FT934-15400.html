			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tunnel vision It would be nice to think that once the Queen and President Mitterrand snip the red ribbon and les shuttles start hurtling under the sea that the gargantuan doubts - and debts - enveloping Eurotunnel will quickly fade. With the costs known and revenues flowing, the imponderables hampering any meaningful valuation of Eurotunnel's units will be reduced. It should then be possible to calculate a present value for future dividend flows - even though Eurotunnel will remain further away from making a pay-out than it forecast when it first issued units in 1987. Unfortunately Eurotunnel is spending cash so fast that investors and bankers will be asked for new money before the tunnel opens, diluting future returns. The sums needed are likely to be higher than the market had previously assumed. But then, what is the odd couple of hundred million pounds when your debts are as great as Sudan's? The rights issue will dampen any euphoria stimulated by the opening. Afterwards, investors will switch attention to how much the tunnel might make. Eurotunnel is chopping short-term revenue forecasts. The worry is that its long-term projections may be too rosy too - especially if rival ferry operators do not quickly cut capacity. Eurotunnel assumes rising cross-Channel traffic will enable it to lift yields. But ferry operators have not managed the feat. The theory also flies in the face of the aviation industry's experience where real prices have fallen steadily despite rising demand. A burst of inflation would surely help but even this cannot be relied upon.</p>

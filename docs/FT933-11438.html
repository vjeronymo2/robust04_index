			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: St James's Place buys fund manager ST JAMES'S Place Capital, the investment company run by Sir Mark Weinberg and Lord Rothschild, is to acquire International Financial Markets Trading, the specialist fund management company, as part of its drive to become a focused financial services company. The move follows SJPC's unbundling of its stake in RIT Capital Partners earlier this week through a Pounds 137m cash and paper pay-out to shareholders, which reduced the size of the business by about a third. SJPC has agreed with IFM's parent company, Bermuda-based Walsingham, to purchase all outstanding shares in IFM for Dollars 9m (Pounds 6m), comprising up of Dollars 2m in book value and Dollars 7m for goodwill. The existing management will also receive a share of this year's profits, which is likely to total some Dollars 3m in cash based on current expectations. Net profits before tax of IFM's continuing businesses were some Dollars 2.5m for the year ended December 31 1992. The acquisition is subject to approval by Walsingham shareholders at a meeting on August 26. IFM, set up in 1984 to trade its own capital, began to manage third-party funds in 1988 and currently has Dollars 455m under management, invested by institutions and high net worth individuals. The company specialises in the growing area of hedge funds, which apply quantitative techniques, often using derivative instruments, to investment management. Mr Clive Gibson, a director of SJPC, said that future acquisitions could include other fund management businesses, possibly using more conventional fund management techniques, or niche banking or stockbroking businesses. He described the company's approach as 'opportunistic', adding that any acquisitions would be 'high-margin, focused financial services businesses.' SJPC's existing interests include insurance, through J Rothschild Assurance and fund management, through J Rothschild Investment Management, J Rothschild Capital management and Global Asset Management. On completion of the acquisition, Sir Mark Weinberg will become chairman of IFM and Mr Gibson will join the board. One of IFM's existing institutional investors, American International Group, the US insurance company, is engaged in discussions to acquire a minority interest in IFM from SJPC.</p>

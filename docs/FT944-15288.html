			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Without charge Compared with Germany or other countries in central Europe, let alone those of the third world, the UK does not have a refugee problem. The number of asylum applications peaked in 1991 at 44,800, falling to 22,370 last year. Yet the British Home Office finds it necessary to hold a growing number of applicants - currently about 600 - in detention. In a report published this week, and based on 50 cases selected at random, Amnesty International found an average of nearly five months' detention before release or expulsion. More than half those studied were detained for over four months. Also, more than half spent at least part of their detention in a criminal prison, in violation of international standards. A separate study by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture deals with 47 detained asylum seekers examined by doctors from the foundation since January 1993. All claimed to have suffered torture in their own countries; all were found to be credible. The most disturbing aspect of the system is that detainees are held without charge. In the great majority of cases the initial decision to detain is made by an immigration officer with only minimal training in asylum issues and no specialist knowledge of the political situation in countries from which refugees come. Yet there is no requirement, as there is for people accused of crimes, that the detainee be brought before a court or independent review body within a fixed period of time. The government says that detainees are told the reasons for detention. Yet many immigration officers seem to be unaware of this obligation. In any event no written statement of reasons is given. Some detainees (but not all) are eligible for bail. This, however, requires two persons willing to act as sureties by pledging a substantial sum of money. Even then, there is no presumption in favour of bail (as there is in criminal cases), and Home Office lawyers usually oppose it. The ostensible reason for subjecting a small proportion of asylum seekers to this treatment is the fear that they would otherwise abscond. Yet seldom if ever is any reason given why some are more likely to do this than others. In 22 of the cases followed by Amnesty the person was eventually released before his/her case was resolved. Not one of these subsequently absconded. No other EU country detains asylum seekers for such long periods, or without judicial process. As well as being expensive for the British taxpayer, the practice is contrary to international human rights law. The government should act promptly to ensure that asylum seekers, not accused of any crime, have at least the same rights as people who are.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cuevas Maintains That UGT's Proposal </F> Is More of Same Thing"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- CEOE [Spanish Confederation of  Employers Organizations] Chairman Jose Maria Cuevas did not  appear too hopeful yesterday afternoon about the possibility  that social dialogue -- between the government, employers, and  trade unions -- will be resumed. In his opinion, the proposal  of consultation made a few hours earlier by General Workers  Union Secretary General Candido Mendez means more of the same  thing, since it entails a radical reconsideration of the labor  reform currently passing through parliament, COLPISA reports.    The statements by the bosses' boss were made in the Senate  where he went like the other social interlocutors in order to  set out his views on changing the labor regulations.    The CEOE chairman reiterated to the Social and Employment  Policy Committee that the approaching changes "are  insufficient." He stated once more that the cost of dismissals  remains high under the bills.  <H5>  "Imposition" </H5>   Jose Maria Cuevas initially described Candido Mendez'  proposal as "useful," but later said that it is "an imposition."  He stated that the withdrawal of the labor reform must be  negotiated with "the parents who made it" -- not with the CEOE.  "With the deputies, with the government, with the parliamentary  forces, and so forth," he counted, while emphasizing that the  reform is necessary and urgent.    In short, in the employers' leader's opinion, the proposal  by  Nicolas Redondo's replacement "has begun badly because it is to  return to where we were."    The CEOE chairman refused to comment on Felipe Gonzalez'  speech. He argued that his tight schedule prevented him from  following the Congress of Deputies debate. However, he  explained that he does not share the government's optimistic  view on emerging from the crisis. "Some economic indicators are  recovering, but not the country's economy. I do not believe  that we are in a process of clear expansion," he specified.    He reiterated the employers' will to negotiate on an  agreement for employment "if the trade unions' proposal is  sincere," he emphasized. [passage omitted]</p>

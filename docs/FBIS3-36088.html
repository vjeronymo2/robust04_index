Deputies supported the proposal of people's deputy Serhiy  Holovatyy, who proposed "to ensure a quorum of live deputies,  and not button ones [ones who have substitutes to press the  button in votes], and to send out telegrams to them so that  there are not less than 300 deputies in the session hall  tomorrow, 3 February." In his speech, Serhiy Holovatyy said that  if the amendments to the law on elections are not approved, the  elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 27 March would  not take place. But elections for the president are set for 26  June. "To whom will power belong over this period?" -- Serhiy  Holovatyy asked. Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme  Council, who was chairing the session, agreed with this  proposal, instructing Vasyl Durdynets, first deputy chairman of  the Supreme Council, to assemble a quorum.</p>

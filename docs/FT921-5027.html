			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Director's disqualification case can go ahead late OFFICIAL RECEIVER v NIXON Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Balcombe and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith): February 11 1992 LEAVE WILL be granted to apply out of time for a director's disqualification order if the court is satisfied there is an arguable case for disqualification, provided there is adequate explanation for the delay and it has not prejudiced the person against whom the order is sought. And if there is a question as to whether that person was in fact a director, it is sufficient for extension of time purposes that the evidence, taking all factors together, shows a fairly arguable case that he was a director or shadow director, in that he controlled the company's affairs beyond the province of a professional adviser. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr David Henry Nixon, from Mr Justice Vinelott's decision upholding leave granted by the County Court to the Official Receiver to apply out of time for an order disqualifying Mr Nixon from acting as a company director. LORD JUSTICE BALCOMBE said that the Official Receiver had been given leave to apply out of time for a disqualifying order against Mr Nixon. Section 7(1) of the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 provided that the Official Receiver might apply for a disqualification order against a 'director' of a company being wound up by the court. Section 2 provided that an application for a disqualification order should not be made after two years from when the company 'became insolvent', except with leave of the court. Tasbian Ltd, an electronics company, started trading in 1982. It was largely financed by Castle Finance Ltd. Castle lent Tasbian Pounds 400,000 secured by a debenture. Midland Bank granted it a Pounds 50,000 overdraft facility, and Barclays Bank lent a further Pounds 610,000 secured by debenture. Tasbian made losses in every accounting period to the end of 1985. In September 1985, Castle introduced Mr Nixon, a chartered accountant and experienced company doctor. He was to report to Castle on Tasbian's financial position and advise on and help its recovery. He was also appointed consultant to Tasbian. On November 1 1985, he reported to the directors after which a decision was made to trade out of Tasbian's difficulties. A moratorium of creditors was proposed, and Castle agreed to subscribe an additional Pounds 400,000 share capital. Sometime after February 1986, Tasbian employees were transferred to a shell company called Hartbrook Manpower Services, which had no other business and no source of income except payments from Tasbian for the employees' services. It incurred large NIC and PAYE liabilities. Negotiations for the take-over of Tasbian by another company foundered. Tasbian's fate was then sealed. On September 24 and 30 Barclays and Castle respectively appointed joint receivers and managers. Mr Nixon had resigned as consultant shortly before the receivers were appointed. As at September 24 1986, there were unsecured liabilities of Pounds 1.54m, leaving a deficiency of Pounds 1.39m. The Official Receiver's charges against Mr Nixon were (a) that he failed to ensure that accounts were prepared and delivered in compliance with section 241 of the Companies Act 1985, and to see that the statutory register of members was properly maintained; (b) that he caused Tasbian to trade while insolvent; and (c) that he caused Tasbian to operate a policy of non-payment of Crown monies. A winding-up order was made on November 10 1986. On December 12, Mr Nixon had a motor accident but was back at work by January 5 1987. In July 1987, he was in contact with the Official Receiver, and made a statement to his examiner on June 2 1988. Section 6(2) of the 1986 Act provided that for the purposes of sections 6 and 7 a company became 'insolvent' if it went into liquidation when its assets were insufficient to pay its debts, or if '(c) an administrative receiver of the company is appointed'. The question arose whether time under section 7(2), which was two years from when the company 'became insolvent', ran from appointment of administrative receivers on September 24 1986, or from the winding up order on November 10 1986. That issue had been decided in the Court of Appeal in favour of Mr Nixon. The remaining question was whether the Official Receiver should have been given leave to apply out of time. On the appeal, Mr Bannister for Mr Nixon argued first, that there was not sufficient evidence that he was a 'director' or 'shadow director'. On an application for leave to bring proceedings under section 7 out of time, the test was the same as that used on any application for leave to take some initiating procedure out of time. If the court was satisfied that the evidence showed a fairly arguable case on the applicant's part, then on that ground alone, leaving aside the reasons for the delay and any questions of prejudice to the other party, it would not refuse leave. In section 22(4) 'director' was defined as including a shadow director. By section 22(5) 'shadow director' meant 'a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act . . .' The matters relied on by the Official Receiver to substantiate his case that Mr Nixon was a shadow or de facto director were that he was appointed and paid by Tasbian; he negotiated an informal moratorium with creditors; he monitored trading and assisted the board; in particular, he negotiated with the DTI and Inland Revenue; he became a signatory on Tasbian's bank account; he advised on the transfer of the labour force to Hartbrook; and most of the directors regarded him as a shadow director. Some of the matters on which the Official Receiver relied, taken by themselves, were of little weight, for example negotiating a moratorium with creditors. But others were much more significant - in particular the allegation that Mr Nixon monitored Tasbian's trading, and controlled its bank account; and the Hartbrook hive-down, which Mr Nixon advised and in implementation of which he assisted. The evidence disclosed a sufficiently arguable case that Mr Nixon was either a shadow or de facto director. Mr Bannister's second argument was that there was insufficient explanation for the Official Receiver's failure to commence proceedings within time. In considering an application for leave to commence disqualification proceedings out of time, the court should take into account (1) the length of delay; (2) the reasons for delay; (3) the strength of the case against a director; and (4) the degree of prejudice caused to him by the delay (Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Desai, CA, November 29 1991). The Official Receiver said the application was not late by reference to two years from date of winding-up, but only by reference to two years from date of the administrative receivership, and the application was made to regularise what might otherwise be regarded as an out-of-time application. Also he said, difficulty was experienced in interviewing Mr Nixon because of the car accident 'and it was not until May 1988 that contact was made'. That last passage was inaccurate. The Official Receiver's misunderstanding of the law was not of itself unreasonable. Against the background of his belief that he had two years from the winding up to make his application, sufficient explanation for the delay had been given. With regard to the inaccuracies, this was public interest litigation. If Mr Nixon had really behaved so as to render him unfit to be a director, it would not be right to prelude trial of that question merely because the Official Receiver had been inaccurate in certain facts. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed. For Mr Nixon: Edward Bannister QC (Jude Sykes &amp; Harrison). For the Official Receiver: Philip Heslop QC and Jonathan Crow (Treasury Solicitor).</p>

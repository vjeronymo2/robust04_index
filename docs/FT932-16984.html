			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Philippine mining group trims deficit ATLAS Consolidated Mining and Development, a Philippine copper producer, posted a net loss of 473m pesos (Dollars 19m) in 1992, slightly less than the previous year's 491m pesos loss, Reuter reports from Manila. The directors said the loss was due to weak demand for copper caused by the global recession, low metal prices because of huge inventories worldwide and rising costs. Turnover fell to 2.8bn pesos from 4.2bn pesos, and the loss per share emerged at 5.65 pesos compared with a loss of 5.87 pesos.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH, HARRIS OFF TO A GOOD START IN BIG WEST  </P> <P> Lucious Harris, Cal State Long Beach's freshman guard, wasn't worried about  playing in his first tournament game.  </P> <P> "I just stay cool," Harris said after scoring a career-high 23 points to lead  the 49ers to an 86-68 victory over Utah State in the Big West Conference  tournament Friday at the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> Harris, who made eight of 11 shots, said he felt pressure "at first, but then  it was just another game, another step."  </P> <P> The victory was the eighth in a row for the 49ers (21-7), who will play New  Mexico State in the semifinals tonight.  </P> <P> "He doesn't panic or worry about anything. He just goes out and plays," Tyrone  Mitchell, the 49ers' senior guard, said of Harris. "I take a lot of pressure  off him -- I let him play and I do the rest of the stuff."  </P> <P> Mitchell had nine assists against Utah State.  </P> <P> Long Beach had not won a postseason game in its last five attempts, three under  Coach Joe Harrington.  </P> <P> "That was the first tournament game for about eight of our guys, so they're  1-0," Harrington said.  </P> <P> The 49ers won the game with two big surges in the last eight minutes of the  first half. Over that span, they outscored Utah State, 27-10, and led at the  half, 45-31. The Aggies never seriously threatened in the second half.  </P> <P> Utah State lost its last lead when Kevin Cutler, who had 19 points and 12  rebounds, scored on a jump shot in the lane.  </P> <P> Mitchell then stole the ball from Allen Gordon and drove for a layup.  </P> <P> Cutler scored again in the lane to put the 49ers ahead, 28-23.  </P> <P> Utah State (14-16) not only started missing shots, but also started making  errors against Long Beach's press.  </P> <P> "Defensively they caused us problems," Aggie Coach Kohn Smith said. "After they  put on their press, they rushed us into off-balance shots."  </P> <P> A three-point play by Harris and a reverse dunk by Rudy Harvey, which followed  an Aggie turnover, made it 33-23.  </P> <P> Utah State got back to within 35-29, but the 49ers closed the half with a 10-2  run, which featured two baskets each by Cutler and Frankie Edwards, and a  reverse dunk by Joseph, who had driven the baseline.  </P> <P> The 49ers shot 52% from the field in the first half and forced the Aggies into  13 of their 20 turnovers.  </P> <P> Reserve forward Frankie Edwards scored 16 points for the 49ers, making seven of  10 shots.  </P> <P> Kendall Youngblood led Utah State with 16 points.  </P> <P> "I'm happy with 21 wins," Harrington said. "Happy but not satisfied. We're  getting into a better rhythm on offense, better than we have had at any time  this season. They're a happy bunch of guys, and they're working hard."  </P></p>

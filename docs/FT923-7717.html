			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Belfast man is extradited A WEST Belfast man who was acquitted in Germany on IRA-linked bombing charges was yesterday extradited to Northern Ireland. Mr Gerard Hanratty, 32, from Andersonstown, who was found not guilty in Dusseldorf of bombing an army base, was flown to Belfast where magistrates remanded him in custody on firearms charges. Mr Hanratty and Mr Terence McGeogh were found not guilty a year ago of causing an explosion at the Glamorgan Barracks in Duisburg in July 1988 in which 10 soldiers were killed. The judges decided, after a year-long trial, there was insufficient evidence against the two and ordered their release. Mr Hanratty was immediately re-arrested pending extradition to Northern Ireland. He was charged with firearms offences following an incident in 1984 but failed to turn up for his trial after being bailed.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BENEFITS, TRIALS OF BECOMING YOUR OWN LAWYER  </P> <P> He strode toward the witness confidently, his cordovan loafers shining and his  graying hair neatly slicked back.  </P> <P> Carrying a yellow legal pad filled with detailed notes, the man confronted the  witness, asking carefully worded questions. The man was well-prepared. He had  to be. His freedom was at stake.  </P> <P> The man was 61-year-old Richard Hughes and the scene was the Pennsylvania  courtroom of Lehigh Judge Maxwell Davison. Hughes was on trial for theft, a  serious crime that carries a possible sentence of five years in jail. Yet  Hughes had no lawyer. He was representing himself, depending on his own  knowledge and finesse to save his good name, and his liberty.  </P> <P> "I rest my case," he told Davison optimistically when he had finished asking  the questions he felt would prove he did not illegally withhold a commission  from a salesman who worked for his real estate company.  </P> <P> Hughes won his case, something the Allentown, Pa., man had done many times  before. Though this was the first time he had faced a possible jail sentence,  Hughes was no more intimidated by the prosecutor from the district attorney's  office than he has been by the private attorneys he faced in civil matters or  the judges who have controlled his fate.  </P> <P> "A lot of people, when you say court, they immediately have fear," Hughes said  outside the courtroom. "A lot of people see a judge like a god. Most people  wouldn't even think of trying (to represent themselves), but a lot of people  are being taken over the coals by lawyers."  </P> <P> In an era where there is hardly a dearth of lawyers -- about 700,000, or one  for every 250 U.S. residents -- thousands of people across the country are  going pro se, the Latin term meaning for yourself used by those in the legal  profession to refer to people who represent themselves.  </P> <P> These are people who say they can't afford a lawyer, often people caught in the  gap between those poor enough to receive legal assistance and those with enough  money to pay fees that can reach several hundred dollars an hour. These are  people who feel that lawyers will not give service worth their high fees. And  these also are people who simply want to be in charge of their own lives.  </P> <P> If there is any truth to the adage, "He who represents himself has a fool for a  client," these people are ignoring it. And they are supported by organizations  across the nation, many of which have produced "how-to" books and guides  designed to help people wade through the bureaucracy that is the American legal  system.  </P> <P> "Law is not this mystical thing," said Leili Eghbal, publicity director for  Nolo Press, a 20-year-old Berkeley-based publisher of self-help legal  information. "Basically, people can do it themselves; we are making sure we can  provide them with the most up-to-date information."  </P> <P> There seems to be little connection between the apparent simplicity of the  matter and whether or not a lawyer is necessary.  </P> <P> Many people find drawing up a will to be their first legal task and the first  time they decide whether to hire a lawyer. Consumer groups say there is no  reason why a person can't write his own will, especially with the help of books  like Nolo's "Simple Will Book," which even contains legal forms.  </P> <P> Many lawyers suggest that people work on their wills themselves, but then find  a lawyer to look them over. Some lawyers will do a simple will for less than  $100.  </P> <P> Lawyers often use the same philosophy when it comes to resolving domestic  disputes such as divorce. A couple might want to try to work through some of  the issues before getting a lawyer to seal the deal. No-fault divorce, however,  has led many couples to do it themselves. In California, for example, 70% of  divorces are handled pro se.  </P> <P> Public-interest groups say more people would represent themselves if more  attitudes changed.  </P> <P> "Judges are incredibly hostile and impatient with pro se litigants. They don't  cut any slack," said Debbie Chalfie, legislative director for HALT, a nonprofit  public-interest group that seeks to make the legal system simpler, more  accessible, more affordable and more equitable.  </P> <P> Judges say pro se litigants put them in a jam.  </P> <P> "Theoretically we are supposed to treat someone with a lawyer and without a  lawyer the same," said Lehigh County (Pa.) Judge Robert Young. "My experience  is we end up helping the person without the lawyers. The judge is biting his  tongue time and time again because it isn't fair to the other side."  </P> <P> Young said that he might extend a filing deadline or help a pro se litigant get  something into evidence.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you don't want a guy thrown out of court because they don't know  procedure," he said.  </P> <P> Young said one reason to hire a lawyer is "not because the lawyer is so smart,  but because the lawyer is supposed to be detached and logical."  </P> <P> "It's difficult for an emotionally involved person: 'That's my kid. That's my  car.' It's difficult for them to know what's relevant and they end up telling  you all kinds of stuff they shouldn't tell you because it hurts them. . . . The  lawyers have learned what the judge needs to know to resolve that particular  issue. They don't go off on these lifetime stories."  </P> <P> HALT's Chalfie said: "The pro se litigant has to learn procedure and evidence  and all forms of proceedings, and whether the form is double-spaced or  single-spaced. There are a lot of pitfalls and barriers. Some of them are there  for the parties' protection and the integrity of the court. Others are there  just to place barriers, so you need to hire someone to maneuver their way  around it."  </P> <P> Pro se litigants across the country tell stories of court clerks who won't  answer simple questions, of being denied access to legal records and legal  forms.  </P> <P> "It's not that judges are malicious. They just don't know how to deal with  people on their own," said George Milko, HALT education director. "When they  are faced with pro se litigants, even the most well-meaning judges also stumble  around."  </P> <P> HALT, when it began 12 years ago, stood for Help Abolish Legal Tyranny. But the  group, which keeps the HALT acronym, now refers to itself as an organization of  Americans for legal reform.  </P> <P> HALT is working to get states to expand the dollar limits for small-claims  court, replace legalese with plain language, allow court personnel to help  non-lawyers with simple legal matters and change restrictions on who may  practice law.  </P> <P> Both HALT and Nolo publish books and guides. Nolo has 60 titles, many of which  contain legal forms. Some of the titles include "Plan Your Estate," "Fight Your  Ticket" and "The Living Together Kit."  </P> <P> The issue of who may practice law is one of the hottest on the legal front  these days.  </P> <P> Across the nation, paralegals are seeking the right to work without an  attorney's supervision to help people resolve simple legal matters. The theory  is that they can answer questions that would allow people to go into court  without a lawyer, or that they can help do the paper work that often accounts  for much of lawyers' fees.  </P> <P> A Nolo study concluded that paralegals could save consumers billions annually.  </P> <P> According to the study, it would cost $750 to get a divorce from a lawyer at a  nationally advertised clinic, a figure considered low compared to most lawyers  fees. On the other hand, a paralegal would charge about $125.  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: CMB benefits from top management reshuffle CMB PACKAGING, Europe's largest packaging group which reshuffled its top management last autumn, yesterday reported a 16 per cent rise in net profits before extraordinary items in 1991. However, the FFr852m (Dollars 152m) profits represented a 17 per cent fall in attributable earnings due to the fact that 1990 profits were inflated by a large extraordinary gain on the sale of the group's steel business. Mr Jurgen Hintz, the American chief executive who took over at the helm of the Franco-British group from the flamboyant Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries last autumn, said the results showed the management reorganisation and cost-cutting measures taken last year were starting to pay off. CMB, formed three years ago from the merger of Carnaud of France and Metalbox Packaging of Britain, had been dogged by friction between its UK and French senior managers, which culminated in Mr Descarpentries' departure. Relations between managers and between the two main French and British shareholders were now cordial, said Mr Hintz. Turnover last year rose by 4.5 per cent to FFr25.5bn, on which operating earnings climbed by 8 per cent to FFr2.4bn. Within this, sales in the UK fell 2 per cent, the US was down 4 per cent, and Germany was up 23 per cent. Operating profits in metal packaging were stable, while plastic packaging recovered strongly. Since the turn of the year, growth in Germany had ground to a halt, while there was no sign of a UK recovery, said Mr Hintz. Productivity, in sales per head, rose by 12 per cent last year, partly reflecting the loss of 2,500 jobs, bringing the workforce down to 31,450. This brought a steep rise in restructuring charges, from FFr198m to FFr389m. CMB's increased cash-flow and reduced working capital enabled it to reduce its high debts, a legacy of its earlier hectic acquisitions, to FFr3.91bn by the end of December, from FFr4.78bn. Gearing fell from 42 per cent of shareholders' funds to 33 per cent over the same period, as interest charges fell by 9 per cent to FFr67m. Sales in the first quarter of the current year were flat, after an unusually strong first quarter last year, said Mr Hintz.</p>

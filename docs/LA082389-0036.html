			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LAMB'S PLAYERS DO POIGNANT JOB WITH 'DIARY OF ANNE FRANK'  </P> <P> "It's an odd idea for someone like me, to keep a diary; not only because I have  never done so before, but because it seems to me that neither I -- nor for that  matter anyone else -- will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13-year-old  schoolgirl." -- From "The Diary of Anne Frank"  </P> <P> Anne Frank died in the Nazi concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen two months  before its liberation and three months before her 16th birthday.  </P> <P> She was just one of the 6 million Jews who died at Nazi hands during World War  II. The simple diary she left -- bursting with girlish confessions, complaints,  laughter, tears, dreams and longings -- gave the Holocaust a human face.  </P> <P> The diary begins just before Anne went into hiding with her family and four  other Jews in a cramped attic in the Netherlands, and ends with the family's  discovery by the Nazis 2 1/2 years later. Anne's father, Otto, was the only  member of the family to survive the concentration camps.  </P> <P> Seeing the play, now at Lamb's Players Theatre through Sept. 17, reopens the  personal pain that lies buried under the statistics. The story is all the more  poignant because Anne is mercilessly honest in describing the eight refugees in  the cramped attic. She records the spats about whether or not she will eat her  vegetables, her struggle with her lessons, the jokes, the joys, the challenge  to come up with some kind of presents for each other on birthdays -- such as  sugar saved from Anne's porridge used to make sweets for the others -- and the  moment when she first felt herself falling in love with Peter, the teen-age son  of the other couple hiding with her parents.  </P> <P> The timing of the production could not be more apt. In a city where  anti-Semitic actions have been rampant this year -- from the bombings of the  San Diego Jewish Times (the most recent occurred last week) to the painting of  swastikas on a synagogue, the House of Israel in Balboa Park and private homes  -- one has to applaud a small Christian theater troupe such as Lamb's, which  has dared to tackle a story that reveals the blood on the hands of those who  sport such symbols of hate.  </P> <P> The direction of Robert Smyth, artistic director of Lamb's, is exemplary. He  never once dips into the temptation to sentimentalize or soften the portraits.  And the actors, excellent all, reward him with fully fleshed-out performances  that seem all the more touching for not disguising the warts.  </P> <P> One cannot overpraise 16-year-old Julie Arnall in the pivotal role of Anne.  Spirited, forceful, sweet and sour, alternately brimming with confidence and  anxious with confusion, she is proof that the smart-talking 13-year-old is not  a recent sociological phenomenon.  </P> <P> Lee Weldon is a shy, sensitive revelation as Peter, the object of her  affections. To watch Anne coax him out of his shell suggests the gentle wonder  of seeing a butterfly emerge from a cocoon.  </P> <P> Anne's parents are played by Carmen Beaubeaux and David Cochran Heath with  quiet dignity. The pain on Beaubeaux's face as Anne rejects her in favor of her  father is palpable.  </P> <P> Peter's parents, the Van Daans, are played by Deborah Gilmour Smyth and James  Pascarella as a couple fractured by the tension that makes them jump at each  other's throats. The way she clings to her fur coat, her last symbol of  departed elegance, and he to his cigarettes, so dearly bought on the black  market, suggests the pathos of the pressure that brings two decent, but hardly  heroic, people to the breaking point.  </P> <P> Chris Redo brings tight control to Mr. Dussel, the dentist whom the crowded  family finds room for in their cramped space. Erica Kuhn lends quiet sweetness  to Anne's older sister, Margot; though an air of more knowing would enhance the  tiny role. Veronica Murphy Smith winningly mixes courage with modesty as Miep,  Otto Frank's stenographer, who helped hide the troupe and nourish it,  physically and spiritually, with food and news from the outside.  </P> <P> Mike Buckley's set design, a central, crowded kitchen, bordered by beds, along  with the theater's in-the-round space, accentuates the sense of being  surrounded by hostile forces. Mark Coterill's classical and dignified sound  design adds to the depth of the mood, as does the director's simple and  effective lighting.  </P> <P> The one critical absence in the production is the failure to find a way to tell  audiences what happened to those in hiding after they were caught. The story  may have been famous when it was published in 1952, but a new generation has  come around since then, and the memories of even those who recall the work may  not be as sharp as they should be. Audience members filing out on opening night  wondered aloud about the families' fate.  </P> <P> It would seem easy enough to allow each actor to give the name of his character  and tell how and where he died, a story by itself: Mr. Van Daan, gassed Sept.  6, 1944, Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp; Mr. Dussel, died Dec. 20, 1944,  Neuengamme concentration camp; Mrs. Frank, died Jan. 6, 1945,  Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp; Anne and Margot Frank, died between  February and March, 1945, Bergen-Belsen concentration camp; Mrs. Van Daan, died  between April 9 and May 8, 1945, while being transferred from Germany to  Czechoslovakia; Peter Van Daan, died May 5, 1945, in Mauthausen concentration  camp, three days before that camp's liberation.  </P> <P> Otto Frank, the only one to survive, died Aug. 19, 1980, after publishing the  diary and commissioning the play from Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, thus  fulfilling his dead daughter's dream of someday becoming a famous writer. How  tragic that the price of achieving the dream was to be so great.  </P> <P>  Performances at 8 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday with Saturday matinees at 2 and one  Sunday matinee on Sept. 17. Closes Sept. 17. Tickets $13-16. At 500 Plaza  Blvd., National City. (619)474-4542.  </P> <P> </P></p>

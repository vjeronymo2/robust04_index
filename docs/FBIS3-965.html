Though it did not  approve a new sanctions package against the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], the UN Security  Council meeting, which wound up after midnight, could yet  approve such sanctions at a meeting to be held two weeks from  now, should UNITA insist on war.    In the resolution it approved, the UN Security Council urged  an end to hostilities and condemned all behavior that hinders  humanitarian work in Angola. [passage omitted]    Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, Angolan ambassador to the United  Nations, has expressed satisfaction about the fact that the UN  Security Council has told UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to present a report on the evolution of the Lusaka  peace talks over the next two weeks, after which UNITA could be  severely punished, should it continue to resort to warmongering  behavior.    [Begin Mbinda recording] We are very happy to know that the  resolution adopted by the UN Security Council gives a two-week  deadline for the UN secretary general to present a report on the  evolution of the Lusaka peace talks. We are also very happy to  learn that, should UNITA continue to hamper the implementation  of the peace process, the UN Security Council will again analyze  the problem and impose whatever sanctions it deems necessary.  [end recording]    Speaking to the press only minutes after the UN Security  Council meeting, Ambassador Afonso van Dunem Mbinda said the  Lusaka peace talks are deadlocked all because UNITA is unwilling  to budge.    [Begin Mbinda recording] We can say that the Lusaka peace  talks have come to a halt. The Angolan Government has just  advanced a proposal, it has just made an offer, in which it  proposes that UNITA be given several ministerial posts in the  central government, the provinces, and other areas where UNITA  can participate in terms of the peace process. The government  did so as a gesture to encourage national reconciliation. UNITA  has not accepted that gesture by the government. UNITA demands,  needs, or requires more ministerial portfolios. It has demanded  far more than what it deserves. Our government has already  noted that it will not make any more such concessions. So, this  was an offer the government made UNITA and now the government is  unwilling to negotiate that offer. If we negotiate an offer, we  will be [words indistinct] of the electoral process which makes  it clear that it is up to one of the so-called sides, the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, MPLA, to form the  government and govern. [end recording]    The Angolan ambassador to the United Nations also voiced the  opinion that the international community must exert pressure on  UNITA to end the war and make greater efforts to reduce the  Angolan people's suffering.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and </F> economic cooperation, by correspondent Qiu Xichun (6726 1585  3196) and staff reporter Li Zhengping (2621 3630 1627); place  and date not given: "Strong Momentum of Development, Heavy Tasks  in Reform"--first paragraph is JINGJI RIBAO introduction]    [Text] The magnificent objective of China's reforms in the  management system of foreign trade is to set up a new foreign  trade system in line with China's actual conditions and the  rules and customs common in international economic activities.  On 12 May the "Foreign Trade Law of the PRC" was adopted by the  NPC Standing Committee and will be put into effect on 1 July,  thus putting China's foreign trade management on a legal  footing. How is the current situation with China's foreign  trade and with the reforms in the foreign trade management  system? What are the prospects? All these issues have  attracted the greatest attention from China's economic circles.  Reporters from this newspaper interviewed Wu Yi, minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, asking her to express  her views on these issues.    [JINGJI RIBAO] Minister Wu, the first four months this year  saw a good foreign trade situation. According to relevant  statistics, foreign trade grew in an all-round way. In  particular export trade grew more rapidly, thus increasing  China's foreign exchange reserves. In 1993, China's foreign  trade volume accounted for 37 percent of its gross domestic  product. The people are very concerned about the development of  foreign trade, because it closely relates to their interests.  Will you please give a detailed account of the situation?    [Wu] In the first four months of this year, China's foreign  trade developed in a rapid, coordinated, and sound way. In my  view, there were four characteristics: One, import and export  trade grew in a comprehensive way. According to statistics  provided by Customs, the total foreign trade value was $57.84  billion, up 21.1 percent over the figure for the same period  last year. This growth rate is higher than the figures for the  same periods of previous years. The situations in various areas  indicated that apart from one or two provinces and autonomous  regions which registered a decrease in foreign trade volume,  most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions chalked  up increases in foreign trade volume. Two, export trade grew at  a greater pace. The export volume for the four months was  $28.04 billion, up 22 percent over the figure for the same  period last year. What merits special attention is that the  general export business [yi ban mao yi chu kou 0001 5301 6319  2496 0427 0656], which had achieved less satisfactory results  over the last few years, grew rapidly by 30.5 percent, bigger  than the growth rate of 22.1 percent achieved by processing  export. This is the first laudable trend seen in the last few  years and more. Three, there was a decrease in the growth rate  of the import volume, which was $29.79 billion, up 20.3 percent.  In terms of absolute value, the export volume has approached  the import volume. The current tendency suggests that we are  likely to strike a balance between imports and exports in the  future. Four, we earned more foreign exchange than we sold.  The national situation with foreign exchange is quite good. We  have a bigger foreign exchange reserve than we did at the  beginning of the year. Of course there are some difficulties  and problems with our foreign trade business. The fairly  spectacular problems are: A shortage of circulating funds, a  sharp rise in the purchase price of exports, and insufficient  potential for future development of export trade.    [JINGJI RIBAO] The situation with foreign trade has been  relatively good since the beginning of this year. Is this the  result of accelerated reform of the foreign trade management  system?    [Wu] I think so. Reform has promoted the development of  foreign trade. Since the beginning of this year, we have made a  very important step forward in the reform of the foreign trade  management system. In particular the reforms of the exchange  rate mechanism and of the export quota distribution system laid  a sound foundation for the long-term development of foreign  trade. It should be said that the situation of foreign trade in  the first four months this year showed the positive effect of  the reform of the foreign trade management system. This accords  with our expectations.    Under the new foreign trade system, exchange rates,  taxation,  and credit have become important economic means for regulating  foreign economic activities. Since the beginning of this year,  the exchange rate of the renminbi has been stable. This created  a favorable environment for foreign trade. I also believe that  the stable exchange rate gives expression to the sound  development in foreign trade, in export trade in particular,  seen since the beginning of the year. The current exchange rate  mechanism has already become a market mechanism. Basically  speaking, a stable exchange rate depends on the balanced and  sound development of national foreign trade.    [JINGJI RIBAO] The reform of the export quota distribution  system you mentioned is a main topic of conversation regarding  the reform of foreign trade this year. The experiment with open  bidding for quotas for 13 export commodities, including logs and  ginseng, carried out since April this year has had a great  impact on enterprises engaged in the export of these commodities  and has aroused popular concern. Would you please talk about  its significance?    [Wu] The plan to have bidding, auctions, and formula  allocation of import and export quotas is contained in the  "Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist  Market Economic Structure." This represents the orientation of  the reform of the quota management system. This year, we had  bidding for 13 selected export commodities with active quotas  [zhu dong pei e 0031 0520 6792 7345] on a trial basis. The  export value of these commodities accounted for about 7 percent  of that of all export commodities subject to quota control. The  bidding proved successful and it was conducted in accordance  with the principle of ensuring economic returns, fairness, and  openness. A significant phenomenon was that the enterprises to  which no or only a few quotas had been given before  enthusiastically welcomed the new measure, while the companies  which had enjoyed quotas before displayed apathy about the  reform because their privileges had been axed. In my opinion  such a reaction is normal. What matters is that those companies  which lost "privileges" must adapt themselves to the law of  competition under the market economy and reestablish their  superiority through competition on an equal footing. In the  future, on the basis of the experiment, we will have bidding for  more commodities with quotas.    [JINGJI RIBAO] At present large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises are encountering many difficulties. How to deepen  reform to enliven these enterprises has once again become a  major problem of public concern. Apart from foreign-funded  enterprises, a total of 7,000 enterprises have been granted the  right to engage in foreign trade. They are all state-owned  enterprises, among which quite a lot are large and medium-sized  enterprises. How do matters stand with these enterprises?    [Wu] Since the beginning of this year, foreign trade  enterprises nationwide have fared well. The reform policies put  into effect this year are beneficial to state foreign trade  companies, large and medium-sized companies in particular. By  applying the measure for making unified settlement of foreign  exchange accounts payable and doing away with the practice of  turning in a fixed amount of foreign exchange to the central  government with or without compensation, the central government  has lessened the burden of state foreign trade companies so that  they can enter fair competition. This will help these companies  develop into efficient companies.    The process of the reform in the foreign trade management  system over the last few years shows that we have always put the  reform of foreign trade companies in an important position.  From 1988 to 1990, by introducing the contracted managerial  responsibility system, foreign trade companies solved the  problem resulting from "eating from the same big pot," regaining  their vitality and increasing their strength. The 1991 reform  aimed at abolishing subsidies and making enterprises responsible  for their profits and losses enabled foreign trade companies to  develop into companies which make their own management decisions  and are responsible for their own profits and losses. The  reform this year is being carried out on the basis of previous  reforms, so it will give an extremely big stimulus to foreign  trade companies. As required by our principle for reform,  foreign trade companies should deepen reform in light of the  modern enterprise system. In this way, they will make greater  contributions to the development of foreign trade.    [JINGJI RIBAO] There was information that the new tax reform  had increased the burden on foreign-funded enterprises. What is  your comment on this?    [Wu] I believe the information is incorrect. We have  consistently seen to it that the foreign businessmen's  legitimate rights and interests are respected and protected. In  the latest round of reform of the foreign trade management  system we introduced the system of earning and selling foreign  exchange into state foreign trade enterprises while we only  introduced transitional measures into foreign-funded  enterprises, allowing them to keep foreign exchange accounts to  facilitate their operations, including foreign trade. As a  whole, the tax reform has not brought a greater burden to  foreign-funded enterprises. For one or two foreign-funded  enterprises which will have a greater tax burden, we have worked  out regulations for providing subsidies to ensure that foreign  businessmen enjoy the preferential policies laid down in China's  laws and cooperation agreements. The preferential policies  toward foreign investors remain unchanged. We will continue to  improve the environment for investment and create conditions to  grant foreign- funded enterprises "national treatment."    [JINGJI RIBAO] You, as minister of foreign trade and  economic cooperation, are responsible for promoting the  country's foreign trade and economic cooperation with foreign  countries. It is an arduous duty. At present what is your  greatest concern?    [Wu] My work covers an extensive area and I have many "major  problems" to solve. To be frank, I feel the pressure of my  work. My greatest concern, it should be said, is China's export  business. Can the momentum over the last four months continue?  While realizing the active effect brought about by reform, we  should have a sober understanding of the factors detrimental to  export. The two major problems are: A sharp increase in the  price of export commodities and a shortage of funds. Many  products exported early this year were purchased last year or  made from the raw materials purchased last year, when their  prices were low. But the prices of export commodities purchased  this year were much higher. Many foreign trade companies have  reported that their business is greatly affected. I believe my  ministry cannot solve these problems on its own.    To promote China's foreign trade, we must carry out a "grand  economic and trade" strategy based on foreign trade, under which  operations concerning commodities, funds, technology, service,  and labor service abroad will interpenetrate and develop in a  coordinated way, and which will involve departments responsible  for foreign trade, production, science and technology, and  financial affairs.    In the meantime, to meet the needs of economic development,  foreign trade enterprises should introduce intensive management,  carrying out the strategy of "increasing sales by improving the  quality of their products," focusing on optimizing the product  mix, promoting technological progress, and improving their  economic performance so that they change their main products  from textile and other light industrial goods, primary  processing products, and products with low added value to  machinery and electrical appliances, heavy industry products,  chemicals, high-tech products, intensive processing products,  and products with high added value by 2000. This is essential  to developing China's foreign trade.</p>

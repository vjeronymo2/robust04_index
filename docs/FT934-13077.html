			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Dawkins hails passing of federal budget MR John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, said yesterday the prospect of interest rate rises in Australia had been eliminated, now that the federal budget had passed through the Senate, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. An amended budget was formally approved on Thursday after two months of wrangling between the Opposition, the two minority parties who hold the balance of power in the Senate, and the government. The uncertainty surrounding the budget's progress had previously unnerved the Australian dollar, and led the Reserve Bank governor to warn that interest rates might have to rise in support. Mr Dawkins' remarks came as the treasury, in its latest quarterly bulletin, said the Australian economy was continuing to expand at a 'moderate pace.' However, the authorities acknowledged that business investment has yet to show any signs of picking up. The June quarter saw 'continued growth in private consumption, as well as strong contribution from the public sector,' the treasury said. More recently, continued strength in housing indicators has suggested the housing cycle may not have run its course, although the industry anticipates a downturn to start in 1993/94, it added. The treasury also noted the current account on the balance of payments had improved marginally in the last three months, and that price and wage pressures remained low. But it conceded that business investment remained lacklustre, despite the strong upturn in corporate profitability and low level of interest rates.</p>

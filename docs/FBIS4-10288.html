			<p>BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 9 Apr (EFE) --  Today the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN)  demanded the release of 21 civilians imprisoned since January,  charged with being Zapatistas.    "We have learned that the 21 civilians are confined at the  Cerro Hueco prison, unfairly charged with being members of our  army; furthermore the EZLN leadership hereby declares that none  of its members are currently in any of the country's prisons,"  the rebel Subcommander Marcos stated. In a communique signed by  the subcommander published today by some morning newspapers in  the State of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, the EZLN insists that  it has verified its list of fighters and the names of the  persons currently in prison do not appear on the list.    The 21 civilians were taken prisoner on 2 January, during  the  armed clashes between the Army and the rebels. In addition,  they were all charged with being EZLN members, accusations which  they have all repeatedly denied. Since last week, the civilians  detained at the Cerro Hueco prison near Tuxtla Gutierrez began a  hunger strike demanding that the charges be withdrawn and they  be released.    The civilians are also demanding an investigation and that  penalties be imposed on a group of soldiers who, according to  the prisoners, proceeded to beat them, tied their hands and  feet, and held them isolated and without food for several days  before throwing them in jail.    According to Marcos "to continue holding these innocent  persons in jail is an obstacle to continuing the peace process  and dialogue with the federal government." Finally, Marcos  indicated that the EZLN believes that with these detentions  "there is a clear intention to cover up arbitrary actions in the  indiscriminate arrest of civilians during the conflict and  accusing them, without any basis whatsoever, of being members of  our army."</p>

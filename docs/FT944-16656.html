			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: A Beckman lower A Beckman, the property and textiles group, announced pre-tax profits nearly halved from Pounds 790,000 to Pounds 403,000 in the year to June 30. Mr Melvin Lawson, chairman, said textiles margins had been squeezed while rental income had fallen mainly because of vacant space. Although that had now largely been relet it was at lower rents and as a consequence the associated company suffered a loss, of which the group's share was Pounds 128,000. The properties have been revalued downwards and there would be ongoing losses for the foreseeable future, Mr Lawson said. Turnover amounted to Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 14.5m) with property contributing slightly less at Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.55m). Earnings per share fell to 2p (4.7p) but the dividend is held at 3.58p with a proposed unchanged final of 2.38p.</p>

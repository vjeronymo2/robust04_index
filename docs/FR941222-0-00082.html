			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested that the proposed definition of ``solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste disposal site'' is so broad that it would encompass lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the Exxon Valdez spilled oil. The Service agrees, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inserts language in the final definition of ``solid waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site'' to make clear that 36 CFR part 6 does not govern discharges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of materials, or substances into the environment that are covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by such laws as the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(3)) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). It was never the intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NPS to regulate such discharges or deposits as if they were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``solid waste disposal sites.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested that this rule also govern ``transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations,'' since they are places where solid waste is deposited,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> albeit temporarily. Because such stations may be places of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant degradation to park resources resulting from noise,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litter, visual intrusion, runoff and traffic, the Service has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to include transfer stations in the definition of a ``solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste disposal site.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.4&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites Not in Operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on September 1, 1984  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note that the EPA's definition of ``hazardous waste'' at 40 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 261 excludes wastes generated by households (including single and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple family residences, hotels and motels). In light of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, the Service reiterates that such waste is not ``legally''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous. This ``household waste exclusion'' is mentioned here again because it is important to point out that the prohibition at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;6.4(a)(6)(i) and at &sect;6.5(c)(3)(i) does not prevent the NPS from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepting for disposal at NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid wastes such as used oil, grease, paints, solvents, cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents, or pesticides that are generated by ``households.'' Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials are not ``legally'' hazardous waste when discarded by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households (including hotels, motels, restaurants, single or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple family residences).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, as long as such waste is generated by National Park Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, such as garbage collection from park/concessionaire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, they may be disposed of in an NPS-operated solid waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.5&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites in Operation on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1984  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments from the NPS Alaska Region, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out that both the proposed and the final rule recognize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that some communities may lie wholly within the boundaries of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit of the National Park System in Alaska. Such communities may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust the capacity of their existing solid waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site. Such communities may request that the Regional Director  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit them to expand an existing site within the unit. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional Director must normally judge such a request under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions in &sect;6.4. However, the Regional Director will instead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judge a request for expansion of an existing site under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval conditions of &sect;6.5(c), if the operator shows that the solid waste is generated solely from within the boundaries of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit, the operator owns or leases the lands proposed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion, and the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate water access to any lands outside of the unit for all, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial, portions of the year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.6&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites Within New Additions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the National Park System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment indicates that this section applies to units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the National Park System created in Alaska in 1980. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulation plainly states it, the Service repeats that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section applies only to lands and waters that fall within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries of a unit of the National Park System as a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unit establishment or expansion after the effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations as final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.7&blank;Mining Wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asked how this part applies to operations on mining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims. This section is intended to clarify the relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the final regulations governing solid waste disposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> govern mineral operations. Without this section, this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation would govern solid waste disposal sites by all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral operators. The NPS now regulates solid waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by many mineral operators and does not intend to create a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duplicate regulatory scheme for such operators. Thus, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section excludes from the permit and financial assurance provisions of the final regulations solid waste disposal sites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by operators that are, now or prospectively, governed by NPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.8&blank;National Park Service Solid Waste Responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asked if the NPS would establish a household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``harmful'' waste collection program for its inholders. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> answer is ``No.'' Inholders may not dispose of their waste in NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. Nor is the NPS in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business of collecting waste from inholders. Moreover, the NPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will establish collection programs for household waste that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> though not legally hazardous, may be harmful, ONLY in those units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same comment then seemed to suggest that since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at 36 CFR 6.8(b) mandate the establishment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection programs for ``household hazardous wastes'' ONLY for parks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that operate solid waste disposal sites, then only such parks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need have hazardous waste collection programs. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrect. Every park that generates waste that is defined by 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 261 as hazardous, must collect, store, handle and manage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that waste under the regulations governing such waste prescribed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Subtitle D of RCRA. To eliminate confusion, the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;6.8(b) no longer refers to ``household hazardous waste'' which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legally is not ``hazardous'' but to ``harmful wastes generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by residential activities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

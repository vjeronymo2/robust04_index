			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Ministers put spending target under threat SPENDING departments in Whitehall have ignored a firm Treasury instruction not to seek increased resources for next year and instead submitted bids for extra funds totalling several billion pounds. The threat to the Treasury's public spending targets emerged as the Prime Minister's Office sought yesterday to calm the political row which erupted this week over radical proposals to shrink the welfare state. With Mr John Major anxious to direct attention to the latest batch of favourable economic indicators, his aides said that options thrown up by the Treasury's long-term spending review were unlikely to result in immediate decisions. But the decision by virtually all the main departments - the exception is defence - to fight for additional resources in this summer's spending negotiations underlined the severity of the looming cabinet clash over Whitehall budgets. There were renewed indications that some departments are determined to press for the extension into 1994 of a published current public sector pay limit. The Treasury opposes maintaining the present 1.5 per cent pay ceiling, arguing for informal restraint. But several cabinet ministers - including those on the party's right wing - believe it will be impossible to hold the line on public sector wages without the formal ceiling. The expected clashes have prompted Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to bring forward to mid-June the traditional cabinet discussion on spending priorities. Mr Portillo will have time to hold an intense round of discussions with his spending colleagues before the August holidays. Yesterday, shadow chancellor Gordon Brown said he planned to raise the whole question of public spending and public service cuts - including the possible introduction of charges for National Health Service beds - when he addresses the Welsh Labour party conference in Llandudno today. Mr Portillo insisted this week that the government was determined to stick to the cash ceilings for Whitehall spending set last autumn for the financial years 1994/95 and 1995/96. The ceilings for the two years - Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn respectively - were agreed by the cabinet last autumn and re-affirmed in Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget. They imply small cuts in overall expenditure once inflation has been taken into account. In an attempt to hold the line earlier this year, Mr Portilloasked colleagues to abandon the traditional practice of bidding for extra cash and to provide the Treasury with options for cuts of between 2.5 and 5 per cent. But ministers said the home office and social security, health, education, environment, and transport departments - which account for more than three-quarters of all spending - have rejected any budget reductions. Instead they have submitted additional bids which one senior Whitehall official said ran into 'many billions'. The Treasury has set aside a Pounds 7bn contingency reserve for unforeseen expenditure in 1994/95 but only half can be allocated during the summer. A substantial proportion of the remainder has already been earmarked to cover the knock-on effect of additional expenditure agreed for the present financial year.

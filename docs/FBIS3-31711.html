			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Zagreb, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A French unit of the UN  Protection Force [UNPROFOR] is to be deployed Wednesday around a  bridge on the border between Croatia and Bosnia blocked by about  100 secessionist Serbs for almost a week, UNPROFOR said here.  Two contingents of UN troops, comprising Jordanians and  Argentines, were placed on alert Tuesday because of mounting  tension at the site.    About 100 Serb police and soldiers have held the bridge over  the River Sava since they overpowered a UN control post manned  by Nepalese troops on Friday. The bridge links the Croatian  town of Stara Gradiska and the Bosnian town of Bosanska Gradiska.    The UN secretary general's special envoy in ex-Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi viewed the Serbs' seizure of the bridge as  "unacceptable" and was exploring "various ways" to end the  stand-off, UNPROFOR said in a statement. [passage omitted]    UNPROFOR meanwhile reported "repeated attempts" Tuesday to  shell the strategic Maslenica Bridge in southern Croatia,  without saying which side was responsible. It said this  constituted "one of the most serious violations" of the  ceasefire concluded in mid-December by the Croatian Army and  secessionist Serbs.    Croatian media Wednesday accused secessionists from Krajina  of having bombed the Meslenica area Tuesday, wounding two people.    The Maslenica bridge, which the Croatian Army recaptured  from  Serb secessionists during an offensive in January 1993, is vital  to Croatia because it links the ex-Yugoslav republic's northern  and southern parts.</p>

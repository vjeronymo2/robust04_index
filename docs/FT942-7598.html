			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Finance companies step up IT spending A majority of financial services companies will increase spending on information technology this year for the first time since 1989, in spite of numerous project failures, a survey by the consultancy Price Waterhouse has found, Alan Cane writes. The survey of 82 organisations with annual IT budgets ranging from less than Pounds 5m to more than Pounds 10m found that 57 per cent expected to increase their rate of IT spending. Last year only 30 per cent predicted a rise in spending. The survey also revealed a high rate of project failure, with a quarter of respondents admitting that most projects had been delivered late or over budget. IT project failures have increased as companies have used technologies to attempt to seize competitive advantage, often without a clear understanding of what is involved.

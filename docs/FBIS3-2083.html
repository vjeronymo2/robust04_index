That is part of a package of plans announced by Lu Yucheng,  vice- mayor of Beijing, in a recent meeting here. The plans are  expected to help the capital reach the goal of a  relatively-comfortable life three years earlier than the  nation's schedule.    So far, more than 60 well-known trans-national firms have  come to Beijing to invest, according to the latest statistics.    The investment fields that the municipal government tries to  attract foreign investment in cover infrastructural  construction, renovation of outdate houses, high-tech and  new-tech sectors, economic and technological development zones,  the service industry and modern commercial buildings.    In addition, the government attempts to lure foreign  investment into such fields as high-efficiency farming, tourism  and financial sectors.    Lu said Beijing also plans to expand its foreign trade by  over two billion U.S. dollars this year through building more  export- oriented firms and factories. Last year's total exports  topped 1.68 billion U.S. dollars. The shareholding system will  be promoted in more trade companies.    Officials said they hope to set up a total of 4,000 foreign-  funded enterprises involving 1.25 billion U.S. dollars by the  end of this year, up 39 percent over last year.    To achieve that goal, the vice-mayor said that more than  10,000 high-level specialized experts involving international  finance, international trade and modern management will be  trained.</p>

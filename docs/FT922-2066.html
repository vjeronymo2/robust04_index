			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost Chemring to Pounds 2.65m BOTH ORGANIC growth and 'the successful integration of the acquisitions made in 1991' helped Chemring Group lift pre-tax profits almost 10 per cent from Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 2.65m in the half-year to March 27. Mr Philip Billington, who became chairman on January 1, said he was aiming to increase Chemring's non-defence side to 60 per cent, though he stressed that the defence side made 'defensive, rather than offensive products', such as radar countermeasures and flares. Group turnover rose almost 20 per cent to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 15.4m), with acquisitions accounting for Pounds 2m of the rise. In May 1991 the company bought Octavius Hunt - which makes smoke pesticides, sparklers and specialist matches - for Pounds 1.54m in cash, shares and loan notes. In July it paid FFr6.5m for 49 per cent of Traco, the French electrical transformer manufacturer, to combine with Securelec of which it also owns 49 per cent. In August it added Horace Sleep to its Vacuum Reflex specialist clothing company and in September the marine division of Kilgore was absorbed into the pyrotechnic operations of Pains-Wessex. The group has 70 per cent of the global market for marine pyrotechnics. Chemring would go to the market for larger acquisitions, said Mr Billington, but had Pounds 3.1m cash at the period-end for smaller buys. He was looking for companies 'with markets and manufacturing processes we understand'. Earnings emerged at 35.54p (31.39p) and the interim dividend is lifted 10.9p (9.9p).</p>

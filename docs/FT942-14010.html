			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Trade News: Water boost to green exports - Co-operation by US and Mexico The US Export-Import Bank and Mexico's national development bank have announced a programme to finance up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 336m) for waste water treatment in Mexico over the next five years. The agreement is one of a series announced this week as part of the Clinton administration's mobilisation of government resources to expand trade in environmental technology. The Eximbank, which had its annual conference yesterday, is pushing environmental trade fervently. With Banobras, Mexico's development bank, it has produced a plan to fund cleansing of rivers, lakes and streams, using a combination of users' fees, commercial loans and government guarantees. Under this arrangement, cities will select private companies to build, operate and maintain waste water treatment facilities, which would eventually be transferred to the city. Users' fees will pay for the water treatment services. Banobras will guarantee repayment to commercial lenders in case of user fees being inadequate. Eximbank also announced a plan to have the 45,000 companies in the US environmental industry expand exports. Its aim is to support Dollars 800m in fiscal year 1994, a doubling of the total last year. It offers the following inducements: financing for 15 per cent of costs incurred locally in addition to the financing of US equipment and services; deferment on construction loans until project is completed; the longest repayment terms allowed by multilateral rules. An environmental insurance package in the US will provide 95 per cent commercial coverage and 100 per cent political coverage. Environmental exporters will be exempt from the ordinary requirement that they pay a share of the first loss claimed under the policy.</p>

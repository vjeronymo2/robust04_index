			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINOS TRY TO SETTLE ON CONSENSUS CANDIDATE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: COMMUNITY LEADERS HOPE TO AVOID DIVISIVE AND EXPENSIVE CONFRONTATION  IN THE 1ST DISTRICT. SOME DOUBT POLITICAL AMBITIONS CAN BE SET ASIDE.  </P> <P> Though a federal appeals court has stayed creation of a new Latino-majority  supervisorial district in Los Angeles County, community leaders remain locked  in talks to determine a unity candidate who could become the first Latino on  the powerful Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The political stakes are so high and the seat so important to the Eastside  community that at least four prominent Democratic elected officials and one  Republican activist are busily campaigning behind the scenes to be the Latino  candidate for the newly created 1st District.  </P> <P> The unity that Latino community leaders, especially Democrats, had hoped for  two weeks ago when a lower federal court drew new district lines and set a  special election is apparently slipping away.  </P> <P> Four Democrats are actively competing: Los Angeles City Council members Richard  Alatorre, 44, and Gloria Molina, 41, and U.S. Reps. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los  Angeles), 77, and Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), 60. Also seeking support in  the Latino community is Republican and former supervisorial aide Sarah Flores,  52.  </P> <P> A showdown among any of these Latino politicians is exactly the kind of  divisive and expensive confrontation that community leaders had talked of when  the lower court redrew all the districts to consolidate the Latino community.  Latinos now comprise 51% of the voters and 71% of the population in the new 1st  District.  </P> <P> "I hope that once the dust settles, there is a meeting of the community  leadership . . . and there is a consensus candidate," said Antonia Hernandez,  president and general counsel of Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational  Fund.  </P> <P> But Vivien Bonzo of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. said, "It's an awfully  important seat, and every Latino politician has the right to go for it. . . .  That's old- fashioned American competition."  </P> <P> Though Flores is the only announced candidate in the race, Bonzo cautioned,  "Don't count any of them out."  </P> <P> The uncertainty created by so many candidates was multiplied Thursday by the  stay issued by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the landmark voting  rights case.  </P> <P> The county has appealed the ruling of U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who  found that the Board of Supervisors intentionally discriminated against  Latinos, diluting their voting power by splitting the community among three  supervisorial districts. Kenyon on Aug. 4 threw out the results of the June  election in the 1st District, redrew the districts and ordered a new election  for Nov. 6.  </P> <P> The appeals court will decide this week whether to extend its stay beyond  Saturday, and a three-judge panel will rule on the case after hearing oral  arguments in October.  </P> <P> Community activists remained confident that the appeals court will uphold  Kenyon and that there will be a Latino on the board this year.  </P> <P> Joe Sanchez, president of the Mexican American Grocers Assn., says a unity  candidate is unlikely. "It doesn't happen in other communities, and I don't  think it's going to happen here," said Sanchez. "If the political bug has bit  them, there's no turning back."  </P> <P> Interviews with candidates and community leaders indicate that there will  likely be at least two and as many as four candidates -- should the appeals  court uphold the new election.  </P> <P> Though numerous factors such as campaign fund-raising ability are key factors,  the lineup could be determined largely by Roybal -- the political patriarch of  the Eastside community.  </P> <P> If Roybal decides to run, he would be seeking the same office that supporters  say was stolen from him in a controversial 1958 election. A mysterious 12,000  votes were found in a recount several days after balloting in that  supervisorial race, turning Roybal's slim victory into a defeat.  </P> <P> Roybal went on to become one of the nation's first Latino congressmen, but the  county election has been an open wound for him and the community ever since.  </P> <P> The episode played an important role in Kenyon's finding that there has been a  pattern of intentional discrimination against Latinos by the county board.  </P> <P> Running against Roybal "would be like running against Mother Teresa," lamented  one Alatorre loyalist.  </P> <P> "I would think most people would have too much respect for Roybal" to oppose  him, said Bonzo. "But ambition runs high and confidence runs high. And that may  overcome their deference. . . . Especially if they have (campaign) money in the  bank."  </P> <P> Roybal, in an interview, stressed the need for a consensus candidate.  </P> <P> "I would not be interested in running unless that took place . . . and I'm  interested only if no one else can do it," said Roybal. "This has to be done  using intelligence instead of ambition."  </P> <P> Roybal said a united front must be presented to defeat Republican Flores or her  former boss, conservative Supervisor Pete Schabarum -- who said last week that  running in the 1st District is a "serious option."  </P> <P> Flores came in first in the June primary and was scheduled to face Superior  Court Judge Gregory O'Brien in a November runoff. O'Brien has said that he does  not intend to run in the new district.  </P> <P> Despite the unity talk, Alatorre said, "I expect to be a candidate" regardless  of who else is running. "The likelihood of having just one candidate is not  great," he said.  </P> <P> Flores said she has a great deal of respect for Roybal, but will run regardless  of his plans. "He came close once before, and he'll come close again -- because  I'm going to win," said Flores.  </P> <P> Molina said she would not oppose Roybal. "He is the one person I would step  aside for," said Molina. "He has the capability of uniting all Latinos" in the  district, she said.  </P> <P> But if Roybal does not run, Molina said she expects to be a candidate. Until a  decision is reached, Molina said, "I'm operating as though there will be an  election and that I am one of the candidates."  </P> <P> Despite all the posturing, most candidates are hopeful that a consensus can be  reached and more meetings are scheduled for this week.  </P> <P> "We need to avoid a blood bath," Torres said in an interview last week.  </P> <P> While each candidate professes a need to agree on a consensus candidate, they  all want to be that candidate.  </P> <P> Torres, for instance, is keeping his options open. The four-term congressman,  who is already on the ballot for reelection to Congress, last week sought and  received an opinion from the California secretary of state that would allow him  to also run for supervisor. The California Constitution normally prohibits  running for more than one office in any election.  </P> <P> The ruling would also pave the way for Roybal, who is running for his 15th term  in the House of Representatives.  </P> <P> Hernandez said that if a consensus candidate cannot be agreed on, she hopes the  leadership can arrive "at least at some general understanding of how the  campaign should be conducted."  </P> <P> The judge's decision has spawned "a lot of optimism, a feeling of hope in the  community," Hernandez said. "It's had a phenomenal impact. I want to carry that  forward" with a positive campaign for the supervisorial seat -- and in the race  to fill any position vacated by the eventual winner.  </P></p>

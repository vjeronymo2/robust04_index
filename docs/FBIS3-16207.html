			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- The Federation Council  (upper house of the Russian parliament) put the item on the  prosecutor-general on the agenda of its fourth session which  opened on Tuesday.    Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the council committee on  constitutional legislation, explained at the discussion of this  proposal that the chamber is to receive representations from the  Russian president on the resignation of the former  prosecutor-general and the appointment of the new one in order  to debate this issue.    "We cannot examine this issue without such representations,"  he noted. The chairman called legislators' attention to the  fact that the Federation Council regulations contain no article  on how such issues should be examined.    The agenda of today's session contains such an item on the  procedure of debating by the chamber issues relegated by the  constitution to its competence. Deputies decided that the item  should be examined to be ready to discuss the president's  representations.    There were also proposals to consider the situation with  Aleksey Kazannik's resignation, since the new constitution  envisages that the prosecutor-general's appointments and  resignations are to be approved by the Federation Council. As a  result, this item on the agenda reads as follows: "On  prosecutor-general".    Lawmakers also decided to hear a report by the Russian  premier on non-payments and the government's programme on how to  do away with them. The crisis of non-payments was discussed at  parliamentary hearings on Monday where legislators recognised  them as a very serious problem affecting the entire financial  and budgetary system of the country.    Parliamentarians also decided to hear information from the  Russian Foreign Ministry (in the section "Miscellaneous") on  treaties which were concluded but not ratified. The proposal  was prompted by a question of whether the Russian-Georgian  treaty which has not been ratified by the lower chamber for the  time being, operates or not.    Legislators continue discussing the agenda.</p>

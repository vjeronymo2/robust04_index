			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Ginsburg confirmed in top court post JUDGE Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by the US Senate yesterday as the country's second woman Supreme Court justice, Reuter report from Washington. The 60-year-old federal appeals judge from Washington was nominated on June 14 by President Bill Clinton. She replaces Justice Byron White, who retired at the end of June, on the nine-member court. Judge Ginsburg should be sworn in within a few days so she can prepare for the start of the court's next term on October 4. Mr Joseph Biden, Senate judiciary committee chairman, called Judge Ginsburg a consensus candidate who would be cautious and restrained in her decisions. She joins Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, chosen by President Ronald Reagan and confirmed in 1981, as the only two women among the court's 107 current and former justices. She is expected to be a moderate on the court, helping other justices reach a consensus. The vote for confirmation was 96-3. The only senators voting against her nomination were Republicans Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Bob Smith of New Hampshire. Mr Helms opposed Judge Ginsburg because of her support for abortion rights and increased rights for gays.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / MPs call for Maxwells to face Commons MR KEVIN MAXWELL and Mr Ian Maxwell should be brought before the House of Commons to account for their refusal to answer MPs' questions about their father's theft of more than Pounds 400m from his companies' pension funds, a cross-party Commons committee said last night. The social security committee said that Mr Michael Stoney, treasurer of the Mirror Group pension fund, had also refused to answer the questionnaire sent by the committee to trustees of the Maxwell pension funds. Since Mr Robert Maxwell's death in November it has emerged that he stole hundreds of millions of pounds from the funds. An inquiry that ignored the Maxwell brothers would have been like ignoring the Prince in Hamlet, the committee said in a supplement to its recommendations on pension reform published on Monday. 'The refusal of the Maxwell brothers to give evidence has been most harmful to the committee's activities.' The MPs had asked the trustees about the ultimate ownership of the pension funds - obscured by secretive offshore trusts - and about day-to-day control of the funds. They had also wanted to question the Maxwell brothers about 'the role of those US investment banks which were involved in the alleged illegal operation to support Maxwell Communication Corporation shares by routeing share purchases through offshore trusts'. In a letter to the com-mittee on February 20, Mr Stoney's solicitors argued he had a common law right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination. This is the argument used by the brothers' solicitors. Mr Frank Field MP, the committee's chairman, said that the committee formed after the general election should pursue the issue of the brothers' 'prima facie contempt of the House of Commons'. The committee had noted the comments of Mr Kevin Maxwell's lawyer that criminal charges were likely soon, and it had 'no intention of fouling up a fair trial'. The Conduct of Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell, Social Security Committee. House of Commons.</p>

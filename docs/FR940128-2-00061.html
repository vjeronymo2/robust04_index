			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program is a joint Navy/Department of Energy (DOE) organization responsible for all matters pertaining to Naval nuclear propulsion. The Program is responsible for the nuclear propulsion plants aboard more than 120 warships powered by over 140 Naval reactors; two moored training ships used for Naval nuclear propulsion plant operator training; nuclear work performed at eight shipyards; two DOE government-owned laboratories devoted solely to Naval nuclear propulsion research, development, and design; and eight land-based prototype Naval reactors used for research and development work and training of Naval nuclear propulsion plant operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning in 1957, spent fuel removed from nuclear powered ships and prototypes has been sent to the Expended Core Facility for examination to evaluate its performance and confirm design and operational predictions. The Expended Core Facility is part of the Naval Reactors Facility which is located within the DOE Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Government has been involved in litigation with the State of Idaho regarding spent nuclear fuel issues at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho. The Navy became involved in this lawsuit when Idaho requested an injunction in 1992 against shipments of all spent fuel, including Naval fuel, until DOE completed an Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act evaluating activities involving all spent nuclear fuel at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 28, 1993, the Federal District Court in Idaho granted the State of Idaho's request for an injunction and directed DOE to evaluate ``The direct and indirect environmental effects of all major federal actions involving the transportation, receipt, processing, and storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.'' Furthermore, the Court Order directed DOE to consider the alternative of ``transporting, receiving, processing, and storing spent nuclear fuel at sites other than the [Idaho] National Engineering Laboratory.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE is separately preparing an Environmental Impact Statement on spent nuclear fuel management throughout the DOE, which includes Naval spent fuel. The Navy is a cooperating agency in this effort. The DOE Environmental Impact Statement will evaluate alternatives for managing Naval spent fuel from 1995 through 2035, and will consider Naval Shipyards and other sites for this purpose. A previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement provides further information (Vol. 58, No. 170, page 46951). The DOE Environmental Impact Statement is scheduled to be published in April 1995 with a Record of Decision by June 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preferred Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If no action were taken, loaded Naval spent fuel shipping containers would accumulate at five shipyards: Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine; Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia; Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia; Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington; and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Naval spent fuel also would remain in the Surface Ship Support Barge at Newport News Shipbuilding. The No Action alternative, which is the preferred alternative, would allow all shipyard work, including refueling and defueling of nuclear powered ships, to continue unimpeded by the short-term accumulation of Naval spent fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consolidation Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Consolidation alternative, Naval spent nuclear fuel in shipping containers would be consolidated at Norfolk Naval Shipyard on the east coast and at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for the Pacific Ocean shipyards. The Surface Ship Support Barge would remain in use at Newport News Shipbuilding. All other shipyard work, including refueling and defueling of nuclear powered ships, would continue unimpeded under the Consolidation alternative. However, this alternative offers no operational advantages to the Navy compared to the No Action alternative, and it would entail otherwise unnecessary shipping of naval spent fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Moored Ship Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Moored Ship alternative, nuclear powered ship inactivations would be deferred. The nuclear propulsion plants would be taken to a cold shutdown condition and physically modified to prevent reactor operation, such as by eliminating the capability to withdraw control rods. Only the ship systems necessary to support eventual defueling would be maintained. The ship would be tied up at a pier within the controlled industrial area of the shipyard where it was scheduled to be defueled. Reduced crews would provide surveillance and necessary maintenance of the ships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Moored Ship alternative has operational disadvantages compared to the No Action and Consolidation alternatives. It would disrupt shipyard work schedules, idle skilled shipyard defueling and inactivation workers, and utilize highly trained Navy nuclear ship operators in the unproductive task of watching over shut down ships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

On return home from his trip to Washington and Ottawa,  Minister Han said delay in visa issuance seems to be part of  Pyongyang's effort to obtain clearer steps regarding their  agreement with the United States over the nuclear issue. Han  said in an airport press conference that if North Korea refuses  to issue visa to IAEA inspectors to the end, there would be due  actions from IAEA and the United Nations.    Minister Han said the upcoming IAEA inspection would  definitely include taking sample materials, but there would be  no exchange of fuel bars. "If and when any fuel bars are  exchanged in North Korean nuclear facilities in the days to  come, IAEA should always take part," he said. Even if North  Korea were found to already possess nuclear materials, what is  more important is to obtain Pyongyang's nuclear transparency and  keep them from using such materials in producing nuclear weapons  than to take sanction, he said.    Han observed the third-round high-level U.S.-North Korea  talks could be held around the end of March at the earliest  because he said it would take about four weeks to analyze the  outcome of the planned IAEA look into North Korean facilities.    The foreign minister was optimistic about North Korea's  return to the stalled inter-Korean dialogue. "Since the  resumption of dialogue is linked to the third-round  Washington-Pyongyang talks and the suspension of the Team Spirit  exercise, I believe North Korea would agree to resumed  dialogue," he said.    Regarding the controversial Patriots missile issue, he said  South Korea and the United States will discuss the matter upon  the end of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting opening on Feb.  21. "The discussion will cover detailed issues including the  question of whether to deploy the anti-missile missiles in  Korea," Minister Han said.</p>

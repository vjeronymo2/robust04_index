			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Babcock issue to fund Pounds 21m Swedish buy BABCOCK INTERNATIONAL, the UK engineering contractor, yesterday announced an expansion of its European operations with the acquisition of the materials handling division of Consilium, a privately-owned Swedish company. It is paying Pounds 21.4m for Consilium CMH, the world's biggest producer of enclosed continuous ship loading and unloading systems, and the Consilium Bulk group of companies, which make bulk handling systems for the wood processing, energy, cement, minerals and grain industries. The deal will turn Babcock into a significant force in the world bulk materials handling market, with sales of Pounds 150m and 1,100 employees in a planned new materials handling division. Babcock shares rose 2 1/2 p to 58p following the deal, which is to be funded by the issue of 42.8m shares. A further 23.5m shares, raising Pounds 9.5m, will be issued to fund the development of the new division and further strengthen the group's capital base. The 66.3m new shares will be offered first to Babcock shareholders on the basis of one new share for every 7.10713 held. Shares not taken up are being placed by NM Rothschild with clients of Panmure Gordon, but it is believed that the offer has already been heavily oversubscribed. Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive, said the creation of the materials handling division would give the company more influence in a big market with long-term growth potential - even if some customer sectors such as the pulp and paper industry were currently hit badly by the recession. The division will comprise the new companies, the Claudius Peters materials handling interests in Germany and the smaller Babcock Materials Handling in the UK. The companies will not be merged, but Babcock will seek to remove overlaps in sales and marketing and encourage the companies to help each other win more business. Mr Whitehead said Consilium's mechanically-based handling equipment complemented Claudius Peters' existing range of pneumatic ship-loaders and unloaders. Consequently, the combination would allow the new division to offer customers more complete systems. The businesses being acquired had combined turnover last year of Pounds 42.8m, down from Pounds 52.3m in 1990 and Pounds 59.5m in 1989. Pre-tax profits slumped to Pounds 632,000 in 1990 before recovering last year to Pounds 3.6m. Mr Whitehead said the exit multiple for the acquisitions was 9.5, based on a normal tax charge, and there would be no dilution in earnings. Over the next 12 months the deal would be broadly neutral for profits, but would lead to a 'definite enhancement' in the second year.</p>

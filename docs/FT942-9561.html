			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The French Connection): The trouble with the French . . . - France's top wine writer complains about his countrymen / As France prepares for its summer invasion of Britons, Weekend FT writers have been gathering news and views from its regions 'Wine is one of the great strengths of France. The name Margaux or Lafite is much better known around the world than, say, Balladur, but the French seem to take no pride in their wines. Britain has much better media coverage of the subject. 'The quality of a new vintage is a very important cultural and economic fact to France but, contrary to any other subject, reporters never ask an independent outsider about it. They ask the Ministry of Agriculture]' The exasperated 'independent outsider' delivering this diatribe is Michel Bettane, widely hailed as France's top, if under-utilised, wine writer. A jolly ovoid, vintage 1952, self-taught and passionately devoted to wine quality, he gave up teaching classics three years ago to devote himself to the French monthly magazine Revue du Vin de France (RVF) of which he is not editor but its trump card. Although France is the world's leading wine producer, RVF is France's only consumer publication devoted to wine. Britain has at least three (Decanter, WINE and The Vine) while Wine Spectator, The Wine Advocate, Wine Enthusiast, Appellation and the Quarterly Revue of Wine are just some of the US counterparts. The approaches and objectives of these three countries' wine writers could hardly be more different. For Bettane, it is as important to inform and guide France's vine growers as the wine consumers among RVF's 30,000 readers. His particular hobby horses are the need to limit yields, the evils of relying on a single clone of each vine variety, and the virtues of ecologically sensitive viticulture. Accordingly, he spends at least three months each year in vineyards and cellars counselling vignerons. His reference points for each vintage include Michel Delon, Alain Vauthier and Michel Rolland in Bordeaux and Lafon, Leflaive, Leroy and Accad in Burgundy. Famed for both his palate and his memory, he never takes a note in situ. 'It's just a matter of politesse: you're a guest; a grower gives you what he thinks is his best wine. How can people do it? What's more important is to listen to the wine and to the grower.' His policy is to criticise by omission rather than to publish a poor review. 'It is very important to say the truth to the growers, but not necessarily to the readers.' When asked how he retains his objectivity, he interprets the question as referring to his personal tasting technique rather than any suggestion of partiality. American wine writers, on the other hand, will do anything to maintain their distance from producers. The preferred research method of America's influential Robert Parker, for example, is to assemble and compare hundreds of sample bottles on neutral territory. Comments and points out of 100 based on his palate, rather than any contact with individual producers, are then printed in ruthless detail. While most American wine writers concentrate on nosing out the finest, rarest and often most expensive wines, the British approach is more democratic, but can be considerably less inspiring. 'Go there, buy that,' succinctly summarises the average British wine article. British wine journalism is still informed by the notion that the writer's job is to demystify this curious foreign beast called wine and swell the ranks of wine drinkers. The chief beneficiaries are the supermarkets, and those selling wines at under Pounds 4 a bottle. In France, Bettane sees his job as halting the decline of wine consumption and educating a new generation of consumers. While Britain's consumerist wine writers list retail stockists, their US counterparts have to limit themselves to importers, so complex is the US distribution system. Bettane and his ilk simply give the address of the producer, however. 'In France we don't have wine merchants, and those few cavistes that exist have no knowledge at all of the international wine market.' As well as travelling to the US, and possibly Italy or Germany once a year, Bettane reads the British and American wine press avidly. He treasures his relationship with 'Bob' (wine guru Robert Parker) and, like him, Bettane was born in Maryland, even though they differ on the subject of wine scores out of 100. 'They are very, very dangerous. More and more the wine trade simply reacts to these points rather than knowing what they like and want to sell. 'I have resisted publishing points in RVF. We use a much more general star system. In France we judge in a more cultural, civilised way. To understand Pinot Noir, for example, you must understand the culture of Pinot Noir before the technical knowledge. 'No Frenchman knows more about California or Italian wines than me but it's difficult to write about them because there's no market for them in France - although more French people are becoming interested in non-French wines, especially Italian wines because of the cuisine. 'I think California produces some superb wines, but Australians? I just cannot understand them. Even someone as sympathetic as James Halliday (Australia's top wine writer and a wine producer) seems to be from another planet. Acids, tannins, balance, we taste completely differently. With Davis (the academic centre of California wine), I understand them - and I know they're wrong. With Australians, I can't even understand them.' For the moment, however, Bettane has quite enough problems to sort out at home. 'We think that more than 60, perhaps 80, per cent of all French appellation controlee wines are below the necessary level of quality, especially in Burgundy and Champagne. That's why vins de pays producers deserve success; because they work so much harder. 'Perhaps the best value appellations in general are in south west France - Madiran, Jurancon, Bergerac - and the Languedoc. They are modern wines with the complexity of French tradition rather than the simplicity of the New World. 'And,' here he gives his trademark mischievous smile, 'they're so much less boring than Bordeaux.'</p>

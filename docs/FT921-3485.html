			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest tumbles Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.35m In 'the most challenging year ever experienced' Abbeycrest, the designer and manufacturer of gold and silver jewellery, reported pre-tax profits down by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.35m. Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said in spite of extensive discounting in the retail jewellery sector over the peak Christmas selling season the company's market had still contracted by more than 20 per cent. Turnover for the year to end-December was static at Pounds 60m (Pounds 60.2m) and operating profits fell from Pounds 5.31m to Pounds 4.32m. Net interest payable however was reduced from Pounds 1m to Pounds 967,000. Bad debts, brought about by customer failures, led to an increase in provisions to Pounds 494,000 against Pounds 41,000 last year. A final dividend of 2p (2.4p) is proposed making a total of 3.2p (3.6p). Earnings per share fells from 12.1p to 9.8p.</p>

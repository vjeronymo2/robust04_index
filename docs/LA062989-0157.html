			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REVERSING FIELD;  </P> <P> ALBERT RAZO IS USING FOOTBALL TALENTS TO LEAVE LIFE OF DRUGS, VIOLENCE BEHIND  </P> <P> His heart on his sleeve, his family name tattooed on his arm, Albert Razo  talked about smoking marijuana as a third grader and PCP as high school  freshman. He talked about starting fights over such pressing issues as "Who are  you looking at?" and about being arrested. He talked about a bad guy he knew a  couple years back, a guy who looked, spoke, even threw a football the way he  did. He talked about himself.  </P> <P> He talked about his family name, which he's proud to show above the likeness of  an Indian woman on his left arm. It's also a name that, in the past two years,  found its way into newspaper stories about his older brother Jose, who went to  Harvard but came back to La Habra and was recently convicted of robbing  fast-food and convenience stores.  </P> <P> Albert Razo, 18, talked about his life in La Habra, the only kind of life he  has known and one he's now itching to leave.  </P> <P>  Reporter: You signed to play football at Cal State Northridge, a good Division  II program. But there are some people who think you have the potential of being  a Division I quarterback. They say that if you got some seasoning at Fullerton  College that in two years you'd be a hot recruiting prospect.  </P> <P>  Razo: I decided it would be best for me to get away from this area. There are  a lot of different things around here that, if I went to Fullerton, would maybe  stop me from pursuing my education. There are a lot of distractions, my  friends, my peers, the gang members I used to be involved with. There's so many  different things that I've tried to overcome and that I don't want to deal with  in college. I have to get away."  </P> <P> Albert Razo has a strong right arm. So strong that during the North team's  workouts for Friday's Orange County High School Football All-Star game several  receivers complained about the speed of Razo's passes and the marks they left  in their chests.  </P> <P> Razo, probably the North's starting quarterback, hopes his arm is strong enough  to take him away from all he did to himself and all that was done to him in La  Habra.  </P> <P> In the worst of times he was smoking dope, giving up on school and ready to  bash anyone's face who looked at him in a manner that he didn't feel fitting.  </P> <P> "You didn't mess with Albert, you kept your distance," said Dave Gutierrez, a  teammate of Razo's on the La Habra High football team who will play receiver on  the North team. "He was his own crowd, he followed only himself, and you better  stay out of the way."  </P> <P> His third day on the La Habra campus -- he had transferred from Servite High  early in his sophomore year -- Razo got into a fight and was suspended.  </P> <P> "I was a bad guy," he said.  </P> <P> But he could always throw. He could throw a junior-sized football more than 70  yards while in elementary school.  </P> <P> John Barnes, Los Alamitos' football coach and coach of the North team, marveled  at Razo's arm strength the first days of practice. Like others, including Razo,  Barnes believes that Razo must improve on staying in the pocket and reading  defenses before he becomes an exceptional quarterback.  </P> <P> "But all the raw tools are there," Barnes said. "He reminds me a lot of Dave  Wilson, who was a raw thrower at Katella, then went to Fullerton College and  really blossomed."  </P> <P> Dave Wilson now plays for the New Orleans Saints.  </P> <P> Still, Barnes had to be persuaded to put Razo on the team. Razo was hurt much  of his senior year, posting his most impressive numbers as a punter. He  averaged 46 yards a punt. But once Barnes got a look at Razo's passes, he knew  he had something special.  </P> <P> "He puts a lot on the ball," Barnes said. "To throw like that, I'm sure  someone's had to work with him as a kid."  </P> <P> But Razo said no one taught him. His athletic ability just came naturally.  Unfortunately for him, his ability to get into trouble came just as naturally.  </P> <P> He was arrested four times as a juvenile. Three times for fighting, once for  being in possession of stolen property. He hung with a local gang in La Habra,  though he said he was never initiated. He fought their fights at parties and  smoked their dope.  </P> <P> "They could be tough guys," Gutierrez said. "One day they might smile at you,  the next they might stab you."  </P> <P> By the end of his freshman year at Servite, Razo was near bottom. His grade  point average was down to a 1.2, a D-average. He didn't pay attention in class,  when he decided to go to class. He drove a motorcycle to school each day though  he was still too young to get a driver's license.  </P> <P> He felt fine when he was playing football -- he played on a Servite freshman  team that also had linebacker Garrett Greedy (signed with UCLA) and running  back Derek Brown (Nebraska) -- but away from the field he was alone.  </P> <P> "I had a huge chip on my shoulder," he said.  </P> <P> When Servite coaches told him at the beginning of his sophomore year that they  were moving him from the backfield to wide receiver, Razo got permission from  his parents to leave Servite for La Habra.  </P> <P> He didn't play football for the 1986-87 school year, "just loafed around and  got in a lot of trouble. I was constantly on the street."  </P> <P> On the night of July 6, 1987 Albert's older brother, Jose, was arrested in  connection with a series of armed robberies. That same night, Albert says he  was smoking PCP, a highly toxic psychoactive anesthetic commonly known as  "angel dust," with some friends.  </P> <P> "I think that night changed everything for me," Razo said.  </P> <P> Jose had been the Razos' Abel to Albert's Cain. Jose got good grades and was  recruited by Ivy League schools, eventually attending Harvard in 1985.  </P> <P> But by July of 1987 that all ended.  </P> <P> "I had always looked up to him; I couldn't believe it," Albert said. "I didn't  know what was going on. My whole attitude changed about everything, it was like  day and night."  </P> <P> Razo says that a month after Jose's arrest, he was totally off drugs. He sought  advice from Bob Rau, then La Habra's coach. Rau told him his football talent  could take him away, but that it would require something of Razo.  </P> <P> "He said I had to change crowds," Razo said. "It was real hard to do, I was  close with some of those guys."  </P> <P> But he made the break, approaching the gang's leader, who Razo said is now in  prison, and told him: "I have to get away from you because I got talent."  </P> <P> Rau told him he had to go to class, that he wouldn't be suiting up at La Habra  with a 1.2 average.  </P> <P> "I never really liked classes like English, but I looked at my situation and  said to myself, 'You need to like English,' " Razo said.  </P> <P> By the end of his junior year, Razo's grade-point average had shot up to 2.85.  </P> <P> His junior season he platooned at quarterback. As a senior, he was going to run  the show himself. He had made such an impression as a junior, he was receiving  mail from such schools at Nebraska, Oregon State and Washington State.  </P> <P> But a week before the start of practice, he broke his collarbone while riding a  motorcycle in the desert. Lying in the sand, waiting for a friend to help him,  Razo lost himself in a swell of tears. This, he thought, was the end.  </P> <P> "The first thing I thought was, 'There goes my career,' " Razo said. "Then I  broke down."  </P> <P> The letters stopped, but he did get back in time for the third game of the  season, just in time to reinjure his collarbone.  </P> <P> "Overall, it was a real frustrating year," Razo said.  </P> <P> A couple of years before, Razo might have escaped by quitting. But Jack  Nicholls, La Habra's coach, said Razo always came to practice and worked hard.  </P> <P> "He helped all the younger quarterbacks," Nicholls said. "I could leave Albert  with the quarterbacks and know that he would get them through a drill. From  what I've heard about him, he probably wouldn't have done that a few years  ago."  </P> <P> To Razo's amazement, Cal State Northridge recruited him. It's not the  out-of-state distance he was hoping for -- "I wanted to get as far away as  possible," -- but it was away from La Habra.  </P> <P> "I'm very proud of who I am today," Razo said. "It's hard to know all the stuff  I've been through. I've seen both sides of the world, good and bad."  </P> <P> And he has lived in both worlds. Asked what the young tough would think of  Albert Razo today, eager to go to college, Razo said: "He'd think he was an  idiot, a nerd."  </P> <P> And what if Albert Razo saw the tough?  </P> <P> "I wouldn't think anything, I'd just walk straight on by him."  </P> <P> The interview nearing its end, Razo leans forward and his eyes widen. He's  talking about how he changed his life and went from no future to a Division II  scholarship. His chest inflates while he talks about being asked to speak to  incoming La Habra freshmen about the importance of going to class and doing the  right thing.  </P> <P>  Reporter: What would you like to see happen for Albert Razo in the next few  years?  </P> <P>  Razo: I'd like to see Albert Razo graduating from college with a Master's in  criminal psychology. I want to help juvenile delinquents. I want to be a  probation officer and go into probation counseling. I want to help the young  kids. This might sound strange, but I'd like to come back to La Habra and help  the young Albert Razos."  </P> <P> </P></p>

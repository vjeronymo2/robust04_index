He is eager to defend the "achievements" of his  feeble presidency by fabricating crises abroad and spreading  lies, something which a person assuming a public responsibility  scarcely does! It has become completely clear to all observers  that Clinton, before completing his first year in office, is  being criticized severely by many domestic sides due to a series  of defeats and failures abroad.    On the domestic front, problems and scandals are raining on  his head, including his love affairs before, during, and after  the presidential elections and the exposure of financial  irregularities that are being investigated in a climate of  economic failure, and his failure to fulfill his tempting  electoral promises. On the foreign policy front, defeats  continue in Somalia, Haiti, and Russia, and plans to contain  Japanese superiority and European independence have also failed.  Moreover, Iraq has succeeded in rebuilding itself and  safeguarding its national independence.    Therefore, Clinton has been perpetually exposed to severe  campaigns of criticism by the U.S. media, and many sides hinted  that he might be fired before ending his second year in office.  This makes him face difficult and bitter options and forces him  to choose the easiest and shortest way to prevent failure and  criticism; namely, fabricating crises abroad and diverting U.S.  public opinion and making it accept confusing and misleading  policies.    The worst of his recent lies may be the ones he told in his  periodic report to U.S. Congress two days ago because these lies  express the U.S. President's state of misery and his disgusting  moral retreat.    He told his first lie to Congress when he said Iraq intends  to rebuild its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction,  especially the nuclear weapon! If Clinton had a balanced mind,  logic, or memory, he would not have uttered such foolishness,  simply because it is well known that the reports of the United  Nations and its committees, particularly the International  Atomic Energy Agency, which work at the instructions and  supervision of the U.S. Administration, have all stated in their  official reports that Iraq has no nuclear weapons and that these  committees have destroyed Iraq's peaceful nuclear capabilities.    One of the ridiculous and reprehensible ironies is that  Clinton told that lie three days before the arrival of Rolf  Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, in Baghdad. Ekeus  had admitted in all his reports that Iraq was free of weapons of  mass destruction in order to discuss the implementation of  Resolution 715 after Iraq implemented the other resolutions,  most important of which is Resolution 687.    Clinton told his second lie when he said that Iraqi soldiers  opened fire on a military convoy of the allied forces in  northern Iraq last December. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued  an official report at that time and refuted the lie. Raising  this fabricated story that collapsed when confronted by reality  is intended to incite the U.S. Congress against Iraq and justify  the blockade.    He also told a third lie to Congress when he said that the  Iraqis are suffering from the blockade because Iraq refuses to  export oil. Despite its silliness, this statement requires  comment. Iraq did not refuse and will not refuse to export oil.  The opposite is true. Iraq asks for permission to export oil to  meet its people's needs, but the United States insists that a UN  committee receive and spend oil revenues inside Iraq, as if the  committee were a substitute for the Iraqi Government or as if it  were in a country having no central government.    While it is a big insult to the Iraqi people, this U.S.  condition cancels Iraq's sovereignty and violates its national  independence because allowing a foreign side to receive oil  revenues and purchase and distribute basic goods apart from the  Iraqi Government means accepting a disgusting trusteeship that  conflicts with the Iraqi people's history and dignity. The  Iraqi people rebelled against that trusteeship and offered  thousands of martyrs to terminate it and prevent it from  returning.    Clinton knows that he is lying and that what he relates are  sheer stories, fabricated and prepared to justify the  continuation of the blockade. The issue may seem to be rather  bearable, but if we take into account the fact that Clinton, a  representative of the American people and their legislative  organ, addresses Congress on such issues, we will understand the  size of defect in the U.S. President.    He lies to the highest legislative authority to mislead it  and get it to support an unjust and inhuman policy in conflict  with the values and principles of the U.S. Constitution; namely,  the continuation of the blockade on a whole nation. This  behavior also conflicts with the presidential oath in which he  promised to carry out his duties honestly and sincerely. It  also conflicts with the qualifications required in a president;  namely truthfulness. Congressional leaders and members were  toppled when their lies were proved. The Watergate scandal  toppled President Richard Nixon when he lied and denied that he  had known about spying on the rival party's headquarters.    Clinton has not only committed the crime of insisting on  killing thousands of Iraqis through the blockade, but has also  gone beyond that to mislead the American people and Congress!  If Congress is truthful and honest to the American Constitution  and to its duties, it has to raise the issue of the President  lying and misleading the American public and Congress and  committing the crime of annihilating mankind!    Finally, Clinton's lies are just more evidence of his  political and moral failure and bankruptcy, his weakness, and  his unstable policy and behavior. This is his Achilles' heel.  Leading the world, which is Clinton's ambition, will never be  achieved by charlatans, liars, and the weak. This is history's  most important lesson.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Matsushita fights for leading role - MCA's quest for control When Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita, flew across the Pacific on Tuesday, the distance between Osaka, where his company is based, and his Californian destination, must have seemed greater than ever. The head of the Japanese consumer electronics group made a hastily arranged trip to San Francisco to find out why the men who run MCA, its US entertainment subsidiary, had suddenly - and very publicly - demanded independence from their Japanese owner. The latest drama in Matsushita's four years as MCA's parent provides a stark illustration of the difficulties that a conservative company, which values consensus and long-term thinking, faces in running a business like MCA, steeped in Hollywood's entrepreneurial and egotistical culture. It also highlights the problems of MCA's executives in adapting to life under a very different corporate regime. It can be no consolation to Mr Morishita that the current crisis was widely predicted when Matsushita bought MCA, which includes Geffen Records and Universal Pictures, for Dollars 6.1bn in late 1990, shortly after Sony's acquisitions of Columbia Pictures and CBS Records. One investment banker commented that the the Japanese have 'no idea of the difficulty of managing Hollywood companies with their prima donna culture of limousines and private jets'. Hollywood has for months been buzzing with rumours of rifts between MCA and its parent. Yet Matsushita executives were clearly flabbergasted by last week's reports that Mr Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairman, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, its president, were considering a bid to buy back control of their business. Matsushita, to an even greater degree than most Japanese companies, likes to deal with its problems discreetly. Any sign of weakness from senior management in the face of pressure from a US subsidiary would have been perceived as loss of face. MCA is also a critical component of Matsushita's long-term strategy in the communications sphere. Without control of MCA's vast libraries of movies and music - which include Jurassic Park and The Flintstones and chart-topping albums from Nirvana and Aerosmith - Matsushita would be relegated to the role of a low-margin hardware manufacturer. Unsurprisingly, Mr Morishita said 'no' when Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg on Tuesday asked him to cede managerial control of MCA. 'What else could he have done?' asked Mr Christopher Dixon, entertainment industry analyst at PaineWebber in New York. 'There's no question that Matsushita is taking a long-term view of its investment. It's got to stick with MCA.' The two companies are now plotting their next moves in a high-stakes game. The critical question is whether Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg will stay at MCA, where they have worked together for 22 years as the longest-running management team in Hollywood. Both men could easily afford to quit, having made substantial sums by selling MCA shares to Matsushita. Mr Wasserman, 81, has already offered to go next year. Mr Sheinberg, 59, may follow when his contract ends in 1995. He, like his boss, has become increasingly dissatisfied with Matsushita's refusal to back MCA's expansion plans. They had hoped their wealthy Japanese parent would finance MCA's participation in the wave of mergers and acquisitions that has swept the US as broadcasters, cable TV operators, telecommunications companies and entertainment groups have raced to position themselves in the interactive media services market. The US corporate frenzy has been watched with scepticism from across the Pacific. Companies like Matsushita, accustomed to the slow, evolutionary pace of development in consumer electronics, are dubious about the timing of the multimedia revolution and its financial potential. These differences came to a head when Matsushita blocked MCA's recent attempt to acquire 49 per cent of NBC, the US television company. This, coupled with a previous decision to veto the proposed purchase of Virgin Records, fuelled MCA's fears of being left behind by dynamic rivals such as Time Warner and Viacom. Whatever Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg decide to do, Matsushita must address the issue of MCA's long-term strategy. Its efforts to do so will be constrained by its ongoing rationalisation programme in Japan, given that it will be reluctant to risk alienating its domestic workforce by sanctioning aggressive expansion in the US. MCA itself is in a vulnerable condition. Its performance was erratic in its first few years under Matsushita. However, it produced record results in 1993 (when analysts suspect it made operating profits of up to Dollars 400m on revenues of Dollars 4bn) thanks to the success of Geffen's music releases, Jurassic Park and The Flintstones. This year's results are expected to be rather less robust. Moreover, Mr David Geffen, founder of Geffen Records, will leave MCA when his contract expires in April. He may well be followed by Mr Steven Spielberg, director of Jurassic Park and producer of The Flintstones, who last week announced he was launching an entertainment group with Mr Geffen and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt Disney's movie studio. Their departure would deprive MCA of two of its most prolific - and profitable - talents at a time when it desperately needs successful new concepts. 'No-one is ever irreplaceable,' said one analyst. 'But those two will be very tough acts to follow.' Mr Spielberg is an old friend of Mr Sheinberg. The latter had hoped the new group might be persuaded to join forces with MCA if he and Mr Wasserman could persuade the Japanese to cede control. Instead, Matsushita's refusal has left MCA in turmoil.</p>

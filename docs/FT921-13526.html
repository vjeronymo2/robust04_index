			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / At least 11 survive French Airbus crash AT LEAST 11 survivors, including a child, were found in the wreckage of a French Airbus A320 which crashed in thick fog in the Vosges mountains of eastern France. At least one of the six crew members also survived. There were 96 passengers and crew on board. State-run Air Inter said it had no indication as to the cause of the crash. Wreckage was found on a wooded ridge four hours after the jet, on a domestic flight from Lyon to Strasbourg, disappeared from radar screens. The Air Inter aircraft, flight IT-5148, gave no distress signal. However, a witness in a village 30 miles south of Strasbourg heard an explosion at around 7.30pm, shortly after the jet was due to land. Rescue workers were hampered by snow, high winds and freezing fog. The A320, regarded as the most advanced civil aircraft in service, is operated by sophisticated computer 'fly by wire' systems. Last night's crash, the third involving the 150-seater twin-engine jet, will rekindle controversy over the possible hazards of aircraft operated by such systems. The A320 has been a best seller for its maker, Airbus Industrie, the four-nation European consortium. Page 3</p>

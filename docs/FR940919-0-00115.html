			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides results for the air pathway, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline and post-regulatory scenarios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the high end scenario models hypothetical receptors. Approximately 26 of the 35 modeled facilities (74 percent)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have individual cancer risks exceeding 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the high end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario in the baseline. For the high end scenario, the non-cancer risk ratio exceeds one at one facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the post-regulatory scenario, individual cancer risk is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowered considerably, indicating that at most of the facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk is driven by TC constituents. In the high end scenario,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight facility(s) have risks exceeding 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Doses of all non-carcinogens are well below reference doses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the population risk estimates, the Agency determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the central tendency incremental benefits are approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.037. For the incremental benefits of today's rule, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed a sensitivity analysis, described in the RIA background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document, which examines the risk implications of changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatilization rates under different assumptions of landfill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover and frequency of waste placement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a number of limitations to the air pathway analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Facilities which were modeled in the analysis were assumed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to dispose of treated waste on-site, which, for some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, may not be the case. In addition, due to limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the model employed, wastes were assumed to be disposed of only one time per year. A sensitivity analysis was conducted and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the RIA Background Document, which examines the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on the emissions rate from this assumption. Finally, only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestreams with all the necessary information were analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This limitation could have the effect of either under- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overestimating the risks from the air pathway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , when an agency publishes a notice of rulemaking, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a rule that will have a significant effect on a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of small entities, the agency must prepare and make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that considers the effect of the rule on small entities (i.e.:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdictions). Under the Agency's Revised Guidelines for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementing The Regulatory Flexibility Act, dated May 4, 1992,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency committed to considering regulatory alternatives in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemakings when there were any economic impacts estimated on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small entities. Previous guidance required regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives to be examined only when significant economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects were estimated on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In assessing the regulatory approach for dealing with small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities in today's final rule, for both surface disposal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes and underground injection control, the Agency considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two factors. First, data on potentially affected small entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unavailable. Second, due to the statutory requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the RCRA LDR program, no legal avenues exist for the Agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide relief from the LDR's for small entities. The only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief available for small entities is the existing small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity generator provisions and conditionally exempt small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity generator exemptions found in 40 CFR 262.11&hyph;12, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 261.5, respectively. These exemptions basically prescribe 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kilograms (kg) per calendar month generation of hazardous waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the limit below which one is exempted from complying with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given these two factors, the Agency was unable to frame a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> series of small entity options from which to select the lowest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost approach; rather, the Agency was legally bound to regulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the land disposal of the hazardous wastes covered in today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without regard to the size of the entity being regulated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this rule have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . and have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned control number 2050&hyph;0085. This rule will reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average reporting burden an estimated 0.75 hours per response,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to decreased paperwork requirements. Send comments regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., S.W. (Mail Code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2138); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

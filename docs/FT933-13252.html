			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Upjohn income advances 8% as turnover rises to Dollars 915m UPJOHN, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday reported a 4 per cent rise in second-quarter sales to Dollars 915m and an 8 per cent improvement in operating income. Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 125.3m, or 70 cents a primary share, against Dollars 123.9m, or 69 cents, a year earlier. Operating income rose to Dollars 163.2m in the 1993 quarter, against Dollars 151.6m. Sales of Halcion, Upjohn's controversial sleeping pill which has been banned in the UK, rose slightly in the second quarter. In the first quarter Halcion's worldwide sales dropped nearly 29 per cent, to about Dollars 10m. The Kalamazoo, Michigan-based company is looking to new products to replace several important drugs which are losing their patents. Three of Upjohn's most important products - Halcion, Xanax and Micronase - will face generic competition next year. Ansaid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, has already lost its patent. In the US, second-quarter sales of healthcare products grew 16 per cent, with new products contributing more than 7 per cent of domestic sales. Incentives to consumers helped lift sales of Rogaine, Upjohn's hair-loss treatment. Outside the US, healthcare sales rose 11 per cent in the quarter. Agricultural sales, however, fell 32 per cent in the three months. The company blamed recent changes to calendar-year from fiscal-year accounting for the decline, although weak corn sales in the US hurt seed sales. Reductions in soyabean acreage in Italy were reflected in declining sales overseas. For the first half of 1993, net income rose to Dollars 269.9m, or Dollars 1.51, from Dollars 38.6m, or 19 cents. In the first half of 1992, Upjohn took charges of Dollars 222.9m for accounting changes, compared with charges of Dollars 7.8m in the first half of this year. Operating income advanced more than 5 per cent to Dollars 347.3m from Dollars 329.2m. Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.85bn.</p>

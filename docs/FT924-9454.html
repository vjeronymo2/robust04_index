			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Corporate America nervously awaits new order AFTER 12 years basking under laissez-faire, pro-business Republican administrations, corporate America is nervously awaiting an activist Democratic president whose legislative programme has far-reaching implications for both US and foreign companies. Despite the anxiety, Mr Bill Clinton has a reasonably strong pro-business record as governor of Arkansas and managed to pick up the election endorsement of many more top executives than other recent Democratic candidates. He has put the revitalisation of the US economy at the top of his agenda and his aides are promising early action in two areas which should win strong business support: an investment tax credit and a Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.2bn) a year programme of infrastructure spending, which should benefit the construction, telecommunications and environmental services industries. However, businesses fear that some of Mr Clinton's other pledges, particularly in the area of healthcare insurance, job training and labour relations, could impose onerous new costs on them, while foreign companies are extremely concerned over his threat to tax them more heavily. The impact of the new policy mix remains highly uncertain, since Mr Clinton has yet to fill his cabinet posts and his published plans consist of little more than vague campaign generalities. However, some broad themes stand out: Foreign companies may suffer in two respects. First, Mr Clinton has promised to 'crack down' on those which 'prosper by manipulating our tax laws to their advantage'. This may involve new rules to prevent multinationals abusing transfer pricing - the price they charge US subsidiaries for goods - to avoid paying US tax. A more aggressive approach would be to support a discussion document floated by two senior congressmen last summer, which suggested arbitrarily taxing foreign companies on the basis of the average profitability of US companies in their sector. Second, foreign companies may suffer from a more protectionist attitude to the takeover of US businesses. For example, Mr Clinton said recently he would oppose the proposed acquisition by British Airways of a 44 per cent stake in ailing USAir because if the deal went through US carriers would get no additional access to the British market. Tax. Mr Clinton plans quick action to provide a 'targeted' investment tax credit, which US business has not enjoyed since 1986. Ms Gillian Spooner, a partner at the accounting group KPMG Peat Marwick, says it remains unclear what kinds of investment will be covered and whether the credit will be incremental - in other words dependent on a business increasing its investment over the level of preceding years. There are also plans to encourage new small businesses by allowing long-term investors in start-ups to get 50 per cent of any gains excluded from the tax net. In common with Mr Bush, Mr Clinton has promised to make permanent an annual tax credit for companies investing in research and development and to set up enterprise zones in the inner cities. Health insurance. A key campaign pledge has been reform of the US healthcare system, aimed at making adequate medical aid available to all and holding back rocketing health costs. The drug and insurance industries will be hurt by promises to attack the 'price gouging' of the former and the underwriting policies of the latter. Mr Clinton is also expected to mandate that all employers provide healthcare insurance for their workers, though they would get some form of federal aid in the early years. Many businesses, particularly small ones, are likely to complain that this is an extra financial burden which will costs jobs. A larger question, argues Mr Steve Raetzman, of management consultants Towers Perrin, is whether Mr Clinton might look to business as a source of revenue to fund his healthcare pledge. He might seek to reduce the favourable tax treatment of employers' health insurance payments, currently treated 100 per cent as an operating business expense. Worker training. Mr Clinton will require every employer to spend 1.5 per cent of payroll for the continuing education and training of its workers. That may not be too arduous for large companies, but once more it may be a severe burden for smaller businesses. The environment. Businesses guilty of pollution are likely to be fined or taxed more heavily, while tax incentives are promised to encourage use of alternative fuels and recycled materials. The motor industry will have to meet tougher fuel efficiency requirements by 2000 and other sectors may face more onerous pollution standards. Telecommunications. The new administration supports the idea of nationwide communications infrastructure based on highly efficient fibre-optic technology. It is not clear who would pay for this and which companies would benefit. The record of Mr Al Gore, who will be vice-president, suggests the administration will encourage a big role for the giant, cash-rich 'Baby Bell' regional phone companies, which are presently discouraged by regulatory and legal restrictions from investing in fibre-optic networks and want more freedom to provide video services to the home. Labour relations. Mr Clinton owes election debts to the labour movement and corporate America fears that unions, which have lost a great deal of power over the past 12 years, may regain some ground. The president-elect has pledged to sign the Workplace Fairness Act, which would ban the permanent replacement of striking workers. 'The great concern in labour law is what he is going to sign when a liberal Congress presents it to him,' says Mr David Rhodes of consultants Towers Perrin, who suggests the outcome will have a significant effect on American industry's long-term productivity.</p>

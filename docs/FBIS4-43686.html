			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PLO To Open Office for Relations </F> With Holy See"]    [Excerpt] Vatican City, June 18 -- The Palestine Liberation  Organization is preparing to open an office for relations with  the Vatican "in a matter of weeks," Nimr Hammad, the Palestinian  general delegate in Italy confirmed today.    Hammad said Vatican and Palestinian officials are now  "discussing the test of an agreement for mutual recognition" in  a statement given to the Italian news agency ANSA. The opening  of a Palestinian office for relations with the Holy See would  appear to sanction the start-up of official relations between  the two sides.    On this score, Palestinian sources here have recently  referred to the prospect for imminent "diplomatic relations."  The feasibility of this step, however, is clouded by what the  Vatican itself describes as "the beginning of Palestinian  autonomous government responsibility in the Gaza region and the  city of Jerico," in relation to full diplomatic recognition,  with an exchange of ambassadors, with an entity which is not yet  a full-blow state.    In any case, noted Vatican watchers, a Palestinian  "presence"  in the Vatican would certainly come as a step in this direction  and help confirm the desire of the Holy See to play a role in  the Middle East peace process.

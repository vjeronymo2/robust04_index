			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. CAPIZZI'S PROSECUTORS TO AID CAMPAIGN; ENRIGHT ANGRY  </P> <P> Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright on Friday assailed his boss, Dist.  Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, for using deputy prosecutors in a planned  door-to-door campaign this weekend in the kickoff of their two-man race for the  office's top seat.  </P> <P> "It's highly, highly questionable," Enright said. "In this case, love and  devotion (to the boss) looks more like retention and promotion."  </P> <P> The prosecutors, however, say their efforts, which begin today, are strictly  voluntary and that Capizzi had to be persuaded to let them help him. One leader  of the Capizzi campaign, Fountain Valley attorney Bruce C. Bridgman, called  Enright "a jerk" for trying to make it a campaign issue.  </P> <P> The political jabs came on the eve of the beginning of Enright's and Capizzi's  fall campaign for district attorney. Both candidates are longtime adversaries  within the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Enright, 63, a last-minute candidate for the district attorney's race in the  June primary, surprised everyone by garnering enough votes in a four-man race  to force Capizzi, the top vote-getter, into a Nov. 6 runoff.  </P> <P> Capizzi, 50, responded on Friday that he has made it clear to all the office  employees who volunteered -- nearly 75 prosecutors and almost that many  investigators -- that there was no pressure to participate.  </P> <P> "So many people wanted to help, I finally decided it would be insensitive to  their concerns for the future of the office not to let them get involved,"  Capizzi said.  </P> <P> But Enright said prosecutors going door to door for the boss should not be  acceptable to the voters.  </P> <P> "You wash the boss's car on Saturday and then the deputy sitting next to you  says, 'Hmm, maybe he could use a wax job too,' " Enright said. "It is wrong for  appearances. If the deputy who walks precincts gets promoted and the deputy who  stays home doesn't, it's just very bad for the office."  </P> <P> But one of the deputy prosecutors who volunteered, Guy N. Ormes, said Capizzi  was reluctant to let them participate.  </P> <P> "A lot of us wanted to help him out before (in the June primary), but Mike  asked us not to," Ormes said. "We're going out there because we want to see him  win."  </P> <P> Gregg Prickett, another deputy prosecutor, said he feels no pressure at all to  help Capizzi. "Just the opposite is true," he added. "Those of us who are going  out there have had to take some razzing within the office about (currying favor  with Capizzi). But (Capizzi) represents the values I believe a D.A. should  have. Why shouldn't the public have a right to know?"  </P> <P> Not all the deputy prosecutors volunteered. One, who asked not to be named,  said he would never walk a precinct for either candidate.  </P> <P> "I'm a professional prosecutor," he said. "I'm here to do a job."  </P> <P> And Tom Borris, a former prosecutor who recently left the district attorney's  office, said at Enright's open house in Santa Ana on Friday night that he was  offended when Bridgman called him and asked him if he wanted to walk precincts  for Capizzi.  </P> <P> "I think it stinks," Borris said.  </P> <P> Bridgman said that he tried to contact only those deputy prosecutors who had  indicated either to him or others that they wanted to help Capizzi.  </P> <P> "We tried to do this without creating any friction within the office," Bridgman  said. "We tried hard not to impact deputies not in the campaign."  </P> <P> For example, he said, he deliberately did not ask any of the prosecutors who  work on the homicide panel, because that has long been Enright's area within  the office. Several homicide prosecutors contacted said they preferred to stay  out of the race altogether.  </P> <P> The Capizzi volunteers are scheduled to walk precincts throughout the county  for the next nine weekends before the election.  </P> <P> Capizzi added that he has stood firm by his decision before the June primary  not to let any of his deputies make any financial contributions to his  campaign. But Enright, Capizzi said, accepted a $1,000 contribution from  Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman.  </P> <P> Enright responded that it's an unfair comparison, because he's not in charge of  the office the way Capizzi is in charge of the deputies in his campaign.  </P> <P> During the primary, Enright had called Capizzi the "politician's candidate."  Capizzi was appointed district attorney in January by the County Board of  Supervisors when longtime Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks accepted a judgeship.  </P> <P> Enright and his supporters claim that Hicks planned his early retirement from  office in an effort to give Capizzi a leg up on the other candidates in the  primary.  </P> <P> Capizzi chose not to respond to Enright in that campaign. But his failure to  retain his seat outright in the June election may have forced some changes in  campaign strategy. He switched political consultants, and decided on a  door-to-door campaign instead of his June strategy of relying on mailers.  </P> <P> In a statement released by his campaign office this week, Capizzi said: "It's  too easy to sit back and send mass mailers. We think political campaigns should  be on a person-to-person basis."  </P> <P> At Enright's open house Friday, Capizzi's use of deputies was a major topic.  </P> <P> Villa Park attorney William A. Dougherty compared it to the old rule in the  military: "You don't have to do it; it's compulsory."  </P> <P> Enright added that the pressure is not so much on those deputies who  volunteered, but on those who did not.  </P> <P> "You would never have seen this in a Kenny Williams office," Enright said.  Williams, who was district attorney before Cecil Hicks, has endorsed Enright's  candidacy.  </P></p>

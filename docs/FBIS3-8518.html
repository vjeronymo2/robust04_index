The Bosnian Serbs Thursday again prevented one 10-truck  convoy carrying 92 tons of food from entering the northern town,  forcing the UNHCR to divert it to Zenica, in central Bosnia.    Kessler said the UNHCR's head of operations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Larry Hollingworth, who accompanied the  convoy, was splitting it into two, one for Maglaj itself and one  for the town of Tesanj, 15 kilometres (10 miles) west.    The two towns are in the Maglaj pocket, containing some  130,000 people who have been under siege by the Serbs since last  June. They are only supplied by international air drops and  latest reports speak of desperate conditions in the area.</p>

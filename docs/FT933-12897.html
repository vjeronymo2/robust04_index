			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith to be first Labour leader to address CBI LABOUR'S rapprochement with industry will take a further step in November when Mr John Smith becomes the first leader of the party to address the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Smith also beats Mr John Major to become the first leader of one of Britain's main political parties to address the CBI annual conference since they began in 1977. Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher was invited in 1984 but pulled out at the last moment to attend the funeral of Mrs Indira Gandhi, the Indian prime minister. Mr Major has so far only addressed smaller CBI conferences and dinners. The CBI yesterday said the invitation to Mr Smith was part of efforts to broaden the scope of its annual conference rather than an attempt to send a political message to Downing Street. Even the attendance of ministers at the annual gathering of Britain's industrial leaders is a relatively new innovation, it said. But Mr Smith is certain the use the opportunity to stress Labour's commitment to gearing economic policies towards promoting manufacturing industry through investment and training - and to attack the government's record on the economy. Addressing the CBI is a logical extension of the so-called 'prawn cocktail' circuit of City lunches by senior Labour spokesmen before last year's general election. Last year Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, spoke at the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress and is due to address a conference later this year on manufacturing organised by the AEEU craft union. That conference will also be addressed by Mr Smith.</p>

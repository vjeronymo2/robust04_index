			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (2): School fees defy recessionary pressures - MBA Costs and Benefits Recessions are good for keeping down prices but not, it appears, the somewhat daunting fees charged by management education schools. As belts have tightened generally across Europe, many institutions offering MBAs and executive courses have continued to raise their fees, even if the increases are less pronounced than they were during the 1980s. A glance at the charges for Europe's top management education centres confirms that many are charging significantly more than they were at the start of the decade. Perhaps MBAs, like Mercedes Benz cars, fall into the category of Giffen goods - products whose attractiveness increases as their prices rise. Not all schools have continued to increase their nominal fees, but this has often been for special reasons. At IESE, the International Graduate School of Management in Barcelona, Spain, for example, the cost of an MBA course between this academic year and the next has barely moved. For 1993/94 the cost of the programme was Pta1.875bn (Pounds 9,014) while for 1994-95 the price will be Pta1.9bn (Pounds 9,134). This amounts to a 1.3 per cent increase, compared with a 26 per cent increase, between 1989/90 and 1991/92. Mr Paul McDonough, director of admissions at IESE, says fees are rising more slowly for several reasons. IESE believes that its programme was under-priced for many years, leading to the big rises at the end of the 1980s. These increases were necessary, too, to pay for new facilities. On top of this, the economic downturn in Europe has resulted in a drop in the numbers of people willing to make investments of any nature. 'Many MBA candidates have decided that it may be wiser to wait a year or two before actually quitting a job and making a significant investment in education,' says Mr McDonough. 'Many marginal candidates have decided that quitting a job is just too risky.' In spite of this, costs generally have continued to rise. Even in the UK where there is an abundance of MBA places and a poor outlook for jobs, many schools have been able to raise their fees. Six of the best known UK schools  -Bath, Bradford, Cranfield, London, Middlesex and Strathclyde - raised their prices in this academic year. At Bradford fees increased by almost 20 per cent between 1992/93 and 1993/94. At London rises were more modest. The cost of the first year of the two-year MBA course increased from Pounds 8,950 in 1992/3 to Pounds 9,500 in this. This Pounds 550 increase compares with increases of Pounds 750, Pounds 1,700 and Pounds 2,000 in the previous three years. At the same time, post-MBA earnings are not as impressive as they were during the last decade. As Aurelie Morel, director of admissions and placements at the Institute for Management Development in Switzerland says: 'The cost of an MBA is less to do with the actual price of the course and much more to do with quitting a job, of investing a year of your life, of forgoing your salary for a year and of finding another job at the end.' A survey by the Association among MBAs (Amba) shows that those entering into positions with new employers after completing an MBA, the size of the premium attracted by MBAs has generally declined over time. Those graduating between 1980 and 1985 reported an average increase in salary of nearly 65 per cent (about 40 per cent when adjusted for salary inflation). By 1991 the average reported percentage increase had declined to 34 per cent which, after adjustment for salary inflation, indicates that those graduating in 1991 increased their salary on average by 16.5 per cent over and above the increase they would have expected to receive during the period of their training. The survey covered 28 UK business schools, 10 continental European schools and leading US schools. One solution to the rising cost of MBAs would be to make fees paid by an individual tax deductible, something for which Amba has long campaigned. The issue has yet to be resolved. In the last UK Budget the government extended tax relief for vocational training to National Vocational Qualifications at level 5, but no-one has yet established whether this covers MBA courses. 'We find the present uncertainty highly undesirable,' says Roger McCormick of AMBA. It would be wrong to exaggerate the impact that the recession has had on the cost of MBAs. The big, well-established schools have sailed through the economic downturn and continued to charge ever higher fees, protecting themselves, to an extent, by offering increasingly varied executive courses on top of the MBAs. This has left the less well-known establishments to bear the brunt of sluggish economic conditions. But as Europe emerges from recession, and the jobs market becomes less competitive, the opportunity cost to students of taking an MBA may start to creep back down. As Mr McDonough points out: 'Those individuals over there (the US) who decided to embark on their MBA two years ago are reaping the benefits of being in the right place at the right time. In Europe, my question is whether it will be the graduating class of 1995 or 1996 which will be job seeking just as the economy picks up.'</p>

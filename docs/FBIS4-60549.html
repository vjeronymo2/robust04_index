			<p>BFN     [Text] Sources in Lebanon claim the Lebanese Government  has recently rejected an Israeli proposal for the beginning of a  peace process and security arrangements in the security zone.  This proposal was submitted via U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    The sources told our correspondent Yo'av Aviv that according  to the proposal, Israel is willing to withdraw its forces and  end its presence in the Jazzin enclave. SLA [South Lebanese  Army] forces in this region will be disarmed and replaced by  Lebanese Army units. Security operations in the area will be  coordinated by a joint IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and Lebanese  Army committee. Over the next five years Israel will gradually  withdraw from the security zone and transfer authority to the  Lebanese Army, while the SLA will be incorporated as a separate  unit within the Lebanese Army.    According to the sources, the Lebanese Government rejected  this proposal, claiming it does not involve a full withdrawal,  and that there is no room for a separate peace between Israel  and Lebanon.</p>

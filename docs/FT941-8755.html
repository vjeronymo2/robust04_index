			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Glaxo hit by counterfeit drugs Glaxo, the UK's biggest pharmaceutical company, has been the victim of a counterfeiting of its top selling anti-ulcer treatment Zantac for the first time since 1989. The fraud has prompted the Medicines Control Agency, an arm of the Department of Health, to send a drug alert to the 60,000 doctors and pharmacists practising in the UK. Drugs counterfeiting is lucrative and widespread in south and eastern Europe but is relatively rare in the UK. Some counterfeits consist of illegally manufactured versions of the drug, as in this case. Others are medically useless or damaging, where capsules might contain materials such as flour. Glaxo said yesterday that it became aware of the problem shortly before Christmas when a patient in London became suspicious. Laboratory tests showed that the tablets, packaged as Azantac 771, the French trade mark, were counterfeit. The tablets were discoloured and lacked the second 'A' in the embossed 'Azantac' logo. Glaxo said it had no idea of the extent of the fraud, but it was the first time counterfeit Zantac pills had been sold in the UK since 1989 when a version arrived after being manufactured in a house in Athens. The news coincided with first-half results from the pharmaceuticals company which showed a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.001bn and an increase in the dividend to 9p. It will come as a blow to the company because Zantac sales growth is slowing down in the face of rival products coming off patent being sold as cheaper generic versions. The Medicines Control Agency said: 'We are only aware of one incidence so far. The drug does contain the essential active ingredients but we are concerned because it does not come from a licenced manufacturer which has been properly inspected.' Results, Page 19</p>

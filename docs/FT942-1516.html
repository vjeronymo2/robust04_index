			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc Rorer to take Dollars 121m charge Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals company formed when the French state-owned chemicals company took a majority stake in the US drug manufacturer, announced last night that second-quarter profits would be lower than expected and that it would take a restructuring charge of Dollars 121m, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter. After taking the charge, the company said it will post a 'small loss' in the quarter. Excluding the charge, Rhone-Poulenc said it expected earnings of between 50 cents and 55 cents a share - well below Wall Street estimates of 77 cents a share - because of slower than expected sales. Rhone-Poulenc also said that the impact of the charge would not be made up in the second half of the year, which means its full-year earnings will come in roughly level with last year. In 1993, the company earned Dollars 421.1m, or Dollars 2.96 a share, on sales of Dollars 4.02bn.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZENITH, AT&amp;T OFFER PLAN FOR DIGITAL HDTV;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE SYSTEM, WHICH COULD BECOME THE U.S. STANDARD, SHOULD MAKE IT  EASIER TO LINK COMPUTERS WITH TELEVISION.  </P> <P> Solidifying their strong position in the race to develop an American  high-definition television (HDTV) system, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph  and Zenith Electronics on Monday announced a new all-digital version of the  HDTV broadcasting scheme that they will present to the Federal Communications  Commission next year.  </P> <P> The companies said that digital transmission -- which sends information as a  series of ones and zeros rather than as a modulated electrical wave -- would  reduce interference and assure that even television viewers receiving a weak  broadcast signal would see an unadulterated HDTV picture.  </P> <P> HDTV will vastly improve the quality of pictures and sound available on  television sets, and the new generation of TVs and related equipment is  expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for consumer electronics  companies in the next decade.  </P> <P> Japanese companies have a big lead in HDTV technology, but the FCC rejected the  Japanese HDTV system as a standard for the United States because it is not  compatible with existing television broadcasts. Following a series of tests  beginning next year, the FCC will select a U.S. standard for HDTV sometime in  1993. It now appears it will be a digital system.  </P> <P> In addition to the nearly 2-year-old AT&amp;T-Zenith partnership, competitors  in the U.S. HDTV race include General Instruments, the Massachusetts Institute  of Technology, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (which has developed a modified  version of the Japanese system), and a consortium that includes Thomson of  France, Philips of the Netherlands, the David Sarnoff Research Laboratory and  NBC.  </P> <P> Last month, General Instruments surprised the HDTV world with the announcement  that it had developed an all-digital HDTV format, and the Thomson-Philips group  said it would have a digital system as well.  </P> <P> Dale Cripps, publisher of HDTV Newsletter, said he would not be surprised if  MIT came out with a digital proposal, but added that too little technical  information was available about any of the systems to judge which was better.  </P> <P> Digital HDTV, in addition to offering better quality, should also make it  easier to link computers with television, since computers also use the ones and  zeros of digital code as their internal language. The merger of television and  computers is seen by many as the next wave in electronics.  </P> <P> The new AT&amp;T-Zenith system will send regular TV signals on existing  channels while sending digital HDTV signals on unused channels that currently  serve as buffers between stations. The digital HDTV signals are compressed via  sophisticated algorithms and then sent at very low power to eliminate  interference.  </P> <P> The new proposal also promises to offer better pictures than other HDTV systems  by increasing the number of lines on the screen, and by using so-called  progressive scan to refresh the image.  </P></p>

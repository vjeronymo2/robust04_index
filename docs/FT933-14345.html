			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Garofano to be questioned today MR Giuseppe Garofano, the most important businesman sought in Italy's political corruption scandal, is expected to be interrogated by Milan magistrates in Geneva today. Mr Garofano was arrested by Swiss police on Tuesday evening as he arrived at Geneva airport from Paris. Unconfirmed reports say he was planning to go to Milan to give himself up following contacts between his lawyers and Milan judges. Last night, Mr Garofano was reported to have asked for a week's 'reflection' to decide whether to accept extradition to Italy. Magistrates want to question Mr Garofano, formerly the most senior executive in the troubled Ferruzzi group outside the Ferruzzi family, on three matters. The first is a L250m (Pounds 107,000) donation to the Christian Democrat party, the issue which apparently triggered Mr Garofano's decision to flee. Mr Garofano maintained the money was a personal contribution. However, Milan magistrates, suspecting the money may have come from Ferruzzi, issued a warrant for illegal funding of political parties. Mr Garofano's name has come up in two other investigations since his disappearance. Milan magistrates monitoring the Ferruzzi rescue plan have been investigating the finances of some foreign subsidiaries. Last month, Montedison, Ferruzzi's main industrial arm, shocked shareholders with a L435bn increase in its 1992 group loss to L1,679bn on account of mysterious credits, deemed irrecoverable, by a small Curacao subsidiary. Magistrates may also want to interrogate Mr Garofano on the now-defunct Enimont chemicals joint venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group. A number of executives involved in Enimont, including Mr Raul Gardini, Montedison's former boss, have already been told that they are under investigation. Mr Garofano's detention marks the first time a leading suspect in the corruption scandal has been arrested on an international warrant. Previous suspects have returned to Italy from hiding after lengthy negotiations between the judges and their lawyers.</p>

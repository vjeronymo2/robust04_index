			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Ukraine falls into line on nuclear arms Ukraine's parliament yesterday ratified the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and closed a chapter in the country's hesitant moves to give up for good nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union. The long-awaited vote, passed by a wide margin, looks set to improve often strained relations with the west and Russia. It also marks a significant political victory for President Leonid Kuchma a week before his US summit with President Bill Clinton. Ukraine will formally accede to the 1968 treaty as a non-nuclear state once security assurances from the US, the UK, France and Russia are, as expected, given at next month's CSCE summit in Budapest. Mr Hennady Udovenko, foreign minster, said 'guarantees of political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity' are all but assured from the four NPT nuclear states . The former Soviet republic's ratification also is crucial because Moscow and Washington have delayed carrying out strategic arms reduction treaties until Kiev ratifies the NPT. The world's third largest nuclear power, Ukraine last January gave up its nuclear arsenal under an agreement signed with Russia and the US in exchange for about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 633m) in nuclear fuel supplies and disarmament assistance. Parliament ratified the Start-1 treaty in February; NPT was the last step. The conservative parliament for three years hedged on ratifying NPT, viewed by many nationalists and communists as Ukraine's last bargaining chip, but yesterday's debate was brisk. 'Ratification will make us hostage to politics in other countries - like Russia,' said Mr Oleh Vitkovich, a rightist deputy. But, after only a dozen deputies, Mr Kuchma significantly spoke last. He told the chamber that, as a former director of a nuclear missiles factory, he found the argument for keeping a nuclear deterrent an 'illusion' held by 'false patriots'. 'By signing this treaty, Ukraine shows we don't blackmail the world community,' he said. Although Ukraine inherited 176 inter-continental missiles and 41 strategic bombers - the warheads are now being transferred to Russia - Moscow controlled the launch codes and Kiev lacked both the technology and financing properly to store the weapons or gain control. Ukraine never made nuclear weapons, only missiles, and never reprocessed spent nuclear fuel - although hard-liners claimed it boasted the scientific know-how to do so. Mr Kuchma warned the deputies that developing Ukraine's nuclear capability would require up to Dollars 200bn and help from Russia. The president instead asked for further western aid to dismantle the nuclear weapons. On Tuesday, 14 western states and the European Union promised Dollars 234.38m in disarmament aid on top of Dollars 500m already pledged. The funds are for military conversion, resettling and retraining military personnel, environmental clean-up, missile dismantlement, non-proliferation safeguards and nuclear reactor safety. Earlier this week Mr Kuchma said Russia put further pressure on Ukraine this week by cutting off nuclear fuel supplies - needed to power Ukraine's five nuclear power plants - until Ukraine ratified the NPT, according to news agency Interfax. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Krylov yesterday welcomed the Ukrainian decision. 'This is an extremely positive step, so necessary now for strengthening security and stability in Europe,' he said.</p>

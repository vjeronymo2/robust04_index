			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL SPILL CLEANUP EFFORTS WIND DOWN AS STORM HELPS OUT  </P> <P> Efforts to mop up the Orange County oil spill began to wind down Sunday as work  crews turned their attention to scrubbing boulders and gathering oil-stained  flotsam driven ashore by the weekend storm.  </P> <P> Heavy surf whipped up by the storm appeared to be helping scour oil off jetties  and rock formations along the coastline, authorities said.  </P> <P> "There's still a bit of work to do, but we're out of that high-pressure,  high-impact phase and into the more detailed work," said Chief Warrant Officer  Dan Dwell, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman.  </P> <P> Some oil washed up in a foamy film on the Huntington Beach shoreline, but  workers were finding mostly tar balls no bigger than jellybeans along broad  stretches of the coast.  </P> <P> The American Trader -- the tanker that spilled 394,000 gallons of crude oil  Feb. 7 when it impaled itself on its anchor while attempting to moor off  Huntington Beach -- steamed out of port late Sunday and headed north to a San  Francisco shipyard for further repairs.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Coast Guard officials continued to puzzle over a mysterious oil  sheen that washed ashore during the weekend, raising suspicions that there  might be a new source of leakage.  </P> <P> Coast Guard investigators have yet to determine the origin of the new oil,  which looked different than the crude that gushed from the American Trader.  Officials suspected that the sheen might be from a different source because the  tanker's crude had been drifting southward, while the new oil came ashore  farther to the north.  </P> <P> The mess left by the sheen along a milelong section of Bolsa Chica State Beach  was cleaned up by Sunday afternoon. Several oil samples were sent to the Coast  Guard Oil Identification Laboratory in Groton, Conn., to determine whether it  matched the crude spilled by the tanker.  </P> <P> Dwell said there is speculation that the sheen may have been a small leak from  one of the oil rigs off Huntington Beach or a spill from a tanker pumping its  bilges.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays flew over the remnants of the American Trader  spill Sunday and said he saw only a few oily patches and scattered sections of  sheen in the ocean. But he said cleanup efforts need to keep moving ahead to  ensure the shoreline is returned to its original condition.  </P> <P> "This could become a sticky issue between the city and the companies involved  with this spill," Mays said. "This is going to get down to what they think is  clean, and what we think is clean."  </P> <P> A spokesman for British Petroleum, which owned the oil the American Trader was  transporting, said the firm would stay until the job is done. "We are not going  anywhere until it is all cleaned up," spokesman Tony Kozlowski said.  </P> <P> The second dead dolphin in two days washed ashore, refocusing concerns on the  episode's impact on sea life.  </P> <P> John Heyning, curator of marine mammals at the Los Angeles County Museum of  Natural History, said it remains unclear what caused either dolphin to die,  noting that such "strandings" are normal in Southern California waters. Tests  to determine whether the spill played a part will be performed Tuesday, he  said.  </P> <P> Most affected by the spill has been the coast's bird population. As of Sunday  afternoon, the spill has been blamed for the deaths of 299 birds.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Dan Weikel and Ted Johnson and correspondents Tom McQueeney  and David Burke contributed to this story.  </P></p>

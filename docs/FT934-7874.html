			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Dangerous liaisons - Celebrities can bring instant fame to a brand, but they can also fall from grace Ten years ago Roger Enrico, then president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola, was talking excitedly to the company's chairman, Don Kendall. 'There's this young fellow Michael Jackson. He's a singer and he's very, very hot. And we think we can get him - and his brothers - to be in our advertising. 'I've had them checked out. The reports came back sterling. These people haven't been near alcohol, much less drugs. They're very religious. Very family-oriented. They're not political. I see very little chance of embarrassment for us here.' If Enrico were this week to re-read his words, contained in his 1986 account of the war with rival Coca-Cola, he would surely blush. Over the past few days Pepsi has pulled its multi-million dollar sponsorship of the star's 'Dangerous' concerts as Jackson has abandoned his world tour because of addiction to pain-killers and stress caused by allegations, strongly denied, that he sexually molested a 14-year-old boy. It is not the first time a celebrity has turned into a marketing nightmare: Pepsi has already abandoned commercials in the US featuring pop star Madonna after a furore over a video; the actor Burt Reynolds' divorce petition became an embarrassment to advertisers; and sportsgear endorsements halted abruptly for 'Magic' Johnson, the basketball player, when he announced he was HIV positive. But far from becoming fed up with the extraordinary fees that stars demand for their endorsement of products - and the danger that if a celebrity goes off the rails the brand may go with them - the trend, if anything, is towards the increased use of big names. Kenneth Miles, director general of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, sees the use of celebrities as an extra weapon on a battlefield where differences between brands are not always apparent. The value of using stars has been proven, he claims, particularly when it comes to getting through to young people. Instead of personalities being employed solely in advertisements, they are increasingly being integrated into all aspects of a marketing campaign. Chris Powell, president of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and chief executive of agency BMP DDB Needham, says using a celebrity can have the benefit of giving instant fame to a product but 'the ever-present danger is that it can blow up on you'. As Mike Walsh, Ogilvy and Mather's London chairman puts it, one of advertisers' greatest fears is that 'the celebrity becomes the hero, rather than the product they're marketing'. An example repeatedly mentioned in the industry is the series of advertisements for Cinzano, featuring actors Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter. Some people believe the characters so dwarfed the product that consumers may have had trouble recalling the brand. If the identification of a star with a product is very strong it can also make brand development difficult, says Tom Brannan, a vice-chairman of the Chartered Institute of Marketing and a director of agency Primary Contact. The weening process may need careful thought: for example, when Sony needed to move away from using John Cleese in its ads, it used the 'ingenious' interim device of a robot-style figure which resembled the actor, says Brannan. Personalities, meanwhile, cannot be guaranteed to be the best ambassadors for the products they are paid to promote - contracts therefore need to specify the standards expected, says Powell. The magazine Marketing cites examples of the 'kind of situations that make ad agencies weep': model Jerry Hall saying she used Bovril to clean her boots; Paul Gascoigne, the British footballer and then Brut man, denying he wore aftershave, and English cricketer Ian Botham calling Dansk low-alcohol lager 'gnat's piss'. Clean, but not so squeaky clean to be boring, seems to be the maxim for selecting a celebrity. That most desired attribute of all when marketing to the young - street credibility - was gained by the former sick-bed drink Lucozade when it started using the Olympic athlete Daley Thompson to promote the brand. Thompson's irreverent streak definitely helped, says Walsh, whose agency created the ads. However, sporting personalities bring their own problems. Says Miles: 'They do have a high wear-out rate,' although, carefully chosen, their promotional value can outlast their ability to win medals. Michael Jordan, the basketball player, earned about Dollars 32m (Pounds 23m) last year, according to Forbes magazine, from promoting a range of products including Nike shoes. He will continue his activities in retirement, even if the ads are modified to take account of his less-active status. One tip from Dominic Mills, editor of the UK advertising weekly Campaign, is to spot a celebrity early: 'If you get them before they're really famous you can ride on their back.' It is also possible, presumably, to benefit from less-inflated fees. Actor Paul Hogan's link-up with Foster's is a good example, says Mills. Hogan only moved from cult to mass-market status with Crocodile Dundee, which came after the first Foster's ads. In selecting a celebrity, says Brannan, it is also very important for companies to analyse which values they are trying to build into their brand. For example, Sir Robert Mark, the former UK Metropolitan Police commissioner, is a good choice to promote the trustworthiness of Goodyear tyres. Beware, says Powell, loose connections between celebrities and brands  -'borrowed interest', as he calls it. That close fit is exactly what Pepsi had for a number of years with Jackson. Jay Coleman, an arranger of deals between rock stars and corporations, brought the idea of Jackson to Pepsi. As reported in Enrico's book, Coleman says as part of his sales pitch: 'Cars, liquor - for a dreamy, clean-living kid like Michael, these make no sense. He needs a product that's soft, cuddly, harmless and fun. And that's soda.' And that, even if every letter of advice from the experts is followed, is celebrities - potentially high rewards, with the inevitable high risks to match.</p>

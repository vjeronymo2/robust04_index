			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Seoul and Pyongyang Should Be Avoided"] </F>   [Text] It is our opinion that the designation of Seoul and  Pyongyang as the venue for a North-South summit should be  avoided. In other words, Seoul and Pyongyang should be avoided  as the venue for the summit unless the North-South summit is  held merely for the sake of talks. If President Kim Yong-sam  visits Pyongyang, North Korea will report that "South Korea's  Kim Yong-sam came to Pyongyang, the capital of the chuche  revolution." And if Kim Il-song comes to Seoul, Kim Il-song  himself will not be very pleased with his visit. Besides, North  Korea, in its Pyongyang television network, will give enormous  publicity to the banners of the students from the National  Federation of University Student Councils [Hanchongnyon] and  Kwangju-South Cholla Province District Alliance of University  Student Councils [Namchongnyon], and members of the so-called  Chuche Idea Faction [Chusapa] in South Korea, who warmly welcome  "their leader's triumphal entry into Seoul." These two  anticipated events are not desirable for the productivity of the  talks.    What we are furthermore concerned about is the possibility  that the talks may end up with external splendor but with no  internal substance. This is because we are not sure about Kim  Il-song's true intention and because "spectators" may dramatize  the talks as the "greatest show on the earth." Truly, the talks  this time should be held in a sincere atmosphere, should proceed  in a substantive manner from the beginning to the end, and  should advance toward the settlement of problems without  becoming a show. To attain this, commotions over parties and  ceremonies, making empty speeches, toasts, picture taking,  spectators' racket, sightseeing, reporting of amusing gossip and  stories, performance of stage shows, dinners hosted by mayors of  Seoul and Pyongyang, and other show-like events, as seen in the  past, should be totally excluded. This type of talks should not  be attempted from the onset.    Instead, the top leaders of the two sides should meet in a  secluded villa or a country house in Mt. Sorak in the South and  Mt. Kumgang in the North, and in-depth discussions should be  held calmly on key points of essential issues without having any  banquet and delivering speeches. In addition, the attempt of  so-called well-known figures and VIP's wishing to join the  event, should be thoroughly blocked. For this, it is furthermore  necessary for the two top leaders to hold a calm, substantive  meeting in a place far from the capital sphere.    Thus, we hope that during the 28 June preliminary contact  the  two sides will designate a third place for a summit, other than  Seoul and Pyongyang, and will agree to have only officials  concerned attend the event and not hold festival-like events by  inviting unnecessary celebrities. If they really want to have  some people attend the site, it whould better to invite  children. We wish to see that sincere talks be held in a plain  and even pious atmosphere by excluding spectators.</p>

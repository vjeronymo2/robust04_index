			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Guideline for Cooked, Ready-to-Eat Fishery Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix A for cooked,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ready-to-eat fishery products. These products possess an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elevated microbiological risk relative to most other seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products because they are cooked as part of processing and do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normally receive any additional cooking by consumers before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption. Consequently, to be safe, these products must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essentially pathogen-free by the time they leave the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. Immediate refrigeration at proper temperatures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the growth of pathogens is also essential for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, which are not shelf-stable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guideline addresses critical control points that apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to these products as a class and that thus will typically be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in the HACCP plans of most processors of cooked,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ready-to-eat products. The guideline also addresses ways of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling hazards at each critical control point. Processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cooked, ready-to-eat products that are also smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products should apply the controls set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix 1. If FDA adopts that regulation, it will codify it in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserved subpart B of part 123.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This guideline is not relevant to most of the cooked, ready-to-eat products that are processed as low acid canned foods under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 113. However, the recommendations in Appendix A, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. a., b., and d. for cooling, processing after cooking, and refrigerated storage, will apply to those low acid canned foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are cooked, processed, and then cooked again.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guideline provides information on how to control the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. aureus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> during the processing step between cooks. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also addresses the control of microbiological hazards that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur within the processing environment for cooked, ready-to-eat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. It does not address nonprocessing hazards, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are not relevant to this class of products. FDA intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publish separate guidance that will, among other things, address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprocessing hazards. Likewise, this guideline will not address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nonsafety hazards, such as decomposition that is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with human illness and economic adulteration, that FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has suggested in proposed &sect;123.6(c) should be covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plan. These hazards will also be covered in the separately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published guidance. Economic adulteration, for example, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in Appendix D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has tentatively decided to address the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls for cooked, ready-to-eat products in a guideline, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than by regulation, to permit flexibility in the face of changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing technologies and knowledge. As stated earlier in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble, the guidelines are intended to advise processors about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what FDA believes will be acceptable in a HACCP plan. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledges, however, that there are basic processing norms to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which conscientious processors adhere, and that these norms are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not likely to change for the foreseeable future. FDA therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comments on whether any or all of the guideline on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooked, ready-to-eat products ought to be codified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in part 123 if it is adopted as a final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Thermal Processing: Cooking and Pasteurization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Processes and Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed guideline in Appendix A, section 4 advises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors on how to ensure that: (1) Their cooking and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pasteurization processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (2) their cooking and pasteurization equipment is adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to deliver their cooking and pasteurization processes. A cooking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process is, in essence, the temperature and time at that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature that will both kill pathogens and create a marketable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product. A pasteurization process is the temperature and time at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature that is necessary to reduce the numbers of pathogens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the point where they will not cause harm over the shelf life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a refrigerated product. It is essential that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> type E not survive the pasteurization process for cooked, ready-to-eat products that are packed in hermetically sealed containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and held at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 52). Such containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are typically vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged and thus can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a good environment for the growth of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> type E.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To meet the requirements in part 123, subpart A, processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must have assurance that their cooking and pasteurization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens and must document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this assurance in their HACCP records. This approach is similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to that in the regulations for low acid canned foods, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that processors of those products know that their thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes are adequate to destroy  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The low acid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canned food regulations do not specify to processors what their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time/temperature parameters must be in order to destroy those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogens. There are simply too many variables and possibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with regard to thermal processing parameters for this kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specificity in those regulations to be practical or appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather, the regulations require that processors use a thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process that is at least equivalent to one established by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competent process authority, i.e., a third party who has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise to determine the parameters of a thermal process that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will destroy pathogens (Ref. 85).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach has served the consuming public, the agency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the industry well over the years. FDA is therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommending in proposed Appendix A, section 4. a.1. and b.1. that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors utilize the services of process authorities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish the parameters of their cooking and pasteurization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "guideline address" by President Liamine Zeroual </F> to the Council of Ministers on 18 April in Algiers--recorded]    [Text] At the presidency of the Republic, head of state  Liamine Zeroual today chaired the first meeting of the Council  of Ministers since the appointment of the new prime minister,  Mr. Mokdad Sifi. It should be mentioned that Mr. Sifi's  government consists of 29 ministers, and among its priorities  are the consolidation of the state institutions, reviving the  national economy, and promoting national solidarity. Concerning  the issues tabled at the meeting of the Council of Ministers  today, the official spokesman for the presidency, Mr. Mihoub,  said the following:    On the occasion of this first meeting with the government  chaired by Mr. Mokdad Sifi, the head of state, made the  following guideline address:    In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. On the  occasion of this meeting of the Council of Ministers, I cannot,  to begin with, but greet and express my personal gratitude to  Mr. Redha Malek, the previous prime minister, and all the  members of his team for their commitment and loyalty in serving  our country. In addressing you, ministers, I congratulate you  for your selection, and I express to you and the prime minister  my sincerest wishes of success in the mission entrusted to you.    The appointment of your government comes within the  framework  of establishing the institutions that will be in charge of the  realization of the objectives of the transitional stage, the  objectives mentioned by the platform agreed by the national  conference. In this framework come all the activities already  started in the recent weeks, as well as the directives I gave at  the two previous meetings of the Council of Ministers, which I  recall today. I have already had the occasion to define the  problems that were the cause of the crisis faced by our country.  In addition to the known political causes and the deterioration  of the foreign monetary resources, there was a laissez-faire in  management and lack of clarity of objectives.    Such deviations faciliated the emergence of calamities in  the  apparatus of the state, such as bureaucracy, despotism,  injustice, and nepotism. Such deviations also reduced contact  between officials and permitted the absence of officials in the  field of work, as well as the marginalization and instability of  the cadres. The break with past practices, which remain our  basic objective, lies in eliminating these manifestations and  practices, and this can be brought about only with the carrying  out of a radical change in the state's structures which, in the  future, must obey new rules.    Effectively, the work we are doing to bring about national  reconciliation and definitively uproot terrorism and violence  from our society must be necessarily accompanied by the  strengthening of the state's institutions, the rehabilitation of  the civil service, and the setting up of sound relations between  the citizens and the administration, which must be in their  service. In this respect, the mobilization of officials at all  levels is an urgent necessity to guarantee the follow-up and the  realization of decisions, and to perform the job of control, and  therefore restore full credibility to the public institutions.  In this respect, there must be reforms that give a fresh breath  to the civil service sector.    The credibility of the public institutions also requires  them  to lead by example in reducing the state's expenditure and  practicing austerity. This credibility also requires combating  bribery, speculation, and smuggling with seriousness and  determination. The law must be implemented strictly within the  framework of the respect of individual and collective liberties.    In the field of communication, the government has got to  exert a considerable effort. The media, which will receive a  lot of attention, should be mobilized so as to carry out its  fundamental role, which consists in serving the higher interests  of the citizens and conveying their concerns to the state.    The media, whose variety is considered as one of the gains  of  democracy, should play its role in consolidating this  achievement and defending the higher interests of the homeland,  whatever source is harming them. Freedom of expression means  the responsible transmitting of sincere information away from  any deceptions and conspiracies.    It is also our duty to devote a bigger share of attention to  promote our national culture. It is indisputable that our  deep-rooted cultural heritage is considered a property of the  Algerians and a strong factor in the unity and progress of our  people.    A comprehensive program for our national culture must be set  up to recover the true position of this sector in our society.  The success of all these tasks demands the utmost care in  choosing officials at all levels of the state apparatus. As you  know, the state has concluded an agreement with the IMF. We  will be vigilant in implementing this agreement in our concern  that it should bring benefits to citizens and in reviving the  national economy.    Within this framework I accord every importance to the  temporary burdens ensuing from this agreement will be borne  equitably by all strata of society and to implementing social  protection programs that are accompanied by effective  implementation.    The national solidarity, which constitutes a tradition and  is  one of the demands of our people, must be reinforced more and  more particularly for the benefit of the most deprived groups.  Within the same context, some sectors of the national economy  that I have previously touched upon must receive special care  and be given priority in the government's efforts. This matter  is related to the hydrocarbons, housing and agriculture sectors,  small and medium enterprises, and trade. These priorities will  allow the exploitation of the positive effects of the agreement  with the IMF to activate the national economic apparatus, meet  the requirements of the citizens, and create new jobs.    We must also work to mobilize as many as possible of the  country's resources, including the tourism sector, which will  play a considerable role in developing the national economic  wealth.    Furthermore, the implementation of the agreement with the  IMF comes within the framework of a structural reform process in  connection with the national economy. This process should be  continued and consolidated, especially in the sphere of  industrial restructuring, and this sector should be opened up to  partnership.    It is obvious that all these operations, which require the  government's utmost attention, will be better implemented by  delegating them to the local authorities. The state is also  represented by the wali, the head of the district, and the head  of the municipal executive body.    Within this framework we should rehabilitate the local  communities, whose contribution to a coherent development of the  country is indisputable. These tasks will achieve better  success if they are carried out within the framework of an  intensive consultation with social partners. As far as this is  concerned, the creation of the National Social and Economic  Council, which should be initiated as soon as possible, will  contribute to promoting consultation between the state and its  social partners.    Finally, this program will receive more popular support if  it  is effectively explained to show clearly that this program  requires temporary sacrifices, and that its aim, in the final  assessment, is to revive national development and to produce  opportunity for the creative resources, particularly the youth,  to whom the horizons of the future will be opened, and toward  which they can legitimately aspire to.    Those are some of the directives your government program  will  focus on. The program should be prepared as soon as possible,  because the state will not restore the citizens' trust unless it  honors the commitments it undertook and provides tangible deeds.    No doubt that consultation, unity of action, consistency of  address, and the daily follow up of major issues are among the  requirements for the success of your program, and of the  materialization of the objectives which we have set for  ourselves.    Solidarity and harmony will be two conditions necessary in  order to carry out our task.    Here ends the directives of the head of state presented  before the Council of Ministers. Thank you.

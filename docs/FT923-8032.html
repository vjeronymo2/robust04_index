			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Besieged Sudanese town 'threatened by starvation' NEARLY 300,000 people trapped in the besieged southern Sudanese garrison town of Juba face starvation after international food airlifts were suspended last month, foreign aid agencies said, Reuter reports from London. 'It is feared that unless a regular food pipeline into Juba is established urgently a large proportion of the population will starve,' said a report issued yesterday after a meeting of international aid agencies in Juba on Tuesday. The report by Britain's Oxfam, Christian Aid and Cafod (Christian Fund for Overseas Development) and the Norwegian Church Aid group said the city's 293,000 people had run out of food and 'face imminent starvation'. The population of the city, 1,300 km south of the capital Khartoum, has been swollen by refugees from Sudan's nine-year civil war. The report said airlifts had been intermittent during early July and since July 18 no flights carrying food for civilians had been allowed to land at Juba, southern Sudan's main town. The mainly Christian-animist Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) has been fighting the Khartoum government since 1983 over what it sees as Moslem domination of Sudan. It wants a referendum in the non-Moslem south and other marginal areas, with the option of separation. The agencies appealed to the government and SPLA to approve a resumption of the UN relief flights and establish safe corridors out of Juba for civilian evacuation .</p>

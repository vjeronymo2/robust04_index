			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Peugeot to start car assembly in Egypt PEUGEOT, the French car maker, has signed an agreement to start assembly in Egypt - the fruit of 11 years of tortuous negotiations. The group has set up a 51 per cent-owned joint venture with its Egyptian distributor, CDC Waguih Abaza, and with the local subsidiaries of two French banks to make up to 10,000 cars a year for an initial investment of FFr10m (Pounds 1.04m) at an existing Jeep plant near Cairo. Peugeot is the latest car group to show interest in Egypt since the improvement in the country's creditworthiness after last year's accord by the IMF and World Bank to forgive half its official debt. This is also the latest step in Peugeot's campaign to expand production in developing markets, after a similar accord in Poland in the spring, and the start-up of production of medium-sized 405 saloons in Argentina in May. The Egyptian venture will also make 405s, with production due to start later next year, at an initial annual output of 1,500 cars, with full production in four years. The plant, owned by Arab American Vehicles, a joint venture between Chrysler and a consortium of Arab investors, currently makes Jeeps for the Egyptian army. Peugeot plans to include 20 per cent of locally-made components in the first year, building up to 30 per cent in year two. To help build up local content, Peugeot is encouraging French component makers such as Valeo to strike co-operation accords with Egyptian suppliers. Peugeot's competitors include General Motors, which makes commercial vehicles in Egypt and recently signed an accord to make medium-sized cars. Citroen is negotiating for a local assembly accord, as are Suzuki of Japan and Hyundai of South Korea. Egypt has recently given the go-ahead for other car-making joint ventures. General Motors Egypt, which already builds light trucks, is to produce passenger cars beginning next year. Egypt Suzuki will assemble mini-vans and trucks. A group of Egyptian businessmen plans to build Russian Aleko passenger cars.</p>

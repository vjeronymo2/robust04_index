			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rustam Arifdzhanov under the rubric "Provincial </F> Life": "The Reforms As a Sight To See in Nizhniy Novgorod:  Chernomyrdin, Chubays, and Zaveryukha Flew to Nizhniy To Witness  the Local Experiments"]    [Text] Three weeks before the Russian leaders arrived here,  British Prime Minister John Major walked along the former  Sverdlov Street, which is now Bolshaya Pokrovka, drank some  champagne in the Heraldic Hall of the restored building of the  Nizhniy Novgorod trade fair, and admired the reforms.    What is happening in the old and glorious Volga city, why  are  the inquisitive and the curious flying here from all nearby  krays and oblasts and from distant countries across the ocean  (they have even begun to publish a local newspaper in English,  NIZHNIY NOVGOROD TIMES--so what, there is a demand)?  <H5>  Nemtsov, the Governor </H5>   It is clear to everyone that the reforms came from Nemtsov.  A  senior scientific associate at Gorkiy Scientific Research  Institute, the radiophysics techie occupied a main Nizhniy  Novgorod office on the wave of the antinuclear rally movement.    In August 1991 a remarkable photograph was published  throughout the world press--next to the favorite of the Russians  and our first president was a tall person with white teeth  wearing the most fashionable long coat and a no less fashionable  scarf.    They said that it was he, Nemtsov, who had come on Yeltsin's  behalf to reach an agreement with the Taman Division concerning  support, and they did agree. The Taman members turned away from  the supporters of the State Committee for the State of  Emergency. Thus Nemtsov became Yeltsin's local representative in  Nizhniy Novgorod and then at the same time head of the  administration, and the session of the oblast council decreed  that he be called governor from then on.    Nemtsov passed the test of power. Moreover, in the opinion  of  the majority of people who know him, he grew into a serious  politician far above the local level. Three important things  took place with him. He did not stagnate, he did not cease to be  the people's favorite, and he did not dress himself in the armor  of a highly placed boss surrounded by a retinue of yes men (in  Rus', alas, there have always been as many examples of this as  you may wish). That is the first thing.    He did not become the mouthpiece, the arm, the eye, and  everything else of the Moscow leaders, afraid of his own opinion  and his own obstinacy. And, third, he is constantly growing,  seeking, and he is not afraid of trying things.    I will not say that among the Russian governors, provincial  presidents, and members of the Council of the Federation, Boris  Nemtsov is the most respected. But that he is the most noticed  and, perhaps, the most energetic--there is no doubt.  <H5>  Yavlinskiy, the Reformer </H5>   People speak about the great friendship between Boris  Nemtsov  and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, which goes back almost to before they  can remember. This is hardly true. The distance between the  deputy chairman of the Silayev Council of Ministers and the  young Nizhniy Novgorod deputy was fairly significant in those  days. But they felt a sympathy for one another. They even look a  little bit alike, not to mention the similarity of their manner  of thinking, communicating, and making decisions.    Therefore it was no accident when Yavlinskiy's ideas were  not  called for after the first visit of Gaydar and his team of  "Chicago boys" that the theretofore fashionable economist with a  group of his own "boys" from the "EPItsentr" which he organized  set out for Nizhniy Novgorod. "Capitalism with a Yavlinskiy  face" was constructed in Nizhniy in a year and a half and the  program called "Nizhniy Novgorod EPIlog" was implemented.    The experiment in small-scale and medium-scale privatization  in the Nizhniy Novgorod area was deemed most successful. The  privatization of the trucks was especially successful. At the  time when the State Automotive Inspection had not introduced the  new Russian numbers and it was possible to tell from the  combination of numbers and letters who owned the motor  vehicle--a private party or the state--and the travelers along  the local roads were struck by the abundance of "private"  numbers on the trucks.    And here, unlike other Russian oblasts, they rejected the  coupon system for distribution of products. The prices were  liberalized. They turned out to be higher than their neighbors'  and the "product delivery line" was spontaneous, changing  according to the laws of the market, turned in the direction of  Nizhniy. But at the same time in the oblast wages remained about  10-15 percent higher than their neighbors'. The neighbors  complained, groaned about "local prejudice" and "selfishness,"  but because of this Nizhniy lived better than the others.    There were mistakes as well. For instance, they decided to  introduce something like their own money--this was when Russia  was gripped by the "cash" crisis, to which the Gaydar government  proceeded deliberately, trying thus to control the operation of  the printing press. The oblast money, which even before it  appeared was christened "Yavlinki," fortunately, was not needed.  They did without it.    Attracted by Yavlinskiy's name, foreign specialists were  also  drawn to the city, first simply to look, and then to help.  <H5>  Anthony Doran, `Missionary' </H5>   All right, Yavlinskiy did not go very far when he left  Moscow. Specialists came here from America and England to help  "push" the reforms. Anthony Doran, a specialist from the  International Financial Corporation, lived in the Volga city for  almost a year. He had a whole group of advisers along with him.    Practically free of charge, which Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin emphasized, and sometimes, to be honest, at their  own expense, the Englishmen and Americans helped to privatize  the sovkhozes and kolkhozes in the remote Nizhniy Novgorod area.    You might say that things were not going very well in  Russia.  Yes, the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes were transformed into  joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships, and  farmers appeared in some places. But so what? The farmers were  moaning and groaning and even intending to leave. The  joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships were  new in name only--they used the former methods and the results  were lamentable.    And here another good friend of Chernomyrdin (apparently for  this reason), the country's chief agrarian, Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, almost caused the relations that had developed in  rural areas to break down prematurely. It was a matter of acting  without thinking. The Russian individual is special, and our  path is special. So just give us more credit for the branch and  we will respond with a harvest. The credit was given. This kept  Zaveryukha quiet for a time. Then they asked for some more. They  did not give him enough, and so the harvest did not turn out.    Chernomyrdin took Zaveryukha along with him to Nizhniy  Novgorod. But he also took the minister of agriculture, Viktor  Khlystun, a person who was undoubtedly more progressive.    What did the "missionary"--and you could not call him  anything else--Anthony Doran, show them?    In the village of Kovrigno the Kolkhoz imeni 60-Letiye  Oktyabrya was coming off the auction block. The auction was  conducted according to a plan developed by Doran and his men.    First they divided all the kolkhoz land and all the property  together into actual land and property shares. Everyone living  on the kolkhoz received equal rights to shares of land.  Depending on their work tenure and wages, each one received a  property share as well. And the old pensioners became almost the  richest ones when things were divided up--they had been working  there for decades.    Then they began to combine the shares. Anyone who wanted to  work as an individual--who was tired of cooking in the common  pot--he kept his share. Anyone who was thinking about a  farmer-run or peasant farm, joined together with relatives or  close friends.    The rest of the people were divided into three groups. They  turned their shares over for leasing or to the former chairman,  or to the chief agronomist and economist. It was possible to  reach an agreement on money as well, but the villagers preferred  payment in kind--wood for a year, milk every week, a worthy  burial. That was also possible.    This was not the first privatization according to the new  plan in the oblast. One kolkhoz and one sovkhoz had been  transformed this way before that. And if in Kovrigno there was  not a single person who would sell his share forever, in other  villages there were also "seasonal workers." They were tired of  being tied to the land. One old lady sold here certificates  (they were given to everyone) for so many cases of vodka. That  was her right.  <H5>  Makarycheva, the Chairman </H5>   Eight potential buyers came to trade at the auction, which  was attended not only by the government, but also by 37  governors and administration chiefs from regions of Russia.  There were two private property owners. Two farmers. Three  future leaders of mixed companies (those same chairmen,  agronomists, and economists) and the chief specialist of a  former kolkhoz who was thinking about creating the limited  liability partnership Tekhservis. The land was divided up  peacefully and, from all indications, long before the auction  itself took place.    But at the property auction they were pounding the gavel  constantly. They were vying, as it were, for each tractor and  each truck. There was bidding for the cow barn, the sheep farm,  the cows, and the sheep. Whoever offered more, whoever was more  resolute, whoever had calculated more precisely the package of  property shares.    The economist Yekaterina Nikolayevna Makarycheva, now  chairman of the mixed partnership Moshkinskoye, left the auction  satisfied. She did not manage to buy everything she wanted;  there were not enough warm garages for agricultural equipment,  but, all right, it was possible to reach an agreement to pay for  their use.    But Chernomyrdin was perhaps even more satisfied with the  auction than Makarycheva was. Thus he said, looking the  representatives of the other components of the Federation in the  eyes: "We shall use the Nizhniy Novgorod experiment as a basis  for a Russia-wide national program for privatization in rural  areas."  <H5>  Yefremov, the Economist </H5>   Big-time politics had turned Yavlinskiy's head. He left  Nizhniy Novgorod. Some of his team also took deputy seats in the  State Duma.    The reforms in Nizhniy Novgorod were now in the hands of the  deputy leader of the oblast department of economics and  prognostication, Vladimir Yefremov. The boy from Vyatka (the  neighboring oblast), he received his professorial robes in the  American city of Springfield. Yefremov links his views on the  reforms and their success primarily to the rise of industry.    They had already determined their priorities for the  development of the oblast economy. They "went" to the government  with a proposal to grant the oblast "defense industry" an  investment tax credit for payments into the federal budget, they  developed a system of bills of exchange for Ministry of Defense  debts to the enterprises, and they are beginning to create a  fund for supporting the enterprises on the basis of commercial  banks for financing the development of production in keeping  with the established priorities. And there are many more  proposals. The oblast administration has already adopted decrees  regarding all of them.    Chernomyrdin read it, shook his head--interesting!--and  suggested: Get together with Shokhin and Soskovets and think  about what can be used at the federal level.    After the departure of the Moscow guests, the telephone in  the office of affairs of the oblast administration started  ringing off the hook with long distance calls: We are coming to  see what interesting things you have there.</p>

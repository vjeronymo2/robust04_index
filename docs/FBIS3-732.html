They also expressed the need to further enhance such  cooperation for the benefit of the two countries.    In a joint communique issued at the end of President  Mugabe's  four-day state visit to Botswana, the two presidents called for  more efforts to be put in exploring other areas of cooperation,  in particular the tourism sector. They also resolved to  undertake measures, including the increase of border posts to  facilitate legal and unhindered movement across the common  border, and to make joint border patrols to curb illegal border  crossings and cattle rustling. The communique says President  Mugabe has expressed Zimbabwe's appreciation for the generous  gesture by Botswana in giving that country a part of her quota  of beef exports to the European Community for 1993.    The heads of state commended the mediation efforts in the  now  subsided conflict in Lesotho by the international community,  including Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. On South Africa  Sir Ketumile and Mr. Mugabe welcomed the positive steps by  Inkatha Freedom Party Leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi to  register provisionally for the forthcoming South African  elections scheduled for next month. They expressed hope that  the rightwing parties will also join the negotiation process and  participate in the forthcoming elections. The communique says  the two presidents called for national reconciliation and  appealed to the international community for humanitarian  assistance for the Angolan people.    On the situation in Somalia the two presidents noted with  concern the decision by Western governments to withdraw their  troops from Somalia, observing that the international community  has an obligation to help the Somali people while conflict  remained unresolved. They also discussed the conflict in Sudan,  Liberia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina and the suffering inflicted on  the people.</p>

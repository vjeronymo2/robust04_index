			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] By demanding "varied wages," the Bundesbank has made  a clear statement against the background of the current wage  disputes. "In order to do justice to the different conditions in  the individual sectors and regions, wages must be varied.  Regions with weak infrastructures in both eastern and western  Germany require a lower wage level than strong regions, not  least because job opportunities must be improved," the  Bundesbank's latest monthly report states.    One of the reasons it considers such a variation in wages  justifiable is "that the cost of living in the individual  regions varies." Thus, housing costs -- be it for one's own or  rented accommodation -- are "much lower in areas with a weak  infrastructure than in prospering urban areas." Wages in  eastern Germany are reported to have been 80 percent of the west  German average at the end of 1993. "This means that the  catching-up process should slowly be coming to an end."    The Bundesbank is still very cautious about evaluating  economic trends. "The basic trend of the west German economy  continues to be in a trough; recession has not been completely  overcome." The Bundesbank considers "mainly domestic factors  responsible" for the continuing sluggishness. Thus, in private  households, "higher incomes are more than used up by price  increases and increases in taxes and contributions." There is,  therefore, "no financial room" to fulfill any additional wishes  consumers might have.    The Bundesbank considers investment behavior still impaired  by "declining business profits, a lack of positive future  outlook, as well as a continuing low capacity utilization."  Capacity utilization is so low at the moment that  rationalization projects rather than investments seem to be the  priority." In "the otherwise rather gloomy economic landscape,"  the guardians of the currency see rays of hope in the fields of  housing construction and foreign demand.    Even if the expected upswing were to take place, they do not  expect the labor market to relax yet. "Companies' adjustment to  the lower level of activity has not yet been completed." In  December, 610,000 fewer people were in gainful employment in  western Germany than the previous year; at a seasonally adjusted  2.5 million, the number of unemployed was some 480,000 above the  1992 figure. A positive development is the slowing-down of  price increases, the Bundesbank says: Taking out the mineral  oil tax increase, "seasonally adjusted consumer prices only went  up at an annual 2.5 percent over the last six months."    The monthly report notes a "continuing vigorous economic  growth," in eastern Germany, which has also reached the  processing industry. Although new products and improved  production methods have made east German businesses more  competitive in Germany, they have not yet been able to gain a  sufficient foothold in foreign markets." The Bundesbank  considers the level of economic activity in the new laender  "still low." Yet, job cuts are coming to an end, it says.</p>

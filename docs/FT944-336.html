			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Force for growth at Renault - Obituary of Pierre Dreyfus Pierre Dreyfus, the former chairman of Renault who died on December 25 at the age of 87, was one of France's most influential post-war industrialists and a driving force behind the expansion of the state-owned motor company. When Dreyfus took charge in 1955, Renault had an annual production of 200,000 vehicles. When he stepped down 20 years later the production lines were delivering 1.4m vehicles a year. Behind the numbers lay a series of innovative and successful products. The Renault 4, Renault 16 and Renault 5 all left the drawing board during Dreyfus' chairmanship. All achieved significant commercial success, with the Renault 5, of which more than 5m were built, becoming Europe's best-selling car in the early 1980s. As Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's current chairman, put it: 'Under Pierre Dreyfus' chairmanship, Renault was to produce a series of models that would count as some of the greatest successes of the European motor industry.' Dreyfus was also behind international expansion in the company's sales. By the time he bequeathed management of the company to his successor Mr Bernard Vernier-Palliez, Renault was deriving half of its turnover from abroad. This was achieved in spite of significant problems in the US in the late 1960s, which ultimately led to Renault's withdrawal from the market. As well as his industrial achievements at Renault, Dreyfus will be remembered for his development of social policy and trade union relations at the company. Following its nationalisation after the second world war, Renault became a showcase of state ownership and a crucible of social policy. Dreyfus was responsible for many of the achievements in that sphere and for a series of innovations which became widely adopted throughout French industry. In particular, he introduced in 1955 the first collective bargaining pay agreement at the company. In 1962, he announced the move to four weeks' paid holiday a year. During his tenure at Renault, the company was commonly referred to as 'a shop window' for French industrial policy. At the centre of this description lay the close management consultation with the communist-led union the Confederation Generale du Travail. The important role held by the unions, however, and the CGT in particular, was to became a substantial obstacle to Renault after Dreyfus' departure. During the late 1970s and 1980s a series of strikes and union opposition to restructuring and efficiency measures were principal factors in the company's decline into the red. Restructuring measures have now been implemented, and Renault has joined the ranks of the world's most profitable motor groups. Dreyfus' achievements during his tenure at Renault drew the attention of French political leaders and prompted a return to the political arena, where he had started his career as a civil servant in the 1930s. In 1981 he was appointed industry minister in the Socialist government of Mr Pierre Mauroy, the prime minister, and was responsible for implementing the administration's nationalisation programme. Ironically, given Dreyfus' position as a champion of nationalised industry, his death coincides with Renault's move towards the private sector. A partial privatisation earlier this year is expected to be followed in 1995 by the end of state control.</p>

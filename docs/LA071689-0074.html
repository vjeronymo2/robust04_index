			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it will swap its 22% stake in  Italian computer maker Olivetti for a large holding in Carlo de Benedetti's  main industrial holding company. The announcement ends speculation that  AT&amp;T would sell its Olivetti stake because of differences that emerged a  year ago over the firms' industrial alliance formed in December, 1983. Under  the new agreement, AT&amp;T is selling to De Benedetti's Italian holding firm  Compagnie Industriali Riunite 100 million Olivetti shares at a price of $8.31  each, for a total of $832 million. Then, AT&amp;T will buy 182.5 million CIR  shares, also to total $832 million.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CHUMASH TO SUGGEST NAME FOR WILDERNESS;  </P> <P> INDIANS: AN ESTIMATED 200 TRIBE MEMBERS WILL VOTE TONIGHT. ORGANIZERS SAY THE  MEETING MIGHT HELP FOSTER MORE SELF-AWARENESS AND UNITY.  </P> <P> In what is predicted to be the tribe's largest gathering in memory, the Chumash  Indians are scheduled to meet tonight to recommend a Chumash name for a  proposed national wilderness area in northern Ventura County.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's been a gathering like this ever," said Patrick Tumamait  of Ojai, a Chumash who helped organize the meeting. He said 250 flyers have  been sent to Chumash Indians and to people and organizations active in other  tribes, and he said more than 200 members of the tribe are expected to attend.  </P> <P> The wilderness proposal is stalled in Congress, so a decision on what to name  the area may be of little consequence. But Tumamait and others active in Indian  affairs say that just having such a meeting may foster more self-awareness and  unity among the Chumash people.  </P> <P> "This is what we are trying to do," said Connie Diaz of Oxnard, who said she  has spread the word about the meeting to fellow Chumash. "We should all band  together.  </P> <P> "But it's hard to get a lot of Indian people out, really," she added. "Years  ago, many people who were Indian didn't want to be Indian. They wanted to be  Mexican or whatever other nationality they were mixed with. So much had  happened to the Indian people."  </P> <P> An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 Chumash inhabited Ventura, Santa Barbara and San  Luis Obispo counties as far inland as Bakersfield when Spanish explorers  arrived in the 18th Century. European diseases decimated the Chumash, and many  who survived were forced to abandon their culture.  </P> <P> Today, about 200 Chumash live on a reservation in Santa Ynez, about 20 miles  north of Santa Barbara, and an estimated 3,000 others of Chumash descent are  scattered throughout Southern California, about 1,000 in Ventura County.  Several Chumash from the reservation plan to attend the meeting Sunday,  according to Tony Romero, a Chumash spokesman there.  </P> <P> Tumamait and others involved in Indian affairs say the Chumash are not  organized, and, until recently, most people thought of them only when a  developer uncovered a Chumash burial site.  </P> <P> "The Chumash as a live culture have only gotten attention in the past few  years," Tumamait said. Sunday's meeting "would add to that," he said.  </P> <P> Bruce Stenslie, deputy director of the Candelaria American Indian Council, an  Oxnard-based agency that operates a number of Indian programs, sees another  benefit to the meeting.  </P> <P> "What's nice about this is, it should be an opportunity for the Chumash to  rally around something that's not divisive, not controversial," Stenslie said.  </P> <P> Disputes have arisen over the use of Chumash Indians as monitors when  developers or government contractors disturb Chumash archeological sites. The  monitors, who earn as much as $20 an hour, are supposed to make sure that human  remains, among other things, are handled properly.  </P> <P> Some Chumash have charged that non-Indians who claim to be Chumash have  received many of the lucrative jobs, that even many Chumash monitors are  untrained, and that monitors occasionally have let developers cut corners at  sacred sites.  </P> <P> At Sunday's meeting, anyone who claims to be a Chumash will be allowed to vote,  said Robert Peterson, an organizer of the meeting who also is a director of the  Ventura-based Native American Indian Inter-Tribal Assn.  </P> <P> Only Chumash will vote on the proposed names, Tumamait and Peterson said, but  members of any tribe, and even non-Indians, are welcome at the meeting, which  is scheduled to start at 6:30 p.m. at the inter-tribal association's  headquarters at Washington School, 96 South MacMillan Ave.  </P> <P> Tumamait and Peterson helped set up the meeting after the Sierra Club asked for  a Chumash recommendation on what to call the proposed wilderness area. Under  legislation that has passed the House of Representatives and is pending in the  Senate, a 378,000-acre expanse of the Los Padres National Forest would be  protected as a wilderness area.  </P> <P> Sally M. Reid, a national director of the Sierra Club, said the environmental  group wanted a Chumash name because the Hispanic name now proposed -- the San  Aemigdio Mesa Wilderness Area, after a prominent topographical feature --  seemed inappropriate.  </P> <P> "This is a very important area to the Chumash Indians," Reid said.  </P> <P> Tumamait agreed. "There are burial sites, village sites, lots of rock paintings  in the area," he said.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), who sponsored the wilderness bill, told  Reid to make sure that the Chumash were involved in selecting a name. Reid met  with Tumamait and other Chumash leaders in early March, and Tumamait  volunteered to come back Sunday with possible names.  </P> <P> He said suggestions came from his father, Vincent Tumamait, a respected Chumash  elder who is active in education programs about the tribe and has one of the  few reference works that list some Chumash words and their meanings.  </P> <P> Patrick Tumamait said four names will be put to a vote on Sunday:  </P> <P> * Chumash Wilderness Area: Chumash means "island people," and the term reflects  the fact that some members of the tribe were found on the Channel Islands.  Patrick Tumamait said one drawback to that name is that the wilderness is  inland, and nowhere near the islands. But he favors that name because it would  increase the tribe's visibility.  </P> <P> * Kasi-Wey Wilderness Area. Kasi-wey means "the pass" in Chumash, and that name  would recognize the migration of Chumash through the mountains as they settled  the coastal area, Tumamait said.  </P> <P> * Kaspot-Kaslo (Eagle's Nest) Wilderness Area.  </P> <P> * Wit Wilderness Area. Wit means "condor" in Chumash, and Tumamait said his  father prefers that name because condors once soared over the area.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino said he does not expect any difficulty getting Congress to approve  whatever name the Chumash select. The problem, he said, is getting a wilderness  bill passed at all.  </P> <P> The House has approved his bill, but it is stalled in the Senate, where Sen.  Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has introduced a rival measure. Although Cranston's  bill also would create a new wilderness area, it would provide more protection  to Sespe Creek and would restrict the use of private land. That fact has drawn  opposition from Lagomarsino and others.  </P> <P> "I wish I were optimistic," Lagomarsino said.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (11): Something for everyone - Books on women in management are one of the fastest-growing parts of business publishing / Female executives 'WOMEN IN MANAGEMENT: A DEVELOPING PRESENCE' edited by Morgan Tanton Routledge, Pounds 14.99, 253 pages 'COMPETITIVE FRONTIERS: WOMEN MANAGERS IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY' edited by Nancy J. Adler and Dafna N. Izraeli Blackwell, Pounds 19.99, 414 pages 'MASCULINITY AND THE BRITISH ORGANIZATION MAN SINCE 1945' Michael Roper Oxford University Press, Pounds 25, 259 pages There are few women in management. Yet there is no shortage of books about them. While the number of female executives is low and rising imperceptibly slowly, the number of academics specialising in the field is climbing steadily, and books on the theme are one of the fastest-growing parts of management publishing. The latest crop has something for everyone - from the down-market self-help books of the 'Dress for Success' variety, to serious academic research. Even the latter type shows impressive range, from heavy duty feminist rant to painstaking factual account. Women in Management, a collection of mainly British research, claims to represent a 'second generation' of gender studies, and is presented from what it calls a 'woman-centred perspective'. Editor Morgan Tanton defines this as follows: 'Instead of highlighting how women are different from men I have described how women are. I have omitted reference to men or, where this was unavoidable, I have endeavoured to refer to men as 'other' to the female norm'. Such a warning is going to put off a lot of people, (women among them) who baulk at the idea of any such special perspective. These readers will find plenty else to offend them in this volume. The token alternative male among the contributors talks about a revelation that came to him during a management training session that he was giving. He realised that his preoccupations as a white male were geared towards mastering death, whereas those of the black woman who took part in the session seemed to be more about being at one with the mysteries of life. At least his account was not followed by three pages of detailed footnotes quoting other work in the area, as were those of his fellow contributors. For all its unattractive packaging the collection is not without interest. One chapter offers a convincing account of the ways in which the supposedly scientific systems used by companies for appraising their employees may discriminate against women. Another looks at the differences between male and female entrepreneurs. There is a minimum of ideological baggage carried by Competitive Frontiers: Women Managers in A Global Economy. Instead of concentrating on Britain and America, whose glass ceilings have already been scrutinised from every conceivable angle, this collection brings us women managers from all over the world. The conclusion of the book - that women seem to be struggling to a more or lesser degree on all continents - is not going to surprise anyone. The value of the book lies in the bulk of information - presented in a clear, factual style - about women in countries that for the most part have escaped detailed examination. A clear introduction by Nancy Adler summarises in a few pages the last 25 years of research into the barriers facing women managers, and divides the findings into four categories. The first are based upon the differences between men and women themselves. The second take as their focus the organisation, and look at the ways in which women's under-representation in management can be self perpetuating. The third involve straightforward discrimination: deeply embedded assumptions by managers about the role of women. The fourth claim that male-dominated institutions persist because the people with a vested interest in their persistance are the ones with the necessary power to make sure change does not happen. An interesting new light is cast on the subject by Michael Roper who has looked at the same subject taking men as his starting point. In Masculinity and the British Organization Man since 1945 he has interviewed male corporate veterans and concluded that the idea of male managers as strictly rational beings is a myth. He has tried to get under the skin of organisation men by asking them about their relationships with each other, their wives, their secretaries and their women colleagues. This is by the the most enjoyable read of the bunch. Each of his subjects is given a good deal of rope, and nearly all manage to hang themselves with it. A Mr Dowell, chairman of Hill Components, a traditional engineering company, starts - as do all the others - by playing lip service to the idea of promoting women. He then relates the following experience: 'We had a woman engineer who was in charge of all our computer operations who was extremely good, but eventually became unemployable because. . . she became more male than the males in her job. She was so aggressive and so difficult that in the end you couldn't hold a balanced, reasoned argument with her, because if you said anything that implied criticism of her because she was a woman, you got the woman bit. So that in the end we had to call it a day.' Roper concludes that some aspects of the classic macho manager are under threat as a result of new technology, restructuring of companies and so. Whether his demise will bring with it an era of equality is another matter altogether.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAFFEY GO-GO'S BACK TO AN ALL-GIRL GROUP  </P> <P> When Charlotte Caffey left the Go-Go's in 1985, she vowed that she would never  be part of another all-girl band.  </P> <P> So who's heading the Graces, the new all-women band whose debut album, "Perfect  View," comes out next week? That's right: Caffey.  </P> <P> "So maybe I'm a glutton for punishment," quipped the singer-guitarist, whose  new partners are singer Gia Ciambotti and singer-guitarist Meredith Brooks.  </P> <P> For Caffey, memories of the Go-Go's hadn't been all sweet until two weeks ago,  when the five former Go-Go's -- Caffey, Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, Gina  Schock and Kathy Valentine -- got together for the first time as a unit since  the 1985 split.  </P> <P> Carlisle and Schock organized the reunion at an Italian restaurant on Melrose  Avenue. And, Caffey reported, it was joyous.  </P> <P> "We were like a bunch of sailors getting together after years of being apart.  Getting together was like officially closing a chapter on something -- but we  all had to get together to close the chapter. We remembered the good times.  That day even the bad times we'd gone through didn't seem so bad."  </P> <P> Caffey said that they even discussed the possibility of reuniting for benefit  dates.  </P> <P> Carlisle, a pop/dance-music star on MCA Records, is the most famous of the  ex-Go-Go's. Wiedlin has had some success on EMI Records, but Schock was  recently dropped by Capitol Records.  </P> <P> Since the split, various members had stayed in contact with each other.  Carlisle and Caffey, for instance, remained friends. In fact, Caffey worked on  Carlisle's two solo albums.  </P> <P> Those two also engineered the breakup.  </P> <P> The Go-Go's career was slipping by 1985. The group was signed by I.R.S. Records  in 1981, several years after it was formed by Wiedlin and Carlisle.  </P> <P> "We struggled for years before we got that record deal," Caffey said. "It was  tough because we were girls. People were slamming doors in our faces for years.  It was incredibly satisfying to have a hit on our first try."  </P> <P> The debut album sold more than 2 million copies, but sales slipped on the next  two. The final Go-Go's album, "Talk Show," didn't even go gold (sales of  500,000).  </P> <P> "We had a lot of problems with each other and we just weren't getting along,"  Caffey said. "One of the problems we had was trying to live up to this bubbly  image. All the music was supposed to be bubbly. That's what people expected  from us. But that was very limiting. We were caught in this trap.  </P> <P> "There were incredible internal problems. It got very ugly. That's why we  stayed away from each other for so long. Those wounds needed a long time to  heal."  </P> <P> It's noteworthy that the Graces even have a contract, considering that record  companies usually avoid signing all-women bands. The excuses haven't changed.  They range from "females can't rock as well as men" to "female fans would  rather see male groups."  </P> <P> Once out of the Go-Go's, the last thing on Caffey's mind was facing the hassles  of an all-female unit.  </P> <P> "I was scared of working with women again," said Caffey, 35, in an office at  the Hollywood headquarters of A&amp;M Records, her new label. "I didn't want to  face the problems women bands have to go through. Things are a lot better for  women bands now. The Go-Go's success helped make things better. But I had a  block against working with females."  </P> <P> Since she had rejected the idea of working in a women's band, Caffey decided to  front a male group. Producer Jimmy Iovine, best known for his work with U2,  took her demo tape to A&amp;M Records, which signed her in 1987. But it turned  out that singing with a male band wasn't the answer.  </P> <P> "It didn't feel right," Caffey said. "Being in a band with guys didn't feel  like what I should be doing. Lead singing didn't feel right in that situation."  </P> <P> Working solo, she said, didn't feel right either. Another all-women band seemed  to be the only answer.  </P> <P> "Nobody at the record company had a problem with it," she said. "By then I was  past my block about working in an all-women band. It seemed like the right  thing to do then."  </P> <P> While searching for male musicians, she had seen Brooks and Ciambotti in their  own bands. "I didn't know them and they didn't know each other but I called  them to ask about the possibility of forming a band," Caffey said. "Since I had  seen them work in clubs, the bands they were in had broken up. They were  looking for something to do."  </P> <P> The Graces even had a woman co-producer, Ellen Shipley, in the studio, though  executive producer Iovine was still in charge of the project. While writing  with Ciambotti, 27, and Brooks, 31, Caffey wanted to do more of a rock album  this time.  </P> <P> "The Go-Go's were a frothy pop band," Caffey said. "I wanted to do music that  had a harder edge. I wanted to do harmonies that had a harder edge. The Go-Go's  harmonies were homogenized."  </P> <P> No one could ever accuse Caffey of blowing her own horn. In assessing her  talents, she is surprisingly self-critical:  </P> <P> "In this group we each sing leads, but vocally I have a very limited range. I  wanted to be with people who could really sing. I can't carry that burden  myself."  </P> <P> She isn't any more positive about her guitar skills: "I've never been a great  lead guitar player. I play one style and that's it. Meredith plays much better  than me. I play a few leads on the album but she plays the majority of them."  </P> <P> Caffey, a Los Angeles native, started playing the guitar by default. Back in  the mid '70s, she played bass in local bands before joining in the Go-Go's in  1978.  </P> <P> "They asked me to play lead guitar," she said. "There was only one slot open in  the band. I had never played lead guitar but I did it because I wanted to be in  the band."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME TO RETHINK ALBANIA'S HARD LINE, LEADER STRESSES;  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE: PRESIDENT ALIA SIGNALS A FURTHER SHIFT AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY'S  ORTHODOX COMMUNIST PAST.  </P> <P> Albanian President Ramiz Alia says his hard-line Communist country should  rethink enshrining the Communist Party's leading role and policy of atheism in  the constitution, the state news agency reported Thursday.  </P> <P> Signaling a further shift away from the country's orthodox Communist past, Alia  said the ruling Party of Labor of Albania "should not and cannot exert state  power directly" but should respect the rule of law, according to remarks  published by the official news agency ATA.  </P> <P> He also said the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with the United  States awaits only an announcement from Washington.  </P> <P> Alia, who is trying to introduce cautious reforms and bring his Balkan country  slowly out of self-imposed isolation, also decried bureaucracy and a lack of  discipline.  </P> <P> The comments by Alia appeared to be another cautious step toward reform.  </P> <P> The speech also seemed timed to influence a Paris summit that will decide later  this month whether to admit Albania to an all-European system of cooperation  and human rights.  </P> <P> In the speech, Alia did not say the Communists should give up power or legalize  a political opposition, nor did he suggest a specific constitutional amendment.  </P> <P> The constitution refers to the party as the "only leading political force in  the state," but Alia said that the Communists won that status "through  struggle, work, self-denial, and adherence to the interests of the people and  the homeland."  </P> <P> That echoed Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rationale earlier this year  for calling on the Soviet Communist Party to give up its guaranteed monopoly on  power.  </P></p>

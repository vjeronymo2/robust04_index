			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Algeria's FIS chiefs jailed for 12 years AN Algerian court sentenced Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj to 12 years in prison yesterday, Reuter reports from Algiers. They were charged with conspiracy against the state, which carries the death penalty. The military prosecutor had asked for life imprisonment for both men whose now outlawed party was blamed for plunging Algeria into 13 months of violence and political turmoil. The military court president, passing sentence at the trial which was closed to foreign journalists, said the court took into account 'extenuating circumstances'. Another FIS official, Kamel Guemazi, former mayor of Algiers, was given six years. The prosecutor had asked for 20 years. Four other men received four-year terms. All of those accused refused to attend the court which was also boycotted by their lawyers. The defence said earlier they would appeal to the supreme court whatever the sentences.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- Cross-Taiwan Strait trade  exchanges will be put on hold in the wake of a mysterious boat  fire in Mainland China in which 24 Taiwan tourists died, the  Economics Ministry said Tuesday [12 April].    Economic officials said all normal exchanges will be  suspended until Beijing settles the incident reasonably.    They added they will suspend the review process for Taiwan  applications to invest in the Mainland and will also prohibit  imports of mainland goods.    The officials said plans to allow the visit of mainland  economists and entrepreneurs will also be put on hold.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien said that the  ministry will make the adjustments in line with a policy mapped  out by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).    Yang added that he did not know how long the prohibitions  will last.    Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Monday said it  will suspend the approval process for imports of semi-finished  products from the mainland.    Since Premier Lien Chan unveiled an economic stimulus  project  last July, Taiwan has approved the import of 1,788 semi-finished  products from the mainland, BOFT officials said.    Semi-finished products approved before the suspension will  still be allowed into Taiwan, they noted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Huanli (1728 3562 0448)] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- This morning Zhu Rongji,  vice premier of China's State Council, was invited to attend a  breakfast hosted by Japan's Mitsui group in his honor.    Zhu Rongji said: You all are old friends of the Chinese  people and well-established Japanese entrepreneurs. I can tell  you that China's economic reform is bound to succeed, and China  will maintain its annual economic growth rate at 8 to 9 percent  for a long time to come. You should have full confidence in it.    Zhu Rongji added emphatically: Favorable temporal,  geographical, human, and other factors bind China and Japan  closely together. Friendly relations and cooperation between  China and Japan are an irresistible historical trend. China  needs Japan's capital and technology for its development,  whereas Japan needs China's markets and resources for its  economic development. Only by increasing cooperation can China  and Japan achieve their own prosperity. In conducting equal and  mutually beneficial cooperation, China and Japan should show  mutual understanding, consult with each other in a friendly  manner, and solve existing problems.    Zhu Rongji expressed the hope that Japan's economic circles  would consider the overall interest in developing Sino-Japanese  cooperation and work with China in constantly advancing  good-neighbor and friendly relations between China and Japan.  His speech won warm applause from those present at the  breakfast.    Prominent Japanese entrepreneurs attending the breakfast  included Naohiko Kumagaya, president of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd.;  Yosuo Matsushita, president of Sakura Bank; Joichi Aoi,  president of Toshiba Corporation; Katsunosuke Maeda, president  of Toray Industries; and Yoshiro Sasaki, vice president of  Nippon Steel Corporation. They related their experiences in  developing economic relations and trade with China, spoke highly  of China's achievements in economic reform, and repeatedly  expressed their wish to vigorously promote cooperation with  China.    He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of the State Council,  and other key aides attended the breakfast.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRI-CULTURAL FESTIVAL IN BALBOA PARK;  </P> <P> DANCE: SUNDAY'S PERFORMANCES WILL FOCUS ON THREE COUNTRIES -- MEXICO, SPAIN AND  THE PHILIPPINES.  </P> <P> Cultural expressions from Mexico, Spain and the Philippines will be vividly  displayed Sunday under the umbrella of the Tri-Cultural Music and Dance  Festival at the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> A four-hour marathon of music and dance will feature ethnic foods along with  nonstop live entertainment -- all designed to highlight historical ties among  the three ethnic groups.  </P> <P> During its 20-year history, the cultural center has focused on Chicano culture,  especially the arts of Mexico. But Sunday's concert, scheduled to run from 2 to  6 p.m. at the center's Balboa Park facility, will be its first foray into the  art forms of the Philippines.  </P> <P> "Our mission is to preserve Mexican culture, but we like to think up ways to  collaborate with other colorful cultures," said Eloise De Leon, Performing Arts  Coordinator for the center.  </P> <P> Lolita Carter, founder of the Samahan Philippine Dance Company, conceived and  coordinated the event to celebrate what she called "a common heritage."  </P> <P> "You know, the Philippines and Mexico were both part of Spain at the same  time," Carter said. "Both were colonized in 1521. Of course, there are  differences, but the Filipinos are very Spanish in their music and dances, and  their food and customs are very similar. I wanted to explore our common  heritage in this festival.  </P> <P> "I asked Carlos Santoyo (director of the Mexican Folklorico troupe) and Carla  Herredia (leader of the Spanish-flavored flamenco ensemble) to participate,  because you have to bring in Mexican and flamenco dance when you (focus) on the  common links between Mexican and Philippine dance," she said.  </P> <P> "The Mexicans borrowed a lot from us, and vice versa," Carter said. "That was  inevitable since the Philippines were governed from Mexico, and there was a lot  of trade exchange between Acapulco and Manila. When you see the dances side by  side, you will notice these shared roots."  </P> <P> Carter organized the festival to showcase that common artistic ancestry, but  she also wanted to provide a broader cultural context for the ethnic dance and  music. She invited Rizalino Oades, a history professor at San Diego State  University, to introduce the event with a historical overview of the  colonization of Mexico and the Philippines. In addition, the artistic directors  of each group will talk about their art before the performances.  </P> <P> "I will be speaking about the connection between the Philippines and Mexico --  links that go back almost three centuries," Oades said. "Since the Philippines  were governed by Spain through Mexico, there was not just an exchange of goods  between the two peoples, there was also a lot of intermarriage between them. In  fact, some Philippine towns were even named after Mexican places. And  Philippine seamen were probably the first Asian settlers of North America."  </P> <P> The Philippine dancers assimilated the graceful curve of their port de bras  from the Spanish conquerors, for example, while the Spanish influence in  Mexican dance is more pronounced in the fancy footwork, Carter said.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of similarity in the arms between Spanish and Philippine dance  forms," Carter said. "The Mexicans aren't concerned about the arms very much,  but they use a lot more of the foot tapping than we do. Even in Philippine  dance, however, there is a little tapping" based on the lightning-fast heel  claps that characterize flamenco dance.  </P> <P> Philippine dance is actually a melting pot of styles that draw on kinetic  expressions from Indonesia, Bali and Malaysia. But for this tri-cultural  celebration, Carter's 10-member company will concentrate on dances rooted in  Spanish culture.  </P> <P> The Samahan troupe will bring its own live musical accompaniment -- the  Philippine Rondalla, a small string orchestra -- and a singer. Unfortunately,  due to funding shortfalls, the Mexican dances will be accompanied by recorded  mariachi music.  </P> <P> Santoyo's folklorico group was formed at Chula Vista's Castle Park High School  in 1975, and they perform a range of Latino dances around town. For Sunday,  Santoyo chose a suite of six strongly Spanish dances from the region of  Jalisco.  </P> <P> "We wear charro costumes, derivatives of what the Spaniards wore. The  indigenous people were not allowed to ride horses, so wearing charro suits was  considered a status symbol."  </P> <P> The dances reflect Spanish courting customs, as well, Santoyo explained.  </P> <P> Dancers "don't hold each other, because the etiquette does not allow it. They  only hold each other by the eyes," he said. "One of the main differences is the  posture and the way feelings are expressed. The Spaniards were upright and  rigid. The Mexicans show more enjoyment in their dancing. The Mexicans even  transformed the instruments and rhythmic structure" of Spanish music.  </P> <P> Although the festival participants have prepared an assortment of ethnic  dances, they are all convinced that the value of the daylong event will  transcend mere entertainment.  </P> <P> "If this festival is successful, we're hoping to do another one next year,"  Carter said. "The Philippines and Mexicans are the two biggest minority groups  in San Diego. There are about 150,000 Filipinos in the county. Only the  Mexicans are larger."  </P></p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Shipowners in dispute European shipowners yesterday sought to take the heat out of a dispute with their customers over freight rates across the North Atlantic, writes Charles Batchelor in London. European Union ministers will later today review a special exemption granted to shipowners which allows them to group together in 'conferences' to agree prices on certain routes. Belgium, as president of the European Union, is to file a motion confirming the exemption for conferences. Shippers have protested that the pact between large shipowners such as P&amp;O, Nedlloyd and Hapag Lloyd has been used to push up freight rates. The shipowners counter that before the agreement was reached freight rates for a standard container had fallen from Dollars 1,600 to less than Dollars 900.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Smith and M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The Hong Kong Government will take a hardline  stance on Chinese dissidents wanting to visit the territory next  month.    It's a bid to fend off China's fears the territory will be  used as a base for "subversive" activity during the anniversary  of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.    The government, it is believed, will reject visa  applications  from a growing number of prominent Chinese political activists  preparing to gather here for the fifth anniversary of the June 4  crackdown. The move is designed to block any row with China.    Sources close to the Beijing government told the Hong Kong  Standard that a planned visit by dissident leader Wuer Kaixi at  about the time of the Tiananmen anniversary would be regarded as  confrontational.    A government spokesman said yesterday that no application  had  yet been received from dissidents wanting to visit the territory  but several dissidents, including Wuer Kaixi, the leader of the  Tiananmen Square movement, have already announced publicly their  intention to come here.    Another prominent dissident, Chai Ling, is also believed to  be planning a visit for the June 4 anniversary.    The Hong Kong Government believes the visits are part of an  orchestrated move by Chinese dissidents, a move which would not  be welcomed by local authorities.    The government is likely to use its powers to reject visa  applications to abide by the one country, two systems policy and  avoid becoming involved in China's internal affairs.    A Chinese official said any approval by the Hong Kong  authorities for Wuer Kaixi to visit the territory would be seen  as a provocation and would threaten already tense relations with  Beijing.    The source said it was of great concern to China that Hong  Kong does not become a base of subversion against the communist  regime.    "His visit will not benefit Hong Kong. On the contrary, his  relation to the territory will jeopardise Hong Kong's stability  and prosperity," he said.    "The purpose of (Wuer Kaixi's) visit is considered to be  provocative in Chinese eyes," the source said.    Wuer Kaixi, who is still on China's most-wanted list, has  been living in exile in the U.S. since the 1989 crackdown. He  was reported to have escaped from China and fled to the U.S. via  Hong Kong and is now a student in San Francisco.</p>

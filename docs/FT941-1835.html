			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Lower bonds hit Tokyo as Hong Kong rebounds 4% A sharp sell off in the bond market prompted by concerns over rising tensions in the Korean peninsula and higher US interest rates affected investor confidence, and the Nikkei index closed lower amid low volumes, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average declined 215.92, or 1.1 per cent, to 20,253.53 after a high of 20,458.55 and a low of 20,202.42. Falls in the futures market prompted arbitrage selling, while small lot profit-taking also depressed share prices. Volume was 360m shares as investors refrained from activity ahead of last trading day for March settlements on Friday. Buying by foreign investors also declined from previous weeks. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 19.23 to 1,628.01 while the Nikkei 300 declined 3.42 to 299.27. Losers led gainers by 826 to 247, with 111 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.67 to 1,344.28. North Korea's rejection of full international inspection of its nuclear facilities and the subsequent decisions by the US to deploy missiles in Seoul fueled fears of growing tensions in the Korean peninsula. Such uncertainty coupled with speculation of a further rise in US interest rates hurt the bond market, which in turn dampened the share prices. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said that Japanese institutions may choose to invest in the bond market if long term interest rates rise further. He expects volatility on the bond market to affect share prices on the short term and sees the Nikkei index closing this business year between 19,500 and 20,000. Interest rate sensitive shares lost ground in anticipation of higher long term interest rates. Nippon Steel fell Y4 to Y350 and Tokyo Electric Power by Y80 to Y3,290. Banks were lower on profit-taking with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y100 to Y3,210 and Sumitomo Bank off Y30 to Y2,170. Bakery and flour mill stocks were once again sought by speculators due to the continued rice shortage. Retailers are reporting a rise in sales of bread and noodles and Yamazaki Baking rose Y30 to Y2,100 and Nitto Flour Milling gained Y20 to Y550. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 196.17 to 22,349.87 in volume of 92.2m shares. Aoki International, a retailer of office workers' uniform blue suits, plunged Y240 to Y3,300. Roundup Regional markets adopted sharply divergent routes. HONG KONG rebounded, the Hang Seng index gaining 4 per cent to finish above 9,000 as bargain hunters sent prices up after the recent losses, and with a rise in US rates already discounted. The index jumped 345.14 to end a volatile day at 9,012.17, having swung from a low of 8,533 to a high of 9,150 as Japanese funds were seen returning as buyers. Preliminary turnover was a healthy HKDollars 6.34bn against Monday's HKDollars 6.52bn. The turnaround came as Mr Stuart Cook of Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities said that the Hang Seng was unlikely to hit its January 4 high of 12,599 again this year, but it could rebound to 10,000-12,000 by the end of the year. He said that the market was still attractive with strong corporate earnings anticipated. Interest rates would remain low, and it was unlikely that property prices would crash in the next 12 months. However, Morgan Stanley has reiterated its view that the index could touch or pass the 7,000 level as a result of bloated property prices, the Deng succession and MFN status for China. 'At the 7,000 level we would recommend buying stocks heavily. The long term story on China is still intact and as attractive as ever.' KUALA LUMPUR picked up 1.4 per cent after recent sell-offs as bargain hunting lifted the composite index 13.30 to 967.48. The index hit a low of 936.80 in early trade after falling 92.30 points over the previous three trading days. SINGAPORE was firmer in a technical rebound after Monday's sharp falls and the Straits Times Industrials index rose 8.74 to 2,045.04 after hitting an intra-day low of 1,990.37. AUSTRALIA saw late bargain hunting pick shares up from their lows, leaving the All Ordinaries index to finish 0.3 firmer at 2,140.8, having been 14.7 points down at one stage. SEOUL closed easier in weak trading as mild selective buying centred on some blue chips was wiped out by selling pressure caused by growing tension over North Korea's nuclear row. The composite index eased 7.70 to 877.95. NEW ZEALAND was unnerved by weakness elsewhere and the NZSE-40 capital index fell 48.41 or 2.2 per cent to 2,206.93 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 44m. MANILA recouped some of its sharp early losses after Hong Kong's rebound and the composite index finished 34.97 or 1.3 lower at 2,563.60, after a low of 2,503. BOMBAY was lower in nervous trade triggered by the Bombay Stock Exchange declaring a local stock broker defaulter. The BSE 30-share index closed 28.95 lower at 3,791.78. COLOMBO was lower again prompting speculation that the correction which began on March 1 would continue at least until after tomorrow's southern provincial council election. The all-share index fell 10.01 to 1,256.48.</p>

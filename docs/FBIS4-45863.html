			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 19 (AFP) -- The rump Yugoslavia  Tuesday [19 April] said UN sanctions against it had caused the  deaths of 30,000 people, including 15,000 children.    Yugoslav deputy health minister Svetlana Arsenic told the UN  children's committee here that despite provisions to allow  medical equipment into Yugoslavia, the sanctions had denied  vital medical equipment to thousands of ordinary people.    The embargo on trade with Serbia and Montenegro was imposed  by the United Nations in May 1992 to punish Belgrade for  supporting Serb aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Children have been particularly hard hit by the scarcity of  medical equipment and drugs and 15,000 have died as a result,  the Yugoslav minister said.    If the UN agrees to an exception for medical equipment,  "even  the smallest imports" are subject to complicated bureaucratic  procedures at the UN sanctions committee in New York, Arsenic  said.    "The examination of a large number of requests is constantly  delayed and put back," she said.    Yugoslavia's ambassador to Geneva, Vladimir Pavicevic, said  that because of the impact of the sanctions, Belgrade can no  longer apply the UN convention on children's rights.    Sanctions against Yugoslavia have caused a sharp fall in  medical cover available with some of the most vulnerable being  the 3.2 million children in the region, 200,000 of whom are war  refugees "of all nationalities", Arsenic added.    In several areas of Yugoslavia, the death rate has risen  above the birth rate, she added, suggesting that this  jeopardised "the very survival of the Yugoslav people."</p>

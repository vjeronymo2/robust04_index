			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: New equity inflow weighs on Milan - Rights issues are being criticised for their timing and quality It is a measure of the bad sentiment on the Milan bourse that last Friday's 38 per cent cut in Fiat's ordinary share dividend was greeted with relief rather than rancour. So negative have attitudes towards Italian equities become that even the wildest rumours are being given credence. The possibility that a bellwether company like Fiat might swell the list of rights issues overhanging the market was one of the factors behind last week's plunge in the Comit index through the psychologically important 480 barrier. In the event, Fiat produced neither a rights issue, nor a dividend to be paid partly in shares and in cash - the other possibility haunting brokers. The news helped the market regain some ground at the start of the new trading account on Monday, but the recovery was short-lived. In spite of Fiat's temporary relief, Milan remains shell-shocked. While trading volume has risen above L100bn (Dollars 83m) on most days, almost every Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new broking and fund management hybrid, is thought to be losing money on equities. Funding moves are the latest culprits. How, brokers ask, can companies expect the bourse to absorb trillions of lire in rights issues when trading is barely ticking over? In the past three weeks, Italcementi, Ras and Assitalia have announced big rights issues amounting to L1,776bn. Meanwhile, Iri, the state holding company, hopes to raise around L1,750bn by a secondary placing of shares in the Stet telecommunications holding group. Further down the line are likely flotations of Iri's Finmeccanica engineering arm, Eni's Agip and Snam subsidiaries, and just possibly, Iri's Ilva steel-making subsidiary. It is Iri's plans, bunched in the second half of the year, which have most depressed the market. Hit by the clampdown on government funding, Italy's biggest state holding company has turned to the market in virtual desperation. With its cash-raising ambitions in mind, some private sector companies may be trying to nip in first. Sentiment was already depressed before the latest money-raising cycle. Disappointing 1991 company results and limited scope for improvement in 1992 had crushed the market. Politically, delays in electing a president and forming a new government have postponed the likelihood of Italy getting to grips with its myriad economic problems. Foreign investors have taken cover, while domestic mutual funds have failed to step into the breach. Equity holdings by Italian unit trusts have reached a historic low as funds have switched to bonds or cash. Last month, the funds' net equity sales amounted to L150bn. The latest cash calls have been attacked both for their insensitive timing and poor quality. While Italcementi's purchase of control of Ciments Francais was applauded, its subsequent two-part rights issue was not. The company is charging the same price for ordinary and non-voting savings shares in the first half of the deal, while it is only offering non-franchised savings shares in the second. The move by Ras, Italy's second biggest insurer, which is controlled by Allianz, of Germany, to raise more than L800bn through a mixed share and warrant bond issue was equally unpopular. Its claim that funds were needed to build up the life insurance side was viewed sceptically, and the price of Ras's savings shares collapsed. Lack of information and poor investor preparation were the criticisms levelled at Iri for its Stet deal. In other circumstances the transaction might have gone down well: once completed, Iri will have only 53 per cent of Stet's ordinary shares and just 1 per cent of the savings stock, bringing true privatisation within sight. By half-heartedly releasing the news on the eve of a public holiday, however, and just days after repeated denials that such a transaction was imminent, Iri left the market feeling bitter and misled. With no sign of an upturn in investor confidence, and a host of public sector flotations to come this year, it is a lesson companies need to learn fast.</p>

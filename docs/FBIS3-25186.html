The Black  Cockerel [UNITA] has actually congratulated the United States  through the voice of its spokesman Jorge Valentim who said that  the important thing is to bring the war to an end:    [Begin Valentim recording] We in UNITA have always wanted  the  United States to take this attitude. We congratulate the White  House, the U.S. Administration. It is high time the war was  made to stop at once. We congratulate President Clinton. [end  recording]    The Luanda government also agrees with Clinton but wants  more  international pressure on UNITA, as [presidential spokesman]  Aldomiro da Conceicao has told us:    [Begin da Conceicao recording] The presidency of the  Republic  of Angola has welcomed with satisfaction the view expressed by  the United States on the question of the recrudescence of the  war in Angola. However, we take the view that greater pressure  should be exerted on UNITA to lead it to show real willingness  to bring this conflict to an end. [end recording]    The United States says that either there is an end to the  hostilities in Angola or the Lusaka peace negotiations will be  cut short.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Venezuela alters dollar auction Venezuela's central bank has abandoned the system introduced this month to ration sales of dollars to banks and exchange houses. The system had led to a growing gap between the official exchange rate for the bolivar, determined by central bank sales of dollars, and that on the parallel market. Yesterday the central bank began using a Dutch auction system, under which banks and exchange houses offer bids each business day for a specific volume of US dollars they wish to purchase. The monetary authorities then decide on a minimum price, and provide dollars to all bidders who have offered the minimum price or above. The central bank's main goals are to slow the depreciation of the bolivar and lower pressure on the country's international reserves, which have fallen sharply since the beginning of the year. Since May 2, the official value of the bolivar fell 9 per cent against the dollar, but, on the parallel market, the decline was more than 24 per cent. Mr Chip Brown, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York City, said that the new system, 'if properly managed, should help to stabilise the bolivar and bring it closer to parity.' The previous system used a weighted average to determine the dollar's price each day, and placed a strict limit on the resale margin for foreign exchange obtained from the central bank. There are no limits on resale margins under the new plan. Venezuela depends heavily on imported food and industrial inputs - and currency depreciation therefore feeds straight into cost-of-living increases. The bolivar's devaluation alone is expected to push inflation this year to 60 per cent or more, compared with 46 per cent in 1993. Under the system just abandoned, which was introduced on May 4, demand for dollars from the central bank was greater than what the bank was willing to supply. Foreign and domestic companies complained they were unable to get foreign exchange needed to pay for imports and meet other international obligations and warned of shortages as the flow of imports slowed.</p>

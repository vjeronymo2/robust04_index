			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The head of the investment promotion board  yesterday expressed confidence that Thai industries will survive  even though the government has had to alter its promotional  programme to comply with a multilateral agreement reached in the  Uruguay Round of trade talks.    In compliance with the terms of the Trade Related to  Investment Measures (Trims) agreement which was developed under  the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (Gatt), the Board of Investment (BoI) is among other things  cancelling the export privileges it granted to manufacturing  plants located in investment Zone 2 within five years of the  enactment of the Gatt agreements.    In order to retain their privileges they will have to  relocate their plants from Zone 2 covering 10 provinces in the  central region, to more remote areas in Zone 3.    During an interview yesterday Sathaphon Kawitanon, BoI  secretary-general, discounted concerns about local industries.  He believes the local industries should be strong enough to  stand on their own feet. Moreover, BoI is considering a  reformulation of the tariffs charged to the local  auto-assembling industry, along with a BoI plan to make  industry-wide the tax treatment granted as an exception to the  Mitsubishi assembly plant. [passage omitted]    Sathaphon said in 1985 the BoI had to introduce the  investment incentives to promote foreign investment in order to  boost the export substitution industry and the local economy  after the devaluation of the baht. He said the current situation  does not require such government incentives, however, because  local industries have gained wider economies of scale.    "The export requirement is no longer necessary," Sathaphon  said. He noted, however, that the government might have to  maintain the export requirement in certain industrial sectors.    The new wave of Japanese investment is likely to be aimed at  supporting industries, he said. The Board of Investment has  forecast that American and Japanese investors are likely to  focus on the automobile industry.    He said the Board of Investment, therefore, plans to grant  more incentives to the automobile industry. Officials have  already completed a draft reformulation of a new tariff  structure for the industry, but Sathaphon declined to elaborate  on the plan.    Sathaphon said only that the continuation of the privileges  would depend on key determinants such as proper tariff rates for  the auto-assembling industry and the differences between  investment conditions for plants under the BoI plan and plants  without investment privileges.    Sathaphon predicted that the next wave of Japanese  industrial  investment will be mainly in small- to medium-size plants,  because all the major Japanese producers already have plants in  Thailand.    He added that last year Japanese investments in Thailand  were  greater in value than their investments in any other country in  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.    The recession in Japan should not have a major impact on its  investment in Thailand, as "during the peak period, Japanese  investments here accounted for only two per cent of total  Japanese investment," he said.</p>

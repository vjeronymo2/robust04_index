			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discretionary Adjustment_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC's analysis indicates that in aggregate, the estimated cost per dialysis treatment in fiscal year 1994 is about 5 percent below the median wage-adjusted composite rate. This varies by type of facility. The estimated cost per treatment for independent facilities is about 13 percent below the payment rate. Costs are about 16 percent above payments for hospital-based facilities. Determining the true difference between payments and costs was complicated by data deficiencies. Nonetheless, the Commission believes it is important to recognize this difference in its update recommendation through an adjustment to the base composite rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The latest cost data probably are overstated substantially because they have not been audited, although the magnitude of this effect is not known. Inconsistent cost reporting practices and cost allocation methods raise additional concerns about data comparison and reliability across facilities. Further, government regulations implemented in 1992 have likely increased facility costs, but the exact amount is not known. In the Commission's judgment, a discretionary adjustment of ^4.0 percentage points balances the need to account for the difference between 1994 estimated costs and payments with uncertainties regarding the current level of costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC appreciates HCFA's continued efforts in compiling the database of unaudited dialysis facility cost reports and in auditing a sample of fiscal year 1991 cost reports. These data are important in developing annual update recommendations. The Commission supports HCFA's actions to improve the quality of the cost data by adding edits to the Hospital Cost Report Information System, revising the cost report schedules and instructions, and working with facilities and fiscal intermediaries to ensure that cost reports are filed correctly and completely. These measures will enhance the accuracy and reliability of the data, which is essential for decision making. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC will continue to evaluate payments to dialysis facilities. Its analysis will focus on the difference between payments and costs and how this relationship varies across providers. Additionally, ProPAC will take a closer look at the disparity between reported and audited costs to better assess the adequacy of payments. Because accurate and reliable data are crucial to this undertaking, the Commission urges HCFA to continue its measures to improve data quality and to regularly audit a representative sample of independent and hospital-based dialysis facility cost reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Payment Policies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PPS adjusts hospital payments in several ways to account for factors that may legitimately affect hospital costs, such as the level of teaching activity, wage rates, and patient mix. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of its mandate, the Commission examines the distribution of PPS payments across hospitals and makes recommendations concerning the various adjustments to the payment system. ProPAC considers adjustments that are made both at a hospital level and at a case level. In this year's report, the Commission recommends improvements in the PPS hospital wage index, outlier payment policy, and the indirect medical education adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC is also responsible for making recommendations on Medicare payment for facility services provided in settings other than the inpatient hospital. These payments have grown rapidly throughout the 1980s and have become an increasingly important part of the Commission's agenda. In this report, ProPAC's recommendations concern payment to skilled nursing facilities and hospital outpatient facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 15: Improvements in Hospital Wage Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary should develop and implement improved methods for collecting data on employee compensation and paid hours of employment for hospital workers by occupational category. Once these data become available, the Secretary should implement an adjustment to the hospital wage index under PPS. This adjustment would correct the wage index for the inappropriate effects of including geographic differences in the mix of occupations employed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PPS wage index is intended to measure geographic differences in the unit prices of labor inputs hospitals purchase to provide inpatient services. Currently, hospitals report only total compensation and total paid hours for all employees, regardless of occupation. Consequently, the average hourly wage calculated for each labor market area measures the average labor cost per hour for hospitals in the area, reflecting both unit prices for labor and the occupational mix of employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes the wage index should adjust payments for relative differences in local labor prices, rather than in costs. While local market prices for labor presumably are determined by forces beyond the control of an individual hospital, the quantity and skill mix of labor purchased clearly result from management decisions. Differences among hospitals in mission, services offered, and patient population served may lead to variations in the volume and mix of labor required to produce needed inpatient services. The resulting differences in operating cost per discharge, however, are accounted for by other hospital-specific adjustments in PPS, such as the case-mix index, and by the indirect medical education and disproportionate share adjustments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals located in large cities tend to employ a substantially more expensive mix of labor than hospitals located in rural areas. Consequently the current wage index values for large urban areas tend to be too high, while those for rural areas tend to be too low. This results in overpayment for some hospitals and underpayment for others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous ProPAC studies of 1988 occupation-specific compensation data reported by California hospitals suggest that an adjustment for occupational mix would increase the current wage index values for rural hospitals and decrease those for hospitals located in large urban areas. In 1992, the Commission again used the California data to examine the effect of occupational mix adjustment on wage indexes based on hospital-specific labor market areas. The results from this study were consistent with ProPAC's earlier findings. Adjustment for occupational mix may be particularly important for hospitals located in areas where there are few other hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Differences in occupational mix are an important factor affecting the accuracy of the wage index and equity of payment under PPS. To address this problem, the Commission previously has recommended collecting compensation and employee hours data by occupational category. However, the Secretary has rejected this recommendation on several grounds, including the burden that would be imposed on the hospital industry and lingering doubts about the likely accuracy of occupation-specific data. The Commission believes accurate occupation-specific data can and should be obtained to correct the continuing bias in the wage index. Further, the burden of collecting such data could be minimized by adapting methods currently used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect occupation-specific data for the employment cost index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second set of issues relates to the timeliness and accuracy of the wage data. Accurate and timely data are essential to improve equity of payments among hospitals under PPS. These issues are important because the wage index directly affects the distribution of about 70 percent of all payments under PPS, or some $42 billion per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current law, the Secretary is required to update the wage index annually, beginning in fiscal year 1994. The wage data collected on hospitals' annual cost reports for this purpose, however, will continue to lag by three to four years because of the length of the cost reporting cycle, intermediary auditing, and data submission to HCFA. In addition, the wage data many hospitals submitted on their fiscal year 1990 cost reports were initially inaccurate or substantially incomplete. HCFA's experience collecting wage data by mail survey, with or without occupation-specific data, has been equally poor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC believes the implementation of a new wage index based on hospital-specific market areas may help to improve the accuracy of the wage data. (See Recommendation 16.) With a nearest neighbor approach, a hospital's own data would generally have more influence on its wage index than is now the case. Therefore, hospital administrators may be more strongly motivated to ensure the quality of the information they submit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adjustment of the wage index for occupational mix would substantially improve payment equity among hospitals under the current PPS labor market definitions. It would be equally desirable for a wage index based on nearest neighbor labor market areas. In this case, ProPAC believes an occupational-mix adjustment would reduce variation in wage index values among nearby hospitals and would help the wage index more accurately reflect the labor price levels hospitals face. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Puma back in profit after years in the red PUMA, the German sports shoe company owned by Aritmos of Sweden, returned to profit in the first quarter of 1991 after several years in the red caused mainly by a disastrous US performance. 'The turnround is here,' said Mr Hans Woitschatzke, chief executive (pictured below). Puma had hoped this would be achieved in 1990, but was hit by supply problems in the Far East and made a loss of DM8.9m (Dollars 5.2m), against one of DM2.6m in 1989. Shoe production in the Far East was partly shifted from Taiwan and South Korea to lower-cost Indonesia. However, organisational and logistical problems there, as well as a fire in the Philippines factory, forced Puma to pay DM10m in air freight costs to keep dealers supplied. With these difficulties largely solved, Puma earned a first-quarter net profit in 1991 of DM6.8m, against a loss of DM3.6m last time. Turnover rose by 30 per cent to DM162m, with most of the increase coming in Germany.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Mercosur deal reached Argentina and Brazil have overcome the principal obstacle to the implementation of Mercosur - the planned four-nation customs union that also includes Paraguay and Uruguay - by reaching a compromise on the trade pact's future common external tariffs. Economy and foreign ministers from Argentina and Brazil, meeting near Buenos Aires at the weekend, drew up a detailed pact on the customs union planned to come into force on January 1 next year. The presidents of the four countries will meet in Buenos Aires on Friday for a summit at which they are expected to approve the compromise. A dispute between Argentina and Brazil - the region's largest economies - over common import duties for capital goods, telecommunications equipment and computers had threatened to undermine Mercosur. Argentina levies no duties on the import of these products, whereas Brazil has always protected its local high-tech manufacturers. The two have met half-way, with Brazil accepting a lower tariff for these goods and Argentina agreeing to abandon its zero tariff for capital and high-tech goods. Argentine and Brazilian negotiators have also agreed on a detailed list of products which will receive special protection after January. They account for about 15 per cent of bilateral trade. These privileges will be gradually reduced over the coming years and will end in 2005. In addition, Brazil and Argentina also agreed on special treatment for their free trade zones in Manaus and Tierra del Fuego. These zones - which import components free of duty, assemble them and 'export' the finished goods to their domestic markets - will be allowed to continue operating after 1995, paying the applicable Mercosur tariff when goods are exported to another member country.</p>

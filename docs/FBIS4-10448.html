			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Within the scope of reactions to the  implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, the National  Congress of Democratic Movements [CONACOM], one of the two rival  branches of Haitian socialism, called on Haitians on 11 April to  mobilize in order to prevent the implementation of Article 149  of the Constitution. [passage omitted] Let us listen to the  explanations of Dunois Eric Cantave, the person in charge of  political affairs in CONACOM.    [Begin Cantave recording, in Creole] Personally, I will say  that I understand them, but I do not agree with them. I  understand them because everybody in the country is tired of the  crisis. Everybody is tired of the status quo and the  wait-and-see policy that prevails. The country's economy has  gone to ruin. The middle classes are exhausted. Regarding the  people, the most serious thing that can happen to them is  repression, starvation, death through a lack of care. Everybody  is fatigued. It is normal and it is [word indistinct] that  citizens are proposing initiatives, but I do not agree with the  methods they are using, methods using threats, and through which  they violate a pact that was signed and which provided that  those who were elected in the 18 January [1993] elections should  step aside until the arbitration committee offers a verdict on  their case.    I disagree especially because, as we in CONACOM always say,  the solution must take into account first President Aristide and  all those who were regularly elected in the country. Second, it  must take into account the military institution that is the  keeper of public order and which is also one of the protagonists  in the crisis. Third, it must take into account what we call the  international community, an unavoidable economic partner. [end  recording]    The only consequence of such a strategy would be the  exaggerated extension of the embargo that has had hard effects  on the majority of the social body, while making a minority  rich; and the prolongation of the logic of coup d'etat with all  that that involves, such as threats against the national  institutions, social frustrations, and repressions throughout  the country, CONACOM says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Weeks of campaigning characterized by sometimes  harsh accusations and lots of promises came to an end last  evening as Trinidadian nationals went to the polls to decide who  they wish to represent them in the Laventille West area. The  election results out of Trinidad and Tobago indicate that the  People's National Movement [PNM] and the United National  Congress have retained their seats. Commenting on the outcome,  Prime Minister Patrick Manning expressed satisfaction with the  way things went:    [Begin recording] [Manning] Over time, over the next year or  two, as we come into a general election, and as things improve,  as they undoubtedly will, you will see a considerable  improvement in the position. The poll is low. There is voter  apathy at this time because, to a large extent, we are at the  midpoint in our five-year period of office. And again, because  people saw no real threat to the ruling party, either in  Laventille West or in (Cocorite River) Valley. All in all, I  think we have done very well. I want to congratulate all parties  in this election. Campaign elections were clean. Elections were  incident-free except for one incident that had potential danger,  but did not materialize, a couple days ago. If I told you that I  was unhappy with the way things had gone, I would be less than  honest.    [Unidentified reporter] One of the elements in this election  has been the question of the low poll. There was very low  response by the electorate, by the people who were eligible to  vote for the Laventille West constituency. What do you see as  accounting for this?    [Unidentified interviewee] Maybe a lot of them did not take  the by-election too seriously. But I know that there are a  number of (PNM) people who did not go out to vote today. And  there is no indication that (PNM is not Laventille or Laventille  is not PNM; Laventille is still very much PNM).    [Reporter] Right through the campaign, you would say that  you  were confident of victory.    [Inteviewee] Yes, right through, I was. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the opposition National Alliance for  Reconstruction also commented on its defeat:    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We have been around  to  nearly all the polling divisions in the constituencies that took  part in this election and it was quite obvious to me, and even  from the reports of my election agents, that most of the people  who came out to vote were senior people, and in some instances,  they actually had to be helped to get into the polling station.  It also tells me that the ruling party barely knows where its  support is, and they go out to pull that support out, and in  fact, they are pulling out senior people. They have not been  able to capture the imagination of the younger voters. I think  it should be a concern of all political parties because it means  that the young people seem to be disillusioned with the  political process. [end recording]</p>

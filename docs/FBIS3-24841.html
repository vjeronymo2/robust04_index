			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Feb 1 SAPA--The Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front--AVF] said on Tuesday it was shocked by reports  from "reliable sources" that a large segment of the National  Peacekeeping Force [NPF] had been heard to chant "Kill the Boer,  Kill the Farmer" at their De Brug base on Saturday night.    AVF Press Secretary Stephen Maninger said the NPF  represented  the re-emergence of the African National Congress' [ANC] armed  wing Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], and could not be  trusted with the safety of the South African public.    The NPF was not apolitical, and was ill-disciplined and  unreliable, he said. "We predict that once this force is  deployed it may become South Africa's version of (Zimbabwe  President Robert) Mugabe's `5th Brigade,' sent to suppress all  political opposition in places such as kwaZulu or other areas  where the ANC does not have complete control."    The AVF statement was referred to the Transitional Executive  Council's sub-council on defence for comment.</p>

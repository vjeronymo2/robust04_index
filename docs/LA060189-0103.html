			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OWEN LATTIMORE, SCHOLAR AND MCCARTHY TARGET, DIES  </P> <P> Owen Lattimore, a China scholar who was accused by Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1950  of being "the top Soviet espionage agent in the United States," died here  Wednesday. He was 88.  </P> <P> Lattimore, who suffered a stroke last year, had been in failing health the past  two weeks, relatives said.  </P> <P> Lattimore grew up in China, and spent nearly 25 years in the Far East.  </P> <P> In March, 1950, McCarthy made his much-quoted assertion that Lattimore was the  nation's top communist sympathizer. The Wisconsin Republican later toned down  his charge to "one of the top" agents.  </P> <P> Eventually a Senate subcommittee cleared Lattimore of all of the charges,  declaring them baseless, but that was not the end of his public ordeal. A  federal grand jury indicted him in 1952 for perjury in testimony before the  committee and the charges lingered until 1955, when the Justice Department  dropped them for lack of evidence.  </P> <P> Lattimore never earned a university degree, instead going into business and  doing newspaper work in Shanghai and Beijing from 1920 to 1926. He studied at  Harvard in 1929 before beginning research in Manchuria later that year. He  conducted more research in Peking from 1930 to 1935, also working in Mongolia.  </P> <P> From 1941 to 1942 he served as a political adviser to Chiang Kai-shek, the  leader of the Nationalist government. He then became deputy director of Pacific  operations for the U.S. Office of War Information, serving until 1944.  </P> <P> From 1934 to 1941, he edited Pacific Affairs, a journal of the Institute of  Pacific Relations. Lattimore was the director of the Walter Hines Page School  of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University from 1939 to 1953, and  lectured at Johns Hopkins from 1938 to 1963.  </P> <P> During his legal troubles, Lattimore resigned his job at the Page school but  stayed on as a lecturer at Johns Hopkins.  </P> <P> Among Lattimore's books are, "High Tartary" (1930), "Manchuria, Cradle of  Conflict" (1932), "Inner Asian Frontiers of China" (1940) and "Ordeal by  Slander" (1950).  </P> <P> Lattimore's wife, Eleanor, died in the mid-1960s. His son, David Lattimore of  Pawtucket, is a professor in the department of East Asian studies at Brown  University.  </P> <P> In addition to his son, Lattimore is survived by a sister, six grandchildren  and two great-grandsons.  </P> <P> A family member said Lattimore's remains will be cremated and a memorial  service will be held at a later date.  </P></p>

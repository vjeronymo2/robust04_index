			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Security information from inside the occupied strip  reports that the Zionist occupation forces recently sliced off  vast areas of Lebanese territory in the hills of Saddanah which  lie alongside al-Majidiyah farm at the southwestern corner of  the Golan Heights and annexed them to the occupied territories.    Citing eyewitnesses, the reports said that the Israelis have  built asphalt roads through the al-Malikiyah gateway, which they  set up in 1948, to these hills, which they now have linked to  the farms in Shab'a. They occupied the latter in 1967. The  reports add that the occupation forces set up many camps and  observation posts in these heights and surrounded them with  barbed wire. In addition, they set up iron pillars, flood  lights, and other military equipment. They also imposed a  curfew under the pretext that these are military areas. It is  worth noting here that the Israelis established many settlements  among the farms of Shab'a and built roads linking them to the  Tiberias area many years ago.</p>

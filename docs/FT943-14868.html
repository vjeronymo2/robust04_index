			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (13): China gears up for the future - Arthur Way checks progress in promoting manufacture of parts Vehicle and component manufacturers with the necessary financial, managerial and technological resources are shaping up to participate in the development of China's motor industry. The experience promises to be exciting, occasionally bumpy, but ultimately highly rewarding. In 1993, the country's vehicle output amounted to a reported 1.28m units with the emphasis on commercial vehicles. Government forecasts indicate that production will rise markedly by the end of the 1990s to 3m a year with cars and multi-purpose vehicles (people carriers) accounting for much of the increase. Further substantial growth is virtually guaranteed as the country fulfils its promise to become one of the world's leading economies. Recent years have witnessed a hectic pace in motor industry development. Component industry investment, though, has tended to lag. To allow the components sector to catch up, the government recently announced plans to withhold approval for new vehicle manufacturing projects until 1996. The only venture expected to escape this freeze is the proposed minivan project, for which Chrysler is the main contender. Moreover, approval for any future vehicle assembly operation is expected to be conditional on achieving an initial local content of at least 40 per cent, rising to 60 per cent within three years. Official policy favours an expansion in the components sector. This is being promoted in two main ways. First, vehicle manufacturers who already have an assembly presence are being encouraged to increase local content. And second, those who hope to participate in the next phase of motor industry development are required to show their commitment by setting up component manufacturing operations as a first step. Citroen's newly established venture to produce a version of its ZX model - at an annual rate of 35,000 within two years, and with an eventual target of 150,000 - will feature an increasing proportion of Chinese-built parts. The aim is to reach a local content of 90 per cent as quickly as possible, which has led the company to encourage some of its European suppliers to the Spanish-built ZX to set up in China. Tudor, the Spanish battery manufacturer, has already declared its intention to establish a Chinese plant. There are signs that Toyota is preparing for a bigger role. So far the Japanese company's main involvement has been providing technical help together with a licence to a local producer for the manufacture of light commercial vehicles. The majority of components are imported from Japan, but the strength of the yen has added to the urgency of building up local content which stands at around 20 per cent. Now Toyota is assisting in the establishment of facilities to produce steering and transmission components, with the aim of boosting the figure to 40 per cent in 1994 and to 70 per cent during the second half of the 1990s. In June, Ford announced plans to invest Dollars 50m in setting up its first Chinese manufacturing facilities. These are to be in the components sector and involve joint ventures with two local suppliers - Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation and Shanghai Yao Hua Glass Works. Ford is to hold a 51 per cent stake in the ventures, both of which are conditional on receiving official approval. The joint venture with Yan Feng - China's largest supplier of automotive trim components - will produce plastic components such as instrument panels, interior trim and seats. Operations will take place at one of the Chinese partner's existing facilities and at a new factory which is due to start output in autumn 1994. The joint venture with Yao Hua will be named Shanghai Fu Hua Glass Company, and will produce automotive safety glass and architectural glass. A wide range of European groups are establishing component manufacturing facilities in China. SKF is setting up an operation to manufacture ball bearings, while Valeo has established a joint venture with local partners for the manufacture of windscreen wiper equipment. UK component suppliers have not played a particularly prominent role in China's components sector. Part of the reason probably stems from the absence of a British-based vehicle manufacturer in the country. But some component groups have established a presence and there is the likelihood of more to come as others examine opportunities. Lucas is actively pursuing opportunities in China and already has a licensing arrangement for brake actuation equipment. The company recently concluded a joint venture agreement with Mando (of Korea) to supply brake calipers, in which Lucas will have a 20 per cent holding. Automotive Products (AP), a subsidiary of BBA, has agreements with local interests with the result that all modern generation Chinese trucks are equipped with clutches produced under licence from AP.</p>

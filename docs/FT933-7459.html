			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Gould attacks Labour strategy LABOUR'S decision to abandon redistributionist economic policies spells the end of its hopes of winning a general election, Mr Bryan Gould said yesterday. Mr Gould, who resigned from the shadow cabinet last autumn, said the strategy revealed the party leadership's 'worrying' lack of ambition. His comments reflect continuing unease on the left of the party about the pro-Europe and anti-taxation policies being developed by party 'modernisers'. Much of Mr Gould's criticism was aimed at a revised economic strategy released earlier this week by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, which abandons the 'tax and spend' manifesto on which the party fought the 1992 general election. In a deliberate effort to improve the party's image, particularly in the south of England, Mr Brown said Labour would no longer seek to 'penalise' wealth and promised tax cuts if possible. Writing in Tribune, the leftwing newspaper, Mr Gould said the revised strategy might consolidate Labour support in the party's heartlands but would do nothing to win votes in the south. 'Standing by while the Liberal Democrats reap the benefits of Tory unpopularity in the south makes sense only if we have resigned ourselves to sharing power with them after the next election,' he said. 'If that is what now passes for strategic thinking, then the party should at least be let in on the secret. Such a strategy would be self-defeating, and would represent a complete misreading of the public mood.' He said the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism gave Labour a chance to 'break with Euro-monetarism and the defeatist view that we can't run the economy ourselves'.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets: A good news year - Wall Street Just under 12 months ago, who on Wall Street could have imagined that the stock market would be ending 1993 in such robust form and good humour? Share prices are trading near record highs. The economy is growing at a faster rate than expected and corporate profits are improving steadily. Inflation remains unthreatening, which means domestic interest rates have stayed close to 30-year lows. And the underwriting calendar is as busy as ever at the end of what has been the best year in history for corporate debt and equity issuance. Even the long-dormant mergers and acquisitions business is thriving, with a strong year ending in blockbuster style with a planned Dollars 5bn employee-led buyout of UAL, and what could be a winning Dollars 10bn bid in the takeover battle for Paramount Communications. All this and record profits (bonuses, too) for the traders, bankers and deal-makers who have oiled the wheels of the financial markets throughout 1993. At times, it seemed as if Christmas came every other week for Wall Street in 1993. The year, however, had some downs as well as many ups. There were periodic attacks of anxiety over the direction of interest rates and the possible revival of inflation, in particular during the autumn when prices of government securities nose-dived and long-term bond yields rose sharply. The stock market's nerves were assailed several times during 1993 by President Clinton's peculiarly cliff-hanging style of making policy and law. His last-gasp legislative victories over the administration's first Budget and, later, the North American Free Trade Agreement may look like successes now but, at the time, the votes were too close for the market's comfort. Shock waves from overseas also washed ashore occasionally in New York. Trade became a troublesome issue for the first time in recent memory because of Nafta and Gatt (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), while turmoil in foreign financial markets (especially the continued decline in Japanese equities and fresh upheavals in the European currency markets) sometimes took its toll on sentiment in the US. And political crises in Russia and threats of conflict in Korea left US investors rattled at times. Yet, the good memories outweigh the bad, as they should at the end of any year in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen almost 14 per cent, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 more than 7 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite index nearly 12 per cent. As in 1992, the main driving force behind rising share prices has been low interest rates. For almost three years now, these have been persuading investors to shift money out of low-yielding, short-term assets, such as bank certificates of deposit and money-market funds, and into equities where dividend returns and the potential for capital growth look more enticing. The steadily improving economy, and solid growth in corporate profits, also have helped to sustain stock prices. Then there was the unexpected boost to share values from the return of merger mania. In several key industries - media and entertainment (Paramount and QVC or Viacom); telecommunications (McCaw Cellular and AT&amp;T, TeleCommunications Inc and Bell Atlantic); healthcare (Medco Containment and Merck); and financial services (Shearson and Smith Barney, Dreyfus and Mellon Bank) - factors such as technological revolution, impending regulatory change and a search for efficiency through consolidation forced a host of big companies into strategic unions. If there was one drawback, it was the tendency among many companies to finance their deals with equity, which led to some dilution of share values. Finally, 1993 also has been a year in which the cream of the country's managers have learned to respect the power of institutional shareholders and investors. Among those ousted because of poor performance were John Akers at IBM, Kay Whitmore at Eastman Kodak, Jim Robinson at American Express and Paul Lego at Westinghouse. And what of 1994? The view that the bull market has run its course, and that rising interest rates will force a correction in over-valued share prices early next year, is gathering support. It is a persuasive argument, but the Christmas spirit should be strong enough to allow Wall Street to put aside doubts about the future and enjoy the last few days of a remarkable year.  --------------------------------- Monday      3755.21  +   03.64 Tuesday     3745.15  -   10.06 Wednesday   3762.19  +   17.04 Thursday    3757.72  -   04.47  ---------------------------------</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Japan's government urged to pull out from Cambodia THE JAPANESE government was last night attempting to head off pressure to withdraw police officers from peacekeeping duties in Cambodia after the killing of an officer in an ambush last week. Mr Keijiro Murata, home affairs minister, will today call for the unarmed Japanese police officers to be given greater protection or be withdrawn to Phnom Penh. Mr Murata arrived in Phomn Phen yesterday for talks with the United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia over the safety of Japanese personnel. Untac has so far refused to accede to Japanese government demands to withdraw the police to safer areas, on the grounds that this would be preferential treatment. If Mr Murata is unable to return with a pledge that the police will be given greater protection, it is likely pressure for their recall will grow. The issue is highly sensitive for the Japanese government because the despatch of peacekeepers to Cambodia was presented as a symbol of Japan's commitment to play a wider role in UN affairs. Japan sent 600 military personnel and 75 police officers in October to help oversee the run-up to elections due to be held from May 23 to 28. In a frank meeting with Japanese police officers yesterday Mr Murata was asked by Mr Hiroto Yamazaki, the head of the police contingent in Cambodia: 'How many of us will have to die before you decide to pull the Japanese police out of Cambodia?' Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, who was visiting the family of Mr Haruyuki Takata, the slain policeman, said he was reluctant to consider a full-scale withdrawal of the police. Howver, Mr Yohei Kono, the cabinet secretary, acknowledged that the government was under pressure to clarify its position over the conditions in which it would withdraw the personnel.</p>

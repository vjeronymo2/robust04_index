			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Boris Godunov and The Return of Ulysses - British opera revivals Opera North's staging of Boris Godunov, first seen in 1989, has returned with its glories preserved. Ian Judge's production has been carefully revived by Jonathan Alver; John Tomlinson is again resplendent in the title role. It remains a brutally direct, intense account, given razor-sharp focus by the use of Musorgsky's original 1869 version of the opera - just seven scenes lasting barely two and a half hours, and each rendered as a vivid snapshot in a thrilling chronicle of Russian history. Inevitably one regrets the loss along the way of some of the material Musorgsky added in his subsequent attempts to make his creation more politically and operatically acceptable - no Polish act, no character numbers in the nursery scene. But there is no doubting the dramatic urgency of the original scheme, or that the narrative thrust of the work emerges more clearly - the two protagonists of Boris Godunov, it reminds us, are the tsar himself and the Russian people. It is those two components which the Opera North account catches so excitingly. The Coronation scene, the second panel in this particular pageant, finally set Wednesday's performance ablaze and began to exert the dramatic grip which never slackened afterwards. The opening at the monastery had been slow to come to life; in the opening exchanges too co-ordination between stage and pit was sometimes approximate. But then Paul Daniel's conducting gained pungency and attack, Tomlinson's first phrases as Boris compelled attention, and the chorus began to direct its intensity out into the auditorium. Each of the subsequent scenes contains beautifully crafted, intelligently thought-out performances - grave, articulate Pimen from Matthew Best, never at all histrionic; nimble, clear-toned Grigory from Paul Charles Clarke; an inn scene stacked with cartoon grotesques and headed by Andrew Shore's larger-than-life Varlaam and Ann Howard's eye-rolling Innkeeper. Jeffrey Lawton's Shuisky is beautifully fluent, insidiously crafty, Mark Curtis's Simpleton is uncomplicatedly affecting. Ann Taylor-Morly's Feodor and Melanie Armitstead's Xenia are attractive, not at all caricatured. Most of all there is Tomlinson, in wonderful clarion voice, making sure every word carries through the theatre and wringing every last drop of theatricality from his haunted visions. It is a masterly portrayal, the true focus of this compelling production. English National Opera has revived its 1989 Return of Ulysses, which thus completes the trilogy of Monteverdi stagings by David Freeman seen in London over the past two months. In 1989 this struck me as one of the most heartfelt, powerful and boldly immediate of British Monteverdi productions in living memory. Its return aroused excited expectation, which on Wednesday was let down by plodding, lumpily inexpert musical direction, and by the second-rate quality of much of the singing. In Monteverdi, staging counts for much - and Freeman's richly dramatised ensemble vision, at once ancient and modern, warmly Levantine in its textures, still achieves one of his most imaginatively expansive and fine-grained pieces of operatic theatre - but singing counts for no less. Most of the cast come new to their roles; many of them must be reckoned simply inadequate Monteverdi singers, at least for a house of Coliseum size. Among the gods and suitors a number of coarse-toned basses and strident or cloudy mezzos smirched the picaresque enchantment of every scene in which they appeared. The feebleness of the Minerva was a particular hardship; the original performer had been Sally Burgess, gleaming with wit and vocal lustre, and she was badly missed. Still, not all is gloom. The old shepherd Eumaeus, one of the most wonderful smaller roles in this wonderfully well-supplied opera, is taken now by Neil Jenkins; he is a commanding Monteverdian (I remember with undimmed admiration his Kent Opera Ulysses in the late 1970s), and his focused energy and disciplined passion light up the stage. Paul Nilon's Telemachus is dry-toned but eloquent, Adrian Thompson's 'paunchy cavalier' Irus gruesomely fascinating, Michael Chance's countertenor Amphinomous a ray of elegance amid the encircling vocal murk. And for Anthony Rolfe Johnson in the title role and Jean Rigby as Penelope - the 1989 leading couple, thankfully restored to the revival  - no praise can be too high. Both sink their beautiful voices and strong theatrical personalities even more deeply into their roles than first time round; more than ever, the dark, achingly sad beauty of Miss Rigby's low-register plaints and the physical and vocal thrill of Mr Rolfe Johnson's extraordinary stage magnetism provide the show's most arresting and powerful rewards. Boris Godunov, Theatre Royal, Nottingham; further performance May 23. Touring to Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. Sponsored by Nottinghamshire County Council. The Return of Ulysses, sponsored by The Mercers' Company; in repertory at the Coliseum until June 19.</p>

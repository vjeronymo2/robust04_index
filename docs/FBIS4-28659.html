			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Japan has made no decision  on whether or not it will suspend economic assistance to China  after it conducted an underground nuclear test last Friday [10  June], Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said Monday.    Saito told a press conference the government has not yet  made  a decision on whether it should immediately change its Official  Development Assistance (ODA) policy toward China.    He said Japan has conveyed its concern about the test and  explained again the contents of its ODA guidelines hammered out  in 1992, which state that recipient countries should promote  disarmament.    Japan will continue to urge China to stop conducting nuclear  tests, he said.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa suggested in Beijing on  Sunday  that China's nuclear test could influence Tokyo's future loans  to China.</p>

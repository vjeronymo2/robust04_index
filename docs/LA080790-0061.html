			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> FDA OKS DRUG FOR INFANT LUNG DISEASE  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said it has approved a drug that company  studies have shown can cut by 50% the death rate in premature infants suffering  from a severe lung disease. The disease, called respiratory distress syndrome,  is the most common cause of death in infants younger than 30 days, the American  Lung Assn. said in New York. The drug, Exosurf, mimics the action of lung  surfactant, a liquid that helps keep lungs inflated.  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Allied-Lyons in Indian whisky deal HIRAM WALKER, the spirits and wine division of Allied-Lyons, is to establish a joint venture in India with Jagatjit Industries of New Delhi, one of the country's largest liquor producers. The 50/50 venture will bottle Scotch whisky in India and launch a range of locally-produced spirits for the domestic and international markets. After decades of warding off foreign liquor manufacturers and encouraging a thriving market for spurious 'scotch', India has opened its doors to the world's premium Scotch whisky-makers. Allied is the third UK-based drinks company to enter the Pounds 800m market under the Indian government's liberalisation programme. Guinness and Grand Metropolitan have already announced the formation of partnerships with Indian companies. Seagram, the Canadian liquor and foods giant, has also been allowed to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary to make or blend 25,000 kilolitres of spirits a year. Though the Allied-Jagatjit venture is not expected to make a significant contribution to Allied's profits for some years, Mr David Jarvis, chief executive of Hiram Walker, said yesterday: 'We believe India has great potential for our products. 'We are delighted that the Indian government's positive policy for inward investment now allows us to be associated with Jagatjit.' The Indian government has not allowed foreign liquor companies to set up manufacturing capacities, and they will have to rely on the existing facilities of their joint venture partners, or purchase Indian spirits through contracts. Jagatjit, which commands more than 25 per cent of the country's liquor market, is involved in the manufacture and marketing of malt, malt extract, dairy and food products, as well as in the production of bottling and packaging material. The Rs100m (Pounds 2.2m) project in Maharashtra will import Scotch and bottle it in India for local sale and export to Gulf countries and possibly to South East Asia. The company will bottle up to 30,000 cases of Scotch a year, and another 30,000 cases of blends with locally-made alcohol. Exports have been made mandatory in order to offset import costs. The Indian demand for Scotch is estimated at 1m cases a year, more than 75 per cent of which are spurious or adulterated, and 90 per cent of which are smuggled.</p>

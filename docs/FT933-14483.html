			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Sunday trading THE PRIME MINISTER and the home secretary yesterday strongly backed complete deregulation of Sunday trading in England and Wales. Their backing came as the government published details of the four options it will place before parliament for replacing the current discredited restrictions. This strategy could, however, leave the law in chaos or impose equally anomalous restrictions on Sunday trading. The idea of letting MPs choose between a range of options on an issue which has divided the Conservative party in the past is attractive to a government with a small majority. However, there is a danger that presenting several options could result in the adoption of none if the most popular of the four cannot command a parliamentary majority. That would leave the law in its current unsatisfactory state, widely broken by large retailers and not enforced by local authorities which see the popularity of Sunday shopping. Barely more acceptable would be a victory for partial deregulation. Two of the three options allowing limited Sunday trading include a list of goods which could legitimately be sold. Such a list would inevitably replicate the anomalies which have thrown the present law into disrepute by permitting the sale of pornography on the sabbath but not the sale of bibles. Why, after all, should it be permissible to buy fertiliser at a garden centre on a Sunday, but not groceries at a supermarket? All three partial deregulation options involve restrictions on the opening of larger shops. This would limit choice to the smaller, less efficient retailers whose prices are often higher. One worthwhile consequence of deregulating Sunday trading would be the opportunity to make more efficient use of capital. To exclude the larger stores from unrestricted Sunday opening would therefore impede this desirable outcome. Complete deregulation has been an unqualified success in Scotland. And reprehensible though law-breaking is, the de facto deregulation of Sunday trading south of the border has been hugely popular with customers. The government must thus strain every sinew to ensure that this option eventually commands a majority. One way to achieve this would be to strengthen the legal protection for shopworkers who do not wish to work on Sundays. Seven-day working is common in other industries, and it would be invidious to give shopworkers special rights for work on Sundays. But there may be scope for concessions - perhaps time-limited - which could win support from opposition MPs without losing the benefits of deregulation. Alternatively, local authorities could be allowed to hold referenda on Sunday trading. Parts of the country with strong sabbatarian traditions could retain restrictions, while more secular areas broke free from them. A measure of local democracy could yet be the way to break the parliamentary log-jam.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Data General remains in black DATA General reported a small profit in its fourth quarter as the US mid-range computer manufacturer continues its struggle for sustained profitability. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 500,000, or 1 cent per share. During its fourth quarter last year, the company reported net income of Dollars 18.4m, or 50 cents per share. Revenues were Dollars 288.2m, down from Dollars 295.6m last year but above those in the immediately preceding quarter. On Wall Street, Data General's share price fell sharply on news of the results to close at Dollars 10 7/8 down 2 1/8 from Wednesday's close. Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, said: 'Our challenge is to further increase revenues while improving our operating margins. 'While we remain very cautious for the short term in light of worldwide economic conditions, which continue to negatively impact the industry, we believe we are well positioned to be successful.' For the full year, the group suffered a net loss of Dollars 62.5m, or Dollars 1.91. The loss includes a restructuring charge of Dollars 48m from costs associated with job cuts announced in April. In fiscal 1991, it recorded net income of Dollars 85.6m, or Dollars 2.45 per share, which included a one-time gain of Dollars 13m from the sale of its Japanese subsidiary. Revenues were Dollars 1.12bn, compared with Dollars 1.23bn for 1991 year. The 1992 revenues were reduced by the sale of its Japanese subsidiary, Nippon-Data General. Revenues from the Japanese market place were Dollars 53m lower than the same period last year.</p>

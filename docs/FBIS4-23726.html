			<p>BFN     [Text] More than 300,000 Mozambicans of electoral age have  already registered for the upcoming election in Tete, Nampula,  and Sofala Provinces since the process began on 1 June. By  registering, they acquire the right to participate in the first  general multiparty elections scheduled for October. Meanwhile,  the World Food Program has announced it will grant 330 tonnes of  foodstuffs to assist about 7,000 electoral officers throughout  the country.    Antonio Mateus Luis, Tete Provincial Elections Commission  chairman, told NOTICIAS yesterday that 12,262 people have been  registered for the election in the province in preparation for  the first general multiparty elections in Mozambique.    Mateus said the figures could have been higher, however,  some  electoral teams have not yet begun functioning due to a lack of  material conditions. He added that out of the 83 electoral  teams established in the province, only 61 are operating due to  problems of transportation and food faced by the electoral  officers. Some roads are also inaccessible.    Luis Mateus added that in Zumbo, Magoe, and Chifunde only  two  electoral teams are operating. Efforts are being made, however,  to acquire road and air transportation so that the remaining  electoral teams can leave for areas that are difficult to access.    He said, "we are very worried since we do not yet have  solutions for this problem. We are awaiting the arrival of a  light aircraft from Maputo, and we have been contacting various  organizations so that they can assist us with transportation."    He said that food and subsidy problems for the electoral  teams are still the main "Achilles' heel" in this process, and  according to him, the Provincial Electoral Commission is still  awaiting the funds to be channeled by the National Elections  Commission [CNE] according to recent pledges by that organ.  <H5>  Nampula Records About 300,000 Citizens </H5>   Meanwhile, eight days after the electoral registration  began,  Nampula Province recorded 293,795 citizens who have already  received their voter registration card at a time when, contrary  to what happened early, the electoral registration posts are  experiencing an unprecedented turn out of voters, although the  centers are still facing a number of problems.    All the districts in Nampula Province have given their  report  on the electoral registration process. The current figures,  which refer to registration up to 8 June, do not include all the  numbers for Monapo, Moma, and Namapa.    Furthermore, as a result of this, the number of electoral  registration centers has increased from 157 on 4 June to 266,  and another one which was not scheduled may be opened.    This one will operate in a Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] area between Nacaroa and Memba District. The  necessity of this was realized only now.    Pedro Fernandes Tauelia, a member of the Statistics  Department of the STAE [Elections Administration Technical  Secretariat] in Nampua said, "only lately did Renamo tell us  that in this area many people live far from the electoral posts  in both areas."    Moreover, Moma District has temporarily ceased being the  biggest electoral registration post. As of 8 June Memba  District became the biggest one, recording 137,878 registered  voters, followed by Meconta District which has already  registered 40,411 people.    Mozambique Isle is replacing Lalaua as the district with the  smallest number of registered voters. It recorded 780 people  who registered for the election.    Meanwhile, our newspaper has learned that the province has  just received a light aircraft to assist in the electoral  process in the north of the country.    The shortage of law and security personnel affecting the  area  has been overcome. A number of law and security personnel were  sent to Ribaue and Lalawe Districts today.    About 30,000 people have registered for the election in  government areas of Sofala Province, according to latest figures  of the Provincial Elections Commission. This number does not  include the Caia, Chemba, and Machanga Districts where voter  registration began late. There is no information on the  development of the process in those areas.    Reports from Beira say that the elections commission in this  city has decided to close down the registration post in  Chipangara ward, one of the most densely populated areas in the  capital city of Sofala Province.    The temporary closure was caused by the disappearance of two  inscription bulletins on 4 June, which were recovered on 6 June,  and the disappearance of 14 other bulletins, two of which were  also recovered on 6 June.    Dr. Samuel Elias, chairman of the Beira Elections  Commission,  said after the papers went missing for the first time "we  replaced the electoral team, thinking that it was their  negligence. On 7 June, however, the new electoral team was  physically and verbally assaulted by a group of five outlaws who  said: `Take all this rubbish. These are Renamo's maneuvers,  otherwise we will assault you.'"    Dr. Elias said, "this is happening because the police team  assigned to operate in that post is not operating. I spoke to  the head of the General Staff Police of the Republic of  Mozambique, and we hope they will investigate the issue and  inform us."    More than 10,000 people have already registered for the  election in Beira, excluding the figures from the Nhangau  administrative region, where the electoral registration process  has not yet begun due to transportation problems.    Available reports say that following Beira is Nhamatada,  which has registered more than 6,500 people in the nine posts it  established in the area (three in Renamo areas, where nothing  has been done yet), according to statements by District  Elections Commission Chairman Ernesto Sinamana.    Speaking to NOTICIAS in Nhamatanda, Ernesto Sinamana said a  huge number of citizens were flocking into the electoral  registration posts, and it is expected that a large number of  people will register over the next few days.    Regarding areas under the control of Afonso Dhlakama in  Nhamatanda -- namely, Mucombezi, Nhamphoca, and Chirassicua, and  others -- the process has not yet begun. It is expected that it  will begin as soon as the necessary security conditions have  been created.    Besides this security crisis, there is also the issue of  transportation, since some of these areas are very far.  Chirassicua, for instance, is 60 km from the capital of  Nhamatanda District.    Meanwhile, the World Food Program [WFP] will grant food aid  to more than 6,672 electoral officers all over the country,  according to the WFP Director Philip Clarke.</p>

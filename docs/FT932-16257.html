			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Increased seasonal work cuts unemployment in Germany Increased seasonal work cut unemployment in Germany last month to 3.3m, against almost 3.5m in February, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The unemployment rate in the west stood at 7.2 per cent in March, down from 7.5 per cent the previous month. In the east, increased activity in the construction sector led to a slight improvement, though the unemployment rate was still 15 per cent. Short-time work continued to rise. Nearly 20,000 more people were on short-time in the west in March, bringing the total to slightly over 1m. In the east, employees on short-time work increased by 11,000 to 246,000.</p>

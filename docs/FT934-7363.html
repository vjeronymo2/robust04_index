			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (4): High streets see most development  -The emphasis is on in-fill sites, because, although there is unlet property in most towns, much is unsuitable / The retail market THE RETAIL market, which led the way into the property recession, looks set to lead the way out. Having lost nearly a quarter of its value in the four years to May 1993, retail property values have begun to recover. Investment yields have declined sharply in many cases, while rental values have mostly stopped falling. Even the property development market is showing the first signs of a revival. But many parts of the market are still far from buoyant. Rents on older property in secondary locations are still declining in many parts of the country; empty and boarded-up shops dominate many high streets and shopping centres. So far, there is little sign of rental growth. The improved confidence on the part of landlords is chiefly a result of the reduced concessions they are now forced to offer. The average incentive offered to a new tenant has reduced from the equivalent of two years rent free to just nine months in the past two years, according to Erdman Lewis. The decline in the retail sector has been longer, but shallower, than other parts of the market. From the high point to the low point of the market, the fall in retail rents was 17 per cent, compared with 46 per cent for offices and 23 per cent for industrial. In the view of Healey &amp; Baker, rental growth is likely to resume in 1994 for prime retail space, before reaching a plateau in the second half of the decade as the growth in retail sales slows. As the market recovers, it expects there will be short, sharp increases as centres realign to higher demand, rather than a sustained upwards trend. The uncertainties governing rental prospects extend beyond the outlook for consumer spending. Much depends on the development cycle; the success of the new wave of discount stores could also have a marked impact on the high street. Development activity is currently at low ebb, but the improvement in the market may spur some developers to begin construction before planning permissions obtained in the late eighties expire. The main focus of development activity is in-fill sites in the high street. Even though there is an ample supply of unlet properties in most towns, some of this is deemed unsuitable because it is over-rented, poorly configured, too dilapidated or in a poor location. Outside town centres, development activity is currently subdued. Just 2.54m sq ft of shopping centre floorspace is currently under construction, less than 15 per cent of the 18.9m sq ft recorded at the peak of the 1980s development boom. The prospects of large out-of-town shopping centres winning planning permission in the future have been much reduced as a result of a hardening of the government's planning policies. Last year the Department of the Environment issued a new policy guidance note, known as PPG6, which emphasised the need to revitalise town centres, rather than promote large out-of-town stores. The prospects for construction in shopping centres that already have planning permission is mixed. Cheshire Oaks, the planned shopping centre outside Chester, suffered a setback in September when Boots pulled out as the joint developer. In Bristol, however, the Cribbs Causeway shopping centre is considered viable and is due to begin construction next Spring. The viability of new development depends on consumer confidence and the take-up of developments undertaken at the end of the 1980s. Conditions vary considerably around the country and in different sectors of the retail market. Central and suburban London remain among the worst-performing areas in the country, despite an upturn in interest from small multiple and independent retailers. Away from London, most shopping areas in the south-east have been stable in the first half of 1993, according to Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors. In the same period in the Midlands, south-west and Wales, rents were fairly stable; in East Anglia, feeble consumer demand resulted in a 3.1 per cent decline in rents in the first half of the year; in the north of England they fell declined slightly. Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen a good recovery in the past six months, with positive rental growth of 1.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively. Retail warehouses have been the best performing part of the property market. According to Erdman Lewis, chartered surveyors, total returns on an annualised basis at June were 31.2 per cent for retail warehouses, compared with 7.7 per cent for shops. The foodstore market has also performed strongly, although the low level of lettings makes its performance more difficult to assess. Demand is strong for sites in the best locations, as a result of the expansion programmes of the large store groups such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway. It remains to be seen how far their future is affected by the arrival of discount stores. In particular, the large store groups are concerned about the advance of warehouse clubs like CostCo, the US-style stores which specialise in bulk sales in out-of-town locations. The increasing emphasis on discounting is one factor that may hold back profitability and growth in parts of the retail business. However, given the constraints on new development and the improving prospects for consumer spending, the coming year is likely to see a restoration of rental growth.</p>

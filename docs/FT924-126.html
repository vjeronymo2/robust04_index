			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Sumitomo Metal in Y30bn deal SUMITOMO Metal Industries had the international bond markets all to itself yesterday for a Y30bn Euroyen issue through Yamaichi International (Europe). The bonds have the short first coupon indicative of bonds targetted for a rapid return to Japan. They are due to mature in April 2000 and carry a coupon of 5.3 per cent. Chartered WestLB said it has completed the private placement of fixed-rate medium-term notes for Alto Parana in Argentina, a private sector company described as the country's largest producer of softwood pulp. The paper has a maturity of two years with a put option at 18 months, and is priced to yield 12 1/2 per cent. The bank won the mandate to arrange a borrowing for up to Dollars 50m several months ago, and news of the terms and claims of a successful placement surprised bankers who specialise in the sector. The yield looks too high, they say. The company would be better off issuing commercial paper. 'We placed over 80 per cent with institutional and retail investors, mostly offshore,' said Bill Hayes, a managing director of Chartered WestLB in New York.</p>

Observers took this statement as an  implicit threat to the Palestinian people whose intifadah has  flared up and encompassed all cities, villages, and camps of the  West Bank and Gaza Strip and extended even to the 1948-occupied  territories.    The truth is that the Israeli prime minister is just as  responsible for the horrendous massacre as the Zionist settlers  who carried out the treacherous attack. Rabin is the one who  armed the settlers and gave them a free hand to commit  aggression in the occupied territories. He also refused, after  the massacre, to take deterrent measures to check the settlers'  activities and disarm them. Instead of punishing the war  criminals and bloody killers, he imposed a collective punishment  on the entire Palestinian people, subjected all of the occupied  territories to military siege, and instructed the occupation  troops to shoot indiscriminately. As a consequence, more than  20 martyrs from our Arab people have fallen in the wake of the  savage massacre. Dozens more were wounded. The list is  increasing everyday, and suppression is on the rise.    Rabin is indeed preparing for further massacres, since he  insists on incorporating the Zionist extremist Tzomet Party into  the government coalition and letting the well-known terrorist  and bloody leader of the Tzomet Party, Refa'el Eytan, take over  the Police Ministry.    Eytan is one of the most extremist Zionists. He is the one  who advocated mass expulsions of the Arabs and committing savage  massacres against them to drive them to emigrate immediately.  Therefore, the international community should take Rabin's  threats seriously and provide protection for the Palestinian  people in line with the Geneva Conventions and international  charters and principles.    By issuing such threats and making them a reality, Rabin not  only seeks to severely harm the Palestinian people, but also to  deliver a fatal blow to the Middle East peace process, entrench  occupation, and pursue schemes to Judaize the occupied Arab  territories and plant them with settlements.    We do not believe any of the influential parties on the  Security Council are unaware that the massacre has done great  damage to the peace process and that any new massacre will  undermine the peace process in its entirety. We also do not  believe that a single Security Council member is unaware that  Zionist settlers constitute a stumbling block to the achievement  of peace. A just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East  is impossible without the return of all the occupied Arab  territories, the evacuation of the settlers, and the Palestinian  people's guaranteed right to exercise their national rights,  foremost being their right to self- determination.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has again highlighted certain  facts that some people have forgotten or chosen to disregard.  One of these facts is that peace is impossible under occupation  and cannot coexist with settlement activity. Therefore, the  Security Council, which is discussing the question of this  region, is asked to assert the need for a full Israeli  withdrawal and for the evacuation the settlers and the  dismantling of the settlements in line with international  resolutions. These resolutions have always rejected occupation,  the acquisition of territory by force, settlement activity, and  Judaization of the land.    Today, peace depends on a decisive international stand and  true international credibility. Current and past events have  shown that the international community cannot continue to  disregard the reality of Zionist occupation and give the  criminal hand of Zionism a free rein in the occupied  territories. This would be an outright violation of  international charters and UN principles and would undermine the  peace process that has so far drowned in Arab blood shed at the  hands of Israel, its troops, and settlers.    The Arabs, who responded to the U.S. peace initiative and  accommodated all Security Council resolutions, have only reaped  bitterness and frustration. Such a situation is no longer  acceptable by Arab governments or by the Arab man in the street.  Unless effective international measures are taken to implement  the Security Council resolutions, effect the return the occupied  Arab territories, and ensure the liberation of the Palestinian  people from Zionist terrorism and oppression, the peace process  is liable to collapse into oblivion.</p>

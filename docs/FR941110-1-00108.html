			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers and any production of controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate that the transferor possesses, as of the date the transfer claim is processed, unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits sufficient to cover the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus one percent of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator will take action to notify the transferor and transferee as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits to cover the transfer claim the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to the transfer and will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended or credits by the amount to be transferred plus one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor and the transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended credits to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, either party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to a transfer claim within the three working days specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the transferor and transferee may proceed with the transfer. EPA will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits by the amount to be transferred plus one percent of that amount. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended credits to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Inter-pollutant conversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001 for Group VI, any person (``convertor'') may convert consumption allowances or production allowances for one class I controlled substance to the same type of allowance for another class I controlled substance within the group of controlled substances as the first as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a conversion claim setting forth the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The identity and address of the convertor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the convertor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The type of allowances being converted, including the names of the controlled substances for which allowances are to be converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances being converted pertains;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The amount and type of allowances to be converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The amount of allowances to be subtracted from the convertor's unexpended allowances for the first controlled substance, to be equal to 101 percent of the amount of allowances converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) The amount of allowances or to be added to the convertor's unexpended allowances for the second controlled substance, to be equal to the amount of allowances for the first controlled substance being converted multiplied by the quotient of the ozone depletion factor of the first controlled substance divided by the ozone depletion factor of the second controlled substance, as listed in Appendix A to this subpart;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (H) The control period(s) for which the allowances are being converted; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> KODAK TO CONSOLIDATE OPERATIONS  </P> <P> Eastman Kodak Co. today announced it will consolidate its four consumer  photography products and picture finishing systems operations, a move that will  result in the loss of several hundred jobs.  </P> <P> Company spokesman Paul Allen said by year's end the new division will join  together the consumer products, photo finishing systems and United States sales  divisions. It also will include the administrative service area within the  photo products group.  </P> <P> The move, part of Kodak's continued cost-cutting strategy, is an effort to  strengthen its consumer photography business.  </P> <P> "We do anticipate we'll have to cut our work force by several hundred, but we  don't know exactly how many at this point. We'll have a better fix on that by  the end of the summer," said Allen.  </P> <P> The job cuts would occur in support areas and would be primarily confined to  the company's Rochester headquarters, said Allen. "There will be no major  impact in the field among our sales force or at our manufacturing facilities,"  Allen said.  </P></p>

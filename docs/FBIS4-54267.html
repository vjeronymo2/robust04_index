			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Are We Progressing or Retrogressing? When Will </F> We Really Make It?"]    [Text] After the elections were held, the National Assembly  formed, the Constitution drafted and passed, the king enthroned,  and the Royal Government set up, the Cambodian people have hoped  that with all of these accomplishments the country would at last  enjoy peace, there would be happiness and security, and myriad  foreign firms would flock in to invest in various fields, thus  creating employment opportunities, educational and training  facilities, and enabling Cambodians to rebuild their country and  catch up with other more civilized nations.    What has happened, however, has been different from the  expectations. It is observed that at present the politicians are  busy quarreling with one another and political parties have  nothing but mistrust for one another. Sometimes, people in the  same party do not even speak the same language.    The fighting on the Anlung Veng and Pailin battlefields has  produced no clear result; the proposal of a roundtable for  national reunification and reconciliation has met with many  obstacles; the economic law principles have yet to be  promulgated; more and more foreign investors have pulled out  because they are afraid to stay; the number of freighters  bringing goods to the ports has gradually declined; tourist  attractions have become very quiet, unlike what they used to be  not so long ago; while battles at the front have intensified and  each side has resorted to greater and greater savagery in  retaliating against one another.    When will the leaders of the political groups stop their  bickering and join hands in national economic reconstruction  efforts, as they pledged to do when they were begging for aid at  the Tokyo ICORC [International Conference on the Reconstruction  of Cambodia] conference?    At a time when the government cannot eliminate the Khmer  Rouge and the Khmer Rouge refuse to take part in reconstruction,  it is the people who suffer so badly. It is these ongoing  disputes and wars between Cambodians that have deprived us of  economic gain and completely stalled progress.    The new Olympic market problem remains unresolved; the old  Olympic market continues to spill into the streets, thus  severely blocking traffic; the state airline continues to be  stranded; and a number of petroleum companies, such as Total,  are forced to wait and wait for answers from the government.  Will there be any other investors coming in if the situation,  the economic stability of the country, continues like this?    Nevertheless, while some companies are visibly hesitant, a  few others are optimistic enough to carry on, such as Golden Sea  Shipping, which provides express transportation in the  provinces; PAD, which takes charge of the city's garbage  disposal operations; and a U.S. electric power company. These  companies are carrying on as if nothing serious is happening.    We do not know we will see an economy which truly serves  development, or when an economic authority can be set up by the  government to thrust the country forward. This is because  people can see that the government is spending the bulk of its  energy and funds on ensuring its own political and  security-military stability. This is a factor that has stunted  the growth of the economic authority, preventing it from  becoming the decisive factor. We would like to know when will  the investment law, the trade law, and the concept of giving  priority to economic infrastructure all take effect so we can  truly activate Cambodia's economy.</p>

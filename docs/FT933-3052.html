			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Delors suggests bringing back capital controls MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday raised the possibility of a partial reintroduction of controls on the movement of capital, to combat the sort of currency speculation that led to this summer's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. 'Cars are free to drive,' said Mr Delors, the original animator of the economic and monetary union project, 'but they are subject to traffic rules. I see no reason why at international level we shouldn't study means of limiting monetary traffic.' Mr Delors suggested that the safeguard clauses in the EC directive on the free movement of capital could be used by the 12 member states in concert. 'Why can't what one country does be done by all together?' he argued. The free movement of capital is one of the foundation stones of the European single market, but Mr Delors seemed to imply that what he was putting forward would not conflict with internal market rules. The safeguard clauses in Article 3 of the directive, which, for instance, allow member states temporarily to impose reserve requirements on lending to currency purchasers, were used by Spain and Ireland last year in vain attempts to avert devaluation. Mr Delors was speaking at a European Parliament debate on monetary policy, where calls for capital controls were made on the eve of today's first anniversary of the forced departure of sterling and the lira from the ERM. But his suggestions were swiftly countered by Mr Phillipe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium, which currently presides over the EC. Mr Maystadt said 'reintroducing barriers to the movement of capital would be contrary to our objectives', of completing the single European market and reaching Emu. But Mr Maystadt himself has recently stressed the need for vigorous measures to rebuild the ERM, ' to prevent speculative shocks' as he put it yesterday, and get Emu back on track. European monetary officials have suggested that with the possible exception of the Belgians, there was no enthusiasm for the reintroduction of exchange controls at this week's meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, reiterated his scepticism about the introduction of capital controls when talking to leading financial and industrial figures earlier this week. Asked whether he thought capital controls should be introduced as a means of stabilising exchange rates, Mr Clarke said: 'My advice is, forget it.' Currency analysts were also highly critical yesterday of Mr Delors' comments.</p>

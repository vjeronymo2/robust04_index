			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS SHOW SIGNS OF LIFE IN 9-3 VICTORY  </P> <P> Maybe the management of the Sockers should consider making trades more  frequently.  </P> <P> A week ago, the Sockers shipped temperamental forward Zoran Karic off to chilly  Cleveland in exchange for Paul Wright, a speedy 20-year-old forward who slipped  through the Sockers' fingers during last summer's free agent draft. The  question begging an answer was whether it was worth swapping a guy who led the  team in scoring during the regular season last year for a second-year player  who played infrequently as a rookie.  </P> <P> Tuesday night before a San Diego Sports Arena crowd of just 5,538 -- the fewest  at home since 5,525 watched a game with Dallas on Feb. 3, 1987 -- the Sockers  defeated the St. Louis Storm, 9-3.  </P> <P> Draw your own conclusion.  </P> <P> One game is only a small indicator that this was a smart trade. But, if nothing  else, it was proof that there is life left in a team that seemed ready for the  Major Indoor Soccer League obituary page less than three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that the Storm (19-21) had defeated the Sockers (17-21) in four of  six meetings before Tuesday night. Also keep in mind that we're talking about a  Socker team that had previously won by more than four goals only once this  season, and only once had scored nine goals.  </P> <P> So there were a lot of happy Socker faces by the time rookie forward Rod Castro  scored 58 seconds into the fourth quarter to give the Sockers the final goal of  their offensive party. They were talking with renewed zest in the locker room  minutes after the final ball was played.  </P> <P> "We've got the team that should be playing right now," defender George  Fernandez said. "Everybody feels good about themselves."  </P> <P> The coach feels good, too.  </P> <P> "That should make a few people sit up and take notice around the league," Coach  Ron Newman said. "It was great. There was no slackness tonight."  </P> <P> How did the Sockers pile up so many goals? Let us count the ways.  </P> <P> Midfielder Waad Hirmez started things in the first quarter, followed by  midfielder Branko Segota and forward Jim Gabarra. The first quarter ended with  the Sockers ahead, 3-0.  </P> <P> Second quarter. Gabarra scores again, his seventh of the season. Midfielder  Thompson Usiyan scores for St. Louis to make it 4-1.  </P> <P> Third quarter. Hirmez starts things off again with a goal off a restart kick  from Wright. Segota scores the next two goals for a hat trick and a 7-1 Socker  lead. Segota now has 700 points in his MISL career.  </P> <P> "I was due," Segota said. "I've been hitting the post and crossbar all year.  I've also had minor injuries that have slowed me down a little. I feel good  now. I had 10 days off to take care of the knicks and knacks."  </P> <P> A few minutes after Segota polished off his hat trick, Gabarra made it 8-1 a to  pick up one of his own, the second of his MISL career. Then, after Castro  scored, St. Louis got late goals from midfielders Daryl Doran and Claudio De  Oliveira.  </P> <P> Though he only collected one assist, Wright's presence was felt. The Sockers  suddenly have quick, fresh feet at the midfield position, which allows Segota  to play forward and take his hacks at the goal. From now on, opponents of the  Sockers will keep a nervous eye on Wright as they double-team Segota.  </P> <P> "I think they have to worry about his speed," Segota said. "By playing up  front, I'm more effective. When you go back and forth and then you still have  to battle the double-coverage, it's tough."  </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> Despite a season filled with ups and downs, the Sockers are still talking with  the confidence of champions. Asked about the playoffs, defender Kevin Crow  said, "I don't see anybody that's going to beat us in a series. A lot of guys  on our team, right, wrong or indifferent, are in the habit of looking at their  calendar on October 1st and saying 'Man, the season goes all the way to April.'  It's hard for some of our guys to play at a high level the whole season. But  they can suck it up for short periods of time, and that's what happens in the  playoffs." Midfielder Brian Quinn missed his fifth consecutive game with  tendinitis of the groin, which he said will probably keep him out of weekend  games with Kansas City and Baltimore. Also not in uniform Tuesday was veteran  forward Steve Zungul and forward Damir Haramina, out with strained a  quadriceps.  </P></p>

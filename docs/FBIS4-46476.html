			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "First Russo-Kuwaiti Exercises"] </F>   [Text] A joint exercise of warships of Russia and Kuwait  was held in the period from 25 to 29 December 1993 in accordance  with an agreement between these states. Participants from the  Russian Navy included the large ASW ship "Admiral Vinogradov,"  the large assault-landing ship "N. Vilkov" and the tanker "V.  Kolechitskiy"; participants from the Kuwaiti Navy included the  missile boat "Istiqlal," eight coastal defense launches and two  F-18 airplanes.    The exercise plan foresaw joint maneuvering of ships,  communication training, search and rescue of disaster victims,  detention and examination of a vessel, artillery firing on  water-surface and airborne targets, and joint conditional  strikes against an enemy assault landing detachment undergoing  sealift.    On 28 December the progress of the exercise was kept under  observation by Major General A. Al-Mumin [transliteration],  chief of staff of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces, who gave a high  assessment to the combat proficiency of the crews of our ships.    On 30 December, summarizing the results of the exercise  aboard the large ASW ship "Admiral Vinogradov," Admiral F.  Gromov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, noted that  Kuwaiti and Russian seamen, who successfully completed all of  their missions, are honorably continuing the traditions of naval  cooperation between our countries, established long ago by the  legendary cruiser "Varyag," which entered the port of Al-Kuwait  in 1901 to open a Russian consulate there.    Kuwaiti Navy acting commander Lieutenant Colonel M. Yakut  expressed deep satisfaction in the high organization and results  of the first joint exercises of the two countries which, he  emphasized, were a good school for Kuwaiti seamen.    Captain 1st Rank A. Yakovlev, who directed the exercise,  read  the names of servicemen who distinguished themselves in the  course of the combat exercises. On the Russian side these were  Captain 1st Rank V. Chernyavskiy, commander of the large ASW  ship "Admiral Vinogradov"; A. Denisov, captain of the tanker "V.  Kolechitskiy"; Captain 1st Rank V. Andreyev and Captain 3d Rank  A. Demin, officers of the operational staff; the crew of the  helicopter under the command of Lieutenant Colonel T. Guzoirov;  Captain-Lieutenant V. Kanev, department commander; the examining  team headed by Captain A. Kozlovskiy; Petty Officer 1st Class A.  Sorokin, commander of a signal detachment. On the Kuwait side  these were primarily the crew of the missile boat "Istiqlal" and  its commander, Major Mansur.    After a short rest in Al-Kuwait, where our seamen celebrated  the New Year, the detachment of ships of the Russian Navy  returned to sea to participate in Gulfex-22 joint exercises with  ships of the American, English and French navies held in the  Persian Gulf.

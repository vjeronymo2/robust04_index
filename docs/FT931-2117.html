			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Leading Article: US and Europe IF SAVING the Russian reform process is now the most urgent issue for discussion between the US and its European allies, saving the Uruguay Round and averting a global slide into protectionism is hardly less so. Indeed, the two issues are closely connected. In the immediate crisis, a heated argument over trade issues would distract political leaders from the Russian problem and make it harder for them to agree on a plan of action. In the longer term, the west's ability to help Russia (or indeed anyone else) will be badly impaired, and the effect of any help it does give more than offset, if old and new trade barriers are allowed to impede a global recovery. Both issues involve, or should involve, Japan as much as North America and western Europe. But the Atlantic alliance is much more firmly rooted in a shared cultural heritage, as well as being embodied in a more solid institutional framework, than the trilateral relationship - or for that matter either of the other legs of the triangle taken by itself. The Atlantic alliance was the backbone of the free world in the cold war. The best hope for a post-cold war world order worth the name lies in its continuation, and indeed the gradual extension of its shared values and procedures, if not its specific institutions, to at least the main industrial powers of the northern hemisphere. But continuation cannot mean simply leaving it alone, on the principle of 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'. The alliance in its familiar form was a direct response to the twin challenges of Soviet military power and what President Truman called 'the menace of communism as an idea, as an egalitarian, dynamic social force'. Both are now dead, or at any rate so diminished that fear of them is no longer enough to hold the western democracies together. The new challenges facing Europe and North America, and the reasons why they require a joint effort, need to be clearly articulated by leaders on both sides of the Atlantic if their peoples are to make that effort. A common strategy has to be worked out, and the institutions of the alliance need to be adapted to the new tasks. On the security side a start has been made, with the creation of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council (bringing Nato members together with their former adversaries), and the placing of Nato's resources at the disposal of the UN for peacekeeping, and perhaps soon for peace enforcement, duties. But much more needs to be done, above all on the political and economic side where the EC - soon, let us hope, the European Union - is the proper interlocutor of the US. Last week's meeting between President Clinton and Mr Jacques Delors showed that seemingly intractable differences can be overcome, or at least contained, when political will is applied at the highest level. The relationship needs much more sustained attention on that level if it is to flourish.</p>

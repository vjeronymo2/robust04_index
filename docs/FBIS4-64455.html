			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flying Brigades Begin Controls"] </F>   [Text] Around 200 military police began carrying out  controls this morning on foreigners who cross the border from  Germany and Belgium. Checks are also being carried out on  international trains. This monitoring is the result of  agreements reached between the government and Second Chamber in  order to halt the increase in the number of illegal foreigners  entering the Netherlands. It principally concerns people who  enter the Netherlands illegally or asylum-seekers who have no  chance of receiving a residence permit. The so-called flying  brigades will be in action 24 hours a day.</p>

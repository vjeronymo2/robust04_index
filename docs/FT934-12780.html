			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lloyd's broker coming to market with Pounds 60m tag NELSON HURST, an insurance broker which specialises in professional indemnity in the Far East and Latin America, aims to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange in the next few months. The group expects to raise about Pounds 30m in fresh capital through the flotation, which is expected to value it at about Pounds 60m. The listing follows a management buy-out from Citicorp - Nelson's former owners - two years ago, and is designed to give the group greater financial flexibility. It is one of a number announced by companies in the insurance sector in recent weeks. One rival broker, the Fenchurch group, has announced plans to list its insurance broking interests with a flotation expected next month. Separate Independent Insurers will become the first insurance company to float since the second world war. About a dozen new investment trusts are turning to the equity market to raise more than Pounds 1bn for syndicates of Lloyd's of London before the end of the year. Nelson Hurst, the 13th largest broker in the UK, and the 26th largest broker in the world, derives about 30 per cent of its income from the Lloyd's market. It specialises in buying insurance for professionals such as solicitors and accountants to cover them against legal awards for negligence. In addition the group has expertise in Latin America, where its clients include the operators of the Panama Canal. Some Pounds 23m of the fresh capital raised through the flotation will be used to repay loans made by Citicorp. Advent, the US venture capital company which owns about 30 per cent of Nelson Hurst, is expected to reduce its stake. But Mr David Woodward, chief executive, does not expect management and staff to sell shares in significant amounts. After flotation, management and staff are expected to own about 30 per cent of the group while Advent's stake will amount to about 15 per cent. The group has steadily improved its performance in the past two years with revenues rising from Pounds 26.9m in 1990 to Pounds 28.3m in 1991 and Pounds 31.3m in 1992. Operating profits reached Pounds 3.8m in 1992, compared with Pounds 2.8m in 1991. Further improvement is on the cards this year with operating profits for the first seven months amounting to Pounds 3.8m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Containment capability and releases of radioactivity for accident sequences during shutdown are also evaluated as part of the regulatory analysis. From that work, the NRC has concluded that an intact containment will effectively prevent early releases from shutdown accidents. Large, dry PWR containments should remain intact if closed before being challenged. Severe core-damage accidents in open containments or in containments that fail are expected to have offsite consequences similar to severe core-damage accidents initiating from power operations. Onsite consequences within a few hundred meters of open or failed containments may be more severe at shutdown than at power. The potential dose to the public for a severe core-damage accident without an effective containment was estimated to be 2E+06 person-rem (2E+04 person-Sv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for Commission Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC proposes to resolve concerns regarding shutdown and low-power operations by rulemaking that would require power reactor licensees to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Assure that uncontrolled changes in reactivity, reactor coolant inventory, and loss of subcooled state in the reactor coolant system when subcooled conditions are normally being maintained, will not occur when the plant is in either a shutdown or low-power condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assure that containment integrity is maintained or can be reestablished in a timely manner as needed to prevent releases in excess of the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 when the plant is in either a shutdown or low-power condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Identify that equipment necessary to make the reactor subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain it subcritical in a shutdown condition, and establish controls in either technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3) or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5) for that equipment such that they will ensure each safety function when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Prior to (and throughout the shutdown refueling outage as necessary to accommodate unforeseen contingencies) entering cold shutdown or a refueling condition, evaluate realistically available fire-protection features and the outage plan for possible fires stemming from activities conducted during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, determine whether such fires could realistically prevent accomplishment of the normal decay heat removal capability during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, and if so, either take measures to prevent loss of normal decay heat removal by such fires during cold shutdown or a refueling condition, or have a contingency plan in place that will ensure an alternate decay heat removal capability exists and that will describe the general steps to connect the alternate decay heat removal system to the reactor coolant system (RCS); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) For licensees of PWRs only, provide instrumentation for monitoring water level in the RCS during midloop operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical basis for the NRC's staff's position is derived from the NRC staff's comprehensive evaluation of shutdown and low-power issues in NUREG&hyph;1449, ``Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants in the United States.'' NUREG&hyph;1449 was published as a draft report for comment in February 1992. The comment period on the draft NUREG&hyph;1449 ended on April 30, 1992, and a large number of comments were received from utilities and industry organizations. The NRC staff addressed the comments in the final report (NUREG&hyph;1449) which was issued in September 1993. The principal findings from NUREG&hyph;1449 that support the NRC regulatory position in this proposed rule are the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Accident sequences during shutdown can be as rapid and severe as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during power operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All PWR containments and BWR (boiling-water reactor) Mark III primary containments are capable of offering significant protection if the containment is closed or can be closed quickly. However, analyses show that the steam and radiation environment in the containment, which can result from an extended loss of DHR or LOCA, would make it difficult to close the containment in many cases. BWR Mark I and II secondary containments offer less protection against an accident, but this is offset by a significantly lower likelihood of core damage in BWRs than in PWRs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Outage planning is crucial to safety during shutdown conditions since it establishes (a) if and when a licensee will enter circumstances likely to challenge safety functions and (b) the level of mitigation equipment available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Using technical specifications to control the availability of safety-related equipment is appropriate because (i) operators are trained and accustomed to operating the facility in accordance with approved procedures within the clear limits set by technical specifications and (ii) technical specifications establish clear and enforceable regulatory requirements. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NUREG&hyph;1449 analysis only addressed the use of technical specifications for control of specific equipment relied upon during shutdown and low-power operations. The proposed rule allows for incorporation of controls using either technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c) (2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Although maintenance activities that can increase the potential for fire are performed during shutdown, current NRC requirements in the area of fire protection do not apply to shutdown conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brandenburg (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl [Christian Democratic Union -- CDU] today affirmed  his vision of "flourishing scenes" in the five new laender. At  a CDU election campaign rally in Brandenburg, Kohl said that his  prediction of five years [for the eastern laender to catch up  with the west] could perhaps stretch to "seven or eight, but  basically I have not been mistaken." At the same time the  chancellor called for more tolerance between west and east  Germans, since the people in the two parts of Germany had gone  through different developments in the past 40 years.    In his speech, which was disrupted repeatedly by applause  and  whistling, Kohl said that safeguarding peace and freedom and  fighting mass unemployment were the most important objectives of  European unification. Kohl also called for joint European  efforts to solve the asylum problem and combat international  crime. [passage omitted]</p>

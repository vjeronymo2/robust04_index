			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Fund reduces forecast of global growth THE International Monetary Fund has found little to cheer about in the five months since it last produced a forecast on the world economy. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook says global economic activity showed signs of revival in the first half of this year and it projects continued recovery 'at a moderate pace' over the next 12 months. However, the fund has trimmed its expectations of world output growth this year by 0.3 percentage points since May, to 1.1 per cent, and cut its growth projection for 1993 by 0.4 points to 3.1 per cent. It warns: 'The expansion continues to be slow and uneven, and the balance of risks remains on the downside.' The IMF attributes this state of affairs largely to the failure of its industrialised member countries to achieve important goals in the medium-term growth strategies they set for themselves in the 1980s. While progress has been made towards reducing inflation, the record in other areas - such as cutting government deficits to encourage savings and investment, job creation through structural reform and the elimination of obstacles to efficient resource allocation - 'has been disappointing'. The IMF laments the persistence of large budget deficits in many member states. 'Major efforts to reduce fiscal imbalances are urgently required in many countries to improve confidence and strengthen prospects for sustained growth over the medium term.' It remains particularly concerned about conditions in the US. The underlying US deficit 'remains unsustainably large,' it says. The deficit 'rules out discretionary fiscal expansion, which under current circumstances would only put more pressure on interest rates and undermine confidence further'. It calls for 'a determined new effort to reduce the federal budget deficit in the US'. Although there is widespread speculation that the US Federal Reserve could cut US interest rates again before the presidential election in November, the IMF warns that such action 'would not now seem necessary'. Instead, the US authorities should be prepared to let interest rates rise as the US recovery strengthens, 'to help keep aggregate demand on a sustainable path'. The IMF's interest rate advice reflects a very jaundiced view of the way in which monetary aggregates are working in the three leading economies - those of the US, Japan and Germany. Variations in the three nations' yield curves and shifts in investments between various types of bank deposits mean that the money supply figures targeted by the authorities are failing to give clear signals. In what amounts to an appeal to the Bundesbank in Germany to pursue a less dogmatic approach to monetary policy, the IMF says: 'At this juncture, monetary aggregates in all three countries do not provide an unambiguous guide for the conduct of monetary policy; the authorities must therefore rely on a wider range of indicators.' The IMF would like Germany, as well as the US, to tackle its fiscal deficits. 'An early reduction of the budget deficit will be essential to reduce the pressure on inflation and on interest rates,' it says. About the only industrialised country to emerge with much credit from the IMF's report is Japan. The IMF says that country's medium-term outlook remains strong. In particular, Japan has prepared well for pressure on its public finances associated with the ageing of its population. This fiscal policy success should enable the government in Tokyo to focus more attention on structural reforms in such areas as financial markets, competition policy, agriculture and land management.

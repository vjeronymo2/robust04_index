			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the latest reports from 'Afula, eight  people were killed in the car bomb explosion, apparently  including the terrorist who drove the car. More than 50 people  were wounded in the explosion. Five people who were gravely  wounded were transferred to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, where  one of them died of her wounds. Another four wounded are  currently being transferred to the Tel Hashomer Hospital. Eight  of the wounded were released; 33 people were hospitalized in the  'Afula Hospital with light to moderate injuries.    Police Minister Shahal and Police Commissioner Peled arrived  at the scene. Minister Shahal said that since the Hebron  massacre the Police feared Arab terrorist attacks, and several  attacks were indeed foiled. Commissioner Peled said that it is  possible that as of tomorrow no vehicles from the territories  will be allowed entrance into the Green Line, because it is  inconceivable that Israel would allow inhabitants of the  territories to enter the Green Line to carry out attacks. The  issue of the closure will also be reassessed. The commissioner  added that the timing of the attack -- 40 days after the Hebron  massacre -- did not surprise the police, which were recently  reinforced along the Green Line and in Jerusalem.    Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that the car used for  the explosion was stolen from the Tel Aviv area. Migdal Ha'emeq  [a town near 'Afula] residents have started to congregate en  masse, and the police are acting to prevent acts of revenge.</p>

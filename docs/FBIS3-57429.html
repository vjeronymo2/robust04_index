			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1337 GMT on 25 January, in its "At First Hand" program,  carries an interview with Russia's Choice Chairman Yegor Gaydar  by Radio Rossii correspondent Konstantin Revenko in Gaydar's  office on 24 January.    The first question is on Gaydar's present title and  position,  to which Yegor Gaydar says: "First, I am a deputy and the head,  the chairman, of the Russia's Choice faction. I resigned from  all kinds of state duties and I am heading on a voluntary basis  the scientific work at the institute of economic policy, [word  indistinct], it is called the Institute of Economic Problems of  the Transitional Period." He recalls that the institute was set  up in 1991.    Asked why the government in general and Gaydar in particular  were so unwilling to explain to the people where Russia was  going and what was happening, Gaydar acknowledges that it had  been "a serious fault." He goes on to say: "Our work was very  hectic in 1992 . The state had practically collapsed and one  had a permanent feeling that if one were to stop working for  just five minutes, things would simply slip through one's  hands." He continues: "The main problem of 1992 and 1993 was  that we failed to convince, failed to explain some simple  things, thus giving opportunities and freedom of action to  demagogues and liars."    Asked to assess the state of the Russian economy at the time  when Gaydar "fled," as the correspondent put it, Gaydar says "I  did not flee anywhere, I left to do my own things." He  continues: "The funny thing is that those who spent two years  seeking my resignation are now speaking of the harm my  resignation did." He further says: "There were many questions  on the reasons for my resignation. I understand that some  people have no shame at all. They are prepared to implement any  policy and they are not ashamed of any decisions. I simply  cannot understand how one can retain one's human dignity and at  the same time justify a policy which allows no money for  resolving the problem of nuclear waste -- which we are dumping  in the world ocean -- but which allows 20 times as much money  for the construction of a major administrative building given  that two parliaments, two governments, the union and the  republican government and party bodies have ceased to exist in  Moscow."  "Well, I cannot be held responsible for a policy such as  this," says Gaydar, adding that what Russia needs is "a  cost-conscious, inexpensive state with few officials whose  rights should be restricted." He says that instead of  arbitrarily handing out grants, licenses, and subsidies, they  should elaborate rules to be adhered to in all cases and control  their observance.  He says that there are those who think Russia needs a large  state which actively interferes in the economy, with a large  army of officials and in times of trouble Russia has often  reacted in this manner. He says that it sometimes yielded  results, but it often led Russian into a historical blind alley  from which it was extremely difficult to extricate itself.    "It is my deep conviction that the time has now come for us  to extricate ourselves from this blind alley we are in and to  proceed along a path which has actually ensured success for a  majority of civilized states, where society is dominant over the  state, rather than the other way around." Acknowledging that  this was a problem for Russia, Gaydar said it must be tackled.  "An army of corrupt officials, in cahoots with a part of the  new bourgeoisie that is interested in receiving handouts from  them represents the factor that is capable of paralyzing through  and through any potential for development, simultaneously  exacerbating constantly the most acute social problems,  inequality, and dissatisfaction", he said.    Asked about the current situation, Gaydar said he is "deeply  convinced that despite all the tremendous difficulties we are  now coming up against, despite the whole seriousness of the  current situation, the situation is, of course, much better than  at the end of 1991." He says that at the end of 1991, Russia  had enough grain to last until February and Russia was  completely dependent on imports. This year Russia has major  grain reserves, although there are various marketing  difficulties.    Continuing his comparison, Gaydar says that "hard currency  reserves as at the end of 1991 were nil; there were no hard  currency reserves at all, while as at the end of 1993 they  amounted to $4.5 billion" and these "modest" reserves ensured  that we could pay for up to two months of imports. "We have a  major trade surplus and for the first time Russia ceased to  depend on many imports," Gaydar says, adding that this created  preconditions for further stabilization.    He further says: "We left the country in a situation in  which wages are $100 per month. This is not an indicator of  greater prosperity and it would not be correct to regard it as  such, because wages measured in dollars, of course, fail to  reflect greater prosperity, but it is indicative of the  stabilization of our domestic currency and of the extent to  which the country's economy has become a part of the world  market."    Hyperinflation causes wages to fall to around $10 per month  as is currently the case in the former Yugoslavia and in Ukraine  and as was the case in Russia at the end of 1991 "when wages  amounted to seven dollars per month." "In December inflation  amounted to 12 percent, a record low," Gaydar adds.    Defense orders used to play a tremendous role in the  country's economy which has now adapted itself to a much lower  level of these orders and is geared much more towards consumer  needs which will improve in quality as they have to compete with  high quality foreign consumer goods. This process of economic  restructuring is only in its inception, but it is a promising  trend, Gaydar claims.    Gaydar then states that demilitarization of the economy  altered supply and demand and what is now needed is to finance  investments in the economy. He feels this can be done through  increased taxation and that the state "is currently taking a lot  of taxpayers' money for itself, because we have a huge defense  expenditure, reduced a bit, but you can not reduce it all in one  go; one must realize this quite clearly. We continue to have  serious expenditure to finance an ineffective agriculture and we  have a whole lot of serious structural problems in the economy  and it is not possible to cope with all this in one go and in  conditions such as these to finance an ambitious and large-scale  program of economic restructuring into the bargain is simply  tantamount to making taxes prohibitive and such taxation does  not exist." But economic investments can also be financed  through voluntary contributions from the population, as is the  case in Japan, where the state's investments in the economy are  minimal, but where people save a lot and their money, through  the banking system, is invested in the economy, Gaydar explains.    Gaydar continues: "If I was asked when will the Russian  economy begin to grow, my answer would be, quite simply, that  this process will start when voluntary savings of the population  begin to increase substantially in our country." This would not  be possible if inflation devalued savings by 20 percent a month.  "So, when we say that we need to stop price increases, it is  not because we are some kind of blinkered idealists, but because  we simply do know how development of production is financed, as  distinct, perhaps, from our opponents," Gaydar says. Inflation  endangers production growth, but Gaydar says he is not overly  inclined to believe that an economic disaster was looming,  because the market mechanisms are in place and, he states, "I do  not believe that the current Government will start making one  silly and fatal error after another." Gaydar says he does not  believe that the government would cause hyperinflation in the  country, nor does he believe that the dollar would reach 20,000  rubles.    Asked about his forecasts, Gaydar says: "I think that the  new government's policy will, to a large extent, be a policy of  vacillation. The government will endeavor to hold inflation in  check and, at the same time, overcome by a passionate desire to  increase production, before pre-conditions have been created for  this to happen, the government will throw all its resources  towards supporting individual industries, especially when it  finds itself under powerful lobby pressure. It will hand out  promises of financial support and will subsequently come up  against tremendous difficulties, unable to fulfill its promises.  It will vacillate between a sharp increase in protectionism and  the necessity of ensuring that consumers' elementary interests  are met. In short, it seems to me that this policy will be very  difficult to form, subject to powerful pressures and that it  will, to a large extent, be a contradictory policy". This  policy can preserve the present status quo in which inflation is  not high enough to destroy the fiscal system and bring market  mechanisms to a standstill and nor is it sufficiently low to  stimulate growth through savings being invested in the national  economy. He says that against this backdrop some officials can  be in cahoots with a part of the new bourgeoisie, interested in  the emergence of a protectionist, paternalistic state.    He concludes by saying that Russia is facing a choice  between  the all-powerful state endeavoring to solve the problem of  economic development and breaking out of the "vicious circle of  our history," making the state serve society and creating an  open and competitive economy.</p>

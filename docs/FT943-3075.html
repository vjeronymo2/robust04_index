			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shrinking surplus puts platinum level The platinum market is likely to be in balance this year for the first time since 1989, according to Mr Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, the world's second-biggest producer. Persistent supply surpluses in the past four years have depressed prices. Now Impala is forecasting that last year's surplus of 365,000 troy oz will fall to 80,000 oz. Mr McMahon suggested yesterday that even this potential surplus might be eroded because car companies - the biggest users of platinum - had been re-stocking at a greater rate than Impala had anticipated. Over-supply hit the market after South African producers increased capacity following a surge in prices to nearly Dollars 550 an ounce in the late 1980s. Impala's own expansion plans have been substantially reduced and two platinum mines in which it has an interest - Kennedy's Vale and Crocodile River - have been mothballed, while development of the Messina project has been suspended. Mr McMahon said it would take about three years to bring the two mines back into production. Although the industry could look forward to 'steady but unexciting' growth in demand for platinum, 'this is a commodity-type industry now and there are ore reserves that can be brought into production to stop us getting too fat and happy'. In this context, the decision of BHP, Australia's biggest group, to proceed with a platinum mine in Zimbabwe was 'misguided,' suggested Mr McMahon. Platinum reached a 3 1/2 -year peak of Dollars 430 (Pounds 277) an ounce in July. Last night the price closed in London at Dollars 417.50.</p>

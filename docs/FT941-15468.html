			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: SHL seeks CDollars 50m fresh equity SHL Systemhouse, a fast-expanding international computer services group, says it is improving profitability and hopes to raise at least CDollars 50m (USDollars 38m) in new equity. Net profit was CDollars 4.7m, or 9 cents a share, for the first quarter ended November 30, up from CDollars 300,000, or 1 cent, a year earlier. Operating revenues advanced 54 per cent to CDollars 135m, with strong growth continuing in outsourcing business. The order backlog was CDollars 1.5bn at November 30. SHL operates in north America, Europe and Asia, and recently acquired a minority stake in a Korean outsourcing firm. The group, which is carrying heavy long-term debt, reported a loss after restructuring charges for the year ended August 31 and shuffled senior management. A large US shareholder and Canadian institutions have criticised SHL's proposed executive stock option plan, the issue of two new preferred stock classes and a USDollars 20m loan convertible into SHL common. The investors argue that these moves would result in excessive dilution for existing stockholders and that management was already well paid.</p>

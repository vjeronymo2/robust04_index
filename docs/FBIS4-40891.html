			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Ukrainian Navy Commander Borys </F> Kozhyn, member of the Ukrainian Supreme Council Commission for  Issues of Defense and National Security, by Oleksiy Dashkovskyy;  place and date not given: "Kravchuk's Last Chance"]    [Text] "President Leonid Kravchuk, accompanied by his  high-level ministers, should go to the Crimea immediately to  resolve all questions, including problems of the Black Sea  Fleet," former Ukrainian Navy Commander Borys Kozhyn, member of  both the Rukh faction and Supreme Council Commission for Issues  of Defense and National Security, has told our correspondent.    [Dashkovskyy] As everybody knows, the latest negotiations in  Moscow on the division of the Black Sea Fleet did not produce  any results. Negotiations between expert groups, at the level  of naval commanders, have recently begun in Sevastopol. What  position should Ukraine assume to avoid the role of a "younger  sister," and simultaneously, to conclude previous agreements?    [Kozhyn] Our state should stand on a position of parity and  not allow Russian representatives to dictate their terms,  because all military units deployed on Ukrainian territory  belong to our state, and this relates to the Black Sea Fleet,  first and foremost. When the fleet finally belongs to us not  only de jure but also de facto, our goal will be for an  appropriate Supreme Council commission to decide which  commitments, concerning guarantees for security and  inviolability of borders, Russia should undertake. Only after  that is done will it be possible to talk about certain  reasonable compromises.    [Dashkovskyy] At a closed session of the Supreme Council,  Leonid Kravchuk spoke in favor of transferring control of  Sevastopol's naval base and onshore infrastructure to Russia...    [Kozhyn] The president voiced his opinion on the situation,  but the final decision is to be made by the Supreme Council.  Personally, I am against such a transfer, because the one who  rules Sevastopol and its naval base, dominates the Black Sea.  Besides, everyone should respect international agreements.  Soon after the 1991 Moscow putsch, during the official meeting  of CIS heads of state in Belavezha, Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus  signed an entire range of agreements, including one stating that  every state is the sole owner of all property located on its  territory, and one concerning the inviolability of borders. It  is interesting how the world community would react if Moscow  demanded that the Baykonur launch-site be divided between Russia  and Kazakhstan?! Moreover, I generally stand for the gradual  withdrawal (taking into account servicemen's problems) of  Russian units from Ukrainian territory, including the Crimea.    [Dashkovskyy] The maintenance of the Black Sea Fleet  requires considerable expenditures, and particularly, the  question of fuel arises under the current acute energy crisis.    [Kozhyn] As everybody knows, almost 70 percent of maritime  nation's fuel resources is spent on maintenance of navies. On  the other hand, we must not go too far, because there are other  important sectors. As of today, the balance is maintained --  state organizations allot funds, and moreover, the Black Sea  Fleet is fully maintained by Ukraine.    [Dashkovskyy] What, in your opinion, must be done to prevent  a "Ukrainian Karabakh" from developing in the Crimea?    [Kozhyn] I would not advise anyone to inflame passions  surrounding the Crimea, which is currently being done quite  successfully by the Russian media. The government's position  should be weighed, but tough. When I was still the Navy  commander, I warned the previous Supreme Council of possible  dangerous consequences stemming from Crimean autonomy, and I  insisted that this issue be revised. Since all problems must be  resolved in a peaceful manner, I believe that the president must  go to the Crimea. If Leonid Kravchuk does not do that in the  near future, he will bear responsibility for any further  developments. In my opinion, this is the last chance to  preserve our independence, peace, and accord.</p>

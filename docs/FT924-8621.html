			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Consortium formed to prop up Danish bank A CONSORTIUM of eight large banks, including the central bank, formed a consortium at the weekend to guarantee liquidity to Varde Bank, Denmark's tenth ranking bank with assets at the end of 1991 of about DKr17bn (Dollars 2.8bn). The bank, which serves the Esbjerg area of west Jutland, experienced a run by depositors at the end of last week despite the fact that local businessmen have promised to subscribe to a share issue as a means of strengthening capital ratios. This is the first time since 1984 that the Danish central bank and other banks have joined forces to place a safety net under a troubled bank.</p>

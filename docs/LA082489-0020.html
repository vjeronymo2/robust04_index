			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN ACCUSED OF MOLESTATION TO STAND TRIAL  </P> <P> A former part-time recreation assistant at Reseda Park was ordered held for  trial on charges of child molestation Wednesday after a 6-year-old boy  testified that the city employee was one of two men who abused him in the park  office.  </P> <P> Lars Juden, 38, who has coached young people in athletics at the park since  1983, is to be arraigned Sept. 6 in Van Nuys Superior Court. Juden, who  remained in custody in lieu of $7,500 bail, faces up to 10 years in prison if  convicted on two counts of molestation, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards R.  Abele.  </P> <P> In testimony Tuesday at Juden's preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal  Court, the child said Juden and Ronald Ray Rudd, a 39-year-old volunteer at the  park, molested him more than once in the park office, although he could not say  how many times.  </P> <P> Rudd also molested him in the van that Rudd lived in across the street from the  park, the boy said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Convictions  </P> <P> Rudd, who admitted that he has twice been convicted of child molestation,  pleaded guilty Monday to the molestations, which he said occurred during the  six weeks before his and Juden's arrest Aug. 6.  </P> <P> Under a plea bargain, Rudd will be sentenced to at least 15 years in prison.  Sentencing is set Sept. 18.  </P> <P> At the hearing, Detective Joseph Diglio said Juden, shortly after his arrest,  signed a confession admitting the molestations.  </P> <P> He quoted the former park employee as saying, "If the kid didn't come to the  park alone, these things wouldn't happen" and that "it was Ronald Rudd's fault  because he was an influence on him."  </P> <P> The boy's mother testified that she allowed the boy to visit the park alone up  to five times weekly in July and that she also permitted Rudd to take her son  to movies and swimming.  </P> <P> Los Angeles parks department spokesman Al Goldfarb said Juden has been fired  from his position.  </P></p>

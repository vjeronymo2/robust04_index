			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring helps put Bluebird back in black AFTER THE wide-ranging restructuring of the business in 1991, Bluebird Toys returned to the black in the six months to June 30. Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, said the toy designer, manufacturer and distributor had 'an excellent first half' - profits emerged at Pounds 234,000 pre-tax (losses Pounds 4.47m). Mr Angus Fisher, group operations director, said that the restructuring was completed and paid for and that the results were showing the benefit. In 1991 the company had found itself with excessive manufacturing capacity in the UK as its international business developed. Cheaper manufacturing in the Far East became imperative so two UK factories were closed. The restructure accounted for Pounds 3.34m of last time's losses, and Mr Fisher said the second-half performance would not match the first. Group turnover in the first half advanced 49 per cent to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 11.7m), thanks in large part, Mr Fisher said, to a 78 per cent rise in international sales to Pounds 8.68m. This rise was mostly due to the worldwide distribution and sales agreement with Mattel, the second biggest US toy maker, and a similar agreement for Japan with Bandai. Bluebird's diminutive Polly Pocket range is the number one girl's toy in that country. UK turnover grew 29 per cent to Pounds 8.72m. Aside from the restructure, profits were aided by lower overheads - between 1990 and 1991 stock was reduced 50 per cent and by the end of the period under review it was cut by a further 37 per cent. The overdraft was paid down by Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 7.5m. Earnings per share emerged at 2.6p (losses 46.1p) and again there is no interim dividend, though Mr Norman said the board expected 'to be able to consider a dividend' at the year-end.</p>

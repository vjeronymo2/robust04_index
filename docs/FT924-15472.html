			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Unlocking value for shareholders - Richard Gourlay considers the departure of Chubb from Racal ON MONDAY official trading will begin in Chubb Security and what is left of its erstwhile parent, Racal Electronics, as Sir Ernest Harrison, its chairman, continues to break up the group he founded 27 years ago. As expected, Racal's shareholders yesterday approved the demerger. Now instead of the five old Racal shares they held, they will have one new Racal and one Chubb. It was the last formality before the security company was able to float free of the group it has nurtured with its cash flow for much of the eight years it has been part of it. Looking back on Racal's exceptionally successful 1991 demerger of Vodafone, the cellular network service, shareholders might be tempted to think their feisty chairman's latest ruse to enhance shareholder's value will be equally rewarding. This may be so. But with the two companies telling completely different stories, Racal shareholders face an interesting decision whether to hold or dispose of their shares at current prices. Chubb is one of the oldest and best known brand names in the security market and the thoroughbred in Racal Electronics' stable once Vodafone was split off. As the poor cousin of Vodafone, Chubb was languishing, the victim of a lamentable lack of management attention which, perhaps understandably, was focused on the rise and rise of Vodafone. The arrival of Mr David Peacock as chief executive brought the slide to an abrupt halt. With falling interest and exceptional charges and rising margins, Chubb's brokers are forecasting that earnings per share will grow by 83 per cent, 20 per cent and 17 per cent over the next three years. Clearly the fact that there is scope for such an improvement is testimony to the laxity of the previous management. It also means that Chubb shareholders should enjoy three years of above average earnings growth, even without any sales-led expansion. If Mr Peacock manages to exploit its strong brands, including Chubb, Union, Lips and Pyrene, and expand what is still a relatively small share of its markets, earnings progression could be even better. These forecasts alone would seem enough to support a hold recommendation at yesterday's closing price in the grey market of 201p, which represents a 30 per cent premium to the market. There is also the possibility that Chubb might become the target for a predator. Williams Holdings bought Yale &amp; Valor, the locks company, last year for Pounds 406m, the same as the company's annual sales. On that basis Chubb should be worth Pounds 670m, which is 20 per cent above the Pounds 560m market capitalisation implied by the grey market closing price. -. Racal Electronics, shorn of Chubb, is a different story. Racal's profitability recovered strongly in the year to the end of March and is likely to continue to improve again this financial year. But the mixture of businesses - data communications, commercial and military radio, marine services, defence radar and avionics and network services - is coming from a low base. Adjusted to exclude Vodafone and Chubb, Racal would have made an operating loss of Pounds 11.5m in the year to March 31 1991, swinging to a profit of Pounds 49.3m on sales of Pounds 937.3m the following year. But that is only an operating margin of about 5 per cent. The main problem is data communications, which accounts for nearly a third of sales but barely broke even at the operating level. Racal is aware that data communications, mainly data modems, which is increasingly becoming a commodity business, is the area that requires immediate attention. Mr David Elsbury, the chief executive says he is addressing this issue. But analysts point out that the management that got Racal into this dismal operating condition is broadly the same one as is at the helm today. That does not mean shareholders should necessarily dump their holdings. Again reduced interest and exceptional charges will be a tremendous boost to earnings. And if the turnround at data communications is accompanied by further improvement at the radio division - and both propositions are less than certain - the share price would be underpinned by above average earnings growth. More to the point, at yesterday's grey market closing price of 129p Racal ex-Chubb would have a market capitalisation of Pounds 359m, representing a discount to net asset value. . Any further share price fall would mean that a bid was on the cards.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban  President Fidel Castro today wished for success for the Summit  of the Americas to be held in the United States at the end of  this year, but he cautioned against Washington's intentions for  convoking it.    In his first speech at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the  Cuban president regretted that his country is being excluded  from that forum to take place in Miami, Florida, in December.  He said that it will be a good opportunity for demanding the  end of the economic blockade against Cuba.    During the speech, Castro, clearly alluding to the United  States, asked: "What can we expect today from an invariably  expansionist, egotistic, and hegemonist power?"    The Cuban chief of state, who wore a white guayabera instead  of his usual military uniform said: Ibero-American summits have  reaffirmed the decision of the countries of the region to meet  "without asking others for permission and without irritating  exclusions."    He noted that Washington's proposal is aimed at congregating  the chiefs of state of the continent in the city of Miami, mecca  of Cubans who have lived in exile for the past three decades.    Castro said: "The alleged landlords of this hemisphere have  prohibited Cuba, a country that has endured aggressions and a  blockade for more than 30 years, to participate in that meeting"  in Miami. The Cuban chief of state complained: "How much  cowardice, mediocrity, and political misery that exclusion  reveals."    Castro added: "There has been an Alliance for Progress and  the Initiative for the Americas. No one remembers them now."  [passage omitted]    Castro spoke in favor of establishing hemispheric  cooperation  mechanisms to combat drug-trafficking, but he cautioned that  this must not be done at the expense of the sovereignty of  countries.

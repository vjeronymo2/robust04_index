			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have emphasized the  common ground in the policy of the two governments. Berlusconi,  who arrived in Bonn on Thursday [16 June] on his first visit  abroad since he became head of a government of a right-wing  alliance, mainly pointed to the successes of his party, Forza  Italia, and of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in the  European election.    Kohl welcomed his guest with military honors in front of the  Chancellor's Office, before withdrawing with Berlusconi for  lunch and political talks. In his welcome address, Kohl mainly  underlined the joint positions in European policy. He pointed  out that the founding treaties of what was then called the  European Economic Community were signed as "Rome Treaties" in  the Italian capital in 1958. After the collapse of nationalism  and fascism in Europe, Italy and the FRG established stable  democracies, the chancellor said, adding that Italy's commitment  to Europe has always been exemplary.    Italy and Germany always pursued the same course in Europe,  "and we will continue to pursue the same course for Europe in  the future, too," Kohl said. Berlusconi took over  responsibility as Italian government head in an era of dramatic  changes. "For this I wish you all the best, and may God be with  you," Kohl said.    In his reply, Berlusconi told the unusually large number of  journalists that, after the European election, it was a  particular pleasure for him to be in Bonn "since the political  forces that we represent" have done so well in these elections.  The Italian government head, who is facing international  criticism due to the participation of the neofascist National  Alliance in his cabinet, referred to the joint heritage in the  Christian tradition, which united him with Kohl. The work of  his government will focus on the struggle for peace, against  antisemitism, and for tolerance.    Berlusconi said he was very proud that Russia would  participate in the summit of leading economic nations that he  would host in Naples in early July. He called for a European  task force, which should take military action whenever  humanitarian principles were violated. There was no room for  questions after the short statements by Kohl and Berlusconi.    Berlusconi's short visit to Bonn had caused some protest,  mainly on the part of the opposition. The Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] and Greens had called on Kohl to distance  himself from Berlusconi's neofascist coalition partner. In  interviews in German media, the Italian prime minister and  wealthy media tycoon defended the cooperation of the National  Alliance in his cabinet.    Michel Friedman (CDU), member of the Presidium of the  Central  Council of Jews in Germany, on Saarland Radio called on the  Federal Government to keep its distance from the Berlusconi-led  government. In an interview with BILD, the prime minister  resolutely rejected the accusation that members of his  government alliance were fascists. "There are no neofascists in  my government," he said.</p>

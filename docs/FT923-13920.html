			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Firmer futures market gives Nikkei a boost SHARE prices shrugged off arbitrage-related selling and posted firm gains on index-linked buying, prompted by a rise in the futures markets, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 248.40 to 16,848.66. The index, which fell to the day's low of 16,571.76 in the morning, advanced to a high of 16,927.24 on active buying in the afternoon. Volume rose to 250m shares from 201m. Advances led declines by 602 to 315, with 167 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 10.80 to 1,284.93 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.01 to 1,011.13. Traders said that the activity was largely option-related, as July options contracts expire today. But most Japanese institutional investors were absent from the rally. 'Financial institutions will buy when the market falls, but they will not chase rising share prices,' said Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda at Daiwa Securities. While foreign investors remained on the sidelines, traders said that a rise could prompt selling from foreigners looking for opportunities to manoeuvre. 'Many foreigners are looking to switch into defensive stocks,' said Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg Securities. Traders said that the index was helped by the advance in bank shares. Reports that commercial banks are considering issuing perpetual subordinated bonds, to meet capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank for International Settlements, encouraged investors. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y40 to Y1,600 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank advanced Y70 to Y1,270. Short-term 'theme' stocks continued to be actively traded. Dealers and individuals took profits on Aids-related issues such as Meiji Milk Products, which fell Y5 to Y980, and bought stocks on the mergers and acquisitions theme. Lower-priced companies in the high-technology and automobile sectors were popular as possible targets for acquisitions. Fuji Heavy Industries, the car maker, was the most active issue of the day, advancing Y10 to Y386. Ricoh, the office equipment maker, rose Y10 to Y576 and Oki Electric added Y12 to Y434. The two paper and pulp companies which announced a merger on Wednesday declined on profit-taking. Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp fell Y53 to Y525 and Jujo Paper lost Y8 to Y528. Analysts pointed out that while the merger would create the largest company by sales, the new company could face a squeeze in profitability due to the slump in the paper and pulp industry. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 230.30 to 19,452.06 in volume of 10.2m shares. Roundup ELSEWHERE in the Pacific Basin region, turnover was mixed, but share prices were mainly on the downgrade. MANILA accelerated its downward slide, the composite index dropping 46.30, or 3.1 per cent to 1,435.52. Combined turnover in the Manila and Makati bourses fell from 581m pesos to 243m. Brokers said that the market is still in a consolidation, or correction, phase following the bull run caused by the peaceful transfer of power to the new president of the Philippines, Mr Fidel Ramos. SEOUL tumbled for the seventh consecutive day and about 100 investors protested outside the exchange, calling on the government to halt the slide. The index fell 8.72 to 523.07 as turnover fell to Won109.6bn from Won150.97bn. AUSTRALIA fell after data which showed that unemployment rose to 11.1 per cent in June from 10.6 per cent in May and 9.4 per cent a year ago. The All Ordinaries index closed down 9.3 at 1,642.1, but off its lows for the day, in brisk turnover of ADollars 405.8m. Westpac took the brunt of weakness in the banks, sinking 7 cents to ADollars 3.32. HONG KONG finished at the day's lows as profit-taking continued to put pressure on prices in subdued trading. The Hang Seng Index fell 56.39 to 5,925.52, from a morning high of 5,980.49. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.47bn from HKDollars 2.88bn. NEW ZEALAND equities followed a continued rally in the bond markets, the NZSE-40 index ending 7.10 higher at 1,577.80 in turnover of NZDollars 25m. BANGKOK closed higher across the board after a Thai SEC announcement eased fears about tighter regulation of the stock market. The SET index rose 13.27, or 1.8 per cent to 743.11 in turnover of Bt4.86bn. Ekamol Khiriwat, secretary general of the SEC, told a news conference that his office's probes were aimed at manipulators, that they were confidential and that the SEC was not going to do anything to restrict normal speculation.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Danish PM attacks opponents as Yes vote grows THE DANISH political debate over the country's second referendum on the Maastricht treaty grew more bitter at the weekend as the final opinion polls before tomorrow's vote showed a modest strengthening of the Yes vote. A Gallup survey, due for publication today, showed 50 per cent in favour of the treaty, the No vote little changed at 32 per cent, and 18 per cent undecided or not planning to vote. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democrat prime minister, sharpened his attack on opponents, using terms unusually harsh for Danish politics. 'They're raving mad,' he declared in a Sunday newspaper. At the only campaign meeting where he has met a leader of the left-leaning June Movement, the biggest of the anti-Maastricht organisations, face-to-face, he lashed out at his opponent, Prof Niels I Meyer, a physicist. 'The June Movement claims that Danish democracy will disappear if there is a Yes vote on Tuesday. I am astonished that well-educated people, even professors, can say this without blushing or a tremor in their voices,' he said. The prime minister is apparently not alone in thinking the No movements are unconvincing. A newspaper poll yesterday showed that leaders of the pro-Maastrict campaign were regarded as more reliable than the June Movement's leaders. Danes appear to be preparing to turn out to vote in record numbers, judging by the advance postal vote, which is 13 per cent up on last year. After a campaign marked by poorly attended election meetings and low viewer ratings for television campaign programmes, the size of the postal vote has come as a surprise. In last year's referendum, the verdict was 50.7 per cent against the treaty, with 49.3 per cent in favour. Vote desperation, Page 4 International bonds, Page 19</p>

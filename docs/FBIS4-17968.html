			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy </F> Gorokhov]    [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr--A ministerial level meeting  involving Russia, the United States, the European Union [EU],  and the United Nations to discuss matters regarding a Bosnian  settlement could be held as early as the beginning of May. This  was stated by Andrey Kozyrev on Thursday [28 April] evening upon  his return to Moscow from his trip to Geneva and Bonn, where he  had talks with the leaders of the foreign policy departments of  the United States, France, and Germany.    "There is a fairly big chance that success will be achieved  in organizing a ministerial meeting during the course of next  week," the Russian foreign minister told journalists. He said  that a possible venue for the meeting was Geneva.    According to Kozyrev, much will depend on how things go in  the contact group of four that has been established at the level  of special representatives to prepare a full report on the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has emerged that Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who represents Russia  in the group, will have a meeting in Oslo within the next few  days with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the cochairman of the  coordinating committee of the International Conference on  Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Lucas turns to pension fund for help: Engineering group sees operating profits after interest payments fall to Pounds 200,000 OPERATING profits at Lucas Industries, one of the largest of the UK's international engineering groups, crumbled under the weight of the recession in the motor and aerospace industries. Only a distribution from the group's pension fund surplus allowed it, yesterday, to announce pre-tax profits for the six months to January of Pounds 90.2m and a maintained interim dividend to shareholders of 2.1p. But the slide in its market value continued. Lucas shares lost 4.5 per cent in value last week and yesterday they fell a further 7p to 112p, putting a tag on the group of less than Pounds 800m. Dealers were concerned about the possibility of a dividend cut at the end of the financial year. 'Lucas has not yet seen evidence of an early overall recovery in its markets,' warned Sir Anthony Gill, chairman. But senior executives said that although the aerospace markets might not produce much more profit in the second half than they did in the first, there had been flickerings of life on the automotive side. Of the three main divisions in Lucas, only aerospace made a significant first-half operating profit - Pounds 16.3m. The automotive division made just Pounds 0.8m and the applied technology division broke even. Demand slipped away; margins were under continual pressure. In the first half of 1990-91 operating profits were Pounds 68.8m. This time, after meeting interest payments of Pounds 16.9m, Lucas was left with Pounds 0.2m of pre-tax profits. But, after two years of talks with trustees and the obtaining of regulatory approvals, it also had a contribution of Pounds 90m from the Lucas Pension Fund. This has underpinned its balance sheet and allowed a payment to shareholders. Like other engineering groups Lucas has retrenched heavily; 2,000 people lost their jobs in the first half of this financial year. A further 1,000 will go in the second half. More than 8,000 jobs have disappeared since July 1990, taking the payroll down to below 50,000. The latest profit figures were held back by more than Pounds 15m spent on redundancy and reorganisation costs. By the end of the financial year, this sum will have more than doubled.

However, it is thought preferable to allow States the flexibility to determine what are the best sources of information for their specific needs, as well as the best methods of obtaining information important to their programs. In response to the commenter's second point, the Secretaries note that, in paragraph (b)(3) of the priority, States must describe their ``procedure for obtaining the active and continued involvement in the statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system of *&blank;*&blank;* teachers, students, and parents *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Secretaries have concluded that it is preferable to allow each State the flexibility to determine both the specific kinds of career development assistance that will be made available to students and the specific manner in which parents and teachers will be included in the career development aspects of the School-to-Work Opportunities program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was of the opinion that community colleges are in a good position to assist in linking secondary and postsecondary institutions so as to improve the quality of what the commenter referred to as co-op education programs. The commenter suggested that community colleges should have the opportunity to apply for grants under this program or to be designated as fiscal agents. Further, the commenter suggested that, given the opportunity, community colleges could serve effectively as centralized ``School-to-Work Program Centers'' and could develop consortium arrangements between high schools and employers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under this competition, grants will be made to States and each State will designate a fiscal agent. States, in turn, will award subgrants to local partnerships that must include employers, public secondary and postsecondary educational institutions or agencies, and labor organizations or employee representatives. As public postsecondary educational institutions, many community colleges will qualify to participate in partnerships. Community colleges are expected to play an important and active role in School-to-Work Opportunities programs. The matter of which entity will serve as grant recipient or fiscal agent at the State or local level will be decided by States and local partnerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority_Comprehensive Statewide System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believed that one goal of a School-to-Work Opportunities system is not only to prepare youth for existing jobs but also to enable them to gain access to growing sectors of the economy likely to affect future markets. In the view of the commenter, States should be encouraged to identify and incorporate into their plans those geographical areas that are targeted for economic growth. The commenter further stated that these would include areas that are either receiving Federal, State, or local funds, or receiving funds from all of these sources, for the purpose of stimulating their economies, or areas that have been identified by local governmental or community based agencies for economic activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States are responsible for developing statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Each State plan must describe how the State will stimulate and support local School-to-Work Opportunities programs in the State, including in areas with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. As part of this effort, States will, of course, be encouraged to identify and incorporate in their plans, geographic areas that are targeted for economic growth. However, the Secretaries wish to reiterate that States and localities have the flexibility to determine those areas that should receive any priority in the establishment of statewide systems and for the receipt of funds allocated to local partnerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

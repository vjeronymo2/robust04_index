			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Letter: Total value better than earnings per share Sir, The view of Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, is that earnings per share is a poor gauge of underlying corporate performance ('Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option plans', July 6) and Lex observes ('UK accountancy', July 6) that market multiples are meaningless if EPS is recognised as unreliable. The most direct historical measure of medium-term corporate financial performance is the total value (dividends and capital growth) that the company has created for its shareholders. Shareholder value creation can readily be measured as the return on Pounds 100 invested in the company between two dates. The performance can be shown relative to the All Share or specific sector indices; it can be compared directly on the same basis with competitors' performance; and it can also be adjusted for the relative riskiness of a share. A few companies in the US use shareholder value creation as their prime performance measure (eg Quaker Oats). It has always been a source of some amazement to me that it is never used in UK company reports. It is, after all, the direct measure of the performance that interests the shareholder, and for which he invests. A well-developed set of concepts and much practical experience now allow companies to link economic value creation within the business with the creation of shareholder value. It is therefore possible to integrate this external measure of corporate financial performance with key internal measures of company performance covering both the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. Value-based management thus has a comprehensiveness and coherence that EPS is unable to achieve. Economic value is created by the effective exploitation of sustained competitive advantage. Value is driven by cash returns which consistently exceed the company's cost of capital. The new approach escapes the emphasis on short-termism which has been characteristic of management's preoccupation with EPS growth.

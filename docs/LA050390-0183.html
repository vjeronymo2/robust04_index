			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;  </P> <P> PRESS CALLS FOR CAMPAIGN AGAINST FRAUD  </P> <P> State insurance commissioner candidate Bill Press, under fire for taking  contributions from attorneys who advertise to represent accident claimants  against insurance companies, proposed Wednesday a sweeping anti-fraud campaign  by the state Insurance Department against "corrupt attorneys and doctors."  </P> <P> Calling Los Angeles "the automobile accident insurance fraud capital of the  United States," Press, a Democrat, estimated that the auto insurers statewide  are losing $1.5 billion a year to fraud, including staged accidents and false  medical bills and legal claims. This is more than 10% of annual auto insurance  premiums.  </P> <P> He called for increasing the number of fraud investigators in the Insurance  Department from the current 25 to 200, enacting legislation to take away  licenses to practice law or medicine from any lawyer or doctor convicted of  insurance fraud, and requiring insurers to fight harder against fraud. The  costs of the crackdown under Press' plan would be paid by assessments against  the companies.  </P> <P> Reaction from other candidates in the race varied, some saying that they had  been advocating similar crackdowns all along and that Press is trying to have  it both ways, financing his campaign from sources suspected of abetting fraud  and then urging a crackdown against it. One other candidate was noncomittal and  one opposed Press' anti-fraud approach.  </P> <P> State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), called Press' proposal "nearly  identical to proposals that I have made repeatedly over the last three months.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased to see his interest in this matter," he said. "But I'm curious  about his commitment to rooting out fraud, considering that he is apparently  taking money from insurance mills, or relying heavily on insurance mills for  financing his campaign."  </P> <P> Insurance mills is a pejorative name for teams of lawyers, doctors and  chiropractors who are accused of encouraging clients to build up claims against  insurers, so as to win large settlements for the clients, out of which they  take a large percentage in fees.  </P> <P> "My first reaction is, he stole the entire idea from me," said Democrat Ray  Bourhis of Press' proposals. "My second is, he's hypocritical as hell, to be  taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from automobile accident mills to fund  10-second TV spots one day, and to say he's going after fraud the next."  </P> <P> Press, however, said those who question his independence don't know him.  </P> <P> "I'm unbought and unbossed," he said. "I'm the Democrat who took on Jerry Brown  and Tom Bradley. As a Catholic, I took on the Pope for opposing birth control.  I opposed KABC (the station he worked for as a television commentator) for  hiring Morton Downey."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Tom Skornia, a Republican candidate, also said he had been  suggesting anti-fraud ideas similar to Press' "for some months now."  </P> <P> Two other candidates were noncommittal or dubious about the anti-fraud  approaches of Press, Garamendi, Bourhis and Skornia. Democrat Walter Zelman  said he wanted to study them and Democrat Conway Collis suggested: "The better  way to go after it is to roll back rates under Proposition 103. When you force  the companies to reduce rates, they'll go after fraud on their own."  </P></p>

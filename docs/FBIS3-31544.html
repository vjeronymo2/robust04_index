Although Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Bosnian  Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said after the talks that  differences between the two sides had been narrowed, according  to foreign news agencies, they did concede that the two sides  were still far from any significant agreement.    Granic, who is also deputy Croatian prime minister, said the  Muslim side was interested in a confederation with Croatia, but  the two sides were still not in agreement about the future form  of organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Granic said each member  of the planned confederation would be a member of the United  Nations. Granic said various ideas about the division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina into ethnic republics or cantons and a  ceasefire in central Bosnia had been discussed.    Granic and Silajdzic said the talks on future  Croatian-Muslim  relations would be resumed in the Croatian capital of Zagreb  next week at the level of experts, after which they said the two  of them would most likely meet again.    Granic and Silajdzic first separately met with special  United  States envoy for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ambassador Charles Redman.  Ambassador Redman said he was trying to have the two sides more  decisively approach the resolution of issues of their future  coexistence.</p>

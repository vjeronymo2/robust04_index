			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 6 (AFP) -- The UN and Red Cross  Sunday [6 February] began to evacuate 58 wounded people,  including 30 survivors of Saturday's attack on a crowded  Sarajevo marketplace and Friday's attack on a food line in  suburban Dobrinja. Armoured troop transport vehicles bearing  red crosses drew up at Sarajevo airport where a plane from the  International Committee of the Red Cross and two U.S. hospital  planes waited on the runway. Some 60 wounded people and their  relatives -- about 100 people in all -- would be flown out of  the besieged Bosnian capital Sunday, said the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) coordinator for medical  evacuations, Dr. Genevieve Begkoyian.    Thirty of them were wounded in the Friday and Saturday  attacks in Sarajevo and Dobrinja, while the remaining 28 were  already on HCR lists of seriously ill and wounded waiting to be  evacuated before the latest atrocities occurred. The planes  were to fly their human cargo to a U.S. hospital near the Rhein  Main U.S. airbase, near the German city of Frankfurt, Begkoyian  said.    A spokesman at a military airport in Ramstein, Germany, said  a U.S. plane carrying a dozen people seriously wounded in the  marketplace attack was expected to land there at around 4 p.m.  The wounded would then be taken to the US military hospital in  Landstuhl, near the western town of Kaiserslautern. He was  unable to say if the plane, which carried eight doctors, nurses  and evacuation specialists when it left for the Bosnian capital,  would return to Sarajevo after depositing the wounded. Some of  the wounded in Sarajevo were to be evacuated to Italy on a  French plane, he added.    In the Croatian capital Zagreb, officials said a 60-bed U.S.  mobile army surgical hospital (MASH) erected at Zagreb airport  was ready to take in Sarajevo wounded, if asked, but that no  decision had been made for the moment. Most of the wounded that  could be moved would probably be flown to Italy and Germany,  Colonel Stewart Watkins, commander of U.S. forces in  ex-Yugoslavia, told reporters.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York: Canary Wharf, a project too far? acre redevelopment in a run-down part of San Francisco, should have been O&amp;Y's next showcase. Described as the 'last prime site' in San Francisco, it was large and bold enough to change the face of a major city. But after a string of missed deadlines and reprieves, O&amp;Y has lost its rights to build two skyscrapers and an entertainment complex. O&amp;Y must now find Dollars 2m by July or lose its right to build a 750,000 sq ft office tower. O&amp;Y's attempt to hold on to the last vestiges of its original involvement in Yerba Buena is a long way from its first mega-project in 1975: First Canadian Place, the 72-storey, 2m sq ft tower in the heart of Toronto's financial district. It is even further removed from the project which put O&amp;Y into a league of its own - the World Financial Centre, a Dollars 1.5bn, 8m sq ft complex on a vast landfill site, south of Wall Street. The Reichmanns' bid to develop the whole site in 1980 was a monumental gamble. Other developers wanted to test the market, one building at a time. They said O&amp;Y would never attract leading tenants on that scale. The incentives offered to tenants seemed crazily generous. It was bound to fail, they said. The Reichmanns thought the sheer scale would attract leading tenants. They were right. Wall Street firms were on the threshold of meteoric growth. The project proved a spectacular success. O&amp;Y's next blockbuster, Canary Wharf, was not so successful and much may yet depend on its fate. The project appeared to offer all the ingredients that made the World Financial Centre a hit: cheap land, tax breaks and scale. London was growing at break-neck pace and most of its offices were out-dated slums. Canary Wharf seemed an unmissable opportunity to repeat a winning formula. But Canary Wharf dwarfed even the World Financial Centre in its ambition. It was attempting to create a third new business centre for London at a stroke, something no other developer was prepared to attempt. The World Financial Centre was three minutes walk from Wall Street. Canary Wharf was two and a half miles from the city. The transport links that O&amp;Y were counting on have been painfully slow to arrive. Attracting new tenants was always going to be an uphill struggle. The collapse in the London property market made it infinitely harder. Two years ago, Canary Wharf's asking rent was Pounds 30 per sq ft - half City rates. Now City rents have halved and there is a glut of high-quality modern offices, making it much harder for Canary Wharf to compete. The project is 40 per cent unlet, and is not producing nearly enough income to service its debt. The development so far is probably worth considerably less than the Pounds 1.3bn it cost to build. Canary Wharf tower was recently valued at Pounds 680m and 10 Cabot Square was valued at Pounds 215m. But this does not take account of the project's empty space and it probably over-estimates O&amp;Y's ability to use its tax breaks. Buildings that have been started will be finished, but the remainder - another 6m sq ft of space, costing another Pounds 1.7bn - has an uncertain future.</p>

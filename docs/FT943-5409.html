			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: More words on Woolf - But Anthony Curtis finds that this overview avoids overkill VIRGINIA WOOLF by James King Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 699 pages It may not seem like it to those readers suffering from Bloomsbury bulimia, but as James King, professor of English at McMaster University, Ontario, is at pains to point out, this is the first full-scale biography of Virginia Woolf since the one by Quentin Bell in 1972. The years that followed Bell's sparely written life of his aunt saw the publication of the five volumes of her diaries and the six volumes of her letters. Then Andrew McNeillie began to edit a complete edition of the essays of Virginia Woolf (including all her scattered book-reviews, many of which were originally anonymous). With the appearance recently of Volume 4 (The Hogarth Press, Pounds 35.00) this edition has reached the year 1928. Two more volumes will take it up to Woolf's death in 1941. Thus the millions of words she wrote both privately and professionally during her tragically curtailed lifetime are now all in the public domain. Even the laconic diary she kept at Asheham in Sussex in 1917-18 before the move to Rodmell, hitherto only partially printed in Volume 1 of the diaries, is now available in full in the current number of The Charleston Magazine (Issue 9, available from Charleston Farmhouse, Firle, Lewes, BN8 6LL at Pounds 2.95). Faced by such a mass of primary material - not to mention all the secondary and related sources that have mushroomed - an overview of the writer, the self-destructive drives that accompanied her endless literary creativity, her ironical exposure of the injustices perpetrated upon women, is surely much to be welcomed. King has avoided over-kill and organised his book judiciously. He uncovers the autobiographical elements in the works while integrating his subject's development as an artist with the many intense relations she had with other people. These relations form a set of concentric circles - first the family ones including female cousins like Madge Vaughan and older women like Violet Dickinson, to whom as a girl Virginia was very close. Then the men, her brother Thoby's Cambridge contemporaries who became Bloomsbury, including Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf. Finally, a wider circle of writers and artists like Katherine Mansfield, Vita Sackville-West, TS Eliot, Hugh Walpole who were not part of Bloomsbury but whom she came to know intimately as her fame spread. King is a sensitive scholar who leads us patiently through a richly varied life with fresh insights to offer about episodes familiar from earlier accounts. The least judgmental of biographers, he cannot avoid presenting Virginia's half-brothers, George and Gerald Duckworth, as the villains of this Cinderella-like story. We have her word - in papers she wrote and read to the Memoir Club, a small private society within Bloomsbury - that she was abused sexually by both of them: by Gerald when she was six who fondled her and by George, who tried to rape her in her bedroom after a dance. The precise extent of the abuse remains obscure. One should remember that Woolf was capable of fantasising - as in one spectacular instance after Thoby's death; she pretended to Violet that he was still alive sending her details of the improvement in his condition. But even without the activities of the half-brothers Duckworth (Gerald was to become the publisher of her first novel) she suffered a series of bereavements when she was growing up that were in themselves more than enough to de-stabilise her finely poised mind. Her mother Julia's death in 1895 at the age of 49 was followed two years later by that of her half-sister Stella, who had assumed the maternal role in the family. Virginia was 15. Her tyrannical but lovable father Leslie Stephen died in 1904 when she was 22; her brother Thoby died aged 26 in 1906; and her nephew Julian Bell was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Her recovery from her breakdowns, to the point where she could write her novels and reviews and even re-create the process of losing control of reality in the character of Septimus Warren Smith, was a minor miracle. Though innately anti-Semitic she found her personal salvation through marrying Leonard Woolf, a Jew, who gave up a very un-Jewish kind of career in the Ceylon Civil Service where he was rising meteorically up the administrative ladder. He became instead a writer and a devoted husband. Her lesbian tendency was already apparent and marriage did not eliminate it. Marital sex was another of Leonard's sacrifices. The marriage survived an endless series of upheavals, including Virginia's intense sense of rivalry with other women authors, notably Katherine Mansfield, and with her sister Vanessa with whose husband, Clive Bell, she flirted outrageously, precipitating Vanessa's lifelong passion for the homosexual painter Duncan Grant. When Viriginia was 43 she entered upon her passionate friendship with Vita. This did not become a long, full-blooded affair, like those Vita had with Hilda Matheson and Gwen St Aubyn. According to King they only slept together twice but afterwards remained firm friends. Orlando was as much a requiem as a celebration. The composer Ethel Smyth, another attachment, sends a breath of irreverent fresh air through this hothouse informing Virginia that she hated everything Bloomsbury stood for. VW's ups-and-downs in her relations with all her friends were mirrored in her attitude to her work. She see-sawed bewilderingly between exaltation and utter despair and was over-sensitive to reviews and verbal criticism. After King's thorough biography, which inevitably concludes with her suicide in 1941 as the threat of Nazi invasion loomed, we will not need another life of Virginia Woolf for some time to come.</p>

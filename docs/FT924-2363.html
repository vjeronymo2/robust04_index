			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Severance payment I recently accepted early severance from my employer. The financial package was a lump sum amounting to Pounds 60,000. There were no other compensatory payments. On the lump sum, I was taxed approximately Pounds 21,500, as a considerable amount was at 40 per cent. Come April, I will be able to calculate the tax due for 1992/3 based on total earnings. I am writing about 'top slicing.' I have never understood the implications. Can I take advantage of it? Unfortunately, top-slicing relief does not apply to severance payments like yours. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

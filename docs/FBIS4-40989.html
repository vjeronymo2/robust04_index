			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksey Bukalov and </F> Aleksey Golyayev: "We Cannot Live Without One Another. Viktor  Chernomyrdin Addresses World Gas Congress"]    [Excerpt] Milan, 20 June -- [passage omitted]  "Two-and-a-half years of reforms have not been wasted," the  Russian premier stated. "I can say with complete confidence  that the foundations of economic recovery have been laid and the  first signs of changes for the better have already started to  appear. We have achieved steady results through our moderately  tough financial policy. The inflation rate has been halved,  during the period February through May it held steady at 8-10  percent, and by the end of the year we have set ourselves the  task of smoothly reducing the inflation rate to 5-7 percent a  month."    The head of the Russian Government announced that in 1995  the  country will introduce a new tax system which will be clearer  and more comprehensible to investors. "It is not impossible,  however, that we will be able to achieve a significant easing of  the tax burden in the second half of next year," V. Chernomyrdin  said, "and right now we are preparing a package of decisions to  attract foreign investments. In addition to easing the tax  regime and the mechanisms for granting government guarantees,  these also comprise a number of legislative acts regulating the  procedures for concluding contracts on concessions and the  division of output, and also acts designed to stimulate activity  by foreign investors in 'free economic zones' on Russian  territory."

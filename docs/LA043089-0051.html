			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: QUAYLE REPORT CARD: GOOD MARKS FOR IMAGE REPAIR  </P> <P> Much is being made of President Bush's performance during his first 100 days in  office. But little has been written about Dan Quayle's first 100 days as vice  president. In Quayle's case, the questions usually center on how well he's been  able to regain his confidence and his composure and rebuild his image after  being battered during last year's presidential race. The Quayle jokes have  begun to subside. He's been moderately successful in appearing at ease at  public forums and at sessions with reporters. And, by many standards, he has  earned good marks in his role as a presidential representative on his official  trips to Venezuela, El Salvador and, currently, the Pacific. "As damaged as he  was coming in, I don't think you can expect any more than him trying to negate  some of the damage that was done," said Phil Truluck of the conservative  Heritage Foundation.  </P> <P>  -- The good name of Henry Flipper has been restored -- thanks to the state of  Georgia. In a special ceremony in Thomasville, Atty. Gen. Michael Bowers placed  a marker at the grave of Flipper, the first black to be graduated from West  Point. Bowers said it was time "we righted this great wrong." Flipper was  graduated from West Point in 1877 and four years later, as the officer in  charge of the Ft. Sill, Okla., commissary, he was charged with embezzling  $3,791 and conduct unbecoming an officer. He was acquitted of the theft charge  but convicted of unbecoming conduct. However, it took 96 years more for the  Army to exonerate the man West Point would later name part of its library  after. Flipper's niece, Irsle King of Valdosta, Ga., and Gwinnett County  teacher Ray MacColl had fought for 18 years to secure proper recognition. The  man who was born into slavery in Thomasville died in 1940 at the age of 84 --  long before a world was able to express its regrets.  </P> <P>  -- The recent rampage in New York's Central Park in which a woman jogger was  beaten and raped by a gang of young thugs has prompted real estate tycoon  Donald Trump to pay $85,000 for full-page ads in four New York newspapers  calling for a return of the death penalty. In an interview with United Press  International, Trump said: "The criminal is being protected and the victim is  getting zero protection." He said the message in his ads, which are running  today, "is going beyond the death penalty -- this is giving back the policemen  their power. . . . " JAMES MARNELL  </P></p>

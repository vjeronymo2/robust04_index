			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / A home in the war zone: David Waller meets the exiled Croatian count who holds the seat of Vukovar FEW PEOPLE begin a political career at the age of 70. But Jakob, Count von und zu Eltz, has good reasons for throwing himself into the electoral fray as he did in July when he campaigned for, and won with a resounding majority, the Vukovar seat in the Croatian elections. He wants to go home. Not that the count is a refugee from the fighting in what used to be Yugoslavia; nor, as the owner of large estates on the Rhine and a medieval castle on the Moselle, is he suffering from the material hardship afflicting so many of those displaced by the war. However, for this German aristocrat, home is in Croatia, specifically Vukovar, the town on the Danube that was taken and occupied by Serb forces in November last year. Born in 1921, Count Jakob was brought up in an 18th century manor-house in the centre of the town, the principal residence of the Eltz family since 1733. He left in 1944, returning only in 1989 when it looked as though Yugoslavia was returning to democracy. He entered into negotiations for the return of the ancestral property, but his hopes were dashed by the outbreak of civil war. The mansion, preserved intact through the centuries, was destroyed late last year by Serb militia. The count's poster for his election campaign displays pictures of the mansion before and after the destruction. His slogan was 'Home Together.' His mission is to rebuild the house, to bring the exiled Croats back to Vukovar. 'I wouldn't have taken the trouble to get myself elected,' he says in impeccable English learnt from his Irish nanny, 'if I didn't genuinely believe that this were possible. This is my main political message. You have to be convinced that we are going to go back, and we are going to rebuild. If we resign ourselves to what has happened, if we give up hope, the Serbs will have achieved what they wanted, and the Croatians will have been driven out of Vukovar for good.' The Eltz family's connection with the town dates to the time when an ancestor helped the Holy Roman Emperor expel the Turks from the area. As a reward, he was allowed to buy the town, 23 villages, 200,000 acres of land and 31,000 serfs for the sum of 175,000 gold thalers. Thereafter, successive counts administered the estates on a feudal basis, taking responsibility for roads, bridges, schools, the judiciary, police, the health system and the churches. By the time Count Jakob was born, serfdom had been abolished and the estate encompassed a mere 20,000 acres. His father died when he was a child and Count Jakob grew up in what he describes as 'fairly modest style'. Like his forebears, he spent most of the year in the Vukovar mansion, its lawns stretching down to the Danube, only going to Germany in the summer when he would stay on his Rhineland estates, the most magnificent of which is the Burg Eltz in the Moselle. This many-turreted castle set on a rocky cliff was built by the count's ancestors in the 12th century and is one of Germany's most popular attractions. Its treasure chamber bears witness to the Eltz family's involvement in German history through the centuries. A picture of the Gothic pile is on the back of today's DM500 note. But the count, a fluent Croat-speaker, has always felt himself more Croatian than German, a feeling intensified by exile. He was forced to leave Vukovar shortly after the outbreak of World War Two. But for a fleeting visit shortly before Russian troops arrived in late 1944, he did not return for 46 years, when he started a succession of visits to the old family home. After the civil war broke out, each trip became more dangerous than the last. 'I visited Vukovar a number of times in early 1991,' he says. 'The last time I managed to get there was when the siege of the town had begun. We had to break through the ring to get food and medical supplies into town. I must admit I felt quite foolish. Here I was, an old man, my pockets full of Mills' bombs and a sub-machine gun around my neck. This, fortunately, I did not have to use. I did, however, draw heavy artillery and rocket fire on to my humble person.' The experience, he admits, gave him quite a nostalgic feeling: he had not been under such heavy fire since his days in the Wehrmacht during World War Two. Since then, his adventures have been political rather than military. He has thrown himself behind the Croatian cause and won his seat in the parliament-in-exile as an independent candidate. 'I can do more as an MP,' the German aristocrat bellows down the phone to a well-wisher congratulating him on his success, 'than as a mere count.' He says he wants to impress on the government of Croatia that the north-easternmost part of Croatia, where Vukovar is located, should not be forgotten. His views on the complex situation are informed by a deep knowledge of the history of the region - and by a deep hatred of Serbs. 'There is absolutely no historical foundation for the Serbian territorial claims at all,' he declares, before launching into a tirade of abuse against the Serbs. His views on the United Nations involvement in the region are hardly more temperate. 'The presence of the blue-helmets (UN troops),' he claims, 'has not helped to ameliorate the situation. They are openly favouring the Serbs and frequently aiding and abetting the 'ethnic cleansing' programme.' The count draws solace from an episode in the family's history. In the 14th century the Elector of Trier raised a siege against Burg Eltz, building a small tower on a neighbouring hill with the aim of raining missiles on to the knights of Eltz. The tower is now a ruin, a source of satisfaction to Count Jakob. 'Burg Eltz belongs to me, but where is the Elector now?' he chuckles. All the Eltz family had to do was sit and wait for a decade or two. The same patience underlies the count's determination that the family will once more go home - to Vukovar.</p>

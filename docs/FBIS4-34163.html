			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Quito, 15 Jun (EFE) -- The Ecuadoran Government  today set 7 August as the date for the referendum which  President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced on 10 June and which most  of the opposition political forces in the country have described  as illegal. During a radio and television network today, an  announcer just announced the date for the referendum and read  the seven-question questionnaire Duran-Ballen presented three  days ago. The results of the referendum will decide whether  another plebiscite will be held on 2 January 1995. This second  plebiscite will be held to learn of the people's wishes  regarding the summoning of a constituent assembly to make  changes to the Constitution.    "Our most heartfelt wish is to make actual changes to the  social, political, economic, and moral plans," President  Duran-Ballen said during last week's radio and television  network.

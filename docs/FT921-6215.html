			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Kohl backs Prague's EC drive German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pledged yesterday to press for Czechoslovakia's integration into the European Community as he signed a Czechoslovak-German treaty of good neighbourliness in Prague, writes Ariane Genillard. Several hundred demonstrators, mostly elderly people from the Sudeten lands, greeted Mr Kohl with angry shouts of 'shame' and 'this is our home.' They reject the treaty because it fails to settle the claims of Sudeten Germans, expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945. They have been campaigning to regain their former properties, now being auctioned to Czechs in a privatisation plan.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Angola ripe for an economic revolution: After the peace deal, Julian Ozanne considers the potential of a resource-rich country FEW COUNTRIES in the world have squandered their vast potential wealth as carelessly as Angola. Easily one of the richest five countries in sub-Saharan Africa with abundant fertile land, huge fishing and mineral resources, extensive petroleum deposits and tremendous energy and irrigation potential from the country's rivers, the Angolan economy today is one of the most under-developed, distorted and anarchic on the continent. Sixteen years of destructive civil war and foreign invasion have left a devastating toll. Last week's peace agreement initialled in Lisbon between the government and Unita rebels offers hope of a substantial economic turnaround. But even with peace and normality returning to the country the government's economic policies will have to be substantially revised. While many African countries woke up to the necessity of fundamental economic adjustment by the mid-1980s, socialist Angola kept its head buried in the sand. Obstruction by party ideologues kept a plan for economic reform, presented to the government in 1987, from being implemented. Almost four years later the government announced the first minor devaluation of the currency for 15 years from kwanza 30 to 60 to the dollar (the parallel market rate is about kwanza 1,200 to the dollar), an insignificant change in economic terms but an important symbol of a growing commitment to adjustment. 'A few people in the government do now understand that there is no alternative to sweeping economic change,' said Mr Aguinaldo Jaime, the finance minister. 'But the fact is we have an economic system that does not work. It is artificial and inefficient.' The task of policy reform is formidable. Since independence in 1975 the government has pursued a centrally-planned economy with extensive bureaucratic controls, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange, a fixed exchange rate, rigid price controls, rationing of consumer goods through inadequately supplied state shops, and state control of industry. Many prices and salaries have remained unchanged since 1975. The results were inevitable. Industry, under poor management and critically short of imported inputs, ground to a halt. Angola, once a food exporter, became dependent on food imports. A huge, bustling parallel market grew up where the dollar traded at realistic levels, prices were set by market forces and Angolans sold off the surplus of the few basic goods they could buy at state-run shops with a ration card. A glimpse of how distorted the economy has become was given last October when the government tried to mop up 95 per cent of the excessive money supply it had printed over the years to fuel its budget deficits. Angolans had to hand in their old kwanzas and were only given back five 'novo' kwanzas for every hundred surrendered. The government promised the remainder would be paid in time. The banks took in 90bn kwanzas out of an estimated 150bn in circulation. For a short period there was chaos and prices dropped dramatically on the unofficial markets. But they have increased markedly since, largely because the government was unable to inject goods into the state-run stores to meet unfulfilled demand. The minister of trade was sacked shortly afterwards amid allegations that imported goods destined for state shops had been 'diverted' to the parallel market or across the border into Zaire. Unsustainable levels of public expenditure, with budget deficits reaching as much as 12-15 per cent of GDP, have been possible because of Angola's growing oil industry, which has traditionally provided about 65 per cent of government revenues. The oil sector, which exported 476,000 barrels a day last year, has also kept the balance of payments afloat. With large oil earnings, Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1989, Angola has generated healthy trade surpluses throughout the 1980s. But these have been marred by large and increasing deficits in the services account, particularly in interest payments, transport and travel, and by a growing debt service burden, estimated at between 45-55 per cent of exports before debt rescheduling. Angola's external debt is more than Dollars 7bn (about 90-95 per cent of GDP), of which at least half is owed to the Soviet Union. In recent years Angola has increasingly drawn on short-term commercial borrowing and has accumulated significant payments arrears. Resolution of the civil war will be crucial to economic revival. The war has regularly absorbed 60 per cent of foreign exchange earnings and, according to the United Nations, cost Angola Dollars 27-Dollars 30bn between 1980-88. The new economic team has promised sweeping reform this year including creeping devaluation, privatisation of many of the 400 state enterprises, an overhaul of the banking system, and price and trade liberalisation. However, their ability to implement the necessary measures to boost the economy is being restricted by the reluctance of the party elite to change during profound political change. The few members of the ruling MPLA party who believe they have a chance of winning the country's first free democratic elections are extremely nervous of the impact of austerity measures and adjustment on their popularity, especially in the urban areas. Those in the MPLA who recognise they have no chance of electoral victory want to keep the economic status quo because the distortions provide ample opportunity to the party elite for substantial economic privileges. 'Economic reform is being held back by an unholy alliance of crooks and ideologues and crooks hiding behind ideology who have vested interests in the black market and the controlled economy,' said one western diplomat. 'Many MPLA people are grabbing as much as they can before tomorrow comes because they know tomorrow will not belong to them.'</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Dundee united in derisive thumbs-down: The Timex plant may close now that strikers have rejected the peace plan YESTERDAY'S unanimous rejection by the Timex strikers of a peace plan negotiated by their union to end their four-month strike reflects how attitudes have hardened. But the strikers may have lost their only opportunity to resolve the dispute with some semblance of victory. Their derisive thumbs-down after less than half an hour of emotional debate is a bitter blow to the AEEU engineering union. Mr Jimmy Airlie, the union's Scottish executive officer, had negotiated hard with Timex's management over the past fortnight in search of a compromise deal he believed the strikers could live with. What he presented to the 340 strikers in Dundee yesterday was the best he believes the company will offer. A one-year wage freeze may have been hard for them to swallow as well as cuts in fringe benefits - it has been calculated that the deal would have been equivalent to a 27 per cent reduction in living standards. But Mr Airlie pointed with some satisfaction to concessions he had extracted from the company, not without difficulty. For Timex to offer jobs back for all strikers and not just rehire selectively was a genuine breakthrough. Timex also accepted that it should pay statutory minimum redundancy to those who did not want to be re-employed, which Mr Airlie told the strike meeting was a 'unique' concession in his long experience. It is hard for the union's national leadership to know what to do next. 'We have no options left,' said one official. None of the full-time union officials outside Dundee believe they can do anything that will ensure any kind of victory. 'The trouble is we are dealing with virgin strikers. They have suffered a grave injustice by all being sacked and they see no good reason why they should compromise to get their old jobs back,' said another official. The strikers' resolute stance will strengthen the hand of Timex's local manager Mr Peter Hall. It was his decision to fire all the workers in January and replace them with a new labour force when they refused to accept much smaller cuts in their pay and benefits than are now being demanded. Last night Mr Hall made clear the company's offer would not be improved. There have been differences on how to resolve the strike between Mr Hall and Mr John Dryfe, the US-based Timex director responsible for the company's circuit board business, who was himself once in charge of the Dundee plant. Mr Hall has hinted that he wants to re-employ selectively from the strikers. He seems to have no genuine desire to see all of them back inside the plant, particularly the shop stewards whom he blames for the deterioration of industrial relations. But when Mr Bill Jordan, the union president, and Mr Airlie made a private appeal to the company, Timex decided to see whether a settlement could be negotiated. Since January the strike has become a cause celebre not just in the British Labour movement but across the world. Achieving a deal was seen by some in the company as an important move in helping to restore Timex's tainted image. After yesterday the company has three options. One is to go on as before, recruiting a larger substitute workforce and ignoring the strikers. Another is to go back to the bargaining table with the union and improve the offer. But there is also a final option that many in Timex management outside Dundee might start to consider - closing the plant. Circuit board production is not part of the company's core business and it loses money. Mr Dryfe says it was mainly for sentimental reasons that the company stayed in Dundee, introducing circuit board manufacture, after shifting watch production to France 10 years ago. The strike leaders have often declared that if they do not win, they would prefer to see the plant closed. If the dispute drags on to autumn and beyond, this may become an increasingly attractive option for a company that feels hard done by and believes it has done all it can to resolve one of the most bitter strikes seen in Britain for years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Countdown at Timex  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 7 1992 New shop stewards elected at Timex  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mid December Talks begin between Timex management and AEEU representatives over lay-offs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 7 1993 Company implements lay-offs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Janauary 15 AEEU secret ballot: 92 per cent back strike mandate; 8 per cent against  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 29 Strike begins.

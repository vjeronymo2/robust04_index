			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Jobs hold key to Japan's recovery: A flood of redundancies could tip the faltering economy over the edge Japanese executives have just begun their annual bonenkai or 'forget-the-year' parties. With profits down and sales slipping, they have much to forget, but the results of the latest survey of business sentiment suggests that it will be forced smiles all round when they toast the year ahead. The executives will derive little cheer from the surprisingly favourable GDP figures for the third quarter, which show growth of 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter. For this is seen as a lagging indicator and the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business found that trading conditions have worsened in the past two months. Manufacturing companies told the Bank that their sales will fall by an average of 4.5 per cent this year, that capital spending is being cut by 15.3 per cent, and that they face a growing surplus of labour, which raises the prospect of an increase in unemployment in coming months. But the Bank could point to one positive sign. Companies said the lending attitude of financial institutions has become more 'accommodating' over the past three months, reducing the pressure on the Bank to cut the official discount rate from the present record low of 1.75 per cent. The Bank of Japan has argued that Japanese commercial banks, burdened by bad property-related loans, are still willing to lend to traditional customers, but doubts remain about the readiness to lend to companies not regarded as core customers or in sectors which are suffering most during the downturn. Officials at the Economic Planning Agency said their greatest concern was that companies under pressure would be tempted to dismiss employees, leading to an erosion of consumer confidence and the stalling of economic recovery in coming months. The EPA believes that consumers have the resources but not the inclination to spend, and suspects that there will be a recovery of demand for cars and electronic products early next year, two sectors which have been a drag on the economy for much of the past year. A cut in income taxes is being considered as part of the government's next stimulatory package, due to be put together from next week, but further reductions in overtime and bonuses would work against an increase in consumer confidence. The Bank of Japan's index of excess employment rose from 19 to 26 over the last three months. Other indices suggested that the reduction of excess inventories has slowed, while the surplus of production capacity is increasing. A range of small manufacturers, the most likely to cut their workforces, reported a sharp deterioration of business conditions, with industrial machinery makers, materials companies and textile makers among the least optimistic. Japan's official forecasters are still hoping for a recovery in the final months of the fiscal year ending in March, but the Bank of Japan admitted yesterday that an upturn is more likely to come next fiscal year and that the economy's fate hinges on conditions in the labour market. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, said business sentiment tended to be particularly pessimistic at this stage of the economic cycle, and there was reason for confidence that there would be a recovery next year. However, he suspects the economy will shrink again this quarter. The recovery in housing investment, which rose 9 per cent during the third quarter and boosted the GDP figure, was linked to falling interest rates for home loans, an expansion of concessionary finance available to home buyers from the government, and the recognition among buyers that housing prices may have hit bottom. EPA officials described the economy as 'bumping along the bottom', first touched in April this year. However, they concede that a rush of redundancies could send the economy into a downward spiral and are hoping that companies will hold on to their surplus labour for at least a few more months.</p>

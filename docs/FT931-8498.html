			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Yeltsin plea to nation for support RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the nation to support his version of a constitution if a referendum on who rules the country becomes necessary. Speaking on television, he outlined the constitutional agreement he is seeking in tough negotiations with parliament on shaping the balance of power. However, parliament seems certain to reject his proposals because of his demands that the government take sole charge of economic reform and control of the central bank. They amount to a neutering of parliament, with the added insult of taking from it the decision about a new constitution and giving it to a constituent assembly. Mr Yeltsin said there were forces, 'inherited from the old system and. . . responsible for nothing', who were benefiting from the crisis' - a clear reference to parliament, elected during the Soviet period. He endorsed a referendum 'in which the people can have their say' as the only way out of a power crisis if negotiations fail with the team selected by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. Mr Yeltsin reminded his audience that he had tried many times to get agreement with the Supreme Soviet on a respite from the constant power struggle. Only when the threat of a referendum was held above their heads did they agree to negotiate, he said. He supported early elections, he said, once an election law had been adopted  -with elections for parliament in the spring of next year, and for president in the spring of 1995. 'To hold the two elections at the same time would risk destabilisation,' he said. The president knows, however, that he is launching an appeal for support at a time when indifference, even disgust, with politics is running high and when his own popularity ratings are at their lowest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The Iraqi skies, which have been and are still  considered an arena for Western aircraft to engage in maneuvers  and for flaunting their strength, turned into an sacrificial  altar for these forces on Thursday and resulted in the deaths of  26 American, French, British, and Turkish servicemen. The  incident took place when a squadron of American F-15 planes  fired at and downed two military helicopters, killing 26 of its  American, British, French, and Turkish crewmen.    This incident is noteworthy because, despite the West's  ultramodern weaponry systems and technology, the degree of  confusion among the human element and within the West's military  establishments is such that the West was unable to prevent an  incident that many experts have say could have been avoided.    It should be noted that most of the Western victims of the  bloody Persian Gulf war and of the postwar incidents were  victims of military mistakes committed by the Westerners  themselves. Even though the West's military experts are trying  to portray the recent mistake as a technical error and to blame  the electronic systems in their aircraft, nevertheless the truth  lies elsewhere--there is a state of psychological confusion  being experienced by the West's military forces deployed in this  part of the world.    Undoubtedly these forces are more victims of the political  interests of their leaders than victims of sacred objectives or  even of national interests. Thus, one cannot believe that the  recent incident was a unique incident that will not recur. This  incident speaks of a fundamental characteristic of these forces  that has just begun to show, and it is not improbable that more  Western forces deployed in the Persian Gulf will be added to the  list of victims soon.</p>

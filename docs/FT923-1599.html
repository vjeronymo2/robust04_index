			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Daewoo expected to buy GM side of joint venture DAEWOO, the South Korean conglomerate, is expected next month to end its auto manufacturing joint venture, Daewoo Motor, with General Motors (GM) by purchasing the US car maker's 50 per cent shareholding for an estimated Dollars 170m. Daewoo and GM have been negotiating the terms of the joint venture's dissolution over the past year after disagreements surfaced over the future management of the troubled company. Daewoo Motor, which is unlisted, has been overtaken by Kia Motors as South Korea's second largest vehicle maker and is suffering losses of about Won50bn (Dollars 64m) for the first half of 1992. Daewoo has been hurt by labour disputes and rising wages. Daewoo and GM agreed to end the joint venture, formed in 1983, after GM refused to inject an extra Dollars 100m of capital into the company to expand production and develop overseas marketing. Daewoo also wanted to end GM's exclusive right to sell Daewoo cars abroad. Daewoo Motor cars are produced under an agreement with GM. Under the proposed settlement, Daewoo will be able to continue to use GM's sales network in the US and other countries, including Brazil and South Africa, and will continue to sell its cars elsewhere without restrictions. Daewoo's purchase of GM's shareholding will be made in several installments. Daewoo will take over complete ownership of Daewoo Motor, although it is negotiating with Nissan to replace GM as a possible joint venture partner.</p>

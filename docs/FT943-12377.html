			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Record first-half fall in Japanese vehicle output Japanese vehicle production in the first six months of this year was down 10.8 per cent, a record first-half fall and the first time the industry has seen a fourth consecutive fall, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Vehicle production between January and June totalled 5.2m units compared with 5.9m units in the same period last year. The previous record fall was 9.4 per cent in 1974, JAMA said. In June alone, vehicle production fell 3.2 per cent to 956,662 units. The fall came in spite of a more moderate fall in domestic demand of 3 per cent to 3.8m units. JAMA attributed the decline to falling exports caused by the yen's rapid appreciation and to a growing trend towards overseas production. JAMA estimates that exports in the period fell 20 per cent. Mitsubishi Motors said yesterday it would start manufacturing an upgraded version of its popular Galant car in the US next spring in an attempt to avoid the worst effects of the high yen. Although Mitsubishi plans to export engines for the car from Japan, the company has already agreed to buy transmissions for the car from Chrysler, the US carmaker, to reduce costs. Honda is to invest Dollars 310m (Pounds 200m) to boost its north American operations. Honda said it would increase car and engine manufacturing capacity and strengthen R&amp;D and sales in north America, and increase exports from there. Such moves have been a significant factor behind falling domestic production levels, JAMA said. Car production fell 11.9 per cent in the first half and 5.4 per cent in June, the 15th consecutive monthly fall. Production of trucks fell 7.5 per cent and that of buses fell 12.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bass Brewers to carry Pounds 10m cost Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, told shareholders yesterday that first-half profits for Bass Brewers would be affected by an additional cost of about Pounds 10m in respect of end-product duty introduced in June. However, this would be offset partially by an improvement in bad debts. At Bass Taverns, profits to date were ahead of the comparable period. However, the reduced number of houses would effect profits by some Pounds 9m in the first half. The shares fell 16p to 592p.</p>

Earlier requests by the German ambassador in Damascus had so  far been met with "partly irritated and partly negative"  responses from the Syrian authorities, Hartmut Hilldenberg of  the German foreign ministry said Monday [21 March].    He is a witness to a court hearing dealing with the 1983  attack on the French cultural centre in West Berlin, Maison de  France, in which one person died and 23 were injured.    The Syrians have denied involvement in the incident.  However, a Syrian diplomat admitted that Damascus supported the  Carlos group in the early 1980s. German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel met his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Chareh, in Bonn  Thursday to express the German demands for the extradition of  Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos and his German associate  Johannes Weinrich.    Investigators believe those who carried out the attack  wanted  to free another one of Carlos' associates, a German woman named  Magdalena Kopp. In 1982 she was sentenced to four years  imprisonment in France for possessing explosives.</p>

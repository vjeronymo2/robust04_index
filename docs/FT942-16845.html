			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Canberra sees jobless rate of less than 10% Australia is forecasting a fall in its unemployment rate to below 10 per cent by the end of this year. Mr Simon Crean, employment minister, made the prediction following the release yesterday of official statistics showing unemployment rate dropping to 10.3 per cent in March, the lowest monthly figure in two-and-a-half years, from 10.6 per cent the previous month. This is the seventh consecutive month Australia has recorded growth in employment, with nearly 160,000 jobs created since August last year. The release of the figures coincided with the publication of a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which says that Australia's unemployment rate will remain at around 10 per cent for another two years. Mr Crean said OECD's view of Australian jobs was based on surveys conducted in August last year when unemployment rate was above 11 per cent. The sharp turnround in December made the report look too pessimistic. The report recommends further labour market reform, suggesting that Australia should 'make a decisive break with the award system', in which wages are centrally negotiated between unions, employers and the federal government. It also suggests that wages for youth, the long-term unemployed and unskilled job seekers may be too high. Market analysts are cautious about the jobless trend. The so-called participation rate, which reflects the number of people actively seeking jobs, has remained flat during the last three months. The rate is bound to rise again as the economy recovers, thus getting the unemployment rate to less than 10 per cent more diffi-cult. While the OECD is not very optimistic about jobs, it predicts the Australian economy will grow 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent through 1994 and 1995, with only a slight rise in inflation. The economy registered 4 per cent growth in 1993. The OECD also predicts a much-awaited recovery in business investment. It rules out huge increases in current account deficits in the short term.</p>

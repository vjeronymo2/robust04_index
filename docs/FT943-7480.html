			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Observer: Shrink-wrapped Most city folk have heard of Paul Manduca who has powered through the money management business to become boss of the Pounds 30bn Threadneedle Asset Management group at the age of 42. And some might even have heard of his younger brother, Francis, 30, a fund manager at Gartmore. But another Manduca has popped up in the money management game, and, unlike the other two, he is not a hired hand. Philip, the second youngest brother, has set up his own hedge fund. Fresh from three years managing family money in Palm Beach, he's started Sant Cassia Investment Management which takes its name from his Maltese father and hopes to make its clients rich by dabbling in exchange-traded futures and options and other exotica. He has set up shop in Chelsea Harbour and equipped himself with a PhD in 'neural networks', a sexy computer model which apparently 'learns from its mistakes', and a resident psychologist who analyses what 'frightens' markets. So what does brother Paul think of his new competitor? 'He said he hoped I did well,' says Philip cheerfully, 'because I was using the family name and crest'. At least he didn't call it Manduca &amp; Co.</p>

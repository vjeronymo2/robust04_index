			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>   [Text] Lvov 24 March, TASS -- If Ukraine does not have its  own army, it will have no independence either, Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk said. He spoke at a news conference  after the end of a military training session at the Yavor  training ground of the Carpathian military district, in which  the Air Force, artillery pieces and tanks took part. Along with  the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, military  attaches of a number of foreign counties watched the shooting  practice.    "The expenditures of 40 billion karbovanets, as calculated  by  some journalists, on the military exercise in these difficult  days are still necessary," Kravchuk said. "If we want today to  have 150 grammes of pork on our tables instead of 100 grammes,  tomorrow we shall have no army and, consequently, no  independence."    Problems raised at the news conference included the  stock-taking at the Black Sea Fleet, the creation of a special  bilateral commission and the conversion of nuclear armaments in  Ukraine.    The president expressed satisfaction over the decision of  the  Central Electoral Commission of the Crimea to hold a social  opinion poll instead of a referendum, as planned by Yuriy  Meshkov. "The opinion poll will have no consequences, but will  cost a lot of money," Kravchuk pointed out. Touching upon the  forthcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, Kravchuk stressed  again that he was not going to run for presidency and explained  it by the absence of a new constitution, laws on the structure  of the state management system and the status of the president,  which the outgoing parliament failed to adopt. The Ukrainian  president hopes that the elections will take place on 27 March,  otherwise Ukraine will be swept by chaos.</p>

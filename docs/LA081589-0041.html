			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 FROM E. GERMAN OPERA TROUPE IN BRITAIN DEFECT TO W. GERMANY  </P> <P> Six members of a leading East German opera company have defected to West  Germany after a two-week tour in London, the West German embassy said Monday.  </P> <P> An embassy spokeswoman said five singers and technicians left the Komische Oper  company and flew to West Germany late last week. A sixth visited the mission  Monday before leaving Britain.  </P> <P> The names of the six were not immediately available.  </P> <P> The East German Embassy in London refused to comment on the defection. A  spokesman for the Komische Oper in East Berlin said, "I can't confirm or deny  this."  </P> <P> But the Daily Express newspaper quoted lighting engineer Fred Spodzieja, 41, as  saying he had planned his flight to the West for a year.  </P> <P> Communist East Germany, which keeps a tight rein on the cultural activities of  performers, has lost many talented artists during Western tours. Others have  been expelled to West Germany for opposing the official party line.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, hundreds of East Germans have sought an exit to the West by  taking refuge in the West German Embassy in Hungary and Bonn's mission in East  Berlin. The flood of people became so great that both buildings have been  closed while Bonn negotiates with Communist authorities.  </P></p>

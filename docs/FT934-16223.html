			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead Vickers down ABBOTT MEAD VICKERS, the advertising group, yesterday reported a slight drop in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 1.5m. This drop was in spite of a strong increase in new business in recent months and an increase in turnover to Pounds 94.4m (Pounds 77.7m). Mr David Abbott, chairman, said there were signs that 'widespread cutbacks in client spending seem to be a thing of the past'. This, together with continuing success in winning new business 'gives us considerable optimism as we look forward into 1994', he said. This optimism was reflected in an interim dividend increased 7 per cent to 3.2p, although earnings per share dropped to 5.71p (6p). Operating profits increased slightly to Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 1.23m). The group reported that average cash balances had improved to over Pounds 7.5m, against Pounds 6.2m. However, lower interest rates had reduced interest income to Pounds 211,000 (Pounds 308,000), said AMV. Profits growth had partly been held back by investment in software to transmit full colour pictures, although the longer-term opportunities of the technology were 'substantial', according to the group. AMV acquired the BBDO London advertising agency in 1991 and 'tangible rewards' from the relationship continued. AMV-BBDO moved from tenth to fifth position in the 1993 Register-MEAL ranking of advertising agencies, with a year-on-year billing increase of 38 per cent. AMV bought Clarke Hooper from the receiver in 1992. First-half new business totalled over Pounds 48m on an annualised basis. New accounts included: Gossard, Ever Ready, British Telecom code change, Radio Times, Du Pont, Dunlop Slazenger, British Gas, SmithKline Beecham and Lever Brothers. The group was additionally pitching for business worth over Pounds 54m on an annualised basis, it said.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Booker shares fall 27p on profit forecast cuts SHARES in Booker, the food group, fell 27p yesterday to 345p, adding to a fall of 22p on Thursday, to cut the shares by 12.4 per cent over two days. The share price fall was in response to cuts in profit forecasts for the group following management changes in the group's Booker Fitch food services subsidiary, a wholesaler serving the catering market. Stockbrokers have reduced forecasts for pre-tax profits in the current year to around Pounds 90m from earlier estimates of Pounds 98m to Pounds 100m, compared with Pounds 103.9m reported for 1991. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive of Booker, said the strategy behind the acquisition of Fitch Lovell in September 1990 was still valid. The catering market, for example, should return to growth as the recession ended and the trend to eating more meals outside the home resumed, he said. He said that 'a good bit more' could be done to improve efficiency in the Booker Fitch food services business, which could be 'better accomplished by a new management team'. The subsidiary was in the process of renegotiating contracts with some of its large customers which run chains of restaurants. As well as difficult trading conditions, the profits are expected to be depressed by an exceptional charge of around Pounds 5m covering rationalisation costs in the subsidiary, part of Booker's food distribution division. Analysts said they expected some depot closures and job losses. Brokers said that on forecasts of Pounds 90m the dividend cover will be slim if the final dividend is held at last year's level of 14.25p. However, analysts expect the decision on the dividend, to be taken in March next year, will reflect trading conditions at that time. If the dividend is maintained the shares will yield 8.4 per cent. In Booker Fitch food services, Mr John Black has been replaced as managing director of the business by Mr Tony Noble, who has been one of the divisional directors. Mr Black is currently on holiday. Mr Tony Moss has been replaced as operations director by Mr Fred Barnes who is moving across from another company within the division. Mr Moss has resigned from Booker.</p>

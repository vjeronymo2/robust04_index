			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Genbel to expand securities trading arm GENBEL, formerly the investment arm of Gencor, South Africa's second-largest mining house, has announced a two-pronged reorganisation. It plans to restructure its core investments and expand its securities trading operations. Genbel's repositioning centres around strengthening Unisen, the investment trading arm. It wants to give the group a more dynamic role than previously, when it functioned mainly as a long-term investment holding company with a strong commodities focus. The restructuring flows from the recent unbundling of Gencor, the company which helped establish Genbel to help finance Gencor projects. Although Genbel will retain close ties with its main shareholders - Sankorp and Rembrandt will, as concert parties, hold 35 per cent of Genbel - unbundling has given it the opportunity to chart a new course less closely tied to the fortunes of the Gencor group. Mr Anton Botha, managing director, said the spur for the group's transformation to a 'dynamic portfolio holder and securities investment trader' had been its success, through Unisen, in the trading markets. Over the last five years, Unisen has achieved an average total return, per annum, of 38.5 per cent, compared with 23.3 per cent for the Johannesburg stock exchange's All Share Index. The aim is to significantly enlarge Unisen's trading portfolio, with the object of materially outperforming the index over time. Unisen has had assets of about R200m (Dollars 59.5m) over the last three years. However Genbel's recent restructuring and the transfer of gold shares into Unisen has boosted its net assets to about R1bn.</p>

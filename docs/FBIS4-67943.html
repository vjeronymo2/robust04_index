			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: ``Turkey Will Buy Missiles From </F> Russia'']    [Text] Turkey and the Russian Federation have moved to  cooperate on defense. National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan  has revealed that Turkey will buy long-range missiles from the  Russian Federation. He also said that he agreed with Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev to help Turkey to acquire Russia's  technology in ballistic missiles.    Golhan stressed that he held talks with Pavel Grachev, who  is  one of Russia's most influential officials, when he visited the  Russian Federation some time ago. He asserted: ``Defense  Ministry officials in Russia informed me that they are prepared  to sell various types of arms.''    Golhan said that Turkey has moved to acquire missiles  because  Iran and Syria already have them in their military inventories.  He asserted: ``Russia has very advanced missiles. We will  cooperate with it to help Turkey acquire its missile technology.  We have particular problems with our neighbors from the point  of view of missiles and nuclear weapons. Iran and Syria have  long-range missiles. So Turkey must equip itself accordingly.  Turkey has never been an aggressor country. It does not intend  to become one. We covet no country's territory. But we must  maintain a deterrent force. Turkey is committed to the Treaty  on Conventional Forces in Europe. We are not competing with our  neighbors to acquire arms. But we do not want Turkey to be  regarded as a weak country. A significant opportunity exists  for cooperation with the Russian Federation to modernize the  Turkish Armed Forces in every area.''    Golhan stressed that Turkey has concluded a framework  agreement with the Russian Federation for technical cooperation  in defense. He said: ``Everything has been included in that  framework agreement. They agree to cooperate on issues relating  to their missile technology. Experts from the two countries  will work to realize their cooperation.''    Iran, Iraq, and Syria have many Scud missiles. Iran has  reportedly cooperated with the DPRK to increase the range of its  missiles and improve its missile technology. According to U.S.  intelligence reports, Iran has acquired technology on guided  missiles. It is working to produce a missile with its own  resources.    Iraq used Scud-B missiles during the Gulf war. But the  technology that was used in the production of those missiles was  old. Consequently they were not effective. The Scud-B missiles  are 90 cm in diameter, weigh 6,300 kg, and have a range of 300  km. They may miss their targets by 600-800 meters. They may  operate with solid or liquid fuel and deliver chemical or  nuclear warheads. The Russian Federation has long-range  missiles, which have been produced with modern technology.    Turkey signed the agreement known as the Missile Technology  Control Regime in 1993. The United States, the Russian  Federation, and many Western countries also signed that  agreement, which bans the sale of missiles with a range of over  300 km and that can deliver warheads heavier than 500 kg. The  agreement also limits the transfer of the technology required  for the production of such missiles. Iran and Syria, which  possess long-range missiles, have not signed that agreement.    The Russian Federation's SS-21 missiles are not included in  that agreement. The SS-21 missiles, which were developed in  1976 to deliver conventional warheads, have a range of 120-200  km. They are launched from mobile launchers. Reportedly, the  technology used in the production of the Scud missiles is 20  years older than the technology used in the production of the  SS-21 missiles. The arming of the SS-21 missiles with warheads  capable of causing mass destruction has been banned. Turkey has  acquired military equipment and arms from Russia in the past.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "r": "Slovak PEN Center Protests Against </F> Restriction of Media Freedom"]    [Text] Bratislava--At its meeting on 18 January 1994, the  Slovak PEN [International Association of Poets, Playwrights,  Editors, Essayists, and Novelists] Center Committee adopted a  statement, which says, among other things:    Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar speaks about a list of 40  journalists who supposedly receive their pay from abroad in  dollars and asserts that, after verifying the list's  authenticity, he will make it public.    The Constitution of the Slovak Republic guarantees every  citizen's right to freely disseminate information and there is  no law banning the acceptance of honorariums from abroad. This  does not even run counter to ethics. What we consider immoral  is, quite the contrary, the evocation of stereotypes of  totalitarian thinking by which dollars were synonymous with  dirty money. The publication of such a list, but even the very  mention of it by the prime minister, is an evident attempt to  use xenophobic sentiments in society against independent media,  an attempt that is, in the final analysis, directed against  democracy. We protest, furthermore, against the prosecuting  bodies' efforts to introduce into practice Article 103 of the  Penal Code [regarding defamation of the head of state]. This  precedent of a political problem being carried to the level of  criminal law is a dangerous signal of future abuse of Articles  102 and 103 of the Penal Code against truly independent critics  of power. The Slovak PEN Center deeply regrets that two of its  members signed the Proclamation of 50 Slovak Intellectuals to  the Intellectuals of Europe [reference to a statement adopted in  Bratislava on 6 January 1994, in which 50 Slovak intellectuals  blame Hungarian policies and ethnic Hungarians' "irredentism"  for tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations].</p>

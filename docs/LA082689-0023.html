			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A CONFRONTATION RETOLD  </P> <P> The issue at an Encino school Aug. 17 was not a rough confrontation between two  affluent communities, but whether the Santa Monica Mountains should be  preserved for all people as a national recreation area or should be destroyed  by roads, housing pads and county dump sites.  </P> <P> Under the pretext of easing congestion on Hayvenhurst Avenue, two Encino  homeowners groups advocate extending Reseda Boulevard to Mulholland Drive and  paving Mulholland. Developers and the city of Los Angeles support their view.  The Friends of Caballero Canyon opposes it. Extending Reseda and paving  Mulholland is a violation of state parks policy and the Mulholland Scenic  Parkway Plan, which Councilman Marvin Braude says he supports.  </P> <P> The Encino groups hired burly security guards to prevent anyone from Encino or  Tarzana entering the public school who did not support building the road. The  guards manhandled an elected official of the Sierra Club and a woman board  member of Friends of Caballero Canyon.  </P> <P> Rob Glushon, head of one Encino group, tore down signs that proclaimed support  for the park. He tried to punch a UC student who was holding a sign. When he  was in the process of breaking a banner that children had spent hours painting  in our garage, my son tried to restrain him and was thrown to the ground and  injured.  </P> <P> The Encino groups called the police before the meeting and when they arrived  late, they found a peaceful, but shocked, assembly of kids, retirees, hikers  and citizens who had just witnessed the violent and effective repression of  free speech.  </P> <P> Braude entered this rigged affair with the developer's men. He was neither  jostled nor pushed.  </P> <P> JEAN ROSENFELD  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

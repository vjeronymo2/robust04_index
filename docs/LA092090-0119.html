			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOWMAN TO BRING TALENT HOME FOR PICKWICK SHOWS;  </P> <P> FIGURE SKATING: FORMER NATIONAL CHAMPION FROM VAN NUYS TO PERFORM IN BENEFITS.  </P> <P> Christopher Bowman and Todd Eldredge, winners of the past two U. S. national  men's figure skating championships, are expected to participate in  "Icetraveganza," a benefit show produced by the Los Angeles Figure Skating  Club.  </P> <P> Bowman, Eldredge and several other of the club's international competitors will  perform in shows Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Pickwick Ice Arena in  Burbank. There will be no scoring.  </P> <P> Bowman, 23, will be returning to his old stomping grounds. He grew up in Van  Nuys and trained with Coach Frank Carroll at Pickwick until last year when  Carroll opened his own Ice Castles International Training Center near Lake  Arrowhead.  </P> <P> Eldredge, 19, originally from Massachusetts, now trains in San Diego with Coach  Richard Callaghan. Eldredge was the surprise winner of this year's national  championships in Salt Lake City. Bowman, who was bothered by a back injury,  placed fourth.  </P> <P> Both skaters competed in August at the Goodwill Games in Seattle. Eldredge,  coming off a fifth-place finish in the World Championships, placed third in the  Goodwill Games behind world champion Kurt Browning of Canada and Viktor  Petrenko of the Soviet Union. Bowman, who appeared out of shape, was sixth.  </P> <P> Todd Sand and Natasha Kuchiki, the nation's top pairs team, also will perform.  Sand, 26, from Thousand Oaks, and Kuchiki, 13, from Canoga Park, were second at  the U.S. championships behind Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo. However, the  gold medal-winning team split up to pursue singles careers soon after.  </P> <P> Kuchiki's former partner, Richard Alexander, 21, from Simi Valley, will skate  with his new partner, Tristen Vega, 16, from Torrance. Alexander and Vega  joined forces a year ago and won the U.S. Juniors title only four months later.  </P> <P> Other top names who will be appearing in the show include 1984 Olympian Tiffany  Chin, 1988 Olympic bronze medalist Peter Oppegard and the Olympic Festival gold  medal ice dancing team of Jeanne Miley and Michael Verlich.  </P> <P> Proceeds go to the club's Olympic and world competition fund with a portion  donated to the fight against cerebral palsy.  </P></p>

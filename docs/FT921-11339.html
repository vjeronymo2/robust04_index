			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading TRADING in Footsie futures was volatile, with a squeeze in the closing minutes of the session helping to lift the underlying cash market out of the doldrums, writes Joel Kibazo. There was little buying interest for the March contract early in the session and it fell to the day's low of 2,561 by around 9am. Bargain hunters soon caused a turnround in the contract but the buoyancy was curtailed by the release of disappointing US statistics. Nevertheless, a firm Wall Street and several buying orders late in the session triggered a squeeze, sending March higher which helped to revive the cash market. March closed at 2,584, a premium to the index of 28, and 12 points above its estimated fair value premium of 16. Turnover was 6,218 contracts. In the traded options market, turnover surged to 32,791 contracts, above the 30,000 break-even level, and with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 10,847 lots. BZW was reported to have done most of the day's trading in the index. British Steel was the busiest stock option. It traded 3,254 contracts in what dealers said was largely 'protection business'. This was followed by Fisons with 1,828 contracts. Asda, Hillsdown and Glaxo were also busy.</p>

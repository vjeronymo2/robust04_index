			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Croats and Serbs form new ties Croatia and Serb-led Yugoslavia yesterday agreed to establish low-level diplomatic relations, stepping up pressure on the Bosnian government to endorse a deal on the republic's partition. Under the modest accord, signed by the foreign ministers of Croatia and Yugoslavia, the two countries will set up representative offices in their respective capitals by February 15. While proclaiming the declaration 'a major step towards the normalisation of relations between Croatia and Serbia', Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, was disappointed by the refusal of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serbian counterpart, to extend full diplomatic recognition of Croatia within its borders. The agreement failed to address the most serious point of contention, the fact that Serbs have set up their own state which occupies one-third of Croatian territory. Diplomats said the restoration of communication and transport links would be top priority. However, similar agreements put forward since 1991 have collapsed. Mr Mohamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, expressed the Moslem-led government's fear of a Serbo-Croat carve-up at their expense. .'We hope this does not signal a further alliance of war against our country,' he said, adding that Croats should decide 'whether they are victims in this war or whether they are opportunistic aggressors'. Meanwhile, talks among the three warring parties on the division of Bosnia remained deadlocked as Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, stuck to demands for the return of territory in eastern and western Bosnia, seized by Serb forces over 22 months of war. In other sessions, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediators, discussed the creation of an international arbitration commission to settle territorial disputes, such as Zvornik and Visegrad, Serb-held towns in eastern Bosnia where Moslems used to comprise the majority. In a surprise move the Bosnian spokesman yesterday announced that Mr Izetbegovic would back the arbitration proposal. It would effectively sanction the military status quo until the commission determined which ethnic community should control a contested town. Serb leaders did not immediately comment on the proposal, which could win their endorsement even though they have opposed international involvement in the past. The French government was yesterday considering a successor to General Jean Cot, who is to relinquish his command of United Nations forces in ex-Yugoslavia at the request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, by March 31, writes David Buchan in Paris. As the largest provider of UN troops in the former Yugoslavia, it is for France to propose replacing General Cot with another French general - rumoured to be General Bertrand de Lapresle.</p>

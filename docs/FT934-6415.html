			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Tax 'threat' to recovery: Public-sector borrowing not an urgent problem, says institute Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was yesterday urged to leave fiscal and monetary policy broadly unchanged in next week's Budget. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research says substantial tax increases on top of those already enacted could upset the recovery. The institute concludes that the problem of the growing public sector borrowing requirement is 'not an urgent one' as, according to its calculations, the ratio of gross debt to gross domestic product will settle towards the end of the decade at a much lower level than that of the 1970s. It adds that tax increases now to allow for pre-election tax cuts later would not fool the electorate. 'The electorate would see through the ploy, and would not thank the government for several years of taxation higher than it need have been,' says the insti-tute's quarterly economic review. The review also recommends that the government steers clear of substantial monetary easing as another cut in interest rates now of one or two percentage points 'followed as it may well be by underlying inflation moving outside the announced target range', could undermine attempts to rebuild trust in the pronouncements of the Treasury or the Bank of England. The institute's growth forecasts have changed little since the previous quarter's review. The prediction for gross domestic product growth this year remains unchanged at 2 per cent, while the forecast for next year is slightly up at 2.8 per cent. It is considerably less bullish on manufacturing output, for 1993 at least, than three months ago. The forecast for growth in 1993 has been revised down to 2 per cent from the August forecast of 4.1 per cent. But for next year it forecasts growth of 3 per cent, rather than 2.4 per cent predicted in the last review. Forecasts for inflation have also been revised down in the wake of an encouraging slowdown in growth of the retail prices index. This year the institute expects underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - to reach 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with the same period a year earlier. Only next year will it breach the upper limit of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range, ending the year at around 4.2 per cent. The institute is also slightly more optimistic than the government about the state of public-sector finances. It leaves the deficit forecast for the current year unchanged at Pounds 46bn, compared with the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 50bn, but puts the deficit at Pounds 35bn for 1994-95 compared with the Treasury forecast of Pounds 44bn. The institute expects unemployment to continue falling gradually next year, albeit with rises in some months. The review urges Mr Clarke to restate medium-term financial strategy, which is not comprehensive enough. 'The financial framework must be seen as part of a complete economic strategy which is designed to achieve the wider goal of economic prosperity, defined to include growth of output and employment as well as stability of prices,' it says.

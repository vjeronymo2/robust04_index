Takeshita said: "The agency in charge of the construction has  not been informed of any change." He also denied the report,  saying his inquiry with the Maritime Staff Office has confirmed  "such is not the case."    Meanwhile, it is also true that the DFAA has not much time  left to execute the budget for the construction of the P3C  communications facility. Furthermore, since the government  formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget has been delayed this  year, and the work on formulating the portion of the budget  concerning the P3C project will begin in about a month, no doubt  the DFAA faces a major problem in regards to the construction  project which is making no headway.</p>

Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Penny Stock Reform Act''), Congress mandated that the NASD establish a toll-free telephone number (``800 number service'') for the purpose of receiving and responding to inquiries from the public regarding the background of NASD members and their associated persons. The NASD began operating its 800 number service on October 1, 1991. Upon the request of a caller, the NASD may disclose, in the form of a written report, the following information contained in the CRD: <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  past and present employment history of NASD members and their associated persons; all final disciplinary actions, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  taken by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs, that relate to securities or commodities transactions; and all criminal convictions reported on Form BD or Form U&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under NASD procedures, the 800 number service operator does not provide any information over the telephone. Instead, a written copy of the information requested is sent to the caller and to the NASD member and/or associated person who is the subject of the inquiry. The identity of the caller remains confidential. See 800 Number Service Plan Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD's 800 number service plan does not define the term ``disciplinary action.'' According to the NASD, however, the term includes, but is not limited to, information provided in response to question 7 on Form BD and question 22 on Form U&hyph;4. See Pending Event Disclosure Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, the Commission approved a rule change by the NASD to expand the scope of information that is reportable through its 800 number service. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  Thus, in addition to the information set forth above, the NASD may disclose to the public such events as pending formal disciplinary actions initiated by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs; criminal indictments or informations; civil judgments; and certain arbitration awards in securities and commodities disputes involving public customers. Currently, the NASD relies on members and associated persons to report these events to the CRD on Form BD or Form U&hyph;4, respectively. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Because this represents the only means by which the NASD can obtain data about pending disciplinary actions (other than its own), the quality of the CRD database, and thus of the 800 number service, depends on complete and timely reporting by members and associated persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Pending Event Disclosure Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 7. The Commission notes that, in 1992, Congress requested that the General Accounting Office (``GAO'') conduct a review of various aspects of the Penny Stock Reform Act, including the NASD's 800 number service. Among other things, the GAO recommended that information about final arbitration awards be reported. Accordingly, the NASD submitted, and the Commission approved, a rule change authorizing the NASD to disclose certain arbitration awards, as well as pending formal disciplinary actions, through its 800 number service. In this context, the Commission notes that it ah requested all SROs to coordinate with the NASD the transfer of information about awards rendered in each exchange's arbitration program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Management: Frontal attack mounted on macho military style / Case study - Rank Xerox (UK) The company has suffered from what the Opportunity 2000 team describes as a military management style, resulting in an overwhelmingly macho culture - 'white, male, young and boisterous'. The UK sales, marketing and support subsidiary of the international office equipment group employs nearly 5,000 people, 30 per cent of whom are women. Its aim is to increase the number of women managers to 25 per cent by 1995 from the current 15 per cent. Each year the board announces its highest business priorities - known within the company as the 'vital few' and equal opportunities have been accorded this status. An intensive programme of workshops has involved all employees, starting with the managers. Viki Ford, Opportunity 2000 manager at Rank Xerox, says that employee involvement has been fundamental to the long-term programme. Discussions identified stereotyped ideas of 'men's jobs' and 'women's jobs' as a barrier to promotion.</p>

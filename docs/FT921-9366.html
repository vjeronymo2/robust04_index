			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Army need for land queried THE ARMY controls training areas in the UK bigger than the county of Gwent, but the National Audit Office is puzzled about what it does with them. A report today by the watchdog body, which reports to parliament on the use of public funds, finds little evidence to support the Ministry of Defence's arguments for taking over more land to train soldiers. 'The department's view is that there is a significant shortfall of Army training land,' the report says, 'but the National Audit Office's examination of the limited information available suggests that existing capacity is under-utilised.' Five out of eight training areas and 10 out of 11 firing ranges analysed by the NAO were used for less than 80 per cent of the available time. The report says that decisions to purchase more land were based on 'inadequate information'. Between 1985 and 1990 the MoD bought 6,500 hectares, mostly adjoining existing training areas. The MoD concluded that because of increasing demand, the expansion had not significantly reduced its land shortage. The additional space cost Pounds 13.7m. But by selling 400 hectares of more valuable land in the same period the MoD made a net profit of Pounds 7.3m. The MoD's training areas and ranges cover 161,300 hectares, about the size of Hertfordshire. Almost 90 per cent is controlled by the Army. The NAO complains of 'deficiencies and uncertainties' in assessing training needs. The headquarters of UK Land Forces told the NAO 'they would undoubtedly be able to prove that units had been unable to meet their training requirements', but the watchdog found no evidence to support this.

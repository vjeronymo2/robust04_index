			<p>BFN     [Text]  <H5>  National Assembly elections: </H5>   The entry of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] into the  elections will make it difficult for the ANC to get the  two-thirds majority it needs to write the final constitution on  its own. But ANC leaders remain confident of getting more than  60 percent of the national vote.    The National Party [NP], which saw its share of the  potential  vote improving from a low of 13 percent to above 20 percent by  the beginning of March, now has to fend off challenges from both  the Freedom Front and Inkatha. Before the IFP entered the  elections, many Inkatha supporters who planned to vote said they  would back the NP.    Now President F.W. de Klerk is desperately trying to prevent  them reverting to the IFP -- which explains his blistering  attack on IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Durban this week.  He said Chief Buthelezi was fickle, intolerant, indecisive and  two-faced.    Chief Buthelezi's major problem will be getting the bulk of  his supporters to the polls. Few of them have had access to  voter education programmes and many do not have identify  documents.    But if he is successful the IFP stands a good chance of  getting more than five percent of the vote. This will qualify  if for seats in the cabinet although Chief Buthelezi says  Inkatha will not accept any posts.    Any success General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front  achieves  at the polls will be at the expense of the NP. But the front is  likely to struggle to reach General Viljoen's target of a  million votes.    The DP [Democratic Party] will also struggle to get  sufficient votes to qualify for cabinet posts.  <H5>  Provincial Elections: </H5> <H5>  Western Cape </H5>   Before the ban on public opinion polls, the National Party  had pulled ahead of the ANC but was short of the 50 percent of  votes needed to ensure Hernus Kriel is elected provincial  premier.    The Democratic Party will need to get 10 percent of all the  votes cast in province to qualify for a cabinet seat. The  SUNDAY TIMES poll conducted in March showed the DP had just  over 10 percent of potential voters.    If the NP falls short of 50 percent the DP could determine  the choice of the Western Cape premier.  <H5>  PWV [Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging] </H5>   The ANC looks set to win more than 50 percent of the votes  in  the province, ensuring tha Tokyo Sexwale will be elected premier.    But the NP maintains the ANC will fall short of 50 percent.  Its Transvaal leader Pik Botha spoke this week of forming  alliances with other parties to elect a non ANC member as  provincial premier.    A key question is whether the DP will qualify for cabinet  membership as the SUNDAY TIMES poll showed it had the backing of  just under 10 percent of potential voters.  <H5>  KwaZulu/Natal </H5>   The late entry of the IFP has thrown this contest wide open.    The ANC is still likely to get the most votes, but the IFP  could run a close second if it is able to rally its supporters  to the polls in the short time available.    The IFP could also benefit from the backing of those who  plan  to vote for the NP or DP nationally.    It is likely that no party will get more than 50 percent of  the vote in the province and there will have to be horse-trading  to decide on the premier.  <H5>  Northern Cape </H5>   Little is known about voting trends in the country's least  populated province.    But given the large number of coloured voters in the  province  and the predominant support for the NP in this community, the  Nats must be regarded as favourities to win control of the  province.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Shadow of the Bosnian Issue"] </F>   [Text] The new escalation in the Bosnian conflict, which  includes NATO's first air attacks against land targets in its  history, increases the uncertainty in the Balkans and multiplies  the likelihood of an uncontrolled escalation of the conflict  that has been developing since June 1991 in the former  Yugoslavia.    The dramatic escalation of the crisis with the bombing of  Serbian targets by U.S. aircraft comes at a time when Athens is  passing through a delicate and difficult phase in the handling  of big national issues: The Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia] issue is at its most crucial climax since  our country has been faced with the prospect of international  recognition of that southern former Yugoslav republic. At the  same time, we see the greatest tension since the March 1987  crisis prevailing in Greek-Turkish relations, while the attack  against the Albanian border post and, rather suspiciously, the  provocative statement by Sali Berisha highlight the fragile  character of the relevant tranquility that has prevailed for the  past few months in Greek-Albanian relations.    It is clear that whatever turn they take--an escalation of  clashes or a return to the negotiating table--the developments  in Bosnia will intensify the already oppressive pressure on  Athens that began after the imposition of the trade blockade  against Skopje. The need for that country's stability will  become an urgent priority so that the United States and our  European partners will not be faced with a new area of conflict  in the south of the former Yugoslavia.    That is, the new turn in the Bosnian conflict and the  further  U.S. involvement in the Balkans pose a scenario in which our  national issues might be regarded as annoying pending issues  that must be cleared up as soon as possible.    Of course it is obvious to us that, in the shadow of the  threat of a more general Balkan crisis, simultaneous pressure  for a solution to the Skopje issue and for a compromise formula  that at least "freezes" the tension in Greek-Turkish relations  would result in a most unfavorable situation for our country.    It is obvious that now, almost three years after the  outbreak  of the Yugoslav conflict when there is a danger of uncontrolled  escalation there, our country is unable to make its weight felt  because its involvement in the Skopjean issue has made it to a  great extent part of the crisis.</p>

Jayakumar yesterday said that both Singapore and Malaysia should  find ways of expanding contacts at all levels.    Speaking to THE SUNDAY TIMES before flying home after a  two-day visit, he said that such a move was necessary because of  the changed circumstances.    In the past, he said that many Malaysians and Singaporeans  studied together at Raffles College and the University of Malaya  in Singapore.    As this was no longer happening, he said that it was  important for the two countries to make concerted attempts to  build new links.    Prof. Jayakumar said that his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk  Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whom he met on Friday also agreed on the  need to step up contacts.    Both felt that bilateral ties were very good and that  outstanding issues between the two countries could be resolved.    As an example, he said that they noted that discussions  between both countries were being conducted on two issues on the  same day as their meeting.    They were the disputes over the ownership of Pedra Branca,  on  which stands the Horsburgh Lighthouse and which Singapore has  administered for the past 150 years, and the delineation of the  Straits of Johor.    "We were both optimistic that such issues could be  resolved,"  he said.    Datuk Abdullah, who was present to bid farewell to Prof.  Jayakumar, interjected that the current approach was the best.  "Leave it to the present mechanism," he added.    Prof. Jayakumar took the opportunity of stressing to his  Malaysian counterpart the value he attached to the  Singapore-Malaysia relationship.    "With good relations, it will be easier to view in  perspective the occasional hiccup that may erupt from time to  time," he added.    Prof. Jayakumar, who is also law minister, was on his first  overseas trip since he took over the portfolio in a cabinet  reshuffle earlier this month.    He said that his visit was in line with the tradition for a  newly appointed minister to call on his ASEAN counterpart and to  establish personal rapport.    Prof. Jayakumar, who first met his Malaysian counterpart  about 10 years ago, said that he attached great importance to  personal ties as they formed a vital ingredient in establishing  a good working relationship.    Datuk Abdullah has accepted an invitation from his Singapore  counterpart to visit the republic later this year.    Other Malaysian leaders whom Prof. Jayakumar met were Law  Minister Datuk Syed Hamid Albar and Deputy Home Affairs Minister  Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Executive Bureau [BEN] of the National  Union of Mali Workers [UNTM] held an extraordinary meeting  yesterday. It called for a 50-percent general salary increase.  The BEN also denounced the negative effects of successive  structural adjustment programs. This reaction follows the  50-percent devaluation of the CFA franc. At the end of the  meeting, the BEN issued a statement read here by Mamadou  Doumbouya.    [Begin Doumbouya recording] The UNTM National Executive  Bureau held an extraordinary session on 24 January. Drawing  lessons from decades of development, it observed that Mali has  been engaged in structural adjustment programs for more than 12  years. Mali is one of the rare countries to have fully  implemented all the social and economic measures jointly adopted  by the IMF, World Bank, and the government to ensure the  country's economic and financial balance. The structural  adjustment programs created great chaos by sanctioning the  liquidation of state companies and enterprises, causing the  reduction of the salaried workforce through a wave of  unprecedented retrenchments, and fostering voluntary retirement.    The Malian franc, which is the expression of national  sovereignty and an independent national development work tool,  disappeared in favor of the CFA at the pegged rate of Fr1 to one  Malian franc. The country's return to the West African Monetary  Union [UMOA] in 1984, the recent devaluation of the CFA franc,  and the adoption of a blind liberal economic system have  currently led to a dramatic erosion of workers' purchasing power  by 117.50 percent. This has also led to unbridled price  increases despite appeals by government and the Chambers of  Commerce and Industry of Mali.    The various kinds of privatizations accepted by workers and  the Malian people have only resulted in the deterioration of  their living conditions, which they hoped to improve in the new  multiparty and democratic context. Now more than ever, Mali,  like former French colonies, is no longer free to determine its  own economic and political options in the spirit of safeguarding  African dignity.    Consequently, the BEN strongly calls for the return to the  use of a local Malian currency within a time period compatible  with the Malian people's thirst for dignity. In default of  this, Mali must pledge to strive for the creation of a common  independent African currency. The BEN calls for the total and  immediate payment of promotion arrears that have accumulated  from 1987 to 1993; a 50-percent general salary increase; a  50-percent reduction in IGER [expansion unknown] and its total  abolition for salaried female workers; and a 50-percent rise in  the guaranteed minimum wage, as well as a corresponding  readjustment of retirement and widows benefits. The BEN warns  the government against any eventual failure to ensure state  authority in the enforcement of the freeze on essential  commodities and the effective and permanent control.    In the face of the capitulation of the UMOA heads of state  summit on 10 and 11 January in Dakar, the UNTM, which is  traditionally attentive to state problems, cannot endorse  measures that assault the dignity of Africans and the real  independence of our country and forever compromise Africa's  development. It makes a vibrant appeal to all Malian workers  and the entire people to get mobilized wholeheartedly for the  defense of national interests. It calls on African trade union  federations to get more involved to work for the emergence of an  economically integrated, politically free, and socially  prosperous Africa. [end recording]</p>

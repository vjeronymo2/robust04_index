As we have meanwhile seen, not only that was a  mirage.    In Somalia, the United Nations has proven to be incompetent  and has failed. The clan warfare does not give a damn about the  blue helmets. In front of our door, in the former Yugoslavia,  the Serbs show the United Nations to be a paper tiger and the  European Union has even been ignored. The NATO ultimatum is the  acid test there. The states in Central and East Europe are  watching further developments with the utmost attention.    Thus, it was high time that the Bundeswehr began its  withdrawal from Belet Uen, which, for a long time, has stood in  a very exposed position there. Each day in Somalia only  endangers the soldiers' lives without bringing the country any  closer to peace.    Whoever thinks that there will now also be an end to the  domestic debate on future peacemaking Bundeswehr operations has  not understood anything at all. The Germans cannot simply take  leave of the duties and rights they assumed prior to  reunification. The German declaration of joining the United  Nations did not speak of any reservations.</p>

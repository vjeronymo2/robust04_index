			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> NASA -- An Opinion article on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  by Gregg Easterbrook, published July 22, contained a factual error.  </P> <P> It stated there were no accidents in the X-15 program. In fact, there was one  fatality, in 1967.  </P> <P> Another paragraph, discussing James Thompson, now NASA deputy administrator,  was factually correct but may have left an inaccurate impression. Thompson did  not head the Marshall Space Center during the development of the solid-rocket  boosters. He did head the center for a time when it was responsible for testing  of the Hubble telescope.  </P></p>

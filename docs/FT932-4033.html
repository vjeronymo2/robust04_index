			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour pledge on press ownership A FUTURE Labour govern-ment would order an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers commission into the ownership of the press, Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, told the Commons last night. She said: 'When Mr Rupert Murdoch can own 35 per cent of weekday newspaper circulation that, in the eyes of most people, is a quite unacceptable concentration of power.' Ms Clwyd also complained that Mr Murdoch's acolytes were now arguing that he should be allowed to take over large tracts of British television. She said a Labour government would look at ways of bringing more diversity to local, regional and national newspapers. During a debate on the Commons heritage committee report on media intrusion, Ms Clwyd joined MPs from both sides of the House in opposing statutory regulation of the press. Mr Gerald Kaufman (Lab Manchester Gorton), chairman of the committee, and Mr Paul Channon, the former Conservative cabinet minister, were among leading members of the committee who urged the government to appoint an ombudsman to deal with complaints not satisfactorily resolved by a voluntary press commission. Mr Kaufman envisaged the ombudsman having a 'back-up' role which provided a stimulus for voluntary regulation. He welcomed moves already made by the existing Press Complaints Commission to give effect to some of the recommendations made by the heritage committee.</p>

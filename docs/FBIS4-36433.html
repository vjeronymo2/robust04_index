			<p>BFN     [Text] Among the topics discussed during yesterday's  meeting between the foreign ministers of Greece and of the  Islamic Republic of Iran in Tehran included the further  expansion of the Islamic Republic's relations with the European  Union [EU] and Greece, the Balkan crisis, and the expanding  relations between Tehran and the Central Asian republics and the  Caucasus.    During the meeting Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister  and the current head of the EU, underlined the need to further  expand relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the  EU--something that can play an effective role in solving current  problems in various parts of the world. The Greek foreign  minister stressed that the EU's stance on the issue of the three  Persian Gulf islands is that bilateral talks between Iran and  the United Arab Emirates [UAE] should be strengthened.    At this meeting Velayati also welcomed the expansion of  Tehran's relations with the EU and with Greece and said: The  Islamic Republic of Iran, a country which enjoys stability in  the region, plays a fundamental role in political equations.  The foreign minister added: The Islamic Republic of Iran has  always supported a peaceful solution of the misunderstandings  with the UAE on the basis of its 1971 agreement with that  country. He once again emphasized that regional security could  not be possible without the cooperation of the Persian Gulf  littoral countries.</p>

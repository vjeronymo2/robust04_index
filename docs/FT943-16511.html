			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: China exceeds Yn100bn target for debt finance China has exceeded its target of Yn100bn (Dollars 11.5bn) for the sale of Treasury bonds to finance its budget deficit for 1994-95, the People's Bank announced. The bulk of the bonds sold carried two and three-year maturities, but other categories accounted for about 10 per cent of the offering - China's largest since the Revolution. Mr Zhang Jialun, a senior Ministry of Finance official responsible for the bond issue, described as a 'very good trend' the strong demand for bonds this year: by June 30 Yn102.5bn had been issued. The two-year bonds carried a coupon rate of 13 per cent while the three-year paper yielded 13.96 per cent. China's budget deficit is forecast to reach Yn67bn in 1994-95, while total liabilities, including domestic and foreign debt service, are expected to amount to Yn129.6bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- A note sent today by  the Slovak Foreign Ministry to the Hungarian Embassy in  Bratislava expresses Slovakia's readiness to resume as early as  possible the talks on the establishment of a temporary water  regime on the Danube.    The Slovak Ministry thus responded to a note from the  Hungarian Foreign Ministry of March 28, in which Budapest urged  the Slovak government to resume the negotiations immediately.  The Hungarian note reacted to Slovakia's rejection of a  compromise proposal by European Union experts for the method of  division of the Danube's water between the original bed of the  border river and a derivation canal built by Bratislava on  Slovak territory. Budapest itself accepted the compromise  proposal, though with reservations.    In opposition to this, the Slovak note recalls that the EU  experts had also recommended to build weirs in the Danube's  original bed to prevent drying up of some river's branches, but  the Hungarian parliament recently rejected the weirs'  construction. Nevertheless, in its document Bratislava says it  favors further search for a rational and effective solution to  the problem.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: CAN LANDLORD KEEP SECURITY DEPOSIT?  </P> <P> Question: Some time last year, I entered into a month-to-month rent contract  for a two-bedroom apartment at $600 per month with one month rent in advance  and a deposit of $1,000. I moved in, paid a month's rent of $600 plus a deposit  of $500, the balance of $500 to be paid the next month.  </P> <P> However, once I was in the apartment I noticed several defects -- broken  louvers in all windows, leaking water in the bathroom, defective heater, broken  garbage disposal in the kitchen sink, defective gas stove that wouldn't light  without a match -- so I decided to move out the next month after staying for  only 28 days.  </P> <P> I demanded a refund of my deposit, but the landlord came back with a reply  containing phony charges of damage that she alleged I did to her apartment in  the 28 days I was there. Obviously, she wanted to justify her withholding my  deposit money.  </P> <P> Has the landlord the right to hold the security deposit of $500? If not, how  could I get my money back? -- A.F.A.  </P> <P> Answer: This is one of the most common legal problems between landlords and  tenants -- the security deposit.  </P> <P> Your landlord does have the right to keep that portion of the security deposit  reasonably needed to repair any damage to the premises that you caused. So even  if the bathroom faucet was leaking when you moved in, if the kitchen sink is  now leaking, the deposit may be used to repair the sink. However, the money is  not supposed to be deducted for ordinary wear and tear -- although it sometimes  requires a small claims court judge to decide what is ordinary and what is not.  The deposit can also be used to pay for necessary cleaning.  </P> <P> You are not required to pay for damage caused by a previous tenant. So all the  defects you noticed when you moved in should not be the basis for any repair  deductions. The trick, of course, in a dispute such as this -- when it will  probably be your word against the landlord's -- is to have handy some helpful  evidence, like a picture of the premises including all the broken louvres.  (Although I don't know how you'd get a picture of a leaky faucet or a broken  garbage disposal.)  </P> <P> It's not a bad idea, generally, whenever you move into a rental property to  take some photographs so you'll have a record of the condition in which you  found the place. And try to have the photos developed by a shop that date  stamps them on the back, to help prove when they were taken.  </P> <P> If you want to try to get your money back, first try to be reasonable. Send the  landlord a carefully written letter explaining your position, demanding the  return of your deposit, and threatening to take your case to small claims court  if she isn't reasonable. And be willing to compromise. If you can get back  $300, I would take it. (Small claims court judges often compromise too, so  going to court may not get you much more and will take a lot of time and  energy.)  </P> <P> If you want to be technical (and sound like you know what you're talking about)  refer to Civil Code Section 1950.5 as the basis for your complaint. Of course,  first you should read it -- try your local law library. The section defines the  applicable law, but good luck trying to understand it. In the words of one  judge, it "teeters on the brink of unintelligibility."  </P> <P> But the landlord may have another claim on your money. The security deposit can  also be used to cover unpaid rent. You were renting on a month-to-month  tenancy, and it sounds as if you didn't give 30 days notice, so the landlord  may claim that the deposit was used to cover the rent that was due for the last  30 days. The landlord has a duty to mitigate the loss -- and try to find  another tenant quickly, but you may have an uphill battle proving that another  tenant could have been found and moved in within a few weeks.  </P> <P> In any event, if you decide to go to small claims court, let me know how you  do.  </P></p>

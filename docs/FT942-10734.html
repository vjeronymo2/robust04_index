			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Investors fail to focus on recovery signs - London If the stock market cannot respond to almost daily evidence of economic recovery, then it clearly has its eyes on other matters. Last week's higher dividend payouts from British Petroleum and Bank of Scotland, excellent first-quarter profits at BAT Industries and a handful of mega transatlantic deals should all have pointed the way to a healthier market; yet, the overall performance of market indices was still disappointing. One reason is that the market's nervousness is self-feeding. Market-makers, fearful of being caught out by a highly volatile equity sector, cut share price quotations hard whenever they think they see trouble ahead. The institutions are equally sensitive and, after taking aboard a steady flow of placings and rights issues in the first quarter of the year, have now become relatively unreceptive to new issues. More worrying were the indications last week that some large overseas investors were lightening their holdings in UK stocks. The market is clearly gun-shy, or perhaps dollar-shy would be more explicit. In mid-week and again on Friday afternoon, share prices went into reverse very quickly when threats to the dollar revived fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to defend the dollar. Some analysts argue that the weak pound, which usually follows a weak dollar in present conditions, has in the past been quite good for share prices. If the dollar gets into trouble again this week, then UK bonds will fall and the Footsie 3,100 mark will be at hazard again. With the outlook for the market so uncertain, there are signs that institutional investors are looking carefully at existing portfolios and endeavouring to identify sectors which retain some attractions. In many cases, these attractions are there only because the shares were left out of the huge jump in equity prices earlier this year - for which the market is now paying dear. This has put the pharmaceutical sector back into the limelight after nearly two years in which fund managers probably wished the shares had ceased to exist. The sector still trades at a substantial discount but not much worse than it did 12 months ago when it was hit by worries over the Clinton tightening of US healthcare costs. Now, with SmithKline Beecham paying Dollars 2.3bn for a US drug firm and European buyers focusing on the impending sale of Eastman Kodak's Dollars 5bn plus pharmaceutical division, the sector looks interesting again. SmithKline is buying a Pharmaceutical Benefit Manager, a new animal for UK investors. BZW concedes that the move will mean modest earnings dilution this year but expects 'superior growth' from the combined group thereafter. For the sector as a whole, there is the hope that the SmithKline deal will provide the recovery trigger for which the market has been waiting. The question must be whether these latest developments will bring a general revaluation of the sector which has remained decidedly out of favour with UK analysts.</p>

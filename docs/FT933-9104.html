			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Clinton gun-control plan: Anti-crime proposals would limit appeals against execution PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a broad set of proposals to combat crime, with measures to control gun sales, hire more policemen and limit appeals against the death penalty. Mr Clinton promised to introduce a crime bill into Congress next month offering Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) to put up to 50,000 more police officers on the beat, and called the proposals a 'major down payment' on his campaign promise to use the power of the White House to prevent and punish crime. The package would also bring tighter controls on gun sales, including a new drive to pass the Brady bill, which would require a five-day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun. 'We must end the insanity of being able to buy or sell a handgun more easily than obtaining a driver's licence,' Mr Clinton said. The Brady bill, named after a former White House press secretary who was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, is now widely supported by police chiefs, although few of them believe it would do much to stem the availability of illegal weapons to criminals. Mr Clinton ordered immediate executive action to ban the import of assault-style handguns, and to tighten controls on the issue of licences for gun dealers. Current rules allow 280,000 people to sell guns under scant government supervision, most of them working from home, in exchange for a fee of Dollars 10 a year. The proposed crime package also contains measures to extend the death penalty, mostly applied at the state level, to a number of federal crimes, and to limit prisoners sentenced to death by a state court to a single habeas corpus appeal to the federal courts. Although capital punishment was reauthorised by the Supreme Court in 1976, and is widely supported in US public opinion, 15 times as many prisoners are sentenced to death each year as are in fact executed. The Supreme Court has become less and less receptive to appeals from death row prisoners, but some state law enforcement officials still complain that the appeals process can drag on for years. Many of the measures proposed by Mr Clinton yesterday were contained in crime legislation passed in 1991 and 1992 by both chambers of Congress, but eventually blocked by Senate Republicans who wanted much tougher curbs on habeas corpus rights.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] With billions of rands leaving South Africa, the  Reserve Bank has warned that people taking money illegally out  of the country "will be dealt with with the full force of the  law".    In the past 18 months, more than R16-billion [rand] has  flowed out of the country as international and local businesses  react to political uncertainty and unrest.    Since 1985, the figure is estimated at close on R50-billion  -- money this country can ill afford to lose with massive  unemployment and the expected demands on socio-economic  programmes during the next five to 10 years.    A senior Reserve Bank spokesman said it was difficult to  establish exactly what percentage of the money that left the  country was taken out illegally.    "But we are aware of the different ways that companies and  individuals use to take their money offshore. And the fact  that several people have landed in prison because of illegal  transactions and foreign exchange fraud confirms that we are  ready to act and to act with the full force of the law," said  the spokesman. [passage omitted]    But the spokesman for the Reserve Bank warned that the bank  and the commercial branch of the South African police had  excellent relationships with the relevant departments in these  countries and that details of these illegal accounts and  transactions would be laid bare to the bone.    "We view these crimes in a very serious light and will leave  no stone unturned to expose and bring to book people who have  committed these crimes.    "Our courts have already shown that they have little  sympathy  for these so called white collar criminals." [passage omitted]</p>

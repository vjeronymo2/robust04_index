			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE INVESTOR PLEADS GUILTY TO INSIDER TRADING;  </P> <P> SCANDAL: STEPHEN R. RASINSKI ADMITS THAT HE IMPROPERLY EARNED AT LEAST $115,000  FROM INFORMATION IN ADVANCE COPIES OF BUSINESS WEEK.  </P> <P> An Orange investor pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court in New York to  charges of insider trading, admitting that he used information culled from  advance copies of Business Week magazine.  </P> <P> Stephen R. Rasinski, 35, was accused of having improperly earned at least  $115,000 between September, 1986, and July, 1988, by buying stock in companies  mentioned in the "Inside Wall Street" column before the magazine was available  to the public. A mention in the column generally raised a company's stock  price.  </P> <P> Rasinski's guilty plea is the latest development in the growing insider-trading  scandal involving Business Week. Thirteen individuals in several unrelated  cases involving the magazine have been charged with criminal or civil  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Rasinski could not be reached for comment Monday. He faces a minimum sentence  of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.  </P> <P> In entering his plea Monday, Rasinski told the court that he had received the  inside information from his stockbroker, John L. Petit of Newport Beach. Petit  has admitted that he paid hundreds of dollars a week for the information, which  Petit received from Shayne Walters, a former salesman for one of Business  Week's printers, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. of Torrance.  </P> <P> Both Petit and Walters have pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in the  case and face sentences of 10 years in prison and fines of up to $500,000.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Alice Hill, who is heading the investigation, said the  criminal inquiry is continuing. Petit is cooperating with authorities.  </P> <P> Rasinski was first named in the scandal last month when the Securities and  Exchange Commission accused him of insider trading in a civil complaint filed  in U.S. District Court in New York. The civil case is still pending; the SEC is  seeking damages equal to three times Rasinski's profits.  </P> <P> "We believed he willfully violated the securities law," Hill said.  </P> <P> The SEC has also named Pacific Palisades stockbroker Lawrence M. Small, a  former broker with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., in connection with the  Business Week case. The SEC alleges that Petit, also a former Smith Barney  broker, paid Walters for advance copies of the magazines and that Petit then  provided the information to Rasinski and Small, who in turn contributed to  payments to Walters.  </P></p>

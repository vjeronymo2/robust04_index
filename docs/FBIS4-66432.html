			<p>Desulfurizer   in Korea   <F P=102> 94FE0402I Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 Jan 94  p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0402I </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] On 25 January Chiyoda Chemical Engineering &amp;  Construction Co. signed a contract with Daewoo Co. of Korea  (Seoul; Young Sou Chang, president) to expand joint sales of  exhaust gas desulfurizers. In the future, Chiyoda CE &amp; C will  also supply Daewoo with exhaust gas desulfurizing technology.  Korea has begun regulating emissions of sulfur dioxides as a  measure against acid rain and other such air pollutants. The two  companies are looking to jointly sell desulfurizers because an  increase in demand for that equipment is expected. This is the  first joint-sales system ever built by a Japanese firm and a  Korean firm.    In addition to Hitachi Ltd. supplying Korea's San Sung Co.  with exhaust gas desulfurizing technology, Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries Ltd. has a friendly relationship with Hyundai Heavy  Industries Ltd. of Korea. Chiyoda CE &amp; C judged that it  would be  difficult to sell the desulfurizer on its own in Korea and  decided to aim for sales through a joint venture.    Chiyoda CE &amp; C's exhaust gas desulfurization technology  removes sulfur oxides by feeding the exhaust gas into a liquid  in which lime is dissolved.    The removal rate is 90%. A total of 30 such  desulfurizers in  Japan, the U.S., and Germany have shown good results.    Although there is no desulfurization technology in Korea,  the  decision has been made to increase the limits on sulfur oxide  emissions from the current level of 700 PPM to 500 PPM in 1995  and to 270 PPM in 1999. Only three or four orders for  desulfurizers are expected this year and will be mainly from  coal-burning power plants that emit a lot of sulfur oxides.  Expecting that sort of demand, the two companies will combine  Chiyoda CE &amp; C's technology with Daewoo's business strength  to  sell desulfurizers to electric power companies.    In addition to Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries'  transfer  of liquefied natural gas (LNG) above-ground storage tank  technology to San Sung Heavy Industries Ltd., other  Japanese-Korean tie-ups include Mitsui Engineering &amp;  Shipbuilding's effort with Hyundai Construction that is aimed at  joint sales of a Thai fertilizer plant.</p>

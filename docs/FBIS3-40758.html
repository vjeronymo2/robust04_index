Because of the circumstances of the sanctions, Iraq has a 40  percent shortfall in its need for certified seeds, that is,  seeds suitable for planting.    The use of non-certified seeds prepared by specialists is a  process with uncertain results. Last year the validity of this  view was proved, when the Agriculture Ministry made use of seeds  from the Commerce Ministry and distributed them to peasants.    The director-general of the General Iraqi Company for Seed  Production explained that there were ongoing operations to sort  through, examine, and certify the seeds. Wheat seeds were found  to be a minimum of 96 percent pure, and a maximum of 99 percent  pure. The certification process was supervised to the end, as  was the process of distributing them to the peasants.    On another front, preparations are now underway for the  receiving of rice seeds from the company's laboratories in  Ghammas and Nahr Sa'd. The General Iraqi Company for Seed  Production has defined standards for this purpose, and the  peasants were informed of them, as well as of the fixed prices.    The same company is currently preparing vegetable seeds, for  tomatoes and cucumbers for distribution to peasants so they can  sow them in the winter season with protected and covered crops.  They are to monitor local tomato seeds in special fields for the  production of seeds with facilities provided by the company. The  company has also contracted with a group of field owners in the  Euphrates region for the production of onion seeds, and they  will monitor and supervise the fields.    For their part, the peasants question the rise of seed  prices  in general, particularly for vegetable seeds. They have asked  many times for permission to keep some of the wheat, barley, and  other seeds to be sowing-seeds the following season, especially  as the law of the land forbids that!    The Ministry of Agriculture, for its part, came up with many  plans and programs to make the winter growing season successful,  to correct mistakes made last year, to seek privatization for  agriculture in the future, and to encourage peasants to produce  the harvest itself.    There is another view, according to which the government's  increased purchase prices for some cash crops is a factor in  encouraging peasants to produce those cash crops that ordinarily  are not suitable for cultivation in their lands.</p>

According to Smirnov, who led the Russian delegation,  participants in the session focussed mainly on economic  situation in the countries undergoing economic reforms.    The Russian delegates drew attention to regional integrating  processes with a view to preventing discrimination against the  Russian Federation. They also raised the question of developing  production cooperation within the framework of the "Partnership  for Peace" initiative.    We should immediately begin working on the economic aspects  of the initiative, first of all, in the interests of our  industry and state military-industrial complex, Smirnov said.    The third session of the CSCE economic forum will be held in  June 1995.</p>

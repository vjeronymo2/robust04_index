This interest seems to be prompted by fears over the possible  collapse of the peace process, which was viewed by the world as  a unique opportunity for the achievement of just and  comprehensive peace that would spare the region the calamities  of war and provide it with security and stability, one that  would not come again.    The paper adds: The world community is unanimous that a  durable peace must begin with an Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories, because this would consecrate  international legitimacy. This is a must if the requirements of  peace are to be met. It goes without saying that meeting these  requirements would help the peace process achieve its  objectives, which are enshrined in the relevant UN resolutions.    The paper notes the working paper Syria submitted to the  Israeli negotiators during the sixth round of the Washington  bilateral talks, which was appreciated by the world community  and deemed a positive step forward. The world community  believes that if heeded, this paper would help achieve true  peace in the region. However, Israel, which was pressured into  attending the Madrid conference in the first place, has declined  to discuss the article pertaining to withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories, and raised issues that should have  been raised only after rather than before the withdrawal is  completed.    The paper goes on to say: Israel's position on this issue  has to date remained unchanged. For, the Rabin government has  continued to make impossible and unacceptable demands. The  developments in the peace process over the past two years have  revealed to the world which party is working to achieve just and  comprehensive peace, and which is working to thwart this noble  objective.    In this regard, the paper notes the reaffirmation made by  Douglas Hogg, British minister of state at the Foreign and  Commonwealth Office, regarding the need to achieve a just and  comprehensive regional settlement, affirming that there can be  no peace in the region unless Syria restores its sovereignty  over the Golan.    AL-BA'TH says: If this is indicative of anything, it is of  the entire world community's convictions that if peace is to be  achieved in the region, Israel must implement the relevant UN  resolutions, which provide for complete and full withdrawal from  the occupied Arab territories.    Concluding its editorial, the paper says: The world  community, which is taking a special interest in achieving a  just regional settlement, is required, now more than ever  before, to take a firmer and more serious position to achieve  just and comprehensive peace in the region.    In one of its commentaries, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH  addresses the same issue, saying: Undoubtedly, the world  community is fully convinced that Israel has continued to  obstruct the efforts aimed at achieving just and comprehensive  peace, the peace that is grounded in the relevant international  legitimacy resolutions, and that would achieve security,  stability, and prosperity in the region.    AL-THAWRAH notes the difficulties and obstacles the Israeli  Government has created to obstruct the peace process and prevent  it from achieving any accomplishment that could promote the  cause of peace and stability in the Middle East through the  pursuit of a policy based on evasion and procrastination to  evade any clear commitment to the requirements of peace, as  enshrined in international legitimacy resolutions. Israel has  repeatedly and deliberately stepped up violence, repression, and  terrorism in both the occupied Arab territories and Lebanon to  provoke the Arabs and make them abandon the peace process.    The paper adds: Nonetheless, recent developments have  undoubtedly shown that Israel has failed to achieve its  objectives in this regard. Had it not been for the patience,  wisdom, and prudence demonstrated by the Arabs when confronted  with Israel's maneuvers and games, the peace process would have  collapsed. The positive stands the Arabs have taken toward the  peace process and their honest favorable response to the efforts  made to activate the bilateral talks have enlightened the world  community in general and the United States in particular with  regard to peace process issues. These stands have prompted the  world community and the United States to conclude that it is the  Arabs who are honest in their peace efforts, that they are  working to achieve durable and true peace, and that they are the  party that respects international legitimacy and clings to its  resolutions and laws. What the Arabs are demanding is only that  the principles of right and justice be upheld.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: In contrast to this positive Arab  stand, Israel has been exposed to the world community as an  aggressive occupation power that does not care about peace. Its  peace stand is tailored to promote its ambitions and objectives.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: The bilateral  talks will be resumed in Washington at the chief delegates'  level within days. The achievement of progress in these talks  requires a drastic change in the Israeli negotiating positions.  It also requires a reconsideration on Israel's part of many of  its flawed perceptions and views regarding the nature of the  solution required for the region.    Under the headline "Israeli Threats," the newspaper TISHRIN  says: Israel has revived the policy of threats and intimidation  against the Arabs of the occupied Arab territories, deriving  strength from the Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and Peres.  This agreement has granted Israel complete control over  security affairs. These threats are coming even before the ink  used to sign this agreement has dried. Israel has stepped up  its terrorist and repressive policy against the Arabs of the  West Bank and Gaza Strip, and warned that collective punitive  measures will be escalated if the resistance and  intifadah-related activities are continued, and if the  condemnations and denunciations of the Cairo agreement continue  to be made.    The paper adds: What Israel is saying is that aggressive and  terrorist military force could be used to ensure the  implementation of the Cairo agreement. Israel, before others,  is aware that this agreement has nothing to do with peace, and  that it cannot be called a move toward achieving just and  comprehensive peace.    The paper maintains that the Cairo agreement has ensured  Israel a powerful partner in accomplishing the so-called  security missions, and in protecting settlements. The agreement  has granted Israel the authority to pursue suspects.    Concluding its commentary, the paper says: Partial measures  and separate deals could only aggravate the situation. They  will create a state of open war in the occupied territories.  The developments that we have seen in the aftermath of the Oslo  accord and the Cairo deal are testimony to all that we are  saying.</p>

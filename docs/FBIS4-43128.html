			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Labor Minister Clemente Mastella by Roberto </F> Petrini; place and date not given: "Mastella Will Follow a Soft  Line: `No Decrees on Employment' -- first two paragraphs are LA  REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- The employment package is in the hands of  [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi, who will be meeting the  trade unions next week. In the meantime, Labor Minister  Clemente Mastella is sending out peace signals, and has  announced the government's preparedness to adopt the provisions  on employment through a draft bill, thus renouncing the  controversial decree option. "I told the prime minister that we  had to speak with the unions: Negotiations must work," the  minister explained.    In the meantime, reactions from the trade unions are  cautiously positive. According to Bruno Trentin, CGIL [Italian  General Confederation of Labor] leader, "it is essential" that  the fiscal "bonus" for employers taking on new staff be limited  to indefinite duration contracts, since otherwise "many forms of  precarious employment would benefit from tax deductions." For  his part, CGIL "number two" Sergio Cofferanti expressed the  suspicion that the provision's postponement was a way of  avoiding the issue until after the elections. On the other  hand, Sergio D'Antoni, CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade  Unions] secretary, believed that Berlusconi had "acted wisely."    [Petrini] Minister Mastella, despite the mediation attempts,  your proposed legislation is at a standstill. Why is this so?    [Mastella] If we want to safeguard the employment situation,  we must bear in mind three factors: We must place our stakes on  recovery, guarantee social peace, and implement flexible  instruments. Therefore no sudden breaks.    [Petrini] Therefore the way forward is through negotiations?    [Mastella] Certainly.    [Petrini] Was everyone agreed on this line at last  Wednesday's [8 June] Council of Ministers meeting? Were there  no "hawks"?    [Mastella] I attended the Council of Ministers meeting after  meeting with the trade unions, and I explained that we could not  move toward a head-on confrontation if we wanted to preserve  social peace. They listened to me.    [Petrini] How did things go with Berlusconi?    [Mastella] I explained to Berlusconi that the trade unions  were also requesting to speak with him in order to get a full  picture of the situation, and that we should not be perceived to  be mistreating them.    [Petrini] However, now everything has been postponed until  next week, when the prime minister will meet the unions. As far  as the proposed legislation is concerned, has a rapprochement  taken place?    [Mastella] For my part, I have not taken up any rigid  positions.    [Petrini] How do you mean, minister? The trade unions do not  want this area to be tackled by means of decree laws. Do you  agree?    [Mastella] If we draw up a draft bill instead, it will not  be  the end of the world.    [Petrini] Another hurdle is constituted by entry wage  levels.  The unions will not listen to any talk about reducing wages by  law, but seem to be better disposed to a solution based on free  bargaining between the two sides. What is your position?    [Mastella] I am also prepared to discuss this point. Among  other things, we must determine whether the question is to be  solved at national or, alternatively, at company level. In any  case, we must realize that something must be done.    [Petrini] Furthermore, there is the issue of the overlapping  incentives for new employment, including limited time contracts,  entry wage levels, part-time arrangements, and so on. The unions  seem to have adopted a fairly rigid stance in this respect.  What is your opinion?    [Mastella] In this respect, we view things differently from  the unions. In my opinion, the measures are complementary,  rather than alternative. My philosophy is not a Dash-type  philosophy, according to which "two temporary jobs are better  than a single permanent job." However, it is undeniable that a  temporary job is better than nothing at all. Let me remind you  that families take this view too.    [Petrini] Yet, a temporary job does not seem to be anyone's  maximum aspiration....    [Mastella] We must bear in mind that these measures are to  be  taken at a specific stage in the development of the economy. We  are not aiming to keep them in force for ever. Two or three  years from now, we can review the situation.</p>

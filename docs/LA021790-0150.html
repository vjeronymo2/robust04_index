			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUADRUPLETS TO START COMING HOME IN SHIFTS  </P> <P> Al and Karen Miner thought they would have a couple of weeks to prepare a  nursery after the birth of their quadruplets. As it turns out, they only have a  matter of days.  </P> <P> One by one, their babies will be going home from the hospital sooner than  expected. The first will be home on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Knowing their hands will be full, literally, the Miners have been spending the  last few days organizing their four-bedroom home in Orange for a house full of  babies.  </P> <P> "We're having the family come over to help us prepare," Al Miner said. "Knowing  that time will be very precious for us, we're spending the next few days  getting ourselves organized. We do have diapers. We're not totally organized  with food yet, but we will be. We have to take inventory of what we do have and  what we still need."  </P> <P> The Miner quadruplets were born one week ago today, eight weeks early. To  monitor the development of multiple premature babies, the hospital staff  usually keeps the babies for a few weeks or even months, according to Dr.  Manuel Porto, director of maternal-fetal medicine at UCI Medical Center in  Orange.  </P> <P> Because the quadruplets are progressing at different levels, each will be  released at different times.  </P> <P> Three of the babies -- Brianna, Whitney and Vincent -- were born healthy and  bigger than most quadruplets, he said. One, Jeffrey, was born with a lung-fluid  problem but is now in fair condition.  </P> <P> The quadruplets, all clad Friday in white beanies, booties, diapers and  T-shirts embroidered with their names, were reunited on Valentine's Day when  Jeffrey was released from intensive care to the intermediate nursery.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I have gotten used to holding both of them in my arms, but it  sure feels good," said Karen Miner as she rocked two of the children near her  husband, who was holding the other two. After 59 days in the hospital, Karen  Miner, 32, was discharged Thursday.  </P> <P> The infants were the first quadruplets born in Orange County, and the second  such birth in California, through the fertility technique know as GIFT, gamete  intra-Fallopian transfer. The method involves the woman's eggs being placed  with the man's sperm in her Fallopian tube. Four eggs were used to increase the  chances of pregnancy for the Miners.  </P> <P> The couple said they were shocked when they were told last summer that they  were going to become the parents of quadruplets.  </P> <P> "I laughed," said Al Miner, a 34-year-old management consultant. "I don't know  if the reality has struck me yet. Ask me in six months."  </P> <P> "I was devastated and shocked," said Karen, a second-grade school teacher in  Fullerton. "We wanted a child and we were blessed with four. We'll make the  best of it."  </P> <P> It is still hard to identify each infant, said Karen, but each is starting to  develop his or her own characteristics.  </P> <P> "It's hard," she said. "But, I can tell Jeffrey because he has the blond hair  and Brianna because she is the smallest."  </P></p>

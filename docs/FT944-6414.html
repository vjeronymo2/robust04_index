			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Tory ranks pin hopes on tax cuts before election Ministers and Tory MPs last night grasped at the prospect of income tax cuts before the general election as Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget drew a respectful but less than ecstatic reception on the government backbenches. The deep cuts in spending announced by the chancellor - and the parallel falls in his projections for public borrowing - raised the morale of a party battered by the latest infighting over Europe. But Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, signalled that the opposition would next week try to kindle a Tory backbench rebellion over the imposition of full rate value added tax on domestic fuel. Mr Clarke's emphasis on restoring order to public finances, building confidence in the economic recovery and reviving work incentives for the unemployed were applauded by senior Conservatives as a sensible medium-term strategy. The chancellor enhanced his reputation as a politician with the confidence to shrug off short-term expediency and to plan for the medium term. Amid widespread fears, however, that the Budget would do little to boost the government's popularity in the short term, other cabinet ministers suggested that its success would depend on reinforcing discipline on the back benches. Senior ministers are resigned to a crushing defeat in next-month's Dudley by-election, a result that might add impetus to a threatened Conservative revolt over VAT on domestic fuel. Mr Clarke's announcement of help for the elderly to meet the costs of the increase in the tax from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in April failed to dispel disquiet over the rise among the government's supporters. After confirmation yesterday that eight Tory MPs had been suspended from the parliamentary party after Monday's revolt on Europe and that a ninth had resigned the Conservative whip, Mr Major signalled he wanted to avoid another confrontation. In spite of the chancellor's insistence that the VAT increase was an essential part of his overall tax measures, Mr Major refused to elevate it into an issue of confidence. His enemies on the right of the party appeared unable last night to muster sufficient support to mount a challenge before today's deadline for a contest. Nevertheless, ministers remain in doubt as to whether the government will be able to delay an election until 1997. Meanwhile, rightwing hopes that the government will seek to bridge Tory divisions by agreeing to a referendum on further European integration were boosted by Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary. In a Budget interview, Mr Aitken said a decision to join a single European currency would prompt a decision on whether to use 'the normal channels of parliamentary democracy, or whether we should go to a referendum'.

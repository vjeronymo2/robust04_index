			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Apr 20 (TANJUG) -- Health Minister of the  Bosnian Serb state (R.S.) Dragan Kalinic Wednesday warned that  representatives of the "Medecins sans Frontieres" organization  were misusing their humanitarian mission by giving political  connotations to their reports.    In a letter addressed to Eric Stobbaerts, "Medecins sans  Frontieres" mission chief in Belgrade, Kalinic said he was  astonished at the statements by the organization's  representatives in Gorazde, Moslem enclave in south-eastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina and by its central office in Paris, which  contained negative political connotations for the leadership of  the Serb state in that former Yugoslav republic.    Kalinic asked "Medecins sans Frontieres" to keep to the  activities within the framework of its mandate, realling that  the Serb authorities had highly appreciated the cooperation with  this organization in the past, the R.S. news agency SRNA  reports. The statements by the M.S.F. members have for some  time been rife with anti-Serb stances, particularly those made  by its representatives now in the Gorazde enclave, where the  fighting escalated at the end of March after Moslems -- as  confirmed by U.N. representatives -- started attacking the  neighboring Serb territories.    Nevertheless, the M.S.F. representatives in Gorazde keep  pointing out in their reports that Serbs are attacking that safe  area, even though it was being used for military actions against  the Serbs.    The U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali recently  warned that Moslem safe areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina were being  used for preparations for military actions, and that lawlessness  prevailed and prostitution was common in those areas.</p>

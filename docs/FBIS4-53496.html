			<p>BFN     [Text] Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has warned that recent  moves by the United States have raised concern over its strategy  in East Asia. He said the future of the Asia-Pacific [region]  and the world in the next 20 years rests on having a stable  triangular balance among the U.S., Japan, and China. However,  in the last few months U.S. policies seem at odds with this  objective.    Speaking at [words indistinct], Mr. Lee said the U.S. has  been showing a certain limit of (?view). He gave as an example  U.S. pressure on Indonesia and Malaysia on their labor policies,  which had led to riots in Medan. The senior minister said the  U.S. policy toward China is more mystifying as it threatens to  derail China's economic reform by cutting off MFN [most favored  nation status]. He said if the U.S. tries to thwart China's  growth, China will surely want to return the compliment when  they can do so.    Mr. Lee said China does not have to become an ally of the  U.S. for world peace and stability, but it should not be made  into an adversary. As for China, Mr. Lee said with its enormous  potential, Beijing can afford to reassure its neighbors that it  is a friendly and nonexpansionist power, and China can do so by  making its intention and capability more transparent.</p>

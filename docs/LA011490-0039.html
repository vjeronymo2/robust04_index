			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SONY'S BIG DEAL  </P> <P> Re Nina Easton's Dec. 31 article "Behind the Scenes of the Big Deal," about  Sony's purchase of Columbia Pictures:  </P> <P> Sony and the Japanese have created nothing original.  </P> <P> All of the famous Japanese products, from the radio to the television set to  the videocassette recorder, were invented elsewhere. Namely, here in the United  States. All the Japanese have done is to take already existing products and  make them cheaper.  </P> <P> In the case of the Columbia deal, Jon Peters, Peter Guber and the Japanese are  taking an already existing product; only, in this case, it does not seem that  the Japanese are making anything cheaper or better!  </P> <P> J. GREGORY KEENE, Irvine  </P></p>

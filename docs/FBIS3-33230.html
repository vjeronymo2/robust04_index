			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Banco Latino Intervention Board was installed  today. Gustavo Roosen will preside over the commission until 22  March, when President Rafael Caldera will appoint a new  intervention official. Edgar Dao, president of Banco del  Caribe; Celso Dominguez, vice president of Banco Mercantil;  (Jack Vera), president of (Fidenes); and German Garcia, manager  of the Venezuelan Bank of Credit, will accompany Roosen on the  board.    Regarding the specific problems the institution is facing,  Gustavo Roosen stated that it would be better to reactivate the  financial institution and get it working again, instead of  liquidating it altogether. Julio Santodomingo, the intervention  board's outgoing president, said the body's achievements were  satisfactory when compared to similar intervention efforts with  other banks. Roger Urbina, the outgoing bank superintendent at  the General Bank Superintendency, described other such  investigations forwarded by the Executive Branch in recent  years. He said that the measures taken in the Banco Latino case  are no stronger or weaker than those in any other case.    [Begin Urbina recording] During the last few days I have  repeatedly said that the General Bank Superintendency moved in  accordance with the law. It abided by the laws ruling such  interventions when it examined and acted against Banco Latino.  The examination process was identical to all other bank  examinations carried out on other financial institutions. If  this process can be called weak or lenient, then all such  examinations are lenient. If it is strong, then they are all  strong. There are no exceptions to the rule, much less with  Banco Latino.

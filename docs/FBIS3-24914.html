The protest is to  highlight demands that former Venda military ruler Brig Gabriel  Ramushwana pay back about R[rand]1.6 million he is accused of  siphoning from government coffers. Brig Ramushwana has been  chosen to command the national peacekeeping force being moulded  in Bloemfontein.    All schools in Venda closed on Monday this week in the wake  of the strike. The homeland's Department of Finance has said no  pay cheques will be issued for February as the master computer  has been switched off.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): Decisions, decisions, decisions WHAT consequences will the Single European Market have for business? It will change the world, say the believers. Nonsense, retort the sceptics, the Single Market will have no substantial consequences at all. Which opinion should you trust? Do not trust either. Examine your own situation and decide for yourself. The answer depends on several factors: the size of your company, the geographical area, the industrial or commercial sector, your time horizon, and so on. To make all this simpler, Ceres and Durham University Business School have produced the peculiarly-named EuroTrain (ring-bound, A4, two volumes, approx 130 pages, Pounds 70) which sets out to be a tool-kit for developing your own European strategy. EuroTrain aspires to integrate all the details of the various Single Market measures into a single, logical format so that their impact on a particular business can be evaluated systematically and comprehensively. At least, that is the aim of the first volume; the points in it which are blindingly obvious to me are probably not quite so obvious to others, and vice versa, no doubt. In any case, publishers are more likely to go wrong by skipping what seems obvious than they are by including some matters which may appear elementary. The second volume provides names and addresses of all the organisations which are mentioned in the first volume. The value of this is somewhat dubious, partly because several of the organisations listed would be unable to provide you with anything particularly enlightening, and partly because several organisations which could provide relevant information are excluded. But, even by itself, Volume 1 is good value for money if it is going to help you decide on a matter as important as your European strategy.                            *       *      * Wouldn't it be lovely if we could entrust all of life's little decisions to a computer? We are not quite there yet, but there are a growing number of software packages which help simplify, segment and clarify, decision-making. The latest of these is Strad, specifically designed for the PC. Planning in the face of multiple uncertainty, under the pressure of fast-moving events, calls for a particular kind of cool thinking, a special kind of rational-cum-insightful analysis, which can be helped by the way in which computers handle issues. Strad sees the central challenges as managing of the different sources of uncertainty and balancing commitment in the short term with flexibility in the future. The instructions which come with the software are sometimes a little difficult to follow, and the ins and outs of the system force one to think quite carefully about the problem in hand. But, once mastered, the system makes decisions markedly less fraught and more thoroughly considered.                            *       *      * Precisely what makes decision-making fraught - that is, the rapidity and complexity of change - is what makes organisational renewal so necessary. Rosabeth Moss Kanter has made her name as a management guru specialising in the management of change, and some of her latest thinking is captured in The Great Balancing Act (BBC Training Videos, set of two videos, with Training Notes, Pounds 299 plus VAT). The average life-span of an organisation - 40 years - is less than the average life-span of a human being, and Kanter basic message is that, if organisations wish to survive, they need to become faster, more focused, more flexible and more friendly. One of the factors which can make an organisation quicker is a move away from the traditional job description-ruled hierarchy to flatter, project-oriented teams which form and re-form as need arises or passes. This calls for transformation, not just of structures but more crucially of the mentality of individuals. While hierarchical management is control-orientation project leadership is oriented towards liberation, teamwork and shared achievement. To assist with this individual transformation, you may wish to try Daedal's The Project, another of its paper maze-exercises (ring-bound, A4, with OHP masters, and handout masters, Pounds 125) which is designed to help people, up to middle management levels, to succeed as project leaders. Unfortunately, there is little aimed at more senior people even though businesses can only grow to the level of their chief executives, and unless these executives keep learning there is little chance for the organisation to keep growing.</p>

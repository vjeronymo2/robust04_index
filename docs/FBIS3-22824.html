			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Leppard, home affairs correspondent] </F>   [Text] Scotland Yard has uncovered an international plot by  Bosnian Serbs to buy laser-guided British missiles to attack  Nato warplanes poised to bomb artillery positions around  Sarajevo.    The operation, a joint effort by the police and MI5, the  security service, has identified a conspiracy by a Serb  middleman and a British arms dealer from Kingston, Surrey, to  buy missiles worth about &pound;1m on the black market in London.    The success of the operation, codenamed Porchester, will  come  as a relief to Nato pilots and United Nations peacekeeping  forces in the besieged city, where the chances of bombing raids  receded last night after the Serbs appeared to be meeting UN  demands to withdraw artillery.    Scotland Yard has declined to comment, but intelligence  sources said the two men were monitored at meetings in London  and the home counties as they tried to buy eight Starburst  missiles from an unidentified man, thought to be a British arms  dealer with links to organised crime.    Starburst is a shoulder-fired, laser-guided system  manufactured by Shorts of Belfast. First unveiled at the 1991  Paris air show, it boasts a two-and-a-half-mile range and can be  fired within seconds. Shorts sales' literature boasts that  Starburst "can be brought into action and fired as soon as enemy  aircraft have been identified -- and before the release of their  weapons".    The missile is said to be immune to electronic jamming,  flares or chaff, and would undoubtedly have posed a threat to  allied warplanes, including RAF Tornadoes and Harriers. A  successor to the Javelin missile system, it is used by the  British Army.    Security sources say the Serb middleman described himself as  "the procurements officer" for the government of Slovenia, a  province of the former Yugoslavia and now an independent country  uninvolved in the civil war.    The middleman is a well known Yugoslav-born arms dealer in  his late thirties who lives near Vancouver in western Canada. He  has been under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) since last year. The international operation  also involved American customs and Canadian and Israeli  intelligence.    The middleman was tracked to meetings at Hilton hotels in  London's Park Lane and near Bushey, Hertfordshire. At one  meeting he was shown a missile, worth &pound;100,000 on the black  market, and a shoulder launcher. The combined unit was offered  for sale for about &pound;180,000; the Serb said he wanted to buy  eight missiles.    He arranged to have the money transferred from a Swiss bank  account in Zurich to a branch of Credit Suisse in London. It is  understood he planned to smuggle the weapons to Serbia on a  plane from Heathrow.    Detectives from Scotland Yard's international and organised  crime branch, SO1, have contacted the defence ministry in an  attempt to find out how the missiles reached the London arms  black market. Last year, 120 tonnes of weapons were seized in  Slovenia in what UN investigators claim was a plot to breach the  arms embargo to forces fighting the civil war.    Operation Porchester is the latest example of joint action  by  police and MI5 in the growing war against international crime  and arms trafficking. Although they are confident they have  broken the plan to buy the missiles, the two men are still at  large.    TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Call for change in societies' rules Nationwide Building Society, the country's second biggest, yesterday called for a single qualifying period before society members become eligible for rights and benefits of membership. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said in giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation that there was a case for a single statutory test of membership - having been an investor or a borrower for a set period of time such as two years - which would apply for voting and ownership. While such a change would reduce the number of members eligible to vote, when there was increased emphasis on societies' accountability, it would remove some of the anomalies of the current arrangements. In the case of the Lloyds Bank bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society only C&amp;G investing members of more than two years' standing could receive a cash share of the price, although a larger number of members - including borrowers - could vote on whether to accept the offer. The society's written submission to the committee called for a single regulatory framework for financial services with just one watchdog covering areas now handled by a range of bodies including the Building Societies Commission and the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator. MPs on the cross-party committee pressed Mr Davis about why Nationwide had entered a 'tied' relationship to sell the financial services products of Guardian Royal Exchange, the insurer, instead of offering independent financial advice. He said the link provided a chance to work closely with the supplier and improve administration in order to reduce costs.</p>

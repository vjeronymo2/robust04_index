			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mitterrand political review betrays 'intellectual laziness' Sir, Ian Davidson's review of my book, Francois Mitterrand: a study in political leadership ('English ennui and French polish', March 17), is misleading and dishonourable. His tone illustrates mauvaise foi and intellectual laziness. He reproaches me for not writing a journalistic political biography. I state in the preface that this is not the objective of the book, which is primarily aimed at an academic audience. My book attempts to adopt a different approach which should be criticised on its own terms, not dismissed out of hand. Davidson reveals a shaky grasp of French politics and a simplistic understanding of the events in question. He contends: 'The simple truth is that the Socialist party factions, which he (Mitterrand) had originally created to divide and rule the party, automatically turned into feudal baronies fighting for the succession, once Mitterrand had been re-elected and was therefore a lame duck.' This is rubbish. Socialist party factions existed long before Mitterrand had anything to do with the party. Of course 'feudal baronies' disputed control of the PS once the mitterrandiste coalition began to disintegrate after Mitterrand's re-election. I make this point in several places. A second blatant misrepresentation relates to the economic U-turn of March 1983. The objective reader will search in vain for my apparent explanation of this event as being primarily the cost of the nationalisation programme. The deficits engendered by the nationalisation programme were one contributory factor, nothing more, nothing less. It is clear from the outset that Davidson has read the book in a cursory and impatient manner and has made no effort to address its arguments. He falsely contends that a chronological perspective is absent: that is the function of the first three chapters. Alistair Cole, department of politics, Keele University, Staffs</p>

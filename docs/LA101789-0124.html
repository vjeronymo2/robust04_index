			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS MELISSA ETHERIDGE THE DOOM-AND-GLOOM STAR OF ROCK?  </P> <P> How does Melissa Etheridge feel about being the doom-and-gloom queen of  pop-rock? Words couldn't quite express her feelings. During afternoon tea in  West Hollywood recently, the singer-songwriter let her nose do the talking --  wrinkling it as if she'd just gotten a whiff of a foul odor.  </P> <P> "I don't like the fact that people think I'm this depressed, miserable person,"  lamented Etheridge, who opens a five-day engagement tonight at the Roxy. "Some  people come to see me wallow in misery. Men write me letters telling me how  they want to help me become a happy person."  </P> <P> Blame her image on her debut album, "Melissa Etheridge," which has sold nearly  1 million copies. The songs are intense melodramas focusing on rocky  relationships, on people in emotional turmoil. She sings with great conviction,  her slightly croaky voice sounding angry and emotionally wounded. These songs,  fans assume, have to be autobiographical.  </P> <P> "I do songs about how people relate to each other, about what happens in these  relationships," she explained. "I'm sensitive to pain -- to other people's  pain. That doesn't mean I've experienced all the pain I write about. Let's say  I have a good imagination."  </P> <P> Chuckling, she quipped, "If I was like the characters in some of my songs, I  probably would have committed suicide years ago."  </P> <P> Etheridge comes across as overwhelmingly sincere. Often underscoring her words  with forceful gestures, she looks you intently in the eye, giving the  impression she's hanging on your every word.  </P> <P> "I'm a good listener," she said. "I absorb a lot about people's thoughts and  feelings. If you don't have a good feeling for what makes people tick you can't  be a good songwriter."  </P> <P> A cheery follow-up album would have shattered her gloom-and-doom image. But her  recently-released second album, "Brave and Crazy," is essentially more of the  same. Her fans are apparently pleased with it. After a few weeks out, it's  already in the Top 30 on the Billboard pop chart.  </P> <P> Etheridge, though, doesn't agree that the two albums are that similar. "I did  these songs differently," she explained. "My approach to the themes is more  mature this time. The challenge was how to talk about some of life's basic  complications and problems in new and interesting ways. I think I accomplished  what I set out to do."  </P> <P> In some ways, the albums are different.  </P> <P> For one thing, her phrasing is more offbeat, a little more dramatic. The songs  on the new album are more pensive too. There's less unbridled anger, more humor  and more soul-searching. Her imagery is sharper this time and her lyrics have  more dimension.  </P> <P> Musically, the new album has more of a live feel -- thanks to improved  production. "That live feel was missing on the first album," she explained. "I  wanted to make this album sound more like I do in person. When I went on tour  with the first album, people saw I was more of a rock 'n' roller. That tour,  showing a different side of me, really helped sell the album."  </P> <P> On her albums, she's more like a traditional folk singer, accompanied by  minimalist, guitar-dominated musical tracks, her dramatic vocals mostly  carrying the songs. In person, though, backed by a band, she sounds more like a  rocker -- the musicians fleshing out that spare instrumental accompaniment.  </P> <P> Etheridge, who's from Leavenworth, Kan., figured out in high school that she  wanted to be a singer, and worked for years with a country band before  switching to pop. After a short, uneventful detour into scholarly training --  at the Berklee School of Music -- she decided her best bet was on-the-job  training.  </P> <P> "I started playing bars, clubs, street corners -- wherever people would listen  and I could make some money," she said. "I worked on my writing. After a while  I thought I was good enough to get a record deal."  </P> <P> Record companies, though, had other ideas. They didn't think her music was very  commercial. "I was pretty discouraged," said Etheridge, who moved to Los  Angeles five years ago. "I thought no record company would ever take a chance  on me."  </P> <P> But Island Records' head man Chris Blackwell, impressed by her performance in a  Long Beach club, signed her about 2 1/2 years ago.  </P> <P> Now she's a budding star with two hit albums. She acknowledged, though, that  something is missing -- something she'll gladly do without.  </P> <P> "It's that aching about the future that was gnawing at me all the time," she  said. "I was wondering if I would ever make it or if I would be one of those  people with big dreams who failed miserably. I'm still concerned about the  future -- this isn't what you'd call a secure business. But at least that  horrible ache is gone."  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Rate rise still a danger, say societies BUILDING societies warned the government yesterday that they were still under pressure to put up their interest rates despite the Treasury's decision on Monday to cut interest paid on the National Savings First Option Bond. As the threat of early mortgage rate rises receded, however, shares ended mostly firmer in London where the FT-SE 100 index closed up 11.9 at 2,415.6. The societies' warning coincided with the publication of figures showing that building societies are still under severe pressure for their funding with a net outflow of Pounds 314m from their savings deposits in June, the worst monthly figure in nearly six years. Fears of a rise in home loan costs in the short term subsided as the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, announced it would not go ahead with a planned increase in its standard mortgage rate from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent. While the C &amp; G's change of heart was good news for the government, yesterday saw little relief for sterling. The pound remained weak against the D-Mark which continued to strengthen in spite of Monday's concerted intervention by central banks to damp its recent rise. Sterling did gain some ground in late London trading, however, to close unchanged on the day at DM2.8425. In New York it slipped to DM2.8388. The dollar, meanwhile, held on to most of Monday's gains while the lira continued to weaken. Against a background of growing worries about the economy and pressures on public finances Mr John Major, the prime minister, will spell out the tight restraints on this year's public expenditure round at a meeting of the Cabinet today. That message was emphasised by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who yesterday said there was no alternative to his policy of bearing down on inflation. Mr Major is expected to reiterate his warning to colleagues that tax cuts at the end of the current parliament are entirely dependent on austerity measures now. The prime minister is expected to stress that he is backing the Treasury's attempts to hold down total spending next year to Pounds 244.5bn, in spite of the surge in unemployment benefits payments. The C &amp; G move led Abbey National, the second largest mortgage lender, at the last minute to cancel plans to announce a similar rate increase. This would almost certainly have forced the rest of the market to follow. 'One problem has been alleviated but any others that were there remain. We don't imagine that we are going to see a big inflow of savings,' said Mr Andrew Longhurst, C &amp; G chief executive. The size of the outflow of savings during June, a month before the introduction of the First Option Bond, is alarming to the societies. Total building society net receipts in the first six months of the year were just Pounds 343m, compared with Pounds 4.64bn in the same period last year. The First (or fixed interest rate savings tax-paid) Option Bond was launched with a gross interest rate of 10.34 per cent, which attracted funds away from the building societies. On Monday the rate was cut to 9.67 per cent. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said there had been a shift towards investments in other savings products, and particularly National Savings. The societies also face stiff competition from guaranteed income bonds. Some societies believe the savings outflow also reflects a tendency by savers to withdraw money to pay off loans. 'If this situation continues, the societies will have no alternative but to put their rates up in another two months or so,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.

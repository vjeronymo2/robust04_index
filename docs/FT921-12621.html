			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Appointments: Order to uniforms Jacqueline de Baer has decided that her eponymous and rapidly growing design house for corporate clothing, hitherto more or less a one-woman show, demands the skills of a managing director. She has consequently hired Angus Rankine, just 33, who spent the last five years marketing Canary Wharf for Canadian developers Olympia &amp; York. While de Baer will continue with the design and sales, the nitty gritty of day-to-day business will be minded by Rankine. Clients buying uniforms designed by Jacqueline de Baer, who recently won the TSB/Options 'Women mean business' award, range from Forte and Shell to the British pavilion at Expo '92 in Seville. Starting straight from school on the Barclays Bank graduate trainee programme at 18, Rankine did not tarry with the UK clearer, finding he had no wish to become 'a gold watch man'. Instead Rankine decided to go for what he calls a 'sensible' job, namely an account director at J Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, before leaving for Olympia &amp; York. In order actually to run a business Rankine admits he will now be calling upon some of the theory he was fed on the Barclays training programme. ***** Helen Rees, 31, who resigned as director of the troubled Design Museum in London at the end of 1991, is heading north, to Halifax, where she is to be communications director of a new children's museum called Eureka]. 'It's something of a misnomer to call it a museum,' she says. 'It's designed to be an interactive learning place, where children between 5 and 12 and their families will enjoy themselves.' Rees is looking forward to the move, which she says 'in a sense feels quite Utopian'.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] On 24 May, Sumitomo Corporation announced it will  collaborate with Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest U.S.  CATV operating firm to provide multimedia services in Japan. Two  joint ventures will be established within the year to include a  firm to manage and operate the CATV firms currently owned by  Sumitomo in Japan and another firm to offer programming services  using communications satellite systems. Sumitomo will separate  and transfer CATV operations and programming services to the new  firms and utilize the abundant knowledge of TCI in running the  joint ventures.    The two firms recently exchanged a memorandum establishing  the joint ventures. Operating plans and capital requirements  will be the subject of pending discussions and the schedule  calls for establishment of the joint ventures by the end of the  year. According to sources at Sumitomo, TCI "wants to contribute  about 40 percent of the capital" for each joint venture, but its  initial contribution will be restricted to the amount specified  by foreign capital regulations.    Sumitomo plans to transfer all capital already paid into the  18 CATV firms operated throughout the country into the newly  established CATV management firm. It will enter into discussions  with other shareholders of the CATV firms concerning the joint  ventures. In the future, Sumitomo plans to buy additional CATV  stations, engage in consulting services, and contract for  management services, with the goal of becoming Japan's first  multiple system operator. It will also engage in the  implementation of telephone services via CATV. The president of  the firm will be appointed from among Sumitomo officials and TCI  will assign two directors.    The joint venture engaged in programming services plans to  establish multiple channel services to include animated films,  documentaries, and sports broadcasting. Estimates of new capital  requirements for the two joint ventures for the next three to  four years totals $500 million.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Output of Toyota hatchback starts Toyota yesterday began production of a hatchback version of its Carina E saloon at its Burnaston plant near Derby. The new model will account for a half of the plant's output, which is to rise to 100,000 units in 1994 from 37,000 this year. Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) said the output rise would lift the company's spending with its 200 European suppliers to Pounds 380m next year from 1993's Pounds 100m. The steep rise is partly because 'local' - European  -content is rising ahead of schedule. Mr Yukihisa Hirano, the company's managing director, said that local content will reach 80 per cent by the end of next year, about six months ahead of schedule. It has risen from 60 per cent when the plant came on stream last December to 70 per cent now, the company said. About Pounds 50m is being spent with Toyota's 80 components and 20 raw-materials suppliers in the UK this year, rising to Pounds 190m in 1994. The Burnaston plant is recruiting 500 more employees in readiness for the start of a second shift in February, lifting it close to the 1,700 envisaged for full phase-one production of 100,000 cars a year.</p>

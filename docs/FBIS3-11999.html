			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] It is not only the illiterate who are the victims of  unemployment and underemployment. Large groups of professional  workers, recent graduates, and government employees whose  resignations have been purchased have been added to the problem.    According to the CEPAR [expansion not given], the labor  supply in the country is growing at an average annual rate of  2.8 percent. The working age population has increased at a  percentage higher than that of population growth. As a result,  it has been predicted that the young economically active  population (EAP) will increase by 26 percent, while the feminine  EAP will increase by 31 percent.    This situation is of concern to analysts. According to the  most recent report of the CEPLAES [expansion not given], the  rate of employment declined 9.1 percent in 1993.    The financial difficulties being experienced by businesses  and the uncertainty they are feeling have aggravated the effects  of the reduced labor demand.    The public and private productive sectors are seeking to  invest, and thus to provide more stable jobs. The result of this  process is an increase in unemployment, to which is added the  decline in the purchasing power of the wage earners.    Alberto Acosta warns in an article in the periodical CORREO  POBLACIONAL of the lack of planning of a political and  industrial nature that would lead to the creation of jobs. "It  is hoped that the market, on its own, will generate businesses  and jobs, but there is no structural policy oriented toward this  goal."    He notes that the lack of reliable information on the  employment factor is an indication that those responsible for  economic management regard it as a second-category variable.    And on the basic level, there is further symptomatic lack of  concern about the errors being committed in the training of  professional workers. The result has been serious difficulty in  securing job placements.    On the basis of these predictions and the current economic  determinations, it is estimated that it will be necessary to  absorb an additional labor supply of 981,000 workers in the  cities and 257,000 in the rural sector in the next 10 years if  the rates of open unemployment (14.7 percent) and  underemployment (55 percent) are to be prevented from increasing.    These figures show that 124,000 jobs, 79 percent of them in  the cities, will have to be created every year.    The International Labor Organization recommends that the  increases in social allocations and consumption subsidies be  reduced, while investments in human capital and training must be  increased.    This organization also regards the establishment of  subsidies  to improve nutrition and preventive medical care as necessary.    According to the International Labor Organization, the trend  toward increased unemployment rates, even in the industrialized  countries, is alarming because of the magnitude of the risk it  entails.    In fact, this factor leads to many consequences, including  the erosion of national income and the citizens' standard of  living, thus aggravating the problems of promoting development  and alleviating poverty.    Unemployment also increases the public-budget deficit and  macroeconomic instability, and it absorbs resources that could  otherwise be allocated for the purchase of productive equipment,  education, training, and the provision of aid services to the  most neglected sectors.    Many are of the opinion that the state is no longer the main  force in the battle against unemployment, poverty, and  underdevelopment, but rather the basic cause of these problems  because of the distorting effect of its interventions on the  market.    However, the philosophy oriented toward the market economy  that gained ground in the decade of the 1980's still has not, in  practice, produced convincing solutions, at least on a large  scale. This is evidenced by the job deficit accompanying the  current economic recovery.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good afternoon. The government and National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators this  morning concluded talks on the Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of  the Black Cockerel] issue, which had lasted about 15 days. It  is presumed that Vorgan may soon become a commercial station,  even though its modes of operation have not been made public.  Fortunately this obstacle has been overcome. As a result, the  government and UNITA will this afternoon return to the  Mulungushi Conference Center to discuss the issue of swearing in  UNITA deputies.    This morning's meeting was attended by the mediators and the  troika of observers. Considerable progress may be achieved if  the two sides continue showing the willingness to negotiate,  placing national interests above all else. The government team  has already been showing this willingness, and for this it has  been praised by political analysts in Lusaka and elsewhere.    Meanwhile, regarding the new proposals presented over the  past few days by the government, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim  told the TIMES OF ZAMBIA newspaper in today's edition that his  organization is studying the document, adding that they agree  with a number of issues, while other points need a careful  assessment.    This morning's meeting was unexpected, since in the past few  hours UNITA had requested more time to reflect on the Vorgan  issue, which was at last approved, following agreement by the  two negotiating teams. Meanwhile, Dr. Fernando Faustino Muteka,  head of the government delegation team, this morning visited the  diplomatic mission of the Republic of Angola, having held brief  talks with embassy personnel. Luis Perdilhao, first secretary  of the Angolan Embassy in Lusaka, briefed him on some projects  that are currently underway, difficulties faced by the embassy,  and future prospects.</p>

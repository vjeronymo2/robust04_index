			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Franc slide continues despite intervention THE French franc continued its slide within the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday in spite of intervention by the Bundesbank in support of the currency. The day's trading underlined the strains within the ERM caused by the continued strength of the D-Mark, the result of a widespread belief that the Bundesbank is unlikely to cut interest rates soon. The continued flow of money into the D-Mark also put pressure on the Irish punt and the Danish krone, the two weakest currencies in the ERM. Speculation that the Edinburgh summit of European Community leaders might prompt a further realignment provided another incentive for investors to buy D-Marks. The franc finished the day in London at FFr3.418 against the D-Mark, down from FFr3.413 on Thursday. Yesterday's closing price was the franc's lowest since shortly after the European currency crisis of mid-September and within 1.2 centimes of its ERM floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.43. The fall came in spite of intervention by the Bundesbank on three occasions and a statement by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, that there was 'no need' to devalue the franc. The Danish krone and Irish punt, which have been at the bottom of the ERM ladder for some time, faced renewed selling, which was countered by intervention from the Dutch and Belgian central banks. The selling of the punt prompted Dublin again to rule out devaluation of the currency.

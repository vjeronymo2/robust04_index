			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos said here  in Havana that Cuba is interested in achieving specific  agreements on integration and economic reactivation in Cartagena  de Indias. He also stated that this meeting will be different  from the others. It will be new in various ways, he said.    [Begin Bolanos recording] Cuba is attending the summit with  an interest in achieving a specific action or project for the  integration of Latin America. When I say integration, I am  speaking of trade, investments, exchange in technical  assistance, and scientific-technical cooperation. This was not  achieved on previous occasions of the Ibero-American Summit.  Documents were issued reflecting the wishes of Ibero-America in  that respect, but when you analyze the agreements you will see  that very little was achieved. Also, very little was achieved in  other aspects.    Specifically, there will be an important difference. I say  important because each scenario and each person imparts a given  style and personal touch to the event. A delegate can have an  idea of what is going to take place. I can tell you, for  instance, that the event will not be the same as previous ones.  It will be a more dynamic summit and there will be less  protocol. I believe it will be more substantial. More time  will be given to interviews and to debates by the chiefs of  states than on previous occasions. There is something new which  must be stressed. It is that, in addition to a speech by each  head of a delegation, who will each speak seven minutes, there  will be a panel divided into subjects. One of the subjects will  be the flow of investments. There will be the subject of  integration, social changes, and how to achieve integration and  social change from the social and economic perspectives. There  also will be other subjects. The topics will be given to a  group. Those topics are to be given to a group of Latin  American personalities. I think the fact that we are  participating on equal terms is somewhat of a reaffirmation of  the principles for which we have struggled so much, and for  which Latin America has struggled so much. These principles are  sovereignty and free determination. I think this summit is a  rejection, or I might use a stronger word, a repudiation of the  exclusive and exclusivist policy that has been implemented  against Cuba throughout its history since 1959. It is a  reaffirmation of the existence, strengthening, and consolidation  of the revolution, even during difficult moments for our  country, and even in very difficult international conditions. I  think this is the most important aspect of the summit. [end  recording]</p>

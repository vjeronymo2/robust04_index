			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Parretti grip on film studio at risk MR Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier recently ousted as head of Pathe Communications, may be losing his grip on MGM-Pathe, the film and television studio he acquired for Dollars 1.3bn last year. In a delayed filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Pathe Communications revealed it must sell a 40 per cent stake in the studio by December 1 to repay Credit Lyonnais, the French bank and an important backer of Mr Parretti's acquisitions, including Cannon Pictures in 1987 and Pathe Communications in 1988. The SEC filing suggests that Credit Lyonnais, which has provided Dollars 250m in loans to Pathe and has promised an additional Dollars 145m, will gain voting control of Pathe at the end of November or earlier if Pathe defaults on its loans or fails to meet other agreements. Credit Lyonnais will be allowed to sell 51 per cent of MGM-Pathe or Pathe Communications if Pathe has not reduced its indebtedness to Dollars 125m by the end of November. Mr Parretti and his relatives own more than 80 per cent of Pathe and control three of the nine seats on Pathe's board. If Pathe manages to slash its obligations to Credit Lyonnais to Dollars 125m, the bank will drop the voting rights plan. Although the glamour of Hollywood has helped film studios command high prices, analysts have doubts about the value of the MGM-Pathe stake. Pathe stripped the studio of some of its most valuable assets, including its film library, to finance the takeover. The studio is so cash-hungry it has been forced to delay the release of several films because it could not cover marketing costs. Although MGM's television operations have been reasonably successful, thanks to the popularity of series including thirtysomething and In the Heat of the Night, its film studio has produced several recent box office failures, including Not Without My Daughter. A group of creditors which claims it is owed about Dollars 10m by MGM-Pathe have filed a suit to force the studio into involuntary liquidation. Pathe expects the case to be heard next week. Apart from the Credit Lyonnais loans, Pathe's funding of the MGM takeover has been shrouded in mystery. The identities of of several European investors remain secret. The SEC filing did not disclose all the sources of Mr Parretti's funding. In 1990, Pathe extended its annual net loss to Dollars 107.7m, or Dollars 1.59 a share, from about Dollars 32.4m, or Dollars 1.13, a year earlier. Pathe's loss before extraordinary items was Dollars 120.9m, or Dollars 1.79 a share, in 1990 compared with Dollars 61.1m, or Dollars 2.13, in 1989. The company recorded a fourth-quarter net deficit of Dollars 85.8m, or Dollars 1.22 a share, against net earnings of Dollars 22.2m, or 37 cents, a year ago. The fourth-quarter 1990 results included Dollars 66.8m for reserves on investments and loans to unidentified affiliates.</p>

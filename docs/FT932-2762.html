			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Observer: Lording it up If there seems to be a bit of a power vacuum in Canberra this week, the explanation is quite simple. No less than four of Australia's 19 cabinet ministers are in London: Gareth Evans, the foreign minister, Simon Crean, minister of primary industries and energy, Laurie Brereton, minister for industrial relations and Kim Beazley, minister for employment. Each has a busy round of meetings, ranging from discussing nuclear dumps with Douglas Hurd to woolly jumpers with the International Wool Secretariat. Also in town - what a coincidence - are the lord mayors of all Australia's state capitals. Surely this sudden interest in the mother country cannot have anything to do with the second test match beginning at Lord's today?</p>

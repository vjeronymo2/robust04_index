			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SIGN OF VICTORY: But if you do stay away, you might -- repeat, might -- miss a  brand-new tradition at the stadium. . . . The Big A -- the original halo-topped  scoreboard moved to the parking lot after stadium expansion -- finally is  working again. Henceforth whenever the Rams win, a light will slowly crawl up  one leg of the scoreboard and down the other in all-night celebration. It could  happen Monday; the Rams beat the 49ers three weeks ago up north. . . . P.S.: If  the Angels win, the halo will blink overnight. Dallas M. Jackson and Lily Eng  </P></p>

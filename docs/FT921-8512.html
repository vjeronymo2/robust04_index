			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Omani bank takes over local BCCI operations OMAN announced yesterday that a domestic bank has taken over the local operations of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), allowing all BCCI depositors in the sultanate to be repaid in full, AP-DJ reports from Manama. The central bank of Oman said BCCI's local assets and liabilities had been transferred to Bank Dhofar al-Omani al-Fransi. 'By this action the Sultanate of Oman becomes one of the first countries in the world where (BCCI) depositors and creditors will receive their funds without any deductions, notwithstanding the deficit in the balance sheet which resulted from mismanagement abroad,' the central bank said in a statement. Banking sources said Oman will inject OR19m (Pounds 26.9m) into the merged institution to cover the shortfall. Oman shut down BCCI's local branches on July 5, soon after the Bank of England and other regulators seized the bank amid allegations of widespread fraud. The Abu Dhabi government owns a majority stake in BCCI and is currently involved in negotiations to liquidate the bank and provide partial compensation for depositors. BCCI Oman had a loan book totalling OR44m and deposits of OR57m, which will all now be assumed by Bank Dhofar, according to the bank's general manager, Mr Noreddin Nahawi. He said Bank Dhofar had boosted its paid-up capital by OR10m to OR15m ahead of the merger.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / British soldier killed in Bosnia on convoy duty: UK to send back-up forces to protect troops A BRITISH soldier was killed in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, the first British army fatality since troops joined the humanitarian aid effort in the former Yugoslav republic. The British government said UK forces would continue to supply humanitarian aid for the victims of the civil war in Bosnia, backed by reinforcements expected to be agreed by the British cabinet today. The soldier was killed while accompanying a convoy along the route between the Croatian coastal town of Split and Vitez in Bosnia. The cabinet is due to agree on the dispatch of extra forces to back up the UK's 2,400 troops in Bosnia, principally to increase protection for UK soldiers. Plans under discussion involve sending the aircraft carrier Ark Royal to the Adriatic with Harrier jets and Sea King helicopters, as well as an artillery battery to strengthen the capacity of British UN forces to respond to attack. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said Lance Corporal Wayne Edwards, 26, 'has lost his life in working to save the lives of many others'. Downing Street said the risks of British involvement in Bosnia had never been underestimated. Officials said the twin-track strategy of helping victims of the civil war while insisting that long-term peace in former Yugoslavia required a negotiated settlement would continue. 'It is clear that we will carry on providing humanitarian aid,' the prime minister's office said. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said British troops had saved many lives in the region, besides escorting 147 convoys delivering a total of 12,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid. European Community foreign ministers last night held an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss Bosnia and the apparent breakthrough on Tuesday night at the Geneva peace talks. They gave Bosnia's Serbs six days to accept unconditionally the peace plan or face additional punitive measures by the UN. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, said the EC would start next week preparing plans to seal Serbia's borders, to set up a UN war crimes tribunal, and to enforce no-fly zones over Bosnia. Mr Hans van den Broek, EC external affairs commissioner, discussed with ministers the early dispatch of observers to Serbia's neighbours, including Greece, to prepare for stiffer sanctions. Both men had earlier said the EC had to be ready to pursue the 'total isolation' of Serbia if aggression against Bosnia continued. The Danish foreign minister ruled out massive military intervention in former Yugoslavia as 'not credible'. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, was last night due in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. He will put the Geneva peace plan to his parliament.

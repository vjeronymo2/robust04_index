			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Hongzhi (6079 1347 3112) and </F> XINHUA reporter Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504)]    [Text] Bishkek, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Akayev, president of the  Republic of Kyrgyzstan, gave a grand banquet at the Wucaiyunshan  [name as received] Guesthouse, which is located at the foot of  Tian Shan, this evening to warmly welcome Premier Li Peng and  his party.    Akayev delivered an ebullient speech first. He spoke highly  of Premier Li Peng's speech in Tashkent and said: China's four  cardinal principles for developing relations with the Central  Asian nations have deeply impressed these countries, including  Kyrgyzstan; they are in the interests of the peoples of all  Central Asian nations and will have a far-reaching impact on  maintaining peace and stability in the region. He said: Li  Peng's remarks that China will always be a good friend and  neighbor of all Central Asian nations reached every family in  the region within a couple of days.    Akayev added: The whole world knows that under the guidance  of Deng Xiaoping, the reverend chief designer, reform and  opening up have brought about astonishing economic development  in China in the late 20th century. He praised China for having  found the correct path of development and having become a  successful model of revitalizing the economy among developing  countries.    Premier Li Peng said in his reply: "My visit to four Central  Asian countries is aimed at deepening understanding, promoting  friendship, and expanding development. Judged by the conditions  in the three countries I have visited, this goal will surely be  achieved."    He said: "His excellency the president has just highly  evaluated China's achievements over the past decade or so, and I  extend my sincere gratitude for his remarks. However, I would  also like to say that China has indeed undergone some  significant changes, but we have also met with some difficulties  and problems in the course of forging ahead. We have the  confidence that, under the leadership of the CPC Central  Committee with President Jiang Zemin as the core, we will  overcome one difficulty after another and constantly push our  cause forward."    Li Peng said: Situations differ in various countries; all  countries should search for a course of development suitable to  their respective conditions, and Kyrgyzstan is doing this  presently. He said: It is hard for a young country which has  just become independent to avoid having some difficulties, and  "I believe that the Kyrgyz people have the ability and wisdom to  overcome the temporary difficulties, to constantly achieve fresh  progress on the path of development, and to gradually realize  prosperity."    Li Peng said: The towering and giant Tian Shan will not cut  off the friendship between the peoples of China and Kyrgyzstan;  it should become a link connecting the two countries. China  will always live in a friendly manner with Kyrgyzstan and other  Central Asian nations, as well as its northern neighbors such as  Russia, and it will always seek common development through  mutual benefit and cooperation.    Zhu Lin, Premier Li Peng's wife; Ismail Amat, state  councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission; Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Office of  Foreign Affairs under the State Council; and others were invited  to the banquet. Also attending the banquet were President  Akayev's wife; Prime Minister Dzhumagulov and his wife; Supreme  Soviet Chairman Sherimkulov and his wife, and other high-ranking  Kyrgyz officials.</p>

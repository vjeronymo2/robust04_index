			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOULD-BE ASSASSIN TESTIFIES OF JAILHOUSE PLOT IN BROWN CASE;  </P> <P> COURTS: A WITNESS SAYS HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KILL THREE KEY FIGURES IN THE MURDER  PROSECUTION.  </P> <P> A convicted drug offender, testifying in the murder trial of David Arnold  Brown, Wednesday squared off in court against a prosecutor whom he once planned  to assassinate and gave a vivid account of jailhouse loyalties and betrayals.  </P> <P> "I was contracted for a murder for hire," proclaimed former inmate Richard  Steinhart, a burly, tattooed man.  </P> <P> The 36-year-old Steinhart testified that Brown promised him half a million  dollars to "terminate" three key figures in his murder prosecution -- and  actually delivered $22,700 of it before their plot was thwarted by a third  inmate who "snitched" on them early last year.  </P> <P> As Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson neared the end of his case against  Brown, he introduced Steinhart's testimony in an attempt to portray the  defendant as a man capable of murder.  </P> <P> Brown was arrested in September, 1988, for allegedly orchestrating his wife's  shooting death in their Garden Grove home in 1985, then setting up his  14-year-old daughter to take the fall for it and collecting $835,000 in  insurance money himself. He later married the victim's sister, Patti Bailey,  who has since pleaded guilty to murder as a juvenile for her role in the  killing.  </P> <P> While in jail awaiting trial on those charges in early 1989, Brown allegedly  plotted with Steinhart to murder three people: his wife, Patti Bailey, who has  cooperated in his prosecution, prosecutor Robinson and Jay Newell, an  investigator for the district attorney.  </P> <P> In his testimony, Steinhart said he met Brown soon after entering the Orange  County Jail in December, 1988, on a parole violation from an earlier cocaine  conviction. He said the pair quickly hit it off.  </P> <P> At the time, Brown was undergoing a preliminary hearing that would result in  his having to stand trial for murder. Steinhart said Brown seemed desperate,  convinced that his defense was "deteriorating all around him." He said Brown  maintained his innocence throughout their relationship, asserting that he was  being "screwed" by the district attorney's office and by Patti Bailey for  something he didn't do.  </P> <P> The two men soon began talking in detail about escape and murder, Steinhart  said. Steinhart said they agreed that he would shoot the three dead once he  left jail and then help Brown escape. Then, Steinhart said, he was to receive  as much as $500,000 that Brown had buried in the desert.  </P> <P> Steinhart, now out of custody and in a drug rehabilitation center in Lake  Elsinore, said that if he could have figured out a way to double-cross Brown  without actually killing anyone, "I would have let him rot."  </P> <P> But if murder was the only way to collect the money, he added: "I had full  intent to do it."  </P> <P> What he didn't count on, and what Brown would not know until weeks after the  plot was in motion, was the role of a third inmate, Joseph Drake, who tipped  off authorities to the scheme in January, 1989.  </P> <P> Steinhart seemed disoriented during his testimony but said it was the result of  medication he is taking for a recently diagnosed AIDS-related illness. But he  spoke clearly and vehemently about the intricate jailhouse system of inmates  who provide insider information to authorities in hopes of getting time off  their sentences.  </P> <P> Confronted with authorities about the scheme in January, 1989, Steinhart said,  he agreed to wear a bugging device to record several dozen incriminating and  detailed conversations between him and Brown, conversations that have already  been played in court for the jury.  </P> <P> But he denied suggestions from defense attorney Gary Pohlson that he has  profited from his cooperation.  </P> <P> In fact, Steinhart lashed out in a mocking tone at the district attorney's  office for what he called the "fine accommodations" that he had gotten in jail  after his cooperation and for what he described as the shoddy protection that  he said the office gives its witnesses.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jerry Hicks contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, March 10 (AFP) -- The European Union  [EU] criticised the United States here Thursday [10 March] for  trying to impose numerical export targets on Japan, but offered  to work with Washington in pressing for lower Japanese trade  barriers.    EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said U.S. efforts to  force  open the Japanese market with numerical targets were  inefficient, and violated commitments to free trade and  multilateral dispute settlement.    He also warned the United States to exhaust all  dispute-settling procedures of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT) before resorting to its newly-reactivated Super  301 regulation which allows trade reprisals.    Brittan's statement was a low-key reaction to remarks in  Washington on Wednesday by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor, who attacked the European Union for previous criticism  of American trade policy towards Japan.    "The European Union is as determined as the United States to  see Japan enforcing bold measures that will help reduce the  excessive trade surplus that exists both with the United States  and the European Union," Brittan said.    Last month the EU commissioner suggested a "trilateral  approach" involving Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo to negotiate  easier access to the Japanese market.    Kantor said on Wednesday that the United States was ready  for  such an approach. Brittan replied: "I am ready to begin work  immediately with the United States and Japan to resolve these  difficulties."    Japan had a trade surplus of more than 50 billion dollars  with the United States in 1993, and about 26 billion dollars  with the European Union.    Fighting trade talk across the North Atlantic has flared up  again less than five weeks ahead of the April 15 signing date  for the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations.    Kantor accused the European Union on Wednesday of hypocrisy  for sniping at Washington during its trade dispute with Japan,  while at the same time taking advantage of the U.S.  market-opening leverage.    He also attacked EU trade barriers against foreign films and  television programmes, telecommunications equipment, cars and  trucks.    Brittan replied: "The European Union also has a very long  list of U.S. trade barriers, some of which have been in  existence for decades and which cause distortions to  international trade.    ``What we must all do is to work to remove them  constructively through negotiation, rather than resorting to  finger-pointing,'' the EU trade commissioner said.    An EU spokesman said U.S. trade barriers included  discriminatory taxes on European cars and passenger vans, and  the Buy America Act -- which effectively shut European firms out  of airport, road, rail and underground rail projects.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT TO RULE ON TAX CHALLENGES BY FOREIGN MULTINATIONAL FIRMS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court agreed Monday to settle some key questions involving the  ability of multinational corporations to challenge state taxes in federal  court.  </P> <P> What the justices decide sometime next year in a California case could carry  big-money significance for most states and many big businesses.  </P> <P> The court action, granting an appeal by California officials, said that the  justices will review a ruling that allowed two multinational corporations to  challenge a state tax in federal court.  </P> <P> In a 1984 ruling seen as a major victory for states, the justices ruled that  California may tax multinational corporations based on the businesses'  worldwide income.  </P> <P> But that decision applied only to multinationals whose parent company is  situated in the United States. The case acted on Monday involves multinationals  whose parent company is based in a foreign country.  </P> <P> California's business tax -- the same levy upheld in the 1984 ruling -- was  challenged by Alcan Aluminium Limited, a Canadian corporation, and Imperial  Chemical Industries PLC, a British corporation.  </P> <P> California taxed subsidiaries of the multinationals doing business in the  state.  </P> <P> The California tax employs what is known as the unitary system. The method  bases the tax on a share of worldwide earnings, payroll and property value of  each multinational and its subsidiaries.  </P> <P> At issue in the appeal is whether multinationals based abroad have legal  standing to challenge such unitary state taxes in federal courts in the United  States.  </P> <P> Alcan and Imperial challenged the California tax in a federal court in Chicago,  where the California Franchise Tax Board has an office. A federal judge threw  out the suits on grounds that the parent companies contended that they were  injured only in their capacity as shareholders of their subsidiaries -- and  therefore lacked legal standing.  </P></p>

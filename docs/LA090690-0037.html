			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CAREER ANSWER FOUND IN WHODUNITS  </P> <P> All the clues suggest that Dick Hart, 43, knew his new career would be a  mystery. Well, sort of.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to be 54 and say I should have," said the Laguna Hills man who  has become what may be Orange County's sole mystery book specialty store owner.  </P> <P> The store has a Sherlock Holmes-type magnifying glass hanging above the  entrance.  </P> <P> Hart said the decision was based partly on midlife crisis, and in part was the  fulfillment of what he called his "great American Dream."  </P> <P> "I succeeded in what I had been doing and while I hadn't conquered everything,  it was good," the Colgate University graduate said.  </P> <P> Opening his own store has always been in his thoughts, said the transplanted  New Yorker, who spent most of his working life in the wholesale furniture  business.  </P> <P> "I knew I wanted to merchandise something and mystery books seemed like a good  idea. And I knew it would be in California," he said.  </P> <P> He had been to California several times, contending "I spent the equivalent of  one year visiting Disneyland."  </P> <P> Although he claims to have read every Perry Mason book and parts of most of  what he carries in his store, he's not in it for a literary adventure.  </P> <P> "I'm a businessman who owns a bookstore that has to make money," he said.  "While I enjoy reading mysteries, at the end of the day I can put it down and  go home."  </P> <P> Hart said he was a voracious reader while growing up and had a particular  liking for mystery novels.  </P> <P> But Hart's late father, also a furniture wholesaler, had told him: "Never go  into a retail business. The hours are long, long and longer."  </P> <P> Still, Hart went ahead and opened the Green Door Mystery Book Store in San Juan  Capistrano.  </P> <P> Its hours are 10:30 a.m. to 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m. on alternating days, and it's  open seven days a week.  </P> <P> "He was right," said Hart, who nevertheless is having a good time with his  career.  </P> <P> While Hart acknowledges that his work schedule is fatiguing, he says it is  satisfying.  </P> <P> He said the fact that "more money is coming in than going out" of his one-man  shop helps ease the long hours and time away from his family.  </P> <P> In fact, if the business continues its moneymaking pace, he plans to open other  stores to take advantage of what he considers a broadening market of mystery  readers, most of them 24 and older.  </P> <P> The name of the store, The Green Door, was based on a trip Hart took to  Scotland, where he rented a room with a creaky green door during a night of  thunder and lightning.  </P> <P> "They told me the room was haunted and I didn't sleep that night," he  remembers. "I always said if I opened a business it would be called Green Door  something."  </P> <P> But he had some second thoughts because of an X-rated adult movie with green  door in its title.  </P> <P> "I didn't want people to think I was an adult bookstore," he said.  </P> <P> Hart feels mystery books will always be popular.  </P> <P> "They (mystery books) are sort of real life, once removed," he said. "I think a  new wave is coming in for mystery books and I have a head start."  </P></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe near peak Another strong bout of speculative buying interest drove British Aerospace sharply forward. The stock closed 20 higher and only 4 short of its 1993 high of 468p, on above average, but not spectacular, turnover of 3.5m shares, in spite of recent bad news regarding the proposed Taiwan link-up. Stories circulating for at least two weeks have sugg-ested that a careful and unobtrusive stakebuilding operation may have been in motion. Marketmakers have been at a loss to explain the shares' strong performance since the end of last month when the stock began to rise from 425p. The big price gain, although accompanied by turnover only marginally above usual, triggered stories of discreet stakebuilding. Much of the business in the shares appears to have been executed by one marketmaker, arousing the suspicions of the others. It has even been suggested that GEC, known to have coveted some of BAe's interests for some years, could have been involved. One leading trader in the stock said the shares have been 'fundamentally overvalued for some time; either someone is buying a seat at the table if the company is eventually broken up or bid for, or the shares may have been massaged for some kind of cash-raising operation'. There were suggestions that big holders of BAe had begun to consider switching into Rolls-Royce after reports that overseas holdings in the latter had fallen back to 25 per cent after the recent rights issue. Rolls-Royce edged up 3 1/2 to 155 1/2 p yesterday in heavy turnover of 5.3m.</p>

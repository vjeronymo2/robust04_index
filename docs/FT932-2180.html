			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Motoring: Four-track minded - Stuart Marshall looks at the Spanish-built Nissan which is ready to join the swelling ranks of four-wheel drive vehicles in Britain RISING sales of on-off road 4x4s are like one of the vehicles being driven well across rough country; in a word, unstoppable. Europeans are expected to be buying them at an annual rate of 350,000 by next year. In Britain, the recession has done nothing to blunt sales. They have been rising for six years and went up by no less than 36 per cent in 1992. Britain's best seller is the Land Rover Discovery. But Nissan, which made its first 4x4 in 1951, only three years after the Land Rover was launched, is already big in Europe. It is confident the Spanish-built Nissan Terrano II, which is also to be marketed by Ford as the Maverick, will make it bigger still. Shrewdly, Nissan is calling Terrano II an all-road rather than an on-off road vehicle. It knows that the last thing most buyers will have in mind in plunging around axle-deep in mud. In Nissan's sights are buyers living in towns and suburbs but having an active interest in country life, even if it may only be walking dogs on the downs, going to a point-to-point or towing a caravan. Some Terrano IIs will, it thinks, be used on weekdays as car substitutes for commuting and business motoring, for taking children to school or going to the shops. (Just like the average Range Rover, Discovery or Shogun, in fact, though Nissan is too polite it say so). Terrano II (for which read Ford Maverick because only the badges are different) was developed in Europe for European buyers. There are short and long wheelbase models with three-door or five-door estate car bodies. The longer one (pictured) feels more car-like on roads than almost any other 4x4 I have driven though the short-wheelbase model has a choppy ride on all but the smoothest roads. Like the Mitsubishi Shogun and Isuzu Trooper they have independent front suspension. There is a coil-sprung back axle, selectable four-wheel drive (on hard surfaces you use rear-wheel drive only) and 5-speed gearboxes plus a high/low transfer box. This provides ten gears in four-wheel drive, five in two-wheel drive. There is no automatic transmission option. Engines, both four cylinder, are a petrol 2.4-litre and 2.7-litre turbo diesel. Although the diesel develops less power (100 horsepower against the petrol engine's 124) it pulls so much harder at moderate revolutions that it feels at least as muscular. I preferred the diesels, which most buyers will go for, on and off road. At an indicated 90 mph/145 kph and 4,000 rpm on the autoroute, a 5-door was even quieter than the petrol engined version. The official figures suggest an average 24.5 mpg (11.5 l per 100 km) for the petrol, 28.5 mpg (9.9 l per 100 km) for the diesel. Used mainly in town and on local roads, not motorways, the diesel's economy benefits would be greater. For comfort, light controls, noise levels and ambience, Terrano II and Maverick are more like a Nissan Primera than one of their on-off road rivals. All have a limited slip rear differential and power steering. The up-to-seven seat, long-wheelbase five-doors come with a third face-forward bench folding into the load floor. Terrano II LX and the standard Maverick include most car-type goodies. The posh Terrano II SLX and Maverick GLX also have a powered sunroof, heated mirrors and, at extra cost, air conditioning. Prices, due to be announced next week, are expected to be in the Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 range. This will put Terrano II and Maverick in between the Daihatsu Sportrak, Suzuki Vitara and Vauxhall (Opel) Frontera Sport and the heavier metal of Discovery, Shogun and Trooper. Probable buyers will include young and image-conscious men and women priced out of their GTi hot hatchbacks by the insurance companies. The tail-in-air styling grates on me a bit and I see little point in having a four-wheel drive to use solely on the road. Having said that, a long-wheelbase turbo-diesel Terrano II or Maverick might fit easily into my country town lifestyle. And if we ever had a really bad winter again, its 4x4 traction would be worth its weight in gold.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Recently there has been media coverage of "Operation Rescue" and much  commentary concerning the anti-abortion vs. pro-choice issue.  </P> <P> In this day, with so many contraceptive methods available, why must we as a  society be making such widely diverging choices?  </P> <P> It should be every woman's right to choose what happens to her body. However,  how can we take life so casually? And it will be life if given the chance to  grow. It seems too cold, too inhumane, casual and irresponsible to take a  position that "if I become pregnant I can always just end it."  </P> <P> So much heartache has been caused by unwanted pregnancies, yet we as women  never seem to learn the age-old lesson.  </P> <P> Why not a new commitment to responsibility, to the use of contraceptives, to  cherishing life rather than what seems to be a very sad prevailing attitude  that shows a great sickness within our society.  </P> <P> EILEEN SCHENCK  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

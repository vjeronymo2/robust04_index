			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Charging for road use is way to improve quality of urban life Sir, The report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution is clearly one of the most important documents on the subject of the car and the environment this decade ('UK traffic growth curb urged by commission', October 27). Surprisingly, it appears to attach very little weight to charging for road use - the one political step which could have a significant effect on the quality of urban life. Additional fuel taxation will not of itself make much impact on traffic density in the places where pollution problems are most acute - the UK's towns and cities. It is a blunt instrument which will penalise the rural driver who has little alternative to the car and will add to national freight costs. The commission has dealt fully and forcefully with the costs to the nation of pollution-related diseases such as asthma and cancer, road-related deaths and noise. To be added to this burden are the loss of millions of hours of productive time due to congestion, the inability to plan journeys properly and the rapid deterioration of public transport systems. Road pricing is the only way to break the spiral in a free market economy. It is the only means to force an efficient and responsive economic link between the supply of and demand for limited road space and release significant revenue for investment in public transport networks. While the tolling of motorways by 1998 is already a commitment of this government, road pricing could start much earlier in the cities, and work outwards through the road network, eventually forming a unified road use charging system with the potential to charge for use of all types of road. The necessary technology exists; it is simple, low cost and easy to install. There are, though, two important hurdles to overcome - both within the control of Parliament. The first is the passing of the necessary legislation to enable local authorities to charge for the use of road space. The second is the issue of hypothecation; the Treasury must allow the larger part (if not all) of the revenue derived from road use charging to be directed to improving all areas of the nation's public transport services and, where appropriate, for those decisions to be made locally. The government will not be serving the aims of the commission and the majority of UK people unless it tackles these issues squarely and swiftly.

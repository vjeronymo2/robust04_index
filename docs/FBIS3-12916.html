'Abd-al-Shafi was speaking by phone with AL-QUDS from  Nicosia, where he is visiting at present in response to an  invitation to attend an international conference of churches  after paying a visit to South Africa.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added that a good solution cannot be  reached except with the removal of Israeli settlements from the  heart of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Settlements are the main  obstacle to the achievement of a lasting peace in the region on  the basis of UN resolutions.    'Abd-al-Shafi called on the Palestinian leadership to  suspend  the talks and reassess the current Palestinian situation  entirely on a democratic basis. This would ensure the unity of  the Palestinian position inside and outside by mobilizing all  Palestinian potentials and defining the effective options  available to the Palestinian people.</p>

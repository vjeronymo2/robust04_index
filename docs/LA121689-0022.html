			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIFTH HOLOCAUST FILM  </P> <P> As Patrick Goldstein reported in his Dec. 7 article, "The Holocaust -- A Tough  Sell for the Holidays?," distributing a Holocaust-related film poses special  challenges during the holiday season.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Goldstein has added to the challenge by an oversight. There are  not just "four films simultaneously in the market with Holocaust themes." There  is also "Weapons of the Spirit," an award-winning, feature documentary that  tells the story of a Christian village in France that saved 5,000 Jews from the  Nazis.  </P> <P> After runs in New York City and Los Angeles, the film is doing well in Boston,  San Francisco and Philadelphia. It will be gradually opened in all major  markets throughout the holidays and into the new year. (Incidentally, "Weapons  of the Spirit" was circulating under that title long before the title of  "Triumph of the Spirit" was announced.)  </P> <P> PIERRE SAUVAGE  </P> <P> Pierre Sauvage Productions  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

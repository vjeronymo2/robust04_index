			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Way To Defuse Japan-U.S. </F> Friction"]    [Text] The government has begun to speedily explore ways  to break the impasse in the Japan-U.S. framework talks that  ended in a breakdown. The government held a meeting of cabinet  members in charge of foreign economic issues on 25 February to  confirm that the government will map out a package of measures  during March to promote imports, relax bureaucratic regulations,  promote government procurement and adopt a competitive policy,  and also map out a set of measures to expand domestic demand.  Bureaucrats still strongly resist setting specific targets for  them, and it remains to be seen whether these measures would be  able to soften the U.S.'s tough trade stand on Japan.  <H5>  Promotion of Imports </H5>   The "Market-Opening Issue Headquarters," mandated to examine  specific measures to open the Japanese market, held its first  meeting on 25 February to confirm that nontariff barriers  keeping foreign firms from gaining access to the Japanese market  should be quickly reviewed.    According to the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], the  Secretariat of the Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman  (OTO), the OTO handled 509 cases of business complaints filed by  foreign companies. EPA believes that if common barriers  hampering foreign firms from gaining access to the Japanese  market are identified in the course of handling the business  complaints, it would be possible for the government to map out a  set of internationally-praised measures on its own to help  foreign firms gain access to the Japanese market.    The "Market-Opening Issue Headquarters" was created on 1  February with Prime Minister Hosokawa leading the organization.  EPA describes the creation of the headquarters as an  "indication of Japan's eagerness to grapple seriously with the  issue of increasing foreign access to the Japanese market." The  old headquarters, established in 1982, has been disbanded.  Given the mandate of handling business complaints lodged by  foreign companies, the newly established headquarters will have  to map out a set of measures during March to resolve the  business complaints filed by foreign firms, but it will be  difficult to do that within the month under the present  situation. EPA Director General Manae Kubota says: "We have no  choice but to vigorously publicize OTO for the time being. We  are going to send missions abroad within the year to publicize  it."  <H5>  Automobiles </H5>   As for measures to open the Japanese market to foreign  automobiles and auto parts, the government's standard for import  certification will be reviewed and the business community will  be urged to voluntarily work out its own plans to boost imports  of U.S. automobiles and auto parts. These actions will form the  core of Japan's measures to boost imports of U.S. automobiles  and auto parts.    As for measures that the government can take to increase  their imports, the standard for import certification is likely  to be reviewed and the possibility of reducing the remodeling of  imported U.S.-built cars which meet both Japanese and U.S.  environmental and safety requirements is likely to be studied.  The government's measures are likely to include stopping  Japanese car repair factories from discriminating between  domestically-made auto parts and imported auto parts and  promoting the imports of auto parts used by them.    Given the frequent occurrence of friction resulting from  misunderstanding, the government intends to promote the  design-in formula, under which Japanese and U.S. enterprises  cooperate with each other from the design stage. The government  plans to hold a "Big Three Seminar" (tentative name) to brief  U.S. corporations on how Japanese and U.S. enterprises have  cooperated with each other so far and what results the  cooperation has brought about.    U.S. Commerce Undersecretary Garten will visit Japan on 4  March and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] will present him with the government's package of  measures to open the Japanese market in an informal meeting and  to feel out his reaction to the package.    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, an  organization formed by auto makers and the Japan Automobile  Dealers Association, an organization created by auto dealers,  have begun the joint work of drawing up plans for the purchase  of U.S.-built cars and U.S.-made auto parts after 1995. They  will compile a document to explain the current level of sales of  U.S.-built automobiles in Japan to U.S. automakers. Regarding  auto parts, which has become a focus of dispute between the two  countries, three major Japanese carmakers -- Toyota Motor  Corporation, Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, and Nissan Motor  Company -- will unveil their respective plans in early March.  Mazda Motor Corporation and other Japanese automakers are  expected to unveil their plans.    In 1933, Japan purchased only $14.48 billion in U.S.- made  auto parts, an increase of 6.3 percent over the year earlier,  and meeting the target of purchasing $19 billion worth of  U.S.-made auto parts is almost impossible. The view is  spreading among Japanese automakers that "the automobile issue  should be settled by Japanese and U.S. automakers."  <H5>  Insurance </H5>   Japan shows no signs of making concessions on opening the  Japanese insurance market.    The non-life insurance industry is reacting against setting  any targets for the share of U.S. insurance firms in the  Japanese insurance market. A major insurance firm says, "Japan  has run a deficit with the United States in the insurance  sector, and we are not concerned about any U.S. sanctions."  Some Japanese insurance companies are voicing the need for  Japan to take a tough stand on the United States. Given this  backlash from the non-life insurance industry, it would be  difficult for the Finance Ministry to map out a set of  concessions to open the Japanese insurance market.    Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry plans to introduce a  brokerage system by amending the Insurance Business Law next  spring to help U.S. insurance companies strengthen their  marketing activities in Japan. The Finance Ministry plans to  use the administrative discretion to delay the liberalization of  the Japanese insurance market. The ministry, however, will seek  the understanding of the United States by explaining to the  United States its plans to help maintain the currently high  share of the Japanese insurance market held by U.S. insurance  companies.  <H5>  Expansion of Domestic Demand </H5>   Last year, the United States posted a record $59.3 billion  trade deficit with Japan. Even if the government decides to put  into effect measures, especially the four-point measure to open  the Japanese market, those measures can hardly be regarded as a  trump card to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan.  Japan is also under pressure to map out a set of measures in  the macroarea.    As a target that can be easily understood abroad, presently  under study is an increase in the ten-year plan for public  investment totalling 430 trillion yen that was incorporated in  the final report of the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediment  Initiative Talks in June 1990. At a cabinet meeting on 25  February, many cabinet members spoke positively of the increase,  and a report compiled by the Economic Reform Research Council  (headed by Gaishi Hiraiwa) last December proposed the increase  on the condition that the "government secure financial  resources." The increase is expected to be approximately 100  trillion yen at the end of the coordination of views within the  government.    In addition, the "national welfare tax" called for 18  trillion yen in tax cuts over the next three years, but the  government has decided on tax cuts for only one year, provoking  growing complaints in the United States. Finance Minister Fujii  intends to explain to his U.S. counterpart at the Japan-U.S.  finance ministerial talks on 26 February that the "tax cuts are  Japan's promise to make a sweeping reform of the current tax  system," but it is unclear how to secure financial resources to  make up for a financial shortfall resulting from the tax cuts.  It is also unclear to what extent Japan will be able to obtain  U.S. understanding on the tax cuts.    In addition to those measures, the idea is surfacing of  establishing a target effort to keep Japan's current account  surplus at 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product and making  the target effort "Japan's commitment." Foreign Minister Hata  supports the idea, and there is a possibility that Japan will  present the United States with this idea as a  voluntarily-established numerical target. However,  Administrative Finance Vice Minister Jiro Saito has said, "The  government's consensus is that it will not present the United  States with anything like numerical targets." In this way, some  Finance Ministry officials are voicing their disapproval of the  idea.  <H5>  Government Procurement </H5>   The government will try to put into effect the action  program  designed to expand government procurement and make it  transparent. The government will publicize English-language  versions of bidding advertisements and databased bidding  information in an attempt to smoothly supply information to  foreign contractors that have so far had difficulty obtaining  such information. The government plans to announce its plans  earlier than ever for the procurement of goods worth more than  800,000 SDR (the special drawing rights of the IMF), improve the  current system for settling bidding complaints lodged by foreign  construction firms and simplify the current procurement  procedure.  <H5>  Relaxation of Bureaucratic Regulations </H5>   The relaxation of bureaucratic regulations has frequently  been mentioned as an effective means to expand domestic demand  and open the Japanese market since last September when the  government announced a package of economic stimulus measures.  The relaxation of bureaucratic regulations requires the  amendment of many relevant laws. Most of the deregulation,  though incorporated in the September package of economic  stimulus measures, will be put into effect after this spring.  Even if the government announces a set of new measures to relax  regulations, it is doubtful whether this would bring about an  immediate effect.    In particular, the package of measures to relax bureaucratic  regulations will greatly affect the established enterprises,  though only temporarily. It seems that the enterprises want to  put off deregulation as long as possible.    The September package of economic stimulus measures included  relaxing 94 regulations, including regulations on housing  construction, but relaxation of only 35 regulations out of the  94 has been put into effect. The rest will be relaxed after the  Diet amends relevant laws.    The Hiraiwa Report proposes that "economic regulation must  be  confined only to exceptional cases out of principle." The  report also points out the need to study the possibility of  amending the Large-Scale Retail Store Law and deregulating five  areas, including the first-kind telecommunications business.  The "Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters" of the  government, which was established in early February, has pointed  out the need to reduce or deregulate 682 cases of certification  and licensure. A February package of economic stimulus measures  emphasizes the need to relax 54 regulations as an effective  means to stimulate the economy.    Some government officials are saying the "government has  already taken all immediately enforceable steps to expand  domestic demand and relax bureaucratic regulation." The  certification and licensure of cases, currently numbering  11,402, show no signs of shrinking, and the United States will  incessantly press Japan to reduce its number of regulations.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Oil unions held over a barrel / A look at a trend which may spread to other industries THE MAJORITY of workers in the British oil industry are no longer covered by collective agreements negotiated by trade unions. Oil companies are imposing sweeping changes in working practices through individual contracts of employment. Shell's decision to scrap collective bargaining at its Haven refinery on the Thames estuary next month is a further step towards what Mr Fred Higgs, negotiator for the TGWU transport union, calls a 'collusive employer attack' designed to transform the British oil industry into a 'union-free environment'. But the leading companies - Shell, Esso, BP and Mobil - deny any such co-ordination. They point out that the policy towards the unions differs between parts of their business from offshore work and refining to distribution. A number of comprehensive restructuring deals have been introduced in the oil industry since 1989. Many involve the ending of trade union recognition. These include: Process operators and craftsmen at BP Chemicals' Baglan Bay site, on the Swansea side of Port Talbot in south Wales, moved to individual contracts of employment from March 1 last year and their conditions were made the same as those of white-collar staff. In addition, multi-skilled production teams were introduced and unions were derecognised in collective bargaining. BP oil terminal workers are no longer represented by unions for collective bargaining. The company said it continued to work in harmony with them in its distribution business and refining operation at Grangemouth, on the River Forth. There are collective agreements at its Sullom Voe terminal in Shetland, but not in its offshore operations. Shell tanker drivers were put on staff contracts and collective bargaining with the TGWU ended last July. Individual workers can still be represented by a union official in grievance cases or discipline hearings. Craftsmen at Shell Oil's Stanlow plant in Essex have lost union recognition but workers belonging to the TGWU are still covered by collective agreements as the union agreed to sweeping working practice reforms. At Haven, all unions face derecognition except for individual grievances. In September 1991 Esso moved its tanker drivers to individual contracts of employment and staff status and the TGWU was derecognised. Merit-based pay replaced negotiated wages, taking average earnings to about Pounds 32,000 a year. Maintenance workers at Mobil's Coryton refinery in Essex moved to staff status last August, with the end of collective bargaining. The unions retained individual representation rights on disciplinary issues. In mid-1994, at the end of the current two-year collective deal, 300 operators at Coryton will move to individual contracts of employment. Unions will continue to represent them on non-pay issues. The 320 workers at Mobil's Birkenhead operations who are covered by two collective agreements will continue to have union bargaining. Mobil said: 'We vary our approach between business operations to suit our needs.' The drive against union recognition in oil stems from adverse market pressures caused by overcapacity and low oil prices. The companies believe they must reduce costs to become more competitive with the best in continental Europe. This has meant drastic changes in working practices with the abolition of demarcation lines and the introduction of multi-skilling and teamwork. It has also meant individual performance-related pay systems, staff status for blue-collar workers and the introduction of contract labour. Increasingly, the oil companies see no reason to bargain collectively with trade unions. But Mr Alan Mitchell of Incomes Data Services, the independent research organisation, said total derecognition remained rare. Mr Mitchell said: 'Unions continue to retain a representational role in areas like health and safety or dealing with the problems of individual workers who remain union members in disciplinary and grievance disputes.' The changes have so far brought little resistance from the trade unions because members have been unwilling to endanger jobs by fighting derecognition - and the pay and conditions of most oil workers is substantial in spite of the end of collective bargaining. Oil is not a cheap labour industry, nor will it become so. Providing a service for the individual oil worker may provide a new role for the unions, but this will leave them limited and marginalised. And a growing number of union officials fear the drive to derecognition in oil could encourage employers in other industries to follow suit.</p>

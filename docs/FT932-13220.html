			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / World Bank completes oilfields project talks with Russia THE World Bank has completed negotiations with Russia on a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) project to boost output from the Siberian oilfields, writes George Graham in Washington. The deal, still to be approved by the World Bank's board of directors, would support Russian government efforts to revitalise the oil industry and fund a programme of well upgrades designed to increase production by 33,000 tons a day. This would raise Russia's national output by 3 per cent or Dollars 1.5bn a year, the World Bank said. The Bank is to provide more than Dollars 500m for the project, which will be co-financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Additional funding is expected from national export credit agencies. The energy sector has been a focus for development projects in Russia because of the potential for rapidly boosting export earnings by improving the efficiency of the country's oil fields.</p>

The Palestinian side will  be headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian  president Yasir 'Arafat. The Israeli delegation will be headed  by Deputy Chief of Staff General Amnon Shahaq.    The security committee and the drafting committee are  scheduled to meet tomorrow. The civil committee concerned with  the transfer of the self-rule powers will meet in Taba on  Tuesday [11 January]. This round of talks is scheduled to  continue until Friday and will resume next week on Sunday or  Monday.    Dr. Sha'th held a meeting this evening with the Palestinian  delegation members, who arrived in Taba this afternoon, to  prepare the working papers that will be submitted to the Israeli  side. Dr. Sha'th stated that the negotiations will continue for  three weeks until all the steps relevant to the transfer of  power to the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho are prepared. He  defined these steps as the issue of the crossings, the size of  the Jericho area, and security along the sea and in the Israeli  settlements in the Gaza Strip. He noted that the Israeli  withdrawal is scheduled to be completed before 13 April. He  pointed out that postponing Israeli withdrawal after this date  will be considered a violation of the Declaration of Principles.    Dr. Sha'th stressed that no agreement will be signed until  after a timetable has been worked out to release the remaining  Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails, noting that their number  now ranges between 9,600 and 9,700. He noted that Israel's  release of 101 Palestinian detainees recently is merely a  gesture of good will. He said that the Taba talks will resume  because the Israeli side gave up its claims of the existence of  "a Cairo document" for the negotiations, noting that during the  Cairo talks six working papers were submitted, but nothing in  them has been settled.</p>

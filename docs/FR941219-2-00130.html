			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Bank also commented on section I wherein it is stated that the Plans involved in the transaction are Plans for which the Bank serves as trustee, investment manager, or in any other capacity as fiduciary on behalf of the Plan, and on section II wherein it is stated that the Plans involved in the transaction are Plans for which the Bank serves as fiduciary. The Bank states that although its original application referred to Plans for which it exercised investment discretion, it wishes to note for the record that it also serves Plans in other fiduciary capacities that do not involve the exercise of investment responsibility. In this regard, in addition to the representations contained in paragraph 2 of the Notice, as of the time of the application, the Bank had custody of approximately $2.5 billion in assets from approximately 1,500 plans for which the Bank does not exercise investment responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this comment, the Department acknowledges this additional information. However, the Department wishes to reiterate that it is not granting relief for transactions afforded relief by Section 404(c) of the Act nor relief for transactions involving any plan sponsored by the Bank or its affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank in its comment letter also requests further modifications and updates to the language of the Summary of Facts and Representations, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Specifically, the Bank requests that representations at pages 42293 through 42294 in Notice be changed to reflect the fact that HighMark now has eleven (11) portfolios, having established in November 1993, four (4) new non-money market portfolios, namely the Growth Fund, the Income &amp; Growth Fund, the Balanced Fund, and the Government Bond Fund, and having merged the Special Growth Equity and Growth Funds in May 1994. It is further represented that the Bank continues to serve as investment adviser, sub-administrator, sub-transfer agent and custodian, but does not serve as sub-accountant to HighMark. The Department notes that this additional information will be included in the record of the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank also requests clarification of the language of the fourth sentence of paragraph 3 of the Summary of Facts and Representation, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In this regard, the Bank wishes to confirm that the exemption does not preclude the Bank from relying on any other available exemption (e.g., Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84&hyph;24 or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4), if the terms and conditions of such exemptions are satisfied and if the Bank deems it appropriate to do so in a given situation. The Department concurs in this comment, but expresses no opinion regarding the availability of those exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank also comments that the first sentence of paragraph 5 of the Summary of Facts and Representations in the Notice could be read to suggest that the Bank believes that in-kind transfers of the type covered by Section I of the exemption are not covered by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4. While the Bank represents that it intends to follow the requirements of Section I of the exemption in connection with such in-kind transfers, the Bank reiterates that its position was and is that such transfers also are within the scope of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4. The Department notes that it has formally expressed its view on this issue. Specifically, the Department has concluded that the relief provided by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4 is unavailable for the purchase of shares in mutual funds other than for cash. (See footnote 3 in Advisory Opinion 94&hyph;35A, dated November 3, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Bank wishes to update in three particulars the description of the Bank's automated ``sweep'' service described in the Summary of Facts and Representations, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In this regard, language in the first paragraph in paragraph 14 of the Notice indicates that purchases and sales of shares in any of the Funds by the Plans may also occur in connection with daily automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements, but that agreement to such an arrangement is not a condition for the Plan otherwise choosing to invest in shares of the Fund, nor will the reverse be required. The Bank maintains that the meaning of the phrase, ``nor will the reverse be required'' is unclear. It is the Bank's position that, in the exercise of its business judgment regarding the structure and characteristics of any sweep services it may wish to offer, it may choose to limit investment vehicles made available under any sweep program to shares of a designated Fund. The Department notes that the sentence in which the phrase, ``nor will the reverse be required,'' appeared was intended to mean that Plans may participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements involving the Funds without being required to invest other plan assets in shares of the Funds and that Plans may invest in the Funds without being required also to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements offered by the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the Bank wishes to correct a representation in the second paragraph of paragraph 14 of the Notice which states, in part, that ``all of the Plans served by the Bank had elected to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements with HighMark.'' According to the Bank, this representation should read that ``substantially all'' of the Plans served by the Bank had elected to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements with HighMark. The Department concurs and incorporates this information into the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the Bank seeks clarification of the second sentence of the third paragraph of paragraph 14 of the Notice. In the opinion of the Bank, the sentence could be read to suggest that the ``sweep'' program for a given Plan may involve investments in more than one of the HighMark money market portfolios at the same time. The Bank represents that while a Plan may choose from among several such portfolios of HighMark, the ``sweep'' arrangement for a given Plan involves automatic investments in shares of only one such portfolio at a time. The Department concurs and incorporates the information on the ``sweep'' program into the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After giving full consideration to the entire record, including the written comment from the Bank, the Department has decided to grant the exemption, as described and concurred in above. In this regard, the comment letter submitted by the Bank to the Department has been included as part of the public record of the exemption application. The complete application file, including all supplemental submissions received by the Department, is made available for public inspection in the Public Documents Room of the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration, Room N&hyph;5638, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on Wednesday, August 17, 1994, at 59 FR 42289.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Angelena C.

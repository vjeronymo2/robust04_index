			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The government decided  Friday [18 February] to maintain the current interest rate on  welfare savings offered through private banks at an annual 4.15  percent for the next one-year period.    The decision came at a morning cabinet meeting, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters.    The move is intended to help pensioners and the disabled  amid  the current trend for lower interest rates in line with  progressing financial deregulations, Fujii said.    Private banks offer welfare savings with a relatively high  fixed interest rate under the Finance Ministry's permission.    He noted that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  is  expected to take a similar measure for such savings offered by  post offices.</p>

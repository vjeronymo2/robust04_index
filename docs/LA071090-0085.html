			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS SOLD PLAYERS STOCK BEFORE QUICK DOWNTURN  </P> <P> Several officials of Players International in Agoura Hills sold about $2.5  million worth of stock in the company almost two weeks before the stock took a  sudden drop in over-the-counter trading, according to filings with the federal  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Chairman Edward Fishman, Vice Chairman David Fishman, President Stanley  Harfenist, Vice President John Quiroga and Director Stanley Fishman together  sold 405,300 shares of Players stock on May 31 and June 31 for between $6.10  and $6.125 per share.  </P> <P> Harfenist sold another 10,000 shares that he holds for his son on June 6, for  $6.125 per share.  </P> <P> The stock rose to a 52-week high of $8.50 on June 4. Investors were apparently  intrigued by Players' announcement that it would soon test-market a telephone  call-in version of the popular television game show "Jeopardy!" by using a  900-number service.  </P> <P> After the New York Daily News reported on June 13 that a Tennessee congressman  had asked the U.S. attorney general in May to investigate a different  900-number game, Players' stock fell 31% in two days to close at $5.25 on June  14.  </P> <P> Players' stock closed Monday at $4.75 per share, down 37.5 cents.  </P> <P> David Fishman denied that the officials' stock sales were related to the  congressman's announcement, which he said the company only learned about  through the June 13 Daily News article. The reasons for the sales were  "personal," David Fishman said. "I don't want to get into their personal  reasons or mine," he said.  </P> <P> According to a separate filing with the SEC, the company officials planned to  sell another 1 million shares. But David Fishman said that filing was made by  mistake by the officials' brokers. The officials don't plan to sell more stock,  he added.  </P> <P> Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., claimed that the other 900-number contest, which is  called "The Game," constitutes a form of gambling. But David Fishman said  Players' "Jeopardy!" game isn't gambling.  </P> <P> Players operates a club that offers discounts to "middle-roller" gamblers at  casino resorts in places such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City.  </P></p>

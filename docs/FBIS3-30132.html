			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tetsuro Hanari] </F>   [Text] There are growing concerns within the government  over arguments in the United States and South Korea that "Japan  may arm itself with nuclear weapons." Some officials just laugh  off the arguments because in actuality, there is absolutely no  possibility of Japan's altering its "three nonnuclear  principles." However, a senior official at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "So far,  relations [between Japan and the United States] in the security  arena have been stable. But if they become unstable, bilateral  economic issues will also become complicated." It is feared that  the nuclear arguments might become a factor to further intensify  trade frictions between the two countries.    A MITI source, who recently was asked in an unofficial  meeting about the possibility of Japan's arming itself with a  nuclear arsenal, pointed out, "It will be no surprise to the  United States and European nations to see Japan, an economic and  technological superpower, beginning to develop nuclear weapons."    Since the cold war era, the United States and European  nations have dangerously confronted each other backed by their  nuclear deterrents. It seems that they never understand the  special feeling, or antipathy, that the Japanese have toward  nuclear weapons as the people of a nation that suffered an  atomic attack.    One of the reasons that the nuclear arguments have surfaced  is the foreign countries' lack of understanding and their  distrust of Japan's nuclear energy policy, which permits the  nation to bring in plutonium from France and store it. The  aforementioned MITI source said he was asked "why Japan has to  store plutonium when it has no intention of developing nuclear  weapons."    In addition, the fact that Japan initially did not give its  full support to an indefinite extension of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) has spurred the arguments. The  NPT, which expires in 1995, allows only the current nuclear  powers to possess nuclear weapons. Because of this, some  Japanese Government officials and Liberal Democratic Party  members asked, "Is it right for Japan to abandon a nuclear  option while the DPRK is suspected of developing nuclear  weapons?"    The Foreign Ministry persuaded those who opposed the NPT's  indefinite extension to agree to a plan to announce Japan's  support for the indefinite extension at the G-7 summit meeting  (Tokyo summit) last July. The ministry, however, failed to  change Japan's conventional and vague stand on the NPT.  Although the present coalition government decided to "support"  the indefinite extension after it was inaugurated, this fact  seems not to be fully known to foreign countries. Also, a  successful launch of the H-2 rocket has deepened foreign  suspicions because the rocket can be converted into a missile.    Besides such developments, it has long been rumored in the  United States and the ROK that Japan might equip itself with  nuclear arms because of the DPRK's suspected nuclear program.    Washington officially takes the stand that "Japan will not  turn to developing nuclear weapons." However, U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry recently stated that Japan and the ROK  might begin to develop nuclear arms once the DPRK succeeded in  its nuclear development.    The problem is that such arguments have surfaced at a time  when the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks have broken down.  The Clinton administration, which is irritated by the chronic  trade deficit with Japan, is calling on Tokyo to accept its  "numerical target" proposal. The administration's distrust of  Japan has deepened. So far, bilateral relations in the security  arena have remained stable, but the aforementioned senior MITI  official noted, "Japan should express its intention to not  develop nuclear weapons not only in words but also in deeds."</p>

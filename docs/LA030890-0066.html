			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: IT PAYS TO STUDY YOUR INHERITANCE  </P> <P> Question: I inherited a large coin collection along with some dollar bills  about five years ago. The collection involves probably 30,000 coins including  some junk silver, a lot of rolls of uncirculated pennies from the '60s and many  fairly rare pieces, including American and foreign gold and silver dollars. The  collection is much too large and valuable to just load up and take to a dealer  for evaluation. I am wondering how one would go about liquidating such a  collection. It is located in a small community in the Midwest. Frankly, I am  worried about getting ripped off, as I have no idea who can be trusted. -- T.B.  </P> <P> Answer: The first rule in a situation such as yours is: Trust no one. The  second rule is: Learn as much about coins and coin pricing as you can. Simply  stated, coins are priced on the basis of rarity and condition. Rarity is  determined by the date, mint mark and denomination of a coin. Condition is  determined subjectively, with experts often finding themselves in honest  disagreement.  </P> <P> Obviously, your hoard has some value. To determine a fair market price, you  should separate the gold from the silver and then sort the coins by  denomination and date. Prepare an inventory. Do the same with the bills and the  foreign pieces, separating them by country. After you have a pretty good idea  of what you own, use some standard pricing guides to get a very rough idea as  to what they might be worth.  </P> <P> Then, check with some dealers. You might want to show them a sampling of your  coins. Dealers will travel anywhere if they think it's worthwhile. Have an idea  as to what you want for your coins and be prepared to sell if the dealer comes  close to your estimate.  </P> <P> One of the coins could well be worth more than the rest of the 30,000 in your  collection. But there's only one way to find out. If you do your homework,  you'll be able to trust your better judgment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Canada's 15th annual gold $100 coin is commemorating the International Literacy  Year proclaimed by the U.N. General Assembly. The reverse (pictured) shows an  Inuk mother writing Inuit syllabics with her child. The inscription above the  design refers to literacy in Inukitut, the language of the Inuit. The 1990 coin  contains one-quarter ounce of fine gold alloyed with silver and is limited to a  mintage of 60,000. It is priced at $210. To order, write the Royal Canadian  Mint, Box 457, Station A, Ottawa, Ont. K1N 9H3; telephone (800) 267-1871.  </P> <P> Superior Galleries of Beverly Hills has sent out an announcement about its  auction May 27-30, just before the Long Beach Coin Show. On sale will be the  Father Flanagan's Boys Home Collection, featuring the King of Siam proof set,  owned by an investment fund. All innocent enough, except that the set,  originally graded by the Guaranty Corp. of America, has been re-graded by the  Professional Coin Grading Service. And guess what? Several coins in the set  have gone up a grade, which should make them all the more valuable. This should  add fuel to the ongoing controversy over coin grading.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin Calendar  </P> <P> Sunday: The 25th annual coin show will be presented by the Verdugo Hills Coin  Club featuring bourse tables, exhibits and door prizes. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5  p.m. at Sterling's restaurant, 8737 Fenwick Ave., Sunland. An admission  donation of 50 cents is requested.  </P></p>

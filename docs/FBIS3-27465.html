			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Dongmei (3769 0392 2734) and correspondent </F> Wang Yongping (3769 3057 1627): "Resolutely Try Major and  Appalling Cases and Actually Safeguard Social Stability"]    [Text] For now and the foreseeable future, people's courts  at all levels in the region should consciously uphold the  principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with  both hands" and actually safeguard social stability in order to  provide an effective legal guarantee for accelerating the  region's reform and opening up. This was stressed by Qian  Fenyong, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, at  the 24 January regional meeting of presidents of intermediate  people's courts.    The fundamental tasks on the judicial work of people's  courts  in 1994 are: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, people's courts should continue to deal  strict blows to criminal offenses, make greater efforts to try  major and appalling cases, particularly major economic cases,  energetically regulate the relations between different economic  sectors, actually safeguard the legitimate rights and interests  of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations, strict  enforce laws, enhance the level of judicial work, help safeguard  social stability, help strengthen administrative honesty, and  help accelerate the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure.    Qian Fenyong said in his speech: This year, reform, opening  up, and economic construction will enter a new stage of  all-round acceleration. The more reform and opening up is  deepened, the faster the economy will develop, and the more  important the endeavor of safeguarding social stability will  become. Establishing the socialist market economic structure  constitutes a large-scale readjustment of economic interests in  the whole society. Along with the increase in the dynamics of  reform, some new contradictions and problems will emerge, and  the factors affecting social stability will probably increase in  a certain period. To successfully safeguard social stability,  people's courts must successfully exploit all their functions of  dealing blows to crimes, regulating the relations between  different sectors of the economy, and protecting the legitimate  rights and interests of the people. In the course of dealing  strict blows to crimes, people's courts at all levels should  make greater efforts to try economic cases, civil cases,  administrative cases, accusations, and appeals and should  consciously apply the legal means to standardize market  behaviors, to regulate the relations between different sectors  of the economy, and to appropriately tackle all sorts of  contradictions in society. People's courts should successfully  safeguard social stability in basic and essential fields.    He said: Success or failure in the anticorruption campaign  has a direct bearing on the success or failure in building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. For now and and in the  foreseeable future, a number of lawsuits on major and appalling  economic cases are and will soon be soon brought to people's  courts for lawsuit. Successfully trying these cases and strictly  punishing a number of corrupt elements according to the law  constitutes an important sign of the in-depth launching of the  region's anticorruption campaign as well as a hot spot closely  related to the masses. People's courts at all levels must now  pay attention to trying economic cases, major and appalling ones  in particular, by regarding it as a key task. Moreover, major  and appalling cases which have strong repercussions in society  and which concern the masses must be handled and punished  resolutely, no matter what interferences arise.    Attending the meeting were Wang Xiumei, vice chairman of the  regional people's congress standing committee; Yun Bulong, vice  chairman of the region; and other pertinent leaders.</p>

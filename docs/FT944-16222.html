			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology: Branching out - Remote facilities are on the way in the US as a traditional banking alternative If bank branches are going out of fashion, you would not know it. For years, pundits have argued that advances in information technology, the falling price of home computers and an increasing willingness of people to conduct their financial dealings from home or the office would make trips to the bank a thing of the past. Yet there are 56,000 bank branches in the US, and the number is still rising at around 1,500 a year. But the future is arriving. Low- and high-tech devices - telephones and automated teller machines to screen telephones and private information networks - are combining to provide a wide range of access points to bank services. The advent of interactive television (the first wide-scale experiment is due to start in Orlando, Florida before the end of the year) will open up another potential avenue. This medium will give viewers greater control over the information being fed to them, enabling them, for instance, to request a particular movie or search a database attached to the system. It could also be adapted for real-time financial transactions, whether paying a bill or requesting account information. 'People have already been moving away from branches,' says Eugene Lockhart, head of MasterCard, the international payments group. In the US, according to a study by Lockhart last year for the Bank Administration Institute in the US, more banking transactions are being conducted outside a bank branch than in one. The study found that 31 per cent of transactions are dealt through an automated teller machine and 24 per cent are handled over a telephone. The next stage of remote banking is coming fast. Earlier this month, Citibank launched a full-scale assault on the Washington DC market with a range of services to enable customers to tap into their accounts in a number of ways. It included a full telephone service, a software programme for use on PCs and a card telephone (a telephone with a small screen and card-reader attached.) Finding better ways of getting to their customers has become the biggest single factor in US retail banks' spending on technology, according to a study by Andersen Consulting. Around Dollars 1bn (Pounds 630m) of the Dollars 2.1bn they expect to spend in the next three years will be invested in delivery channels, says Daniel Pfau, a consultant at Andersen. Of that, Dollars 270m will be spent on automated services, Dollars 176m on improving telephone-based services and Dollars 146m on home banking. Citibank's New York rival, Chase Manhattan, will launch a new home banking product of its own next month. And it is putting more resources into telephone-based services. Around a fifth of Chase's transactions take place over the telephone already, says Sue Webb, senior vice-president in Chase Manhattan's retail bank. 'It's not about one channel, or one product, being better than another,' she says. 'It's enabling customers to access you through multiple channels and multiple products.' The success of such products will depend on the quality of information available on the desktops of bank staff, whether at the end of a telephone or in a branch. Victor Menezes, in charge of consumer branch banking at Citibank in Europe and the US agrees: 'You have to make sure you have a robust customer system.' Are the banks moving in the right direction, and are they moving fast enough? That depends on three other factors. First, the future role of branches. At the moment, even banks which are investing heavily in other channels still regard branches as central to their business. Second, most senior bankers have come through the branch system, and their institutions remain dominated by branch bankers. These people contrast sharply with the product managers and technologists who increasingly dominate thinking. Bankers confess to some tensions, but claim to be dealing with them. Third, are banks falling behind the competition? The competition includes a host of other financial services companies, such as credit card companies, mutual fund groups and finance companies. Typically, these are based around a single product or group of products. By centralising sales efforts and not having branch overheads, they generally run on lower costs. 'We think the trend is going to be towards low-cost, direct (services),' says Roger Servison, head of retail marketing at Fidelity Investments, the biggest mutual funds group in the US. Fidelity already has a number of channels available to customers, including a touchphone service which allows customers to handle transactions over the telephone without talking to an operator, and a software programme already used by 40,000 account holders and gaining 2,000 more a month. Fidelity is also involved in the interactive television venture in Orlando. It plans to to plug into as many households as possible. Even if people do not use the Fidelity system to buy a Fidelity product, says Servison, they could use it to access someone else's. 'We'd like to become the financial network to the networks.' This could be worrying for the banks. After all, what use are smart, high-tech branches if your target customers are busy plugging into another system altogether?</p>

The Library of Congress issues this proposed regulation to prescribe the procedures the Library will follow when collecting a debt owed to the Federal Government via deductions from an employee's pay. It also describes the rights of current employees, former employees who owe debts to other agencies, and former employees who are currently employed by other agencies in the collection of debts owed to the Federal Government by them and sets out the procedures for collecting debts through deductions from their pay following due process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be received on or before June 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSEES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ten copies of written comments should be addressed, if sent by mail to: Library of Congress, Mail Code 1050, Washington, DC 20540.

The amount deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, except that a greater percentage may be deducted upon the written consent of the individual involved. If the individual retires or resigns, or if his employment otherwise ends, before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, deductions shall be made from subsequent payments of any nature due the individual from the agency concerned. This proposed Regulation sets out the procedures the Library of Congress will follow when collecting debts through deductions from the employee's pay following due process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of subjects in 36 CFR Part 705  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Salary Offset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing the Library of Congress proposes to promulgate a new part 705 of 36 CFR chapter 7, reading as follows:.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 705_FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 705.1&blank;Salary offset. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  5 U.S.C. and 5 CFR 550.1101. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;705.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Salary Offset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This part describes the rights of current and former staff members in the collection of debts owed to the Federal Government by them and sets out the procedures for collecting debts through deductions from their pay following due process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Debt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is an amount owed to the U.S. Government from insured or guaranteed loans, fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, penalties, damages, interest, fines and forfeitures (except those arising under the Uniform Code of Military Justice), and all other similar sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) Disposable pay, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for purposes of this part, means that part of current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or other authorized pay remaining after the deduction of any amount required by law to be withheld, such as Federal taxes, retirement, court-ordered payments, and FICA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Staff member <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refers to current and former employees who owe debts to the Library and/or other Federal Government agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification of indebtedness. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Director of Human Resources, or designee, shall notify the staff member, in writing, of the individual's indebtedness to the Library and the intention of the Library to collect this debt by deductions from the individual's pay.

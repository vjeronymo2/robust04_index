			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: TEEN SCREAMS FOR SHY NEW ORDER  </P> <P> New Order has been together for almost a decade, but the quartet from  Manchester, England, still has the same testy, sloppy edge of a disgruntled  post-punk garage band. Maybe that's part of the appeal that packed in all those  screaming techno-teens on the first of two nights at the Universal Amphitheatre  on Thursday. Or maybe it was just the striking lighting patterns or the booming  sequencer patterns that had 'em bouncing.  </P> <P> It can't be stage presence: Peter Hook, resembling a gnarly refugee from an  German S&amp;M biker club as he pulled dinosaur growls out of his low-slung  bass, was inappropriately weird, while guitarist/vocalist Bernard Albrecht's  watery little dance moves and wisp of a voice shouldn't threaten Michael  Jackson in the near future. But it's this lack of pretension, the vulnerable  way that a shy, disenfranchised Albrecht struggles to convey a message of  personal pain above the din of the disco machines in songs like "Perfect Kiss"  that makes New Order still worth a scream or two.

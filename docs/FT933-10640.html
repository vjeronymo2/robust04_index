			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The fault, dear Gaul . . .: Revival in cross-Channel prejudice The crisis in the European Monetary System raises new doubts whether the central core of the Maastricht treaty, the programme for economic and monetary union, can be implemented as prescribed. These doubts are partly technical, but only partly. The more serious question is whether Europe is emotionally ready for the idea. At a technical level, European Community finance ministers have been able to rescue the Exchange Rate Mechanism after a fashion. The widening of the bands may be sufficient to accommodate both the Bundesbank's commitment to a tight monetary policy and the rest of Europe's need for monetary relaxation. But this salvage operation leaves unresolved the problem of how, or indeed whether, the EC is to take the next steps towards monetary union. The more serious doubts are political. The monetary crisis has stirred up powerful populist emotions in member states - often nationalist and even xenophobic - so that it is quite difficult to imagine conditions in which voters would acquiesce in surrendering control over their national currencies. These reactions have been particularly acute in France. In itself, this is not surprising: on one hand, the franc has been the prime target of market pressure; on the other, the franc fort has been invested with all the symbolism of national virility in being made the central plank of economic policy by all governments, on the left and the right, for the past 10 years. If the intensity of popular interest is measured in column inches, the French carry off the prize. Last Saturday Le Monde gave the lead story and four inside pages to the monetary crisis. Yesterday Figaro gave it the lead story and nine inside pages. By contrast, yesterday's Financial Times gave it only the lead story and two inside pages. What is more surprising about some French comment has been its atavistic character, notably from some people who should know better. The former socialist foreign minister, Roland Dumas, described Sunday's settlement as a victory for les anglo-saxons who had opposed European integration from the outset. Even Raymond Barre, a former conservative prime minister and internationally known economist, has insinuated that the speculation against the franc was indirectly orchestrated by British or American authorities. Even Le Monde has sought to perpetuate the notion of a deep gulf between France and the Anglo-Saxons. According to its editorial on Saturday, the European currency crisis was a confrontation between two cultures: the continentals, committed to dirigism, and the Anglo-Saxons, viscerally attached to liberalism and free trade; and within this antithesis, there is the opposition between the French commitment to fixed exchange rates and the Anglo-Saxon belief in floating exchange rates. This contradiction is all the more poignant, in the picture painted by Le Monde, because France is isolated. It has long preached the cause of managed exchange rates, but it has great difficulty in recruiting allies for its point of view because the Germans are so ambivalent. It is a touching picture, but strangely anachronistic and unreal. French traditions, no doubt, used to be enthusiastically dirigiste, but that was some time ago. The revolutionary fact about the past 10 years has been France's comprehensive conversion to market forces: privatisation, deregulation and, above all, to the removal of exchange control. Nobody would deny the France's long-standing commitment to fixed exchange rates. But to equate it with a dirigism that has long been abandoned is simply absurd. It shows that, in moments of high stress, ancient reflexes reassert themselves, even when real conditions have changed. By the same token, the picture of the anglo-saxons as unanimously wedded to floating exchange rates is baffling. Has Le Monde forgotten that John Major was totally committed to British membership of the ERM until Black Wednesday, less than a year ago? The real fault-line is not between the French, united on dirigism, and the British, united on free trade. It runs through both countries, between the pro-Europeans and the nationalists; Norman Lamont and Philippe Seguin, Norman Tebbit and Jean-Pierre Chevenement are all on the same side.</p>

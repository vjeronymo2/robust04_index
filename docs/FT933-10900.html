			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Swimming against economic tide AMID the turmoil and confusion of the past few days, one fact emerges ever starker: politics and diplomacy can no more resist the logic of international economic forces than King Canute could turn back an incoming tide, writes Edward Balls. But the willingness of Europe's leaders to blame 'speculators' for the crisis suggests the politicians themselves have yet to take this fact on board. Yesterday's comments from Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Danish finance minister, were typical. 'The government and the central bank is in total agreement that we, under no circumstances, will let those who speculate against the crown win,' he said in a newspaper interview. 'My opinion is that we can resist the speculators indefinitely.' The EC's central bank governors are also inclined to blame the markets. 'In an environment of full freedom of capital movements,' they wrote in April, 'massive speculative exchange rate pressures may arise even in a situation when central parities are backed up by sound and stable domestic economic conditions.' But Europe's problem is not excessive speculation. The international investors are selling the French franc, the Belgian franc and the Danish krone precisely because these countries lack 'sound and stable domestic economic conditions'. France's difficulties are obvious from the charts. Germany sets the interest rate floor in the ERM. But, troubled by rising consumer price inflation, the Bundesbank is keeping its rates high. Because France's inflation rate is half that of Germany, it means painfully high real interest rates. The result is falling output, rising unemployment and popular discontent. The judgment of the markets seems now to be that the political need to prevent the collapse of the ERM will prove weaker than the economic imperative for lower interest rates. In which case, only a solution to the crisis which delivers a fall in French interest rates is likely to satisfy.</p>

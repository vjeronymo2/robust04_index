			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T seeks damages from telecom rivals THE ferocious battle for market share in America's long-distance communications business took a new legal twist yesterday when American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest long-distance group, asked a federal court to award it damages against three long-distance rivals - MCI Communications, Sprint and WilTel. It complained they had undercut AT&amp;T's rates by providing 'secret' contracts to business customers. The action stems from an appeals court ruling in Washington DC last November that all long-distance carriers must publish their prices. This reversed a ruling by the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the industry and allowed AT&amp;T's smaller rivals not to publicly file their rates. AT&amp;T said its damages claim covered 'many millions of dollars.' MCI said AT&amp;T had been stung by a 'a continuing string of losses to MCI among its largest customers,' and it dismissed as 'absurd ' the assertion that secret deals had denied customers the benefits of competition.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD price moved higher in early trading at the London bullion market yesterday in a somewhat confused response to news of heavy sales from Dutch reserves. But after being fixed at Dollars 328.20 a troy ounce in the morning the price headed back towards recent the seven-year low as central bank lending 'pushed the market back into perspective', in the words of one trader. It was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 327.65 an ounce and closed at Dollars 327.55, up 10 cents on the day. In an otherwise quiet day at the London Metal Exchange ZINC prices moved up quite sharply in relatively light trading. As traders covered earlier short sales the three months price moved up to a five-week high of Dollars 1,101 a tonne, but by the close it was a back to Dollars 1,195.75, up Dollars 21 on the day, and it lost more ground in after-hours trading. The slide in NICKEL prices continued as investment fund selling pushed the three months price down another Dollars 117.50 to Dollars Dollars 5,905 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA prices continued to edge higher amid chart-inspired buying. Compiled from Reuters</p>

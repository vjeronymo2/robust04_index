			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Coutts Consulting dividend plan thwarted by ex-chief executive A MOVE by Coutts Consulting Group, formerly DC Gardner, to reduce its share premium account in order to resume dividend payments was blocked yesterday by Mr Barry Topple, the restructured outplacement group's disgruntled former chief executive. The restructuring follows the sale last month of the banking and management training division to Euromoney Publications for Pounds 3.7m and the termination of a costly long term lease on a property in Docklands. The change would have restored reserves, paving the way for arrears of Pounds 480,000 on its 5m convertible preference shares to be paid and hastening the return of ordinary dividend payments. However, the proposed Pounds 6.65m reduction in the share premium account required the support of three quarters in nominal value of the issued convertible stock. Mr Topple, who was replaced as chief executive of DC Gardner in November, controls 70 per cent of convertible preference shares and blocked the move. Mr Topple has been in dispute with his former employer over compensation and other matters and had issued a writ against the company claiming substantial damages. The company, which had made a Pounds 150,000 provision in its accounts to cover possible compensation costs, has issued a counter suit claiming Pounds 3.4m in damages. Sir Kit McMahon, Coutts chairman, said yesterday the two sides appeared to have reached an agreement on a compensation package 'a little better' than the Pounds 150,000 during negotiations 10 days ago. However, the settlement was conditional upon Mr Topple supporting the financial restructuring and he apparently changed his mind on Friday.</p>

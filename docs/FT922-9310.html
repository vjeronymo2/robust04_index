			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 14m acquisition planned to revive Venture Plant VENTURE Plant Group, the USM-quoted plant hire company that fell into losses in 1990, is being resuscitated via the Pounds 13.7m acquisition of National Plant and Transport's materials handling division. To fund the acquisition and relieve debt, Pounds 15.5m is being raised in a placing and 1-for-1 rights issue, priced at 100p. The existing shares, suspended at 8 1/2 p on April 21, will first be consolidated on a 10-for-1 basis. Venture Plant will be renamed Barcom, as suggested by a secretary called Barbara, and will move to the main market. It will have 18.6m shares and the Meeks family, vendors of the NPT business, will control 10 per cent. Mr Dick Cameron, joint chief executive, explained that he and his partner Mr Brian Thompson had left Blackwood Hodge, the international construction equipment distributor, early last year, a few months after it was taken over by BM Group. In September, institutional investors at Venture Plant invited them to turn the company round. As a management buy-out from Tilbury in 1987, Venture Plant had increased pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.58m in the year to September 1989; it was floated in December 1988. But it lost more than Pounds 1.1m in 1989-90 and last year the pre-tax deficit grew to Pounds 5.1m. This included more than Pounds 2m provisions as the new management closed eight of the 11 depots and cut the workforce from 165 to 52. Mr Cameron said borrowings had been reduced from Pounds 8m early last year to Pounds 2m last month. After the NPT purchase, the group's pro forma net assets would be Pounds 18.5m and there would be no net debt. Mr Thompson said NPT supplied and operated the plant for handling coal at 26 collieries in Nottinghamshire and South Wales. British Coal accounted for 88 per cent of the business. Although privatisation should increase opportunities, the coal business was expected to be less than 50 per cent in three to five years' time. Other customers for the group's plant management services included electricity and construction companies. The fleet comprised 600 pieces of equipment, many of which were leased rather than owned, and the utilisation rate was 98 per cent. In the year to March 1991, the NPT division made Pounds 2.56m operating profit on turnover of Pounds 20m. Venture Plant's annualised turnover was about Pounds 3m, with profit of Pounds 250,000. Mr David Meeks, managing director of the NPT business, is joining the Barcom board. Mr John Pinckard, who is also on the boards of Bimec Industries, Avon Rubber and Hadleigh Industries, will become non-executive chairman. The share issue is underwritten by Rea Brothers and Panmure Gordon is the broker.</p>

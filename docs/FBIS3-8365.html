An American, a Frenchman and a Briton aboard the  twin-engined  CASA 212 were injured, he said, but added that the crew had not  reported being fired upon. However the Spanish defence ministry  said the aircraft had been hit in the tail and the right engine.    Earlier reports from the United Nations Protection Force in  Zagreb said that an unidentified Cessna had been fired upon over  Croatia and forced to land.</p>

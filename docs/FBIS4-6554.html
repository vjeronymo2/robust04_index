			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ("Topical Talk" feature with station editor Vu Dinh Vinh] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted on Lenin's concepts in  proletarianism and his work and devotion that resulted in the  victory of the Great Russian October Revolution and the setting  up of the first socialist state in the world] Dear comrades and  friends, in commemorating the 124th birthday of Lenin, we should  study his work and devotion to clearly understand his concepts.  This will help us to have a correct stand in the current  politico- ideological struggle. For this reason, our party has  encouraged systematic studies on achievements and failure of the  international communist and worker's movement, especially the  collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet  Union. Through these studies we will clearly understand the  real concepts of Marxism-Leninism to be able to renovate our  thought to bring the doctrine into full play, thus catching up  with developments of the era. At the same time, we will be able  to uphold the Ho Chi Minh thought and promote socialism to  formulate measures and orientations for our revolution in the  current stage.    Our party's basic lines and policies are to renovate thought  and concept while striving to oppose opportunism and revision  and overcoming conservatism and dogmatism.    It is necessary to say that we are facing numerous  difficulties in the politico-ideological struggle. As a result,  we must strive to maintain and develop all favorable conditions  to win in the struggle. The most fundamental favorable feature  of our just cause rests with Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh  thought. Although efforts are being made to study and overcome  weaknesses in socialist concepts, achievements of the renovation  process have testified to our correct application of  Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought, especially in the  current complicated changes at home and abroad.    Today, in commemorating great Lenin's birthday anniversary,  we recall a foreign scholar's expression: Amid crises, there  existed persons of genius who created historical events, such as  Lenin and Ho Chi Minh. Indeed, they have written an  unforgettable history despite changes and developments.</p>

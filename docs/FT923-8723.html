			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 21m Devon hospital rebuilding scheme The phase two redevelopment scheme, worth Pounds 21m, for Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital at Wonford has been awarded to WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION SOUTH WEST. In a 38-month project which gets underway this month, the contractor will create clinical support departments at the hospital. It is the second and largest phase of a scheme to rebuild the 450-bed hospital for the South Western Regional Health Authority, which is affected by concrete cancer. The development features five linked cruciform structures which will provide 24,000 sq metres of hospital accommodation on two and three storeys. Almost half of Wimpey's work involves the installation of complex mechanical and electrical facilities in the new departments. Overall, the hospital will house a total of eight theatres, 11 X-ray rooms, an accident and emergency unit, an intensive care unit as well as various outpatient clinics, two acute awards and catering facilities. Apart from the support services in the main hospital, Wimpey will also construct and fit out a power generation centre as well undertake the fitting out of two wards built in the first phase. Enveloping the concrete-frame scheme will be a pattern coloured brickwork. The hospital will be topped with a steel framed roof and timber rafters clad with interlocking concrete tiles. The development is planned in such a way that further phases can be added later.</p>

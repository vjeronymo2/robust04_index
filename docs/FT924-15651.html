			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Kravchuk on defensive THE increasingly assertive Ukrainian parliament last night passed a vote of no confidence in the country's communist-dominated government. The decision, opposed by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the president, is being hailed by opposition leaders as an opportunity to begin economic reforms in Ukraine. Parliament's vote by an overwhelming 295 to six came as a postscript to Wednesday's resignation of Mr Vitold Fokin, the Ukrainian prime minister. Mr Kravchuk tried to limit the damage by urging parliament to accept Mr Fokin's resignation but leave his like-minded cabinet in place. However, parliamentarians defied their president and voted to oust the entire cabinet. They gave Mr Kravchuk 10 days to select a new prime minister, and another 10 days to form a new cabinet before presenting it to parliament for ratification.</p>

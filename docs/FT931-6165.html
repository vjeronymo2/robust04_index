			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Clinton urged to step up pressure against China A New York-based human rights organisation has urged the new US administration to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on China to bring about political change. Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, said that President Bill Clinton should ensure that 'clear and verifiable human rights conditions' be attached to any renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. In a report, titled 'Economic Reform/Political Repression', Asia Watch denounced China's attempts to present a more benign face to the world, saying there was little sign of genuine political liberalisation to match economic reforms. In spite of China's 'smile offensive' thousands of pro-democracy activists remained in prison and political opposition to the Communist party was heavily repressed, the report said. Congress requires the president to decide annually whether China's human rights record warrants continuation of MFN. Mr Bush continued to approve MFN, arguing this would strengthen reform elements in China.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL MAKES SETTLEMENT WITH 10 STATES  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the embattled investment banker that agreed to  plead guilty to federal securities fraud charges, said Monday that it reached  settlements to keep operating in 10 states.  </P> <P> Drexel's agreement to plead guilty to securities crimes leaves it open to  actions by states that can now claim that the investment banker broke their  laws.  </P> <P> States can move to revoke Drexel's license and some have the authority to ask  for heavy fines, reimbursement costs and for funds to finance investor  education programs.  </P> <P> Although the firm is negotiating with a majority of states, some say they may  still revoke its license.  </P> <P> Under the agreements reached so far, Drexel has paid a total of $975,000 in  fines and penalties to keep operating. The firm hopes to reach settlements with  other states and expects that it will end up paying about $11.5 million in all.  </P> <P> However, Drexel is still not out of the woods, said Susan Bryant who heads a  committee of securities regulators that developed a draft agreement for states  to follow in their negotiations with Drexel.  </P> <P> "Three (states) have told me directly they are still contemplating revoking  Drexel's license," Bryant said. Bryant is administrator of the Oklahoma  Department of Securities.  </P> <P> Bryant would not name the states because of ongoing negotiations.  </P></p>

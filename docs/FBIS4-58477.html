			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ports and Navigation Organization [PNO] of the  Islamic Republic of Iran is to reduce docking tarriffs at  Nowshahr Port by 10 percent from 22 May to 20 March 1995 to  expand trade with Central Asian countries and to encourage  exporters. This was stated by the deputy minister of roads and  transportation and PNO head in an interview with our  correspondent yesterday. He said that Nowshahr's loading  capacity has been increased and is about 1.5 million tonnes.    Commenting on the facilities extended for the transport of  goods at Nowshahr Port, he said:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified PNO head] In 1372 [year  ending 20 March 1994] we allocated more than 3 billion rials  there to create a trade port for the imports and exports of  Central Asian countries. As our dear people know, this port is  the closest one to the capital, about 200 km away. Last year  the port was equipped with high tonnage forklifts of 60, 45, and  35 tonnes. One of the problems that this port faced was the  bridges on the Tehran-Nowshahr highway, which trucks carrying  high tonnage cargo could not pass. Also, transportation costs on  this route were double the costs of other routes. But  fortunately, with the repair and strengthening of these bridges,  they are now ready for high-tonnage trucks. This will also help  to decrease transportation costs by 50 percent. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (6): Taiwan's dreams set to come down to earth with a bump - Ambitious plans proved lofty talk Distinguishing fact from fantasy has proven to be a dubious exercise when it comes to Taiwan's ambitions to develop a domestic aerospace industry, as several prospective foreign partners have discovered to their chagrin. But following several years of lofty talk and the ignominious collapse of two deals, the government appears to be charting a more pragmatic approach to aerospace development. As a key component of a broader strategy to propel Taiwan into the ranks of the industrialised nations, the Nationalist government aimed to create a comprehensive world-class aerospace industry virtually from scratch in a matter of years - a feat which has long eluded neighbouring economic powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea. The plan was to leapfrog intermediate development stages, such as manufacturing of parts, by using the promise of cash to entice international aerospace companies to build entire aircraft in Taiwan, in the process transferring technology and managerial know-how. Also on the agenda were plans to design and build satellites. Now, those visions stand in disarray and aerospace policy is under review. Taiwan Aerospace Corp, set up in 1991 with 29 per cent of financing coming from state coffers and the remainder from the private sector, was to be the government's designated vehicle for launching a local aerospace industry. But TAC, bedevilled by troubles ranging from internecine squabbles to recalcitrant shareholders, as yet has not a single deal to its credit. A USDollars 2bn plan to take a 40 per cent stake in the passenger jet division of McDonnell Douglas, the US aircraft manufacturer, dissolved in failure in 1992. Then a 50-50 joint venture with British Aerospace to build regional jets, with start-up costs of some USDollars 400m to be borne by the Taiwan side, foundered last year amid financing difficulties and attacks from Taiwanese lawmakers. Both sides insist that the BAe deal remains on the table. 'We're still negotiating with British Aerospace and we hope we can reach a bottom line very soon,' says Mr George Liu, TAC's vice president. But observers gauge the chances of success as remote. It is unclear precisely what will emerge when the revamped aerospace strategy is unveiled later this year. Mr Jack Tang, deputy director of the cabinet-level Committee for Aviation and Space Industry Development, insists that the original direction will not change. 'We are only going to insert some new policies, and resolve some problems with the existing policy,' he says, declining to elaborate. It appears timely that planners will refocus efforts on the more plausible and less capital-intensive strategy of developing Taiwan as a regional hub for aircraft maintenance and parts manufacturing. The economics ministry's industrial development bureau is conducting a feasibility study for the plan which may be completed by the end of the year, according to Yin Chi-ming, bureau director-general. Early indications are that emphasis will shift from attempting to launch from scratch a civilian aircraft manufacturing industry to building on Taiwan's existing military aerospace capacity. In this vein, the economics and defence ministries in January decided in principle to open the military aircraft maintenance business to the private sector. As the military's own facilities are insufficient to meet current aircraft repair and maintenance needs, more sophisticated maintenance work must be done overseas at great expense. Detailed regulations governing the maintenance business are expected to be issued shortly in what is hoped will prove a boon for local machinery, electronics and aerospace-related manufacturers. Taiwan's acquisitive military currently has nearly 1,000 jet fighters and other types of aircraft, including the A-1 Ching-Kuo IDF (indigenous defence fighter), developed locally with design assistance from Lockheed, the US defence contractor. It has also contracted to buy 150 F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed, which bought the fighter division from General Dynamics, and 60 Mirage 2000-5 jets from France's Dassault Aviation. The economics ministry last month announced that Lockheed would invest Dollars 610m to set up a regional base in Taiwan for parts production and maintenance. The ministry has asked Lockheed to establish a facility for comprehensive repairs of F-16s, involving technology transfer and personnel training, in what would be the finest such centre outside the US. In addition, Lockheed and Taiwan are jointly to produce a range of technologically advanced aerospace items, according to the ministry. All told, the centre is to generate annual returns of over Dollars 1bn in maintenance services and Dollars 600m worth of products by the year 2000. According to the bureau director-general, Saab of Sweden has also decided to establish its Asia-Pacific aircraft maintenance centre in Taiwan. It will be located in the central city of Taichung, where the government plans to build a 100-hectare aerospace industrial park. The government continues to seek overseas partners jointly to build complete aircraft. Chiang Pin-kung, the economics minister, has said Taiwan is pursuing a co-operative arrangement with Indonesia's government-run PT Industrial Pesawat Tervang Nusantara to assemble medium-range passenger jets with Spain's Casa. Nevertheless, this was denied last month by the Indonesian side, while TAC's Mr Liu said there was no firm plan for such an initiative. However, the economics ministry has indicated that the TAC will no longer serve as the government's vehicle in aerospace co-operation deals; instead, the defence ministry's aerospace development centre will act in that capacity. The government's aerospace industry development programme has been fraught with personality conflicts and a political vendetta from the start. At the moment it is unclear which government agency is spearheading the effort, or the exact role played by each of the various entities involved. Inter-departmental co-ordination appears to be ad hoc at best. Taiwan's increasingly assertive opposition parties, ever suspicious of the ruling party's motives, are prepared to oppose any deal cooked up in secret by government officials requiring large sums of taxpayers' money. Such was the fate of the McDonnell Douglas deal and the BAe venture. Meanwhile, leading private industrial groups, which the government views as pivotal to realising its aims, have been less than eager to fork out cash for big-ticket endeavours which will not yield immediate returns. Thus, it is likely that Taiwan's aerospace ambitions will be scaled back to more modest and realistic proportions.</p>

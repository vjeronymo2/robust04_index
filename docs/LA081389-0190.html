			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Tecate Update -- A group of residents working to protect a rare grove of Tecate  cypress trees in the northeast corner of Orange County is closely watching the  county's efforts to find a new landfill site.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors is expected to act Wednesday on a staff recommendation  to cut the list of potential sites to three, with Gypsum Canyon among the  finalists (see Briefing, above). According to Gordon Ruser, treasurer of  Friends of the Tecate Cypress, the proposed dump could eventually, under one  plan, wipe out 200 to 300 acres of the total 1,000 acres of the trees. The  county jail proposed for Gypsum Canyon would, by contrast, affect about seven  acres of trees.  </P> <P> Connie Spenger, president of the Friends group, said the county has been  working with an outdated map of the area that does not show the full extent of  the Tecate cypress grove. She plans to deliver an updated map to the county on  Monday.  </P> <P> The isolated Orange County groves, now found in portions of Gypsum, Coal and  Fremont canyons near the Riverside Freeway, mark the northern limit of the  species' range. There are also some trees at sites in San Diego County and at  Tecate Mountain, near the Mexican border town of Tecate. The tree is classified  as rare by the California Native Plant Society and will be considered for  threatened status by the state later this month.  </P> <P> The trees also help support a variety of wildlife, including four plants that  are under consideration for federal endangered species status -- the  heart-leaved pitcher sage, dense reed-grass, Braunton's milk-vetch and  many-stemmed dudleya -- along with the coast horned lizard, also a candidate  for endangered listing.  </P> <P> Elsewhere on the Tecate front, negotiations continue for the purchase of the  so-called Coal Canyon property with $4 million provided by last year's passage  of Proposition 70, a park bond measure. The property, which comprises sections  of Gypsum, Coal and Fremont canyons, would include about half the total Tecate  cypress trees and some buffer land. Spenger said the purchase should be  completed some time early next year.  </P> <P> The sensitive property would be maintained as an ecological reserve and would  not be developed, except for some possible informational displays. Hiking and  equestrian activities would probably be allowed.  </P> <P> Events -- Oak Canyon Nature Center in Anaheim Hills focuses on birds Saturday,  with an 8 a.m. guided bird walk followed by a 10 a.m. program. "Chaparral:  Awaiting the Rains" is the title of the program planned for the nature center  for 10 a.m. on Aug. 26. For information on either event, call (714) 998-8380.  </P></p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: Alitalia cuts deficit ALITALIA, Italy's national airline, sharply reduced group net losses to L34.5bn (Dollars 27.9m) last year from L97.7bn in 1990, despite the affects of the Gulf war on load factors. The war was the main factor in a 4.6 per cent fall in international passenger traffic over the year, the company said. Overall, passenger numbers fell to 17.28m in 1991 from 18.20m the previous year. The load factor slipped to 61.3 per cent from 64.5. Alitalia's group turnover rose 7 per cent to L6,000bn last year. The company estimated that the Gulf fighting caused a L280bn loss of potential sales. At parent company level, turnover increased by 5.4 per cent to L4,700bn, while losses declined to L43.7bn from L114.2bn in 1990. Alitalia's performance was boosted by an undisclosed number of aircraft sales during the first half of last year, which improved cash flow and generated revenues of L177bn at group level. However, the company stressed it had also kept tight control on costs, with measures to improve efficiency contributing L50bn for the group. Part of the savings came through job cuts, with a fall of almost 1,100 in staff numbers at the parent company.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/6/1994 -- The third plenary  session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic  Cooperation Zone opened on Tuesday, 21 June, morning in  Bucharest with a ceremony attended by Romanian President Ion  Iliescu.    In his address President Iliescu said that just three years  after launching, the Black Sea economic cooperation was on a  developing way to become a genuine subregional organization.    "Promoting actively the principles of the Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] and of the United  Nations Charter, it is contributing to the creation of new  opportunities for integration in the Euro-Atlantic space. I  hope that the meeting in Bucharest will represent an important  step in finding and employing the community of interests favored  by the vicinity of the Black Sea," said the Romanian president.    President Iliescu expressed his confidence that once the  problems generated by the transition in the new states of the  zone are surpassed, and the problems caused by the lack of  infrastructure, institutions, and managers at micro-economic  level are solved, then the economic cooperation of the Black Sea  would manage to succeed in building a "unity in diversity" as a  basis for future economic projects able to bring a contribution  to the political and economic stability in the area, and to  ensure a climate of peace and understanding.    "This is, ultimately, our common interest in whose  realization we have not only the right, but also the duty to  engage ourselves with all our forces, with all the intellectual  ability of each of our countries," said President Iliescu.    The Romanian head of state said that in the achievement of  this goal an important role is to be plaid by diplomacy, which  gains multiple dimensions, including an important, necessary,  and useful parliamentary component.    The fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea  Economic Cooperation Zone has succeeded in such a short period  of time in creating its own structures within the economic zone  represents a contribution to the promotion of a climate of  trust, favorable to cooperation, and to the stimulation of the  governments in proving flexibility and realism, said the  Romanian president.    "In spite of the cultural and economic diversity, which  sometimes bars collaboration, the Black Sea states have solely  the chance of cooperation, are destined, in a positive manner,  of course, to develop tight cooperation. At the same time,  Europe cannot be conceived without this area, the west European  countries cannot ignore this region of big economic interest,  which is representing at the same time a very important  potential of collaboration in all fields and a bridge to other  geographic zones of high interest," said President Ion Iliescu.    "Romania has supported from the very beginning and in the  most active manner the cooperation idea between the countries  situated on the shores of the Black Sea and continues to assign  to it increased importance as a connecting factor in the  promotion of the general European cooperation, in extending the  North-South cooperation, the cooperation between the Western  world and the Middle East and, last but not least, between  Europe and Asia," said President Iliescu.    "I hope that the current meeting will represent, along with  a  valuable contribution to the consolidation of the parliamentary  component of the economic cooperation of the Black Sea, also an  important step in the promotion of a climate of understanding  and tolerance, in the achievement of a strengthened regional  stability, in preventing the conflict situations, for the  development of the region, and, last but not least, for closer  relations among our countries," said Romanian President Ion  Iliescu.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Observer: Adding up If a pair of dinosaurs had purchased a 100-million-year life annuity paying out Dollars 416.66 each month, how much dosh would their heirs have received to date? The answer is half a trillion dollars (Dollars 500bn), which is also the value of the assets Merrill Lynch now holds in custody on behalf of its clients worldwide. Celebrating this target achieved earlier in the year, the American broker has been holding an internal competition to see who could make sense of such a big number. So far, Observer's favourite calculation is the one that concludes that half a trillion is the sum the American Indians would today find in their cash management account had they invested the Dollars 24 received for the sale of Manhattan at a rate of 6.69 per cent per annum.</p>

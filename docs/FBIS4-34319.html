			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, Chile, 17 Jun (DPA) -- Today, Chilean  Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said Chile is asking the eight  Cubans who occupied the Chilean Consulate in Havana last  Wednesday to leave the mission peacefully.    The foreign minister said they have received assurances from  the Cuban Government that no reprisals will be taken against the  eight persons, including a woman and a 12-year-old child whose  parents are not in the group. Cuba reiterated to Chilean  authorities that it does not accept the forceful entry into  diplomatic missions as a form of pressure to obtain a visa to  leave the country, the foreign minister added.    Figueroa noted that Cuban President Fidel Castro and Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina assured them that once the people had  left the embassy, they could request whatever visas they wished.  Since it involves a consulate, Chile cannot grant them asylum,  rather "humanitarian refuge," Figueroa said, noting that the  topic is being discussed simultaneously with the occupiers and  the Cuban Government.    Chile and Cuba severed diplomatic relations following the 11  September 1973 military coup and resumed ties at the consular  level as of 1991.    Figueroa explained that thus far, relations between the two  nations "are adequate," and Chile is not demanding that  political changes occur on the island as a condition for the  establishment of diplomatic ties, but that it is studying the  situation. "We have never established conditions at any time,"  the foreign minister stated, adding that his Cuban colleague  Roberto Robaina will visit Chile in August. "I hope that before  he arrives, the topic (of the consulate occupants) will be  resolved," he said.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Arts: A Love Song for Ulster - Theatre If you want tickets for the most exciting new drama in London, you should telephone the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn straightaway. Since it is quite possible that it will be already sold out, the next best hope is that it will be performed elsewhere - say at the Royal National's Cottesloe Theatre, or all sorts of other venues home and abroad. A Love Song for Ulster is a trilogy by Bill Morrison about the Irish question since the creation of the border in 1922 to the present day. The three parts, The Marriage, The Son and The Daughter, can be seen separately. It is probably best to see them all on a single day - as they were premiered on Sunday, spread over eight hours with ample breaks for tea and supper. The experience comes as close to catharsis as you can expect to find in a modern play. Love Song does not stand out so much for the quality of the writing. Morrison's script would go down just as well as a six part series on television, and one hopes that some day it will. On stage it is the quality of the acting and direction, and the immediacy of the contact with the audience, that count. In Nicolas Kent's production with an all Irish cast, these come close to perfection. Some members of the audience initially thought that the first part of the trilogy, covering the period 1922-36, was too slow. Yet by halfway through the second part, which takes the action on to 1969, it is clear that the beginning is essential for an understanding of subsequent troubles. From then on I have rarely seen an audience so hooked. Morrison works in the Greek mould even down to having a kind of chorus commenting on the action, sometimes close to it, sometimes detached. He picks out one family and sticks to it over generations. A mother and her daughter, Kate, are arbitrarily separated at the time of the introduction of the border, the mother going south, the daughter staying north. The details of the plot would seem complex on paper but are straightforward enough on stage. There is rape, murder, pillage, yet also love and reconciliation. The family, continually intertwining, is a microcosm for events in Ireland. An underlying theme is male domination. In southern Ireland this comes about because of the power of the priesthood which terrifies women into submission to their husbands. In the north the men are presented as believing in male supremacy for its own sake. There are a lot of religious references in the course of which the line 'God forgives all men' takes on a new meaning. The more subtle theme, however, is that the Irish are more ready to live together than the evidence of events of events suggests. They are deterred from doing so by history, prejudice, extremists on either side and perhaps ultimately by a lack of self-confidence which goes back to the historical point: who rules Ireland? Love Song goes about as far as is possible to go without a potential libel action in placing a lot of the blame on the likes of Ian Paisley. The protestant minister played by Walter McMonagle is the contemporary villain of the piece, growing visibly better dressed while seeking more and more land for his church: he just about keeps his fingers clean while encouraging the violence. There is some mild mocking of an Irish priest and the Irish Republic is ridiculed for its policy of proclaiming its belief in Irish unity without doing much to achieve it. But anyone who says that Love Song lets off the IRA comparatively lightly would have a case. The other culpable party is the British. True, the British officer who presides over partition has become less of a dummy when he returns with the British troops in the late 1960s, but the brutalities are not spared. Some of the motivation here is questionable. Morrison suggests that the real reason for the British presence is the protection of the sea routes on behalf of Nato. When the Berlin Wall comes down, it is implied that the troops will go away as part of the defence cuts. That has not happened. Never mind the details, however. This is a play to make people talk about Ireland and the atrocities in Bosnia as well. The performances by John Keegan as a loyalist husband and Orla Brady as Kate are superb, but so are they all. Terry Mortimer combines playing the British officer with the musical direction which is an essential part of the piece. Tricycle Theatre, NW6 (071) 328 1000.

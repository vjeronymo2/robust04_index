			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Lunch for a fiver feeds southern 'skimps' Sir, The FT Lunch for a Fiver is a great idea. If lunch was 'only for wimps' in the 1980s - then lunch in the 1990s must be only for skimps] However, I do believe that there are deeper social implications to be drawn from the scheme than simply a creative way of filling empty covers after the Christmas 'festivities'. Why are more than 90 per cent of the restaurants in the 071 and 081 telephone areas? Has the great north/south barrier fallen to such an extent that we now need to subsidise our starving brothers in the south? Or is it simply a case that restaurants in the provinces have been slow to catch on to a good idea? In which case . . . southern entrepreneurs are still alive and kicking] Before angry restaurateurs write in claiming to be 'on the ball', I should point out that it is usually possible to obtain a reasonable lunch for under a fiver in most parts of Brit-ain, but . . . come on lads, free publicity is worth something] I feel that this important social issue needs to be addressed. In the meantime, I shall sweep the crumbs off my desk, having had a working lunch costing Pounds 2.50, and get on with the business] Gordon Gecko, where are you now?

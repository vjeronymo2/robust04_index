			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Astra soars 33% while sales of Losec thrive ASTRA, Sweden's leading pharmaceuticals company, yesterday announced a 33 per cent rise in its pre-tax profit for the first half of the year to SKr2.32bn (Dollars 453m) from SKr1.75bn. Sales rose by 28 per cent to SKr7.63bn from SKr5.94bn. Earnings per share grew by 34 per cent to SKr12.40 from SKr9.25. The company said it expected sales to climb by between 20 and 25 per cent during the whole of 1992 with a faster rate of increase in its profits. Astra continues to thrive with sales of Losec, its anti-peptic ulcer drug, rising by 39 per cent to SKr2.03bn from SKr1.46bn in the first half. Total sales for Losec, including those sold through licensees, rose to SKr3.3bn from SKr2.25bn. Excluding Japan, where large-scale initial sales to the wholesale trade took place during the second quarter of last year, there was a 57 per cent growth in Losec sales. Further growth in profits and sales for Losec can be expected after regulatory approval was given to the drug in Belgium, Brazil and France from July for the long-term treatment of severe ulceration and inflammation of the oesophagus as well as severe peptic ulcer disease. There was also an impressive 64 per cent jump in sales of the group's anti-inflammatory asthma agent Pulmicort to SKr898m from SKr548m while sales of its vasodilating agent Plendil increased to SKr296m from SKr154m. Cardo, the Swedish industrial holding company, announced yesterday it made a SKr115.3m profit for the first six months, almost the same as the SKr114.2m in the same period of 1991. In its forecast for 1992 the company said it was still expecting a SKr260m profit for the whole year, very similar to its performance last year. Sales improved to SKr5.41bn from SKr5.14bn.</p>

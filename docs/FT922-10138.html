			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions Warning Talbot calculated head depth wrong LAST YEAR, when an early resolution to the Gulf war led to a strong rally in the stock market, many directors took the opportunity to sell. Much the same is happening now, only this time the rally was caused by a Tory victory in the general election. Directors of Sage Group, the accounting software company, have not had to endure the problems of most company directors during the last 12 months. Earnings have doubled over the past two years, as has the dividend. Five directors sold a total of 480,000 shares at 475p, but two of those directors exercised options over the same amount of shares as had been sold, thereby replacing their holdings. Another huge sale by Trevor Hemmings of Scottish &amp; Newcastle dwarfed the other deals in our other column. Over the last two months, he has realised a total of Pounds 24.9m from his holding, but still retains an interest in just under 16m shares. Alan Cox, chief executive of ASW Holdings, the steel and wire group, bought 50,000 shares on April 8 at 117p. He bought a further 25,000 shares at 126.5p on April 14 and the shares now stand at 138p. Four directors of Scantronic, the security equipment company, bought a total of 435,000 shares at the discounted price of 40p when Automated Security's stake in the company was placed. At the same time, Thomas Buffet stepped down as chairman.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                 Sector        Shares      Value      directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbott Mead Vickers        Med        22,600         88              1 Airbreak Leisure           H&amp;L     1,000,000        600              2 Ass British Ports         Tran        40,000        123              1* Dixons                    Stor       300,000        786              1* Farnell Electronics       Elns       134,500        407              2* Gold Greenlees Tr          Med        54,000        109              1 Headline Book Publ         Med        66,800        118              2* Park Food Group           FdRe        33,000         37              1 Perkins Foods             FdMa     1,140,000      1,539              1 Pifco Holdings            Elec        10,000         35              1 Psion                     Elns        30,000         48              1 Renishaw                  OthI       800,000      2,144              2 RMC Group                 BdMa        14,000         92              1 Sage Group                Elns       480,000      2,280              5* Scot &amp; Newcastle          Brew     1,850,000      8,685              1 Smiths Industries         EngA        55,711        171              1* Vistec                    Elns       450,000         73              1 Wilson (Connolly)          C&amp;C       472,222        907              1 Wyevale Garden Ctrs       Stor       500,000        855              1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Addison Consultancy        Med       287,000         35              1 ASW                       Metl        25,000         32              1 Britannic Assurance       InsL         1,500         13              1 Dawson Internationl       Text         8,694         18              1 Quicks Group              Motr        82,781         72              3 Scantronic                Elns       435,000        174              4 Sharpe &amp; Fisher           BdMa        25,000         23              2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

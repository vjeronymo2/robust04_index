			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> CAN AZTECS SEND TOURISTS TO SHREVEPORT?  </P> <P> The Independence Bowl Selection Committee met again Monday evening in  Shreveport, La. and the Aztecs still appear to be a longshot for the game.  </P> <P> "As I told their athletic director (Fred Miller) today, there are a few teams a  lot more in contention than (San Diego State)," said Brant Goyne, president of  the Independence Bowl.  </P> <P> "Part of the reason you have a bowl game is to bring tourists to town and have  people stay in your hotels. I don't have a good feeling about (SDSU)."  </P> <P> Baylor is nearly a lock for one of the bids unless the Bears upset Texas  Saturday, which would keep them in the running for the Cotton Bowl. As for the  other bid, Louisiana Tech, South Carolina, North Carolina, Temple and Virginia  Tech all are ahead of SDSU on the committee's priority list.  </P> <P> The committee is scheduled to meet again Wednesday, at which time they hope to  narrow down the field.  </P> <P> Statistical updates after SDSU's 40-34 victory Saturday over New Mexico:  Quarerback Dan McGwire is rated third nationally in passing efficiency (153.2),  trailing Virginia's Shawn Moore and Brigham Young's Ty Detmer. Receivers  Patrick Rowe and Dennis Arey rank first and fourth in receiving yards per game.  Rowe is averaging 125.44 and Arey is at 101.33. Rowe, who has 1,129 receiving  yards this season, is currently eighth in both the SDSU and Western Athletic  Conference single-season yardage lists. He tied an Aztec record Saturday with  his seventh consecutive game with more than 100 yards receiving and is one  short of an NCAA record. SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Technology: Screwbolt to the rescue DIY enthusiasts know all about fixing shelves to a wall with plugs and screws, but the building industry normally uses products such as expanding anchors - you drill a hole, drop the anchor in and 'torque' it up. Plasterer Charles Bickford, who is also managing director of Essex-based PA Fixings, has come up with an alternative - the Excalibur Universal Screwbolt. The device can be used in timber, aerated blocks, brick, masonry, concrete and even steel plate, does not expand and requires no plugs. The screwbolt cuts its own way into a pre-drilled hole with a unique wide-spaced thread, leaving a thick band of material between the thread. With a conventional fine thread, material such as brick crumbles. PA Fixings: UK, 0702 206962.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Birds of a feather: Summer Rites - Nigel Spivey ponders grouse beaters and their place in the scheme of things ONLY A very sensitive ornithologist would want to claim that the grouse was a lovely bird. Lagopus lagopus is a gawky creation which barks when it should trill and flies with a sort of aerial stagger when it should soar. Nature, I think, patently intended this fowl of the air for the pot. Still, I confess to a frisson of pity the first time I saw one downed, somewhere up on the Banff moorlands, not far from the Glenlivet distillery. A late grouse has marvellous scarlet eyes, with black pupils that catch glints of sunlight as the bird lies blasted in tussocks of Highland ling. This is the stuff of the sporting print, the appetising table-mat, the jaunts of Jorrocks and the fields of Fielding. But I briefly mourned the unlovely bird. And I now realise why, for it is becoming increasingly hard to put a gloss of time-honoured prowess on a dead grouse in the 1990s. To begin with, the guns of today are too good. The birds have the odds against them. Humans may be known for their intelligence, but grouse are not. A double-barrelled shotgun has one barrel too many: that is what our great-grandfathers would say. But that is not the crux of one's objection to glory on the grouse moor. Put crudely, it is that the wrong sort of sportsman is bagging these birds. It would be undiplomatic, not to say ungentlemanly, to name nationalities, though when I last went beating even the unctuous head game-keeper took exception to a detachment of Italian Christian Democrat town councillors firing away at rabbits all stricken with chronic myxomatosis. The fact is that nothing says so much about the decline of British aristocracy as grouse shooting. All that is left to us natives is the state of vassalage. We can hardly afford to shoot, so give us a stick, affix an old fertiliser bag, marshall us into a line and let us earn a crust by beating the birds towards the guns of our new masters. Beaters are masochists. They take a delight in the humiliation of it all. The game-keepers run about in plus-four tweeds and hob-nailed boots, dictating strategies over portable telephones. The beaters do as instructed. A whistle sounds. The beaters obediently set off. It may be a mile before they converge - plashing through streams, beset by midges but always flapping that old fertiliser bag on a stick. Whole families of grouse peacefully grousing in the heather go spiralling up. As the beaters inexorably unite, and the glen fills with flapping bags, the guns begin to pop and blaze. Scrambling up the hillside, dodging the patter of pellets, the charitable beaters are the ones wearing Barbour jackets. Before the dogs home in on fallen birds, before the men with foreign tongues begin to congratulate themselves and their quintuple-barrelled guns, there is always the chance to express your pity for a grouse that has ceased to be: pick him up and stuff him into one of those spacious poacher's pockets a Barbour so thoughtfully provides. After a hearty morning esconced in the butts on the edge of a hill, the alien aristocrats pass round their hip-flasks, exchange a few jokes about the state of the currency markets - and wait for lunch. Lunch will certainly arrive in a Land Rover, toiling up from the local country house hotel. That vehicle will be even more certainly piloted by two gorgeous Sloanes. Cold cuts, smoked salmon, foie gras and Stilton are disembarked, and Bollinger is found to ease the nourishment down. The beaters? The beaters will be out of sight, by order of the keepers. An unkempt motley of old Etonians, Oxford graduates and peers of the realm, they have much in common: processed cheese sandwiches, Red Label tea, and a packet of Silk Cut. They bask in the sun. They know their place.</p>

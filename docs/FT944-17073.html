			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (22): Wait for the last call - Stewart Dalby gauges the views of three seasoned travellers One business traveller of my acquaintance, who is constantly on the move, likes to retail the following story. A man presents himself at the check-in desk in Los Angeles. The woman at the counter says: 'You are flying to Denver, sir?' 'Yes, I am,' comes the reply. 'And you have three pieces of baggage, is that correct?' 'Yes. But I would like one piece to go to Chicago. One piece to Miami and the third to New York.' 'Pardon? That is very irregular. I could not possibly do that.' 'Why not, you did it last week.' My acquaintance admits the story is apocryphal and says baggage going astray, at least in the US, is now rare compared with 10 years ago. But Dr David Arnold, an executive with Thorn Secure Systems, a subsidiary of Thorn EMI, adds: 'I usually try to travel with just one piece of baggage. If it is a short trip, I try to take everything I need in one bag and carry it on the aircraft with me. Mr John Flory, a 28-year-old 'information arbitrageur' with a London company, Crawfords, agrees. 'I would never take more than one piece of luggage, if I can possibly avoid it. In fact, I usually just take expensive clothes like suits and shirts and buy socks and things when I get there.' Mr David Appleby, a newspaper executive, says on the subject of baggage: 'Even on long trips I try to take everything on to the aircraft with me. You can get these airline bags which you can wheel along and then put in the overhead racks or underneath the seat. 'You can put all your essential documents and toiletries in them. Then you can take a suit bag. Put your your suits and shirts in it and hang it up on the aircraft. Most airlines allow this nowadays.' Mr Appleby also thinks it is worthwhile checking out which airlines allow the use of personal computers. Most airlines forbid mobile phones, but some allow computers. 'It can make a hell of a difference, if on a long flight, you can get a paper written.' All three business travellers believed in waiting for the last call for the aircraft before boarding a flight. As for money, there is a consensus among business travellers that the best way to travel is to take cash and use credit and charge cards as much as possible. Traveller's cheques, especially if they are not in a local currency can cost money not only because of handling fees but also in possible exchange losses. Mr Flory says: 'I change a little cash on my departure for taxis at the other end. When I am at my destination I shop around the money-changers for the best rate. I never take traveller's cheques. I use cards whenever possible.' Is he not worried about theft and muggings? 'I have never had any problems,' he replies. Dr Arnold also favours credit cards and cash. He says: 'I was in the US for a week recently. I spent Dollars 1,500. I took Dollars 150 in cash and Dollars 150 in traveller's cheques. You must have some cash. The traveller's cheques are a precaution. I usually give them back uncashed.' Mr Appleby also favours extensive use of cards, even to countries formerly in the Soviet Union. He says: 'There is not much point taking traveller's cheques to the former Soviet Union. It has to be dollars. But if you are worried about security, credit cards are the answer. 'In the former Soviet Union, the usual credit cards are accepted, in most hotels and restaurants in the main centres.' Mr Appleby makes the point that it is best to use company credit cards. He says: 'If you use your own credit cards you are in effect making a cheap loan to your company, since it is your money being used upfront. It is best to claim the money back quickly.' He feels that it is a false economy to try to save money by staying in cheap hotels. He says: 'You are travelling on business. Time is usually at a premium. You need a good laundry and dry-cleaning service. You also need a reliable front desk, which takes messages and passes them on. Usually you will need a fax and secretarial service.' Dr Arnold agrees. He says: 'I always stay in hotels where I can get work done.' Business travellers are, generally speaking, not great tourists. Dr Arnold says: 'I rarely have time to see the sights.' Nor does Mr Appleby have much time for tourism. 'But I do read up on countries before I visit them. The Rough Guides are useful. I know they are meant to be for backpackers, but I find they have the best detailed information on restaurants and other things.' The Travel Bookshop in London's Notting Hill says there is such a large selection of guide books that, with new ones appearing every year, the choice is limitless. Guide books are subject to fashion. Old favourites among business travellers such as the Fodor and Insight guides are no longer so keenly sought. A current favourite among business travellers, according to the Travel Bookshop, is the upmarket Cadogan guides. They open with practical hints and have sections on history and suggestions for walks and other attractions. Prices start at Pounds 9.95. *The Travel Bookshop is in London's Notting Hill. 13 Blenheim Crescent, London W11 2EE (Telephone 0171 229 5260.)</p>

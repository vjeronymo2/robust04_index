			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OREGON TO GARNISHEE ECCLESIA PARENTS' PAY  </P> <P> The Children's Services Division of the state of Oregon says it plans to begin  garnishment of wages of Ecclesia Athletic Assn. parents whose children remain  in state custody almost a year after the beating death of the group founder's  daughter.  </P> <P> Bart Wilson, manager of the agency's Clackamas County office, said the state  had spent more than $545,000 through July 1 to care for the 53 children taken  into protective custody after Dayna Broussard, 8, daughter of Eldridge  Broussard Jr., was slain at a group home near Sandy, east of Portland.  </P> <P> Broussard founded Ecclesia at the Watts Christian Center in Los Angeles to  provide what he called religious and athletic training for inner-city youths.  </P> <P> Forty of the 53 children have been placed in foster homes, but all remain in  state custody.  </P> <P> Wilson said the state has obtained judgments against 15 Ecclesia parents for  more than $31,000 in child support.  </P> <P> Broussard has visited his two surviving children twice since they were taken  into custody after the Oct. 13 death of their sister.  </P> <P> Four adult Ecclesia members later were convicted of first-degree manslaughter  and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Broussard was not charged in that case,  but is under federal investigation for possibly violating the civil rights of  the 53 children.  </P> <P> Authorities said Dayna Broussard died after she was beaten with plastic pipes,  rubber hoses and other devices for taking a piece of squash from another  child's plate.  </P></p>

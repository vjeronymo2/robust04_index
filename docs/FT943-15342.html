			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting losses against gains I have incurred capital losses on share dealings. The shares were bought from a joint account with my wife but are held in my name only. My wife has property which, when sold, will produce significant capital gains. It was bought solely by her with her own money although it could be transferred to joint ownership before sale. Can the losses on shares be set against the gains on property? We take it you mean that the shares belonged to you exclusively (as distinct from being held in your name as nominee for your wife and yourself, or as nominee for your wife alone). That being so, the allowable losses on the shares can only be set against gains which accrue to you (and not against gains which accrue to your wife). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT 15 (Capital gains tax: a guide for married couples). If she has not already done so, your wife should seek guidance from her solicitor on the possibility of mitigating the prospective CGT bill on her property. (We can make no further comment, in the absence of relevant data). She should ask her tax office for the free pamphlet CGT 4 (Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses): its scope is wider than the title suggests. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

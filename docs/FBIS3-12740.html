Many of the telephone lines have been  disconnected by the striking Bezeq Company employees. Many of  the problems and disconnections have been deliberately made by  the company employees, the company's director general said this  morning. The company will establish an inspection committee,  and if employees are found to be guilty of malicious action  against the telephone network, disciplinary and even judicial  measures will be taken against them.    Meanwhile, our correspondent Meron Tzur reports that there  are difficulties in dialing from inside and outside the country.  This includes, among others, facsimile and some computer  communications. Employees have returned to normal work only in  the Haifa District and the north. The company is considering  distributing back-to-work orders to the employees to ensure  vital services. It is also awaiting an answer from the  employees committee on a compromise proposal made last night.</p>

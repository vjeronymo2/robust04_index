			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Time-travel, not just a thing of the past - The Nature of Things Time-travel enthusiasts can look forward to a vintage year in 1995. Timecop, the latest movie in the genre, opens in Europe next month after a successful run in the US. And the literary world will be celebrating the centenary of H. G. Wells' The Time Machine, the inspiration of so much science fiction since its first publication in 1895. Until very recently, scientists would have dismissed the idea of two-way time-travel as too implausible to deserve serious study outside sci-fi, even as a theoretical possibility. There is no objection to one-way travel into the future. We are all moving in that direction in normal life, at a rate of one second per second; and scientists have known since Einstein formulated his special theory of relativity that we could travel faster into the future by going on a round trip into space at almost the speed of light. If we returned home after a year, we would find that several decades had passed on Earth. However the traditional view that the laws of physics forbid travel into the past is now being challenged. Some theoreticians have come up with new solutions to Einstein's relativity equations which suggest that loops in the four-dimensional structure of space-time, known as closed timelike curves (CTCs), could provide a route backwards in time. But what about the well-known paradoxes that appear to rule out time-travel? Most famous is the 'grandfather paradox': if you go back 60 years and murder your grandfather before he has any children, how could you have been born? This paradox - or its less brutal variants - would prevent any attempt to make alterations to the past. Another paradox is that time-travel could create knowledge, information or art out of nowhere. Assume that a literary historian returns to Elizabethan England, carrying the text of Hamlet, to interview Shakespeare about the play. He gets his dates wrong, arriving before the young playwright has written Hamlet - and Shakespeare seizes the opportunity to copy the time-traveller's text and claim it as his own work. Who then created the play? There is a way round such paradoxes, even in classical physics: to say that all actions must be consistent with past history. This 'consistency principle' has to over-ride the 'autonomy principle', which normally gives us the freedom to do what we want in our local environment (so long as it does not violate the laws of science) without paying attention to what is happening in space-time elsewhere in the universe. So if time-travel is possible, the traveller must lose some of his or her normal 'free will'. If you went back to shoot your young grandfather, something would prevent you doing the dirty deed; your gun might jam, you might change your mind - or your time machine might break down on the way back to the past. Likewise, some mishap would stop you showing a copy of Hamlet to Shakespeare before he had written the play. This level of determinism may seem strange, but it does not in itself rule out time-travel in the context of classical physics. Entirely different resolutions of the paradoxes are possible if you turn to quantum physics. A current favourite is the 'multiverse' or 'many worlds' view, first proposed by the late Hugh Everett at Princeton in 1957 and now championed by David Deutsch at Oxford. This view, which is much explored in contemporary fiction, holds that there is not just one universe with a single history but a huge number of parallel universes in which all possible histories happen simultaneously. Anyone who went back in time would end up in a different universe from the one he left behind. Imagine trying to enact the grandfather paradox. You leave the universe in which you have grown up and go back 60 years to another, which had been identical until the moment you arrive. In the second universe, you emerge as a previously unknown figure from your time machine and murder an unfortunate young man before he has any children. But that does not affect the first universe, where no one appears from the future to stop him having children and then grandchildren - one of whom eventually disappears in a time machine. You keep your free will but you can never create a paradox, according to the multiverse theory, because quantum physics provides enough linked universes to accommodate all the conflicting possibilities. Deutsch admits that the theory is controversial, although it is the prevailing interpretation in quantum cosmology. The fact that time-travel is theoretically possible does not mean it would ever be practical, even for a super-advanced civilisation. CTCs have emerged as theoretical solutions to Einstein's equations, as a possible path for time machines, but no one knows whether they exist somewhere or could be created artificially. If CTCs do exist on the scale that would be required for time-travel, they are probably in regions of the universe that would be extremely inhospitable for the traveller, such as the edge of a rotating black hole. And creating one would require amounts of energy that are inconceivable with any technology known today. Many physicists, including Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University, continue to maintain that time-travel is impossible. Some argue on theoretical grounds that CTCs could not exist, except perhaps on an infinitesimal scale a million-million-million-million-million times smaller than an atom. Others prefer the practical argument that no one could withstand the radiation and forces around a CTC. If our descendants many centuries in the future do find a way to travel into the past, they will face many constraints. Most important, a CTC cannot be used to go further back in time than the moment of its creation, so our descendants could not make one to travel back to 1994. They might find suitable CTCs already in existence somewhere in the universe, but these would have to be used very sparingly, since CTCs are non-renewable by nature and very limited in capacity. And if the 'many worlds' view turns out to be correct, no one who was satisfied with his present life would venture willingly into the past, because he would end up in a parallel universe - with no possibility of returning. It is safe to predict, therefore, that time-travel will never be more than a minority pursuit. We will not be bothered by time-tourists visiting us from the future.</p>

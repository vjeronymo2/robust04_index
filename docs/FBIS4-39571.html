			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Vil Mirzayanov To Be Paid 30 Million </F> Rubles In Compensation"]    [Text] The Perovskiy district court in Moscow passed a  decision yesterday under which the General Prosecutor's Office  should pay Vil Mirzayanov 20 million rubles (R) for causing  damage to his moral and physical state, and for illegal  prosecution, while the Organic Chemistry Research Institute,  where the scientist was earlier in charge of the department for  counteracting foreign intelligence services, should pay him a  further R10 million. The court rejected Vil Mirzayanov's suit  against the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] on the  grounds that the FCS -- after the Security Ministry was  abolished and primary investigation functions were transferred  to the Prosecutor's Office -- is no successor to the Security  Ministry. "This is the first case in which the court has  defended the interests of a citizen who suffered from the  state's high-handedness," said Aleksandr Asnis, the scientist's  lawyer.</p>

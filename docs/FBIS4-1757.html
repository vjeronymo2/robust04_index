			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 25 (CNS) -- According to the Beijing  Municipal Higher learning Bureau, the fervour of studying abroad  by young people in the capital is cooling down year by year  while foreign students studying in the municipality are sharply  increasing.    Last year the city approved 2,800 people with a higher  education record, to study overseas, 1063 less than in 1992 and  2031 less than in 1991 while the 44 higher learning institutions  in the capital last year registered 11,000 foreign students to  study in the capital 3,000 more than in 1992 and 7,000 more than  in 1991.    Relevant personnel held that the above two sets of figures  indicated the speeding up of reform and opening to the outside  world as well as economic development in the country where an  environment favourable for putting to good use intellectual  talents is now forming. Young people no longer need to go  abroad to study as there are many ways for them to gain training  and with the stability of society and rapid development of  education, the country has attracted a large number of foreign  students to study there with Beijing alone having 11 000 such  students from 127 countries and regions, 1,199 of them being  non-paying students on scholarships and the rest self-supporting.</p>

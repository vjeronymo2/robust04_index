			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT A NOISY NEIGHBOR  </P> <P> Regarding your story of March 27, perhaps the reason Burbank Airport is losing  money is because it is no longer a good neighbor.  </P> <P> Since last August, when the airport changed its flight pattern, residents of  Studio City, Sherman Oaks and Encino have been harassed by its flights.  </P> <P> I can see the planes from my back window. Do you know how low and loud a plane  is when you can see it? Do you know how much air pollution and noise pollution  comes from a plane that low? Do you know what it's like to have your  conversations, TV viewing and peace of mind disturbed by the noise? Do you know  what it's like not to be able to sleep in past 7 a.m. seven days a week because  the planes are buzzing your house?  </P> <P> What happens to property values when we try to sell our homes? Would you buy a  house in the flight pattern of an airport? Developers, think what you could do  with all that land Burbank Airport is on!  </P> <P> We have wonderful airports in Palmdale and LAX. We have minivans that will pick  you up at your door, drive you directly to these airports without a bit of  fuss.  </P> <P> We all live in a valley where the noise resounds. There is enough pollution and  noise on the ground. If we do not want this to continue or increase, now is the  time to do something!  </P> <P> GENNY TUBRIDY  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

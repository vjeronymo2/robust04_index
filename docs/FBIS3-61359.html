			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Text of speech delivered by President Leonid Kravchuk of </F> Ukraine at the second session of the Parliamentary Assembly of  Member States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization  held in Kiev; date not given]    [Text] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen!    I sincerely welcome you to ancient Kiev in the hospitable  land of Ukraine. I am confident that today's meeting will play  an important role in strengthening relations and promoting  greater understanding understanding among the countries of the  Black Sea region.    I am especially pleased that Ukraine was chosen as the site  of the second session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Member  States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. This  event is of truly symbolic significance to our country, because  tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the day when the Act of  Proclamation of the Independence of Ukraine was ratified by a  national referendum. Despite the shortness of the period during  which we have been building our statehood and setting our own  foreign policy course, the process by which Ukraine has gained  international recognition as an independent state and joined the  world community of nations as an equal is now virtually complete.    In July of this year, the Ukrainian Parliament approved the  "Principal Directions of Ukraine's Foreign Policy"--a document  that sets forth the fundamental national interests of our  country, the goals of our foreign policy, and the principles  underlying this policy. These principles are based on the  universally recognized norms and principles of international  law, the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and the Paris  Charter for the new Europe.    Our foreign policy is based on pursuing an open foreign  policy and a desire to cooperate with all interested states. We  are building our bilateral and multilateral relations with other  countries and international organizations on the principles of  voluntarism, mutual understanding, equality, mutual respect, and  noninterference in domestic affairs. Ukraine also adheres to the  principle of the indivisibility of international peace and  international security and believes that a threat to the  security of any one state carries with it a threat to  international security as a whole. Our country's approach in  foreign policy is "security for Ukraine through security for  all."    One of the key principles of Ukraine's foreign policy is our  desire to attain nonnuclear status in the future. Recently the  Supreme Council took a step forward in this direction, although  I am convinced that this was only the first step and that we  must return to this issue.    Our policy must be consistent and predictable. To make this  possible, apart from all else, we need the support of the  world's countries, understanding of our difficult situation, and  assistance in "clearing away the impediments" that were created  when the USSR collapsed, including those involving nuclear arms.    We emphasize: in following the path of nuclear disarmament,  Ukraine expects to receive national security guarantees from the  U.S., Russia, and other nuclear states, as well as the financial  and other assistance that we need to destroy our nuclear  weapons. These are not conditions, as some would like to portray  them, but a foundation without which the actual process of  destroying nuclear weapons may become complicated. We simply do  not have the money for this. Our economic situation is  difficult. We look upon our nuclear arms not as weapons but as  material assets and ask for compensation. I consider this to be  a normal demand.    The decision of the Supreme Council confirms that Ukraine's  policy to attain nonnuclear status remains unchanged, and all  the Supreme Council's earlier decisions on this issue remain in  force.    This is the most important thing. We have to move forward,  based on today's circumstances, focusing our attention not only  on criticism of the Supreme Council's decision, but also on  constructive actions.    This will produce profitable results and open up the way to  new steps in nuclear disarmament. I believe that this unchanging  position will enable us to find a solution that will serve the  interests of the Ukrainian people, those of the world community,  and the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons in the  world.    Esteemed guests and participants in the session!    Ukraine is interested in developing mutually advantageous  bilateral relations with other countries and in expanding her  role in regional cooperation and in the work of the United  Nations and of other international organizations of a universal  nature.    In our opinion, Ukraine's geopolitical location, the long  history and cultural traditions of her people, her rich natural  resources, and her large economic, scientific-technical, and  intellectual potential not only allow Ukraine to view a European  orientation as paramount in her foreign policy, but also to play  an important role in safeguarding Europe's political and  economic stability.    Having a deep-seated sense of herself as a European state,  Ukraine wants to move as fast as possible "to build strong  bridges" of cooperation with the countries along the entire  perimeter of her borders.    It is a universally recognized truth that the international  position of any state is judged primarily by the relations that  it enjoys with its neighbors. That is why we have taken an  unequivocal stand on this matter: we regard all of Ukraine's  neighbors as priority partners.    An important component of this approach is regional and  subregional cooperation. It is quite natural and essential in  international relations to look for points of convergence and  common interests with close neighbors, in particular with the  kind of neighbors that the countries of the Black Sea region  are. The notion of an opening to the sea as a country's "window"  in one direction or another has now become commonplace. For  Ukraine, the Black Sea serves as such an opening to the  Mediterranean region, the Near East, and North Africa, not to  mention the states of the Black Sea region.    Ukraine--and it gives me great pleasure to underscore  this--was one of the initiators of the creation of the Black Sea  Economic Cooperation Organization. The history of relations  between countries in this region is measured not in years but in  centuries. Since the earliest history of the Pontus Euxinus, or  the "Hospitable Sea" as our ancestors called the Black Sea,  there have been close and vigorous trade links and friendly  relations among the peoples living along its coasts. Of course,  there have also been difficult periods, but the wars and  conflicts always passed and were followed by periods of peaceful  cooperation.    Today, as never before, there exist exceptionally favorable  conditions for the countries of this region to develop mutually  advantageous cooperation in all spheres of interstate relations.  By coordinating our efforts towards this end, we can transform  the Black Sea region into an important area of cooperation in  the new Europe.    In today's difficult times, when crisis phenomena in the  economies of many countries are being exacerbated by domestic  political conflicts or even armed hostilities, coordinated  actions, support, and mutual assistance are especially  important. We need to keep strengthening the ties that evolved  over the centuries in the Black Sea region and developing them  on a new basis that takes into account the new historical  realities.    We are very interested in developing friendly relations and  close cooperation with the countries of the Black Sea region. It  is Ukraine's position that the realization of the plan to  transform the Black Sea into a zone of peace and multilateral  economic cooperation will in a short time create conditions  conducive to expanding mutually advantageous relations in such  areas as sea transport, the development of the fuel and energy  and the agroindustrial complexes, health care, and the  pharmaceuticals, food, and processing industries.    In our view, the progressive growth of multilateral economic  cooperation in the Black Sea region will create the most  favorable conditions for establishing a Black Sea foreign trade  and investment bank. We should make an immediate start at  further institutionalizing this cooperation, establishing  permanent commissions and working groups to resolve various  important issues.    To promote the expansion of political and economic relations  within the framework of the Istambul Declaration we need to work  out an additional contractual and legal basis for multilateral  economic cooperation aimed at fostering broad trade and economic  links, the growth of entrepreneurship and business ties at the  state level by making possible the free movement of goods and  services. The Black Sea is already a zone that is free of  nuclear weapons. The reduction of military activity by the  countries of this region could be the next positive step towards  creating a zone of peace, stability, and prosperity along the  Black Sea coast. Unfortunately, today the waves of the Black Sea  also carry human blood that is being shed along its shores.    The wider the horizons of cooperation within the framework  of  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization become--in terms  of economic relations, parliamentary contacts, cooperation in  the sphere of culture--the less tolerance there will be for the  existence of "hot spots" in this region. Our common and  paramount goal is to put an end to the terrible advance of war.    Expanding economic cooperation in the Black Sea zone is the  most effective means of strengthening trust among the countries  of the Black Sea basin. The development of commercial and  economic ties, increasing investments in the economies of  neighboring countries, establishing the most favorable possible  regimes for trade, and participating in joint economic projects  will promote increased economic interdependence among states,  thereby objectively reducing the threat of potentially new  conflicts among them involving the use of military force.    At the same time, the expansion of mutually advantageous  bilateral and multilateral economic relations is being hampered  by the fact that the Black Sea zone of economic cooperation is  still a zone of military conflicts. In those places where blood  is being shed, other, so far unresolved, problems in the  bilateral relations of a number of countries, including the  inviolability of borders, pose a potential threat to peace and  stability in the region.    Given the military hostilities that are continuing inside  some countries or between countries, as well as the tension that  remains in the relations between some neighboring states, the  growth of military activity in the Black Sea and its coastal  regions is cause for grave concern. Recognizing that economic  cooperation is not possible unless a climate of trust is  established among the member states of the Black Sea Economic  Cooperation zone and stability and security in the region are  assured, Ukraine proposes implementing the following measures to  build trust in the military and political spheres:    If this formula is accepted, the necessary details can be  worked out:    1. That provisions for holding naval exercises be worked out  with a view to reducing them, as well as reducing the number of  military vessels in peacetime, thereby helping to reduce  hostilities.    2. That a declaration on the sanctity and inviolability of  the sea borders of the countries in this basin be adopted.    3. That the countries of the Black Sea region sign a  memorandum renouncing the use of naval forces, either directly  or in other ways, against one another.    4. That the countries of the Black Sea basin adopt a  declaration committing them to refuse the use of their territory  for acts of aggression or subversion against other Black Sea  states.    The above is only an outline of our initiative. We are  prepared to join in working out the details of this proposal,  taking into account the interests of all interested states. What  is needed is joint action and collective wisdom.    [I would also like to deal with] another issue. There is an  increasingly urgent need, in my view, to concretize an  environmental policy in Black Sea cooperation. It is  exceptionally important to work out a convention on protecting  the Black Sea from pollution. This convention should cover a  wide range of issues with respect to improving the ecological  state of the Black Sea and utilizing and developing the  bioproductive potential of this body of water.    For Ukraine, with her first-hand experience of a real  ecological disaster resulting from the Chernobyl catastrophe,  the establishment of environmental safety guarantees and the  implementation of a plan to improve the quality of the  environment are "vital issues" in the full sense of the term.  The Mediterranean countries, too, have directed their efforts at  improving the environment by their recent adoption of a number  of joint measures designed to accomplish this goal. If we  consider that the Mediterranean and Black seas comprise a single  natural organism, the need for ecological cooperation becomes  obvious.    Esteemed participants in the session!    I have already stated that the ancient name for the Black  Sea  was Pontus Euxinus. But legend has it that it was also known by  another name, Pontus Axenos, which means the "Inhospitable Sea."  That was the name given it by those who came to its shores by  force and with evil intent.    I believe that productive cooperation among the peoples of  the countries of the Black Sea region is the best guarantee of  this sea always being hospitable to them.    Allow me to welcome you once again at the start of this  forum  and to wish you success.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

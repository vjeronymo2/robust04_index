			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Observer: Designer water First the long march; then the cultural revolution; now the superloo upheaval. China intends constructing 1,000 public conveniences at its most famous tourist spots by 1996, in order to staunch the flow of complaints about its equally infamous public toilets. The State Tourism Administration and the Ministry of Construction are jointly spending 30,000 yuan - about Dollars 3,487 - on each new loo. In Beijing, officials have launched a city-wide Contest of Best Lavatory Design. Apart from good lighting and ventilation, each will also have a supervisor to maintain cleanliness; the most diligent will stand the chance of winning an annual reward. 'No smells of any kind will be tolerated,' says a Chinese official. That's a relief.</p>

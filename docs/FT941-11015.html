			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Help for EU airlines European Union transport ministers meet this week in Athens to discuss plans to help European airlines, which lost a combined Dollars 2.2bn in 1992. Countries such as France and Italy are in favour of increased aid for the industry while others, including the UK, are pressing for limits to subsidies and more competition. Meanswhile, the 221 world airlines of the International Air Transport Association last week reported strong growth in air traffic but no profits last year. Passenger traffic rose 6 per cent in 1993, but the airlines still expect to report a net loss on the year. While some companies are profitable, many more have made large losses. Cut-price offers have not made up for a decline in the amount of lucrative business travel.</p>

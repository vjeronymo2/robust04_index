			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Lunar new year message to the nation by President Le Duc </F> Anh; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Dear countrymen and comrades: On the occasion of  the Vietnamese traditional new year and on behalf of the party  and state, I cordially extend my kind regards, greetings, and  best wishes to all countrymen, comrades, and combatants  throughout the country and to Vietnamese abroad. I would like  also to convey my friendly greetings to our foreign friends who  are celebrating the lunar new year in our country.    During the past few years, despite swift and complicated  changes in the international situation and despite the heavy war  consequences and prolonged U.S. embargo against us, we have  scored important achievements. Our economy has consistently  developed, our people's spiritual and material life improved,  our political situation stabilized, and our diplomatic  activities expanded. These initial achievements have enhanced  our people's confidence and enthusiasm and have won admiration  from our friends around the world. This success has once again  testified to our people's great creativity, vigorous energy to  surge forward, and profound sentiments toward our friends both  near and far.    It can be said that today we have sufficient internal  factors  to ensure firm and long-lasting political security. We also  have a firm base to maintain peace on a long-term basis and many  prerequisites to lead our nation toward a new stage -- the stage  of national industrialization and modernization.    In the years ahead, our party, state, people, and the armed  forces must strengthen their unity to enhance experiences,  uphold the spirit of national independence and sovereignty,  expand international cooperation, seriously practice diligence,  thrift, honesty, and righteousness; develop creativity, and  accelerate the renovation process. With great efforts to carry  out these tasks, we will surely be able to overcome all  difficulties and ordeals and score new, ever greater  achievements on the path of building socialism to attain the  goals of making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and  our society just and civilized, thereby step by step building  our country more beautiful and prosperous as wished by our  esteemed beloved President Ho Chi Minh.    I wish all countrymen, comrades, combatants, and families  throughout the country good health, happiness, and prosperity in  the new year.</p>

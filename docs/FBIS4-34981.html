			<p>BFN     [Text] On 27 June, TRABAJADORES newspaper published an  editorial entitled "Administration is the Art of Mutual  Cooperation for a Common Goal." If the administration is not  efficient in this aspect, there is no chance of success, even  with the proper resources, or even if there is a guaranteed  demand for the product. Cuba is different from the majority of  Latin American countries and thanks to wise, humanitarian  policies, has a population with a high educational level.  Nevertheless, for various reasons, including administrative  errors, that enormous resource is seldom fulfilled today.    The editorial adds: These causes relate to the depressed  state of our economy and the nonexistence or inadequate systemic  structures within the administration of the enterprises.  Although this does not justify administrative errors, it is true  that the improper use of human potential in our work centers is  in part due to what many call the spider web, a thick bundle of  structures, mechanisms, formulas, and outdated regulations that  deprive management of the autonomy, authority, and capacity for  decision-making.    TRABAJADORES points out, however, that many of these  administrators use this situation to evade responsibility for  the results of their work and display very little initiative.  Under today's difficult conditions, two very different attitudes  are clearly observed among administrators -- those who justify  themselves, and those who work. Those who do the justifying are  experts at inventing excuses for their management problems -- I  was not oriented, they did not comply. The economic efficiency  assemblies, among other merits, classify the groups to which the  administrators belong -- either to the group that is expert at  excuses, or to that which struggles and strives to achieve  respect within a collective that needs managers, not rehearsed  excuses.    The editorial adds: When the workers do not have water to  quench their thirst, when there are excess workers or when there  are not enough workers for the needed production, when there is  unused land that is not organized for self-sufficiency planting,  the administrator is responsible. When the by-products of the  primary production are not utilized or equipment is  underutilized, fundamentally, the boss is responsible. Attention  to man, in the broad sense of the concept, forms an essential  part of the administrative function -- the ability to reach  goals through the conscious cooperation of a collective of  workers. All our administrators should understand that attention  to man, communication with workers, and joint action does not  depend on the amount of a material incentive because the human  will is not merchandise.    The TRABAJADORES editorial adds: To win the will of the  workers, practical, systematic, and daily action is needed to  establish that the workers are the principle protagonists. They  are the ones who possess the greatest reserve of economic and  technological talent. They are the ones who can judge whether or  not administrative management serves national economic interests  and the workplace.    The editorial concludes that these analyses have come about  in the efficiency assemblies and are not meant to distance  administration from the workers, but rather, to unite them in a  joint project.</p>

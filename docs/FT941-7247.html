			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Towry Law at Pounds 565,000 after listing costs Towry Law, the chain of independent financial advisers which floated last November, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 565,000 for the six months to December 31 after meeting the Pounds 237,000 costs of listing. The comparable figure for 1992 was Pounds 42,000. Turnover rose to Pounds 10.9m, an improvement of 29 per cent over last time's Pounds 8.44m. Mr Cecil Law, chairman, said that as trading last year was 'difficult' in the first half and strong in the second six months, the increase in the current second half was unlikely to be as large. An interim dividend of 1.5p is declared from earnings of 1.9p (0.2p). The financial services industry is currently the subject of an investigation into faulty advice on pension transfers. Independent financial advisers have been among those criticised, but Towry Law said it had not advised on any transfers involving opt-outs from final salary schemes, and its involvement generally in transfers from public sector schemes was minor. Pensions advisory activities are responsible for the smallest proportion of turnover of the company's three divisions, after financial planning and insurance broking.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> East German police detained 80 protesters in Leipzig after several hundred  people tried to march through the city to demand freedom of expression and  assembly, Protestant church sources said. Demonstrators who reportedly had  gathered outside the city's Old Town Hall for the march ignored calls to  disperse, and police moved in, detaining 80. Witnesses reported use of force by  police but gave no details. The marchers apparently had planned to call for the  release of 11 human rights and peace activists. Leaflets announcing the  demonstration, and calling for freedom of assembly and expression and a free  press, were found last week in Leipzig, East Germany's second-largest city.  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Loss at Sumitomo Chemical SUMITOMO Chemical, the Japanese chemicals and aluminium producer, has fallen into loss for the six months ended June - its first since 1986 - and will not pay an interim dividend. It blamed the performance, which came on an 11 per cent fall in sales to Y285.9bn, (Dollars 2.7bn), on 'the long-lasting economic recession in Japan and the rapid yen appreciation during the period.' Exports, which represent about one-eighth of sales, were down 14 per cent. The pre-tax loss of Y2.93bn (in large measure stemming from a Y2.83bn operating loss) compares with profits of Y9.08bn before tax in the same period of 1992. Chemical volumes and product prices both declined, the company said, more than offsetting the benefit of cheaper raw materials. The loss would have been worse but for a Y4.7bn gain on the sale of securities. The net loss was Y3.35 a share, against earnings of Y3.10, almost all of which last time was absorbed in an interim dividend payout of Y3 a share. For the full year, Sumitomo Chemical expects sales of Y570bn, compared with Y624.2bn, but made no earnings forecast. It said, however, that it did not expect a material impact on the results from an explosion earlier this month at an epoxy resin plant. Moody's Japan, the credit rating agency, warned yesterday that credit risks of some of the country's chemicals companies could weaken in the coming years, for which it foreshadowed a 'dramatic restructuring' involving a 'permanent reduction in the number of players, something the industry has never experienced before.' Sumitomo Chemical's debt carries a Baa1 rating, higher than that of its peers.</p>

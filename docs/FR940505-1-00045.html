			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ventura is classified as a ``Severe'' ozone area, with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 2005 attainment deadline. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  For the period 1990&hyph;1992, the design value was .15 ppm. While this design value is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same as Sacramento's for the 1990&hyph;1992 period, Ventura had more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than twice the number of expected exceedance days (17.6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Based on a request and supporting information from the State, EPA's designation under the 1990 CAA Amendments divided the Los Angeles Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area into four distinct areas with respect to ozone designations and classifications. This action made the entire Ventura County a separate nonattainment area with a ``Severe'' classification, although the 1988&hyph;1990 design value calculated for the area would have supported a ``Serious'' classification. See 56 FR 56698, 56700, 56731 (November 6, 1991). Prior to this designation, the Ventura ozone nonattainment area included only that portion of the County south of the southern boundary of the Los Padres National Forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Transport of ozone and ozone precursors from Los Angeles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Santa Barbara, and outer continental shelf activity can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant. However, emissions from Ventura itself can result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone standard exceedances independent of transport from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. In addition, mountains bordering the Ventura urban areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to a meteorology that favors high ozone concentrations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly within the southern portions of the County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on recent urban airshed modeling analyses, EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that attainment requires 40 percent reductions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current levels of both NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and VOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. South Coast Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The South Coast area (South Coast Air Basin) includes all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Orange County and the more populated portions of Los Angeles, San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bernardino, and Riverside Counties. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  Ventura County lies to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> northwest, the Southeast Desert ``Severe'' ozone nonattainment area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (portions of San Bernardino, Riverside, Kern, and Los Angeles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Counties) is to the north and east, and the San Diego ``Severe''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone area is to the south.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a description of the boundaries of the South Coast Air Basin, see 40 C.F.R. 81.305 and 56 FR 56726&hyph;56728 (November 6, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current population of approximately 13 million is expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to grow to more than 18 million by 2010. The South Coast is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largest industrial area in the United States, with a gross domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product of $300 billion. Practically every commercial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial category is represented in the area's economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the year 2010, mobile sources will account for 46 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of VOC emissions, 81 percent of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions, and 97 percent of CO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions in the South Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The South Coast area has by far the worst ozone levels in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Country and is the only area classified as ``Extreme.'' For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period 1990&hyph;1992, the design value was .30 ppm and the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of actual exceedance days was 134.3. Ozone levels are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly high during the months of July through October, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations also occur under warm and stagnant conditions in April,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May, June, and November.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The South Coast is one of only three ``Serious'' CO areas in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Country. Its design value is 16.4 ppm for the period 1991&hyph;1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average yearly number of exceedances for those years was 38.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years, CO violations have occurred only in the months of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November, December, January, and February, and at certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring sites in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. No CO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations have been recorded in the Riverside and San Bernardino  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the South Coast area since the 1970's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These uniquely high levels of pollution are the result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> massive emissions generated within the area, combined with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially adverse meteorology and topography. A number of factors_sunshine, high temperatures, ocean breezes carrying pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the inland valleys, mountains to the north and east trapping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pollutants within the basin, and prolonged thermal inversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> layers_conspire to create ideal conditions for the generation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high ozone levels. Extreme wintertime inversions retard the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispersion of CO emissions from the 9 million motor vehicles within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area. This leads to a buildup of CO concentrations over time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly within west-central Los Angeles County. Attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires approximately a 45 percent reduction in CO emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the baseyear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. SIP Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction; Relationship of the FIP to the SIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the same time EPA is proposing federal plans for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, the responsible State and local agencies have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing and adopting their own plans and rules to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled Clean Air Act requirements. In relation to the FIPs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most important of these new SIP requirements and submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadlines are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) CO plan for the South Coast demonstrating attainment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing the provisions of section 187 of the Act_due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1992;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Ozone 15 percent rate-of-progress plans for each area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(1)_due November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15, 1993;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) ozone plans for each area demonstrating attainment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfaction of the relevant portions of section 182_due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has issued preliminary interpretations of the amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act's provisions applicable to these SIP obligations. See, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,'' [see generally 57 FR 13498  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)], and ``Guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Growth Factors, Projections, and Control Strategies for the 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans,'' (EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;93&hyph;002, March 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ultimately, EPA expects that SIP measures meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the 1990 amendments and more carefully tailored to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP areas will supplant the potentially severe measures EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelled to propose here. EPA understands that this scenario  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presents facilities with the prospect of changing compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements as the FIP is replaced by SIP measures. In the long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term, however, it will better serve the area to have in place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures which are designed by State, regional, and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities, who are best situated to minimize any disruption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the local economy and communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the discussion below, the more important completed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending SIP submittals for the State and each area are briefly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described. To the extent that the submittals satisfy, or help to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy EPA's obligations under the existing court orders, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve the SIPs and refrain from promulgating FIP provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing those aspects of the air quality problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

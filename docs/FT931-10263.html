			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / People: Avery, from Lloyds to Lloyd's Julian Avery, a solicitor with 20 years' experience in banking, has switched from one Lloyds to another in his latest career move, becoming the latest of a growing number of prominent business figures to throw in their lot with the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Avery, now 47, has been appointed executive chairman of Wellington Members' Agency, where he will lead efforts to upgrade the services the agency offers to the 600 Names whose affairs it handles. Head of European mergers and acquisitions at Lloyds merchant bank from 1990 until last year, Avery has also had a close involvement with private banking, especially in Paris where he headed Lloyds' subsidiary between 1986 and 1990. That should be an ideal blend of experience for a job in which he will need to persuade the wealthy that the time is right to join Lloyd's, as well as helping out with efforts to attract corporate capital to the Lloyd's market. Avery, like Wellington chairman Anthony Haynes who recruited him, is optimistic about prospects and has himself recently become a Name at Lloyd's. 'It is entirely appropriate for anyone who expresses confidence in the market to become a Name,' says Avery. But even if things don't go too well Avery has other experience that could come in handy. In the early 1980s he held senior management positions at Lloyds in Rio de Janeiro where he was closely involved in the Brazilian debt crisis. ***** Julian Mounter, former director general and chief executive of Television New Zealand, is to become president and chief executive of the Hong Kong-based Star TV. Star beams five channels, including the BBC's World Service Television, to 38 countries; two years after its launch, it is available in 11.5m homes. Cornish-born Mounter, 47, was a journalist on The Times for seven years and has worked for London Weekend Television and the BBC. At Television New Zealand, the old New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, Mounter pursued 'a policy of modernisation designed to succeed in a deregulated market' and was involved in everything from telecommunications to pay tv and video distribution. But last year he decided 'after 30 years of work' to take a year off and sail with his family. 'We crossed the Atlantic twice and spent time in the Caribbean,' he says. Mounter says he intends to pursue a policy of 'prudent expansion' at Star, which is owned by Hutchvision, a 50-50 joint venture between Hutchison Whampoa and a company controlled by Li Ka-shing and his family. As well as being president of Star TV, Mounter will also be chief executive of Media Assets, an independent company set up to explore programming opportunities in Asian markets. ***** The exit at the weekend of John O'Neill as executive chairman of Silvermines, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, follows the completion of the disposal of all the group's engineering activities, as part of a restructuring which leaves the group with three electrical companies in the UK and three investment properties in Ireland. O'Neill resigned 'at his request' after almost five years in the post, and is being replaced with a non-executive chairman Bob Morton, who joined the board just three months ago. Morton is a chartered accountant and is chairman of the Vistec group which supplies computer systems, software and services. He has also been chairman of the Burgess Group, Norank Systems and Hatfield Estates. He has a 6 per cent holding in Silvermines. Other board changes include the appointment of Pat Dineen as vice-chairman, and the co-option of George Russell as a non-executive director.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Insurers form group to rescue Confederation Life A group of Canadian life insurance companies has banded together to rescue financially-troubled Confederation Life, the country's fifth largest insurer. Details of the bail-out have yet to be finalised, but it is expected to involve about 10 companies which would inject CDollars 600m (USDollars 433m) into Confederation in the form of preferred shares and senior debt. Confederation had assets under management of CDollars 33bn at the end of 1993. Its operations, which include a successful UK banking and insurance arm, are relatively healthy, but its balance sheet has been weakened by heavy losses in the depressed North American real estate market. Confederations's problems are symptomatic of a shake-out taking place in the over-crowded Canadian insurance market. Two medium-sized companies have collapsed in the past year and several mergers and takeovers have been completed. Fierce competition has severely eroded underwriting margins. The Confederation rescue follows almost a year of talks between the Toronto-based company and Great-West Life Assurance, which is controlled by Montreal-based Power Corporation. Great-West Life had proposed a CDollars 225m injection as well as a substantial reduction in Confederation's operations, including the sale of its group life and health business, and the disposal of part or all of its UK operations. Mr Paul Cantor, Confederation's president, said that 'as the deal worked its way through, (Great-West) reached the conclusion that that wasn't going to be adequate.' He said that Great-West has taken a 'very conservative view' of the outlook for North American real estate, with a full recovery not expected for another decade. Great-West has also insisted on significant reserve provisions. Confederation suffered losses of CDollars 232m on its loan portfolio in 1992 and 1993. Non-performing loans totalled CDollars 800m at the end of last year. Confederation's UK arm is one of the leading providers of pooled pension products for medium-sized companies. Its team of 850 direct sales agents markets a range of unit-linked individual insurance contracts, including standard term and savings products.</p>

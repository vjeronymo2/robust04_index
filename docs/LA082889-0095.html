			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> SHOW CENTERING ON TRAVELING WANDERS OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS  </P> <P> They say we use up one-third of our lives sleeping, but when you think of all  the hours a typical Southern Californian spends creeping along the freeway in a  wheeled metal box, driving looks like the real time-gobbler. Yet for most  people, American car culture still invokes the thrills of potential danger,  sexual dalliance and delicious escapism.  </P> <P> There must be hundreds of pop songs, from the Soul Survivors' "Expressway to  Your Heart" to Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car," that use behind-the-wheel metaphors  to make their point. A whole genre of novels, beginning in 1957 with Jack  Kerouac's "On the Road," have detailed the lives of restless young people who  crisscross the country in search of new kicks, old loves or self-knowledge.  And, of course, movies wouldn't be same without romantic drives, screaming car  chases and the long-distance auto travel of unlikely couples ("Rain Man," "When  Harry Met Sally").  </P> <P> In visual art, the famous abstract crumpled car-body sculptures of John  Chamberlain come to mind, as well as Edward Kienholz's once-scandalous "Back  Seat Dodge" (a real car body with figures copulating on the back seat). But in  general, cars don't seem to matter much in contemporary art -- perhaps because  the center of the contemporary-art scene is New York, where many people don't  own a car or even a driver's license.  </P> <P> Nothing daunted, the Muckenthaler Cultural Center has come up with an exhibit  (through Sept. 3) called "The Traveling Show: Art Influenced by  Transportation." The title encompasses other types of vehicles besides cars and  the show itself wanders farther afield to deal -- too vaguely, alas -- with  pathways and the general idea of movement. But cars and the basic on-the-road  experience are the main event here.  </P> <P> There is one fine Chamberlain, "Etruscan Romance" from 1984, a bulwark of  lustrous, compressed metal components in deep red, rose, green and blue aligned  in vertical slabs. And there is also a strong and wildly varied group of other  works that deal specifically with the mystique of the automobile.  </P> <P> Carlos Almaraz's painting "Flip Over" exults in the brilliant colors of a  terrible freeway fire and the wild, ghastly freedom of a car somersaulting in  the air.  </P> <P> A mixed-media work by Mel Rubin, "Rampant Miasma," replays the view from behind  a steering wheel, with the rear-view mirror wryly reflecting a sweetened image  of the Home Sweet Home the driver left behind. In one of his atmospheric  watercolors, George James captures the blurred beauty of reflections of  taillights in a delicatessen parking lot ("Subs Made Now").  </P> <P> Steve Lapin's mixed-media painting "Karen" is a tongue-in-cheek treatment of  the sex-and-freedom side of car culture. The image is of a woman lounging by a  back-yard pool with a Cadillac half-submerged in it. "Her skirt ripped the  engine roared the car leapt . . . " reads the text incorporated in the work.  But Karen moved away after this tumultuous encounter, and the narrator decided  he was "through with love."  </P> <P> Dustin Shuler, known in these parts for his long-term interest in car imagery,  is represented by several works. The most successful of these is the slyly  sexual "Ships That Pass in the Night." Recreated on a giant scale with bamboo  and rice paper, a full-blown breastlike '50s taillight and a baroque tail fin  share a patch of wall space.  </P> <P> At first somewhat mystifying, Richard Sigmund's gray painting, "Century Park E.  and Pico, LA, CA, USA," proves to be a dryly minimal image of a swatch of the  asphalt at that Los Angeles intersection.  </P> <P> Craig Stecyk's installation "Fish Tale" is an array of hubcaps organized with  the ponderous symmetry typical of a zealous amateur collector. Deadpan  text-and-photo documentation explains that the collector (shown in typical  proud-fisherman pose with his catch) "worshiped the big fish." But, realizing  that "destiny now favored another voyager," he began stalking nocturnal streets  and parking lots looking for Plymouth Barracudas and Packards.  </P> <P> Other topical work on view includes Michael Hart's painting "On the Road" (a  flashy guy in a car that absurdly straddles two square mountains), Tom Jenkins'  fanciful painting of freeway disaster, "Alternate Route Advised," Roger Kuntz's  vintage painting "Signs" (an impressionistic view of a cluster of signs above a  moody underpass), and Robin Palanker's pastel "I-5," a soft, gray curve under a  bleached-out sky.  </P> <P> With so much zesty art based on the car-and-road theme, it is unclear why the  show veers into other areas. Such works as Karl Matson's "Wagon for Guatemala"  (superficially about transportation, but clearly begging questions of a  political nature) and Michael McMillen's painstaking construction "The  Observatory" seem radically misplaced in this show.  </P> <P> Rather than roam all over the map, stretching the "transportation" theme to the  breaking point, it would have been better to try to analyze just what artists  are saying about the impact of travel on our lives. All viewers have to go on  is a brief wall-text essay by Bonnie L. Grad, an associate professor of art  history at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. It's much too short to do  justice to the subject and wallows in generalities instead of making clear-cut,  concrete points.  </P> <P> For his part, Muckenthaler curator Norman Lloyd says his institution is unable  to fund even no-frills, Xeroxed brochures for the exhibitions, and he has only  a tiny budget for guest wall-text essays like Grad's. This is most unfortunate.  If nothing else, community art centers should be information centers, places  where people can absorb basic information about how to look at art and how it  relates to real-life issues.  </P> <P> Assembling good art and hanging it in logical ways are important ingredients of  a successful exhibit. But even the snappiest exhibit title can't replace a  thoughtful essay that places the art in a meaningful context and illuminates  the reason someone went to the considerable trouble of pulling all the pieces  together.  </P> <P>  "The Traveling Show: Art Influenced by Transportation" remains through  Saturday at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave. in  Fullerton. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 p.m.  Sunday. Admission is free. Information: (714) 738-6595.  </P> <P> </P></p>

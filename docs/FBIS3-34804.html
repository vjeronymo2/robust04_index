In a statement to the INA correspondent in Khartoum, Dr.  Ahmad Murtada Ahmad Khalil said his four-day visit to Sudan  seeks to promote constant bilateral cooperation in the field of  transportation, to discuss the exchange of expertise, and to  encourage visits by officials from both countries so they may  learn about the potential for bilateral cooperation in this  regard.    The transport and communications minister expressed Iraq's  willingness to cooperate fully and constructively with the  fraternal Sudanese, and to provide them with technical expertise  in this regard to foster strong and special ties between the two  countries -- ties that will realize the aspirations and  ambitions of their peoples -- in order to overcome difficult  circumstances and break the embargo imposed on Iraq.</p>

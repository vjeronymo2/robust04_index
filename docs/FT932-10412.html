			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: It's good to be gross - Offshore bond funds THE MAIN attraction of offshore bond funds, particularly for non-taxpayers, is that income is paid gross. This means that UK-resident non-taxpayers do not need to reclaim tax from the Inland Revenue - something they would have to do if they invested in an onshore bond fund, since these cannot pay income gross. Even resident UK citizens who are liable for tax may find offshore bond funds attractive because the tax payment can be delayed. The table lists those sterling offshore bond funds which are recognised by the Securities and Investments Board - the chief regulator for the financial services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year performance record. SIB recognition should give some comfort to investors worried by the memory of the Barlow Clowes debacle, as should the presence of many well-known industry names in the table. Figures have been taken from Finstat and show the top 10 performing SIB-recognised funds in the sterling fixed-interest sector. They are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis because some funds have a single price but add on an initial charge. Were funds to be quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage. But the effect of quoting on an offer to offer basis, is that the performance figures are better than the returns which would actually have been achieved by an investor. Initial charges can be 5-6 per cent. In addition, performance figures have been boosted by a very good market for gilts, which have risen in price in response to falls in UK interest rates. There is no guarantee that the illustrated levels of performance will continue. The highest-performing fund in the list - Barclays Sterling bond fund, with a gross yield of 8.9 per cent - has an initial charge of 3.5 per cent with an annual management fee of 0.85 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Investors who are new to the fixed interest sector should be aware that the fund with highest yield is not necessarily the best. Bond funds can achieve a high yield at the expense of declining capital. For those who want further details, information on offshore funds can be found in the Managed Funds pages at the back of the FT's first section. This table appears as part of our regular service for fixed-income investors. Next week, details of onshore sterling bond funds and the permanent interest-bearing shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Best performing 10 offshore bond funds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                           Size (Pounds m)   Yield (%)   Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays Sterling Bond              220.0         8.90       70.4 Govett GSI UK High Inc               17.9         9.10       64.4 Hill Samuel Stg Fixed                32.6         7.84       64.3 Lloydstrust Gilt                    506.4         7.63       64.1 Guinness Flight Pound Hi Yd           4.0         7.62       61.9 Gartmore Cap St Stg Bnd              21.2         6.63       61.6 Capital House Ster Bond               8.9         6.15       60.7 Eagle Star Ster Bond                  2.4         6.25       59.4 Kleinwort Benson Gilt                49.0         7.30       59.1 Henderson Horizon Fixed               6.7         7.50       58.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat. * Offer-to-offer with net income reinvested from May 1 1990 to May 1 1993.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chapters 11 or 13 of Regulatory Guides 3.62 and 3.61,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, provide guidance on acceptable quality assurance programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These chapters state that a QA program meeting the requirements of Appendix B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 10 CFR Part 50 or Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 will be accepted by NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both Parts 50 and 72 require an audit program. An NRC Branch Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Position titled ``Quality Assurance Programs for an Independent Spent Fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Storage Installation (ISFSI) 10 CFR 72,'' implements the NRC review of quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance programs submitted by applicants. NRC inspection reports are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routinely placed in the PDR except for reports containing sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. Inspection reports of NUHOMS fabrication are available in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PDR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> O.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wanted to know if any nonconformances have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been discovered in inspection reports of any fabrication of the NUHOMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canister. If so, what? How was this resolved? How has the QA program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS been reviewed? Is there a manual? How will contractors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontractors be checked?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A notice of nonconformance is documented in NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inspection Report No. 721004/93&hyph;07 dated August 23, 1993. The NRC staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted inspections in three phases at Duke Power Company, its contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) and subcontractor (Rancor, Inc.),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the QA activities with regard to the NUHOMS&hyph;24P dry spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage canisters. The NRC staff found that implementation of Duke Power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company QA Program was satisfactory, in general. However, certain NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements under Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 were not met. QA activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited in the inspection report were documentation of nonconforming materials,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts, or components; quality assurance records; control of purchased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material, equipment, and services; control of measuring and test equipment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions, procedures, and drawings; licensee inspection; and audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonconformance corrective actions were taken and documented by Duke Power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company. The NRC staff found these corrective actions acceptable and so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated in letters dated January 13, 1994, and April 4, 1994. The corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions taken and the implementation of the QA Program are reviewed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodic inspections by the NRC staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The latest version of the QA manual is ``VECTRA Technologies, Inc.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quality Assurance Manual,'' Revision 1, transmitted July 25, 1994, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects the corporation's new name and organization and includes additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to update the manual and clarify QA recordkeeping commitments. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC staff found Revision 1 acceptable and so stated in its letter dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 23, 1994. In its review, the NRC staff compared Revision 1 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VECTRA QA Manual with Revision 3, Edition 2, of the PNSI QA manual, which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC staff found acceptable by letter dated January 28, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contractors and subcontractors of cask vendors (or licensees) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to periodic QA inspections performed by the NRC staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> O.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wanted to know if there is a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem, and if there was, how it was resolved, with a material defect in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Swagelok tube fittings for NUHOMS?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC is not aware of any material defect problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Swagelok tube fittings on NUHOMS designs. There is no reliance on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Swagelok fittings as part of the confinement boundary for the NUHOMS canister.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fittings are covered by a metal plate that is welded on after the canister  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is vacuum dried. Therefore, if there is a failure in the fitting it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the responsibility of the licensee to repair or replace it so that the DSC can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be loaded properly, but its failure would not cause a public health and safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

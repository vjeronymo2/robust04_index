			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. COMEDY PREVIEW;  </P> <P> ON STAGE OR OFF, TENUTA PRACTICES JUDY-ISM ;  </P> <P> HUMOR: THE SELF-STYLED CULT GODDESS, WHO OPENS A SIX-NIGHT STAND AT THE IMPROV  TONIGHT, SAYS SHE BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO STANDARD STAND-UPS, AND SHE GOES  TO EXTREMES TO PROVE IT.  </P> <P> Some comics are soft-spoken, serious and even a bit shy offstage. But when Judy  Tenuta steps out of the spotlight, she brings her persona with her.  </P> <P> At least that was the case during a telephone interview last week from Tempe,  Ariz., as Tenuta set off on a rambling discourse in a voice that ranged from  trilling falsetto to gravelly bark. In movie terms, try Glinda, the good witch  in "The Wizard of Oz," and Linda Blair in the latter stages of possession in  "The Exorcist."  </P> <P> Tenuta, who opens a six-night stand at the Improv in Irvine tonight, points out  with something less than professional courtesy that she bears little  resemblance to the standard breed of stand-up comic: "Toads telling their  McDonald's jokes," she calls them. "You might as well watch the Weather  Channel."  </P> <P> Onstage, she is given to long Grecian robes in Day-Glo colors, with an  omnipresent accordion labeled "J U D Y" her most prominent accessory. "An  astronaut with fashion sense," is how she describes her appearance. "Buzz  Aldrin if he knew how to dress." In interview and performance, she peppers her  talk with third-person references to herself, with "giver-goddess" and "petite  flower" running neck-and-neck as her two favorite labels.  </P> <P> She mugs and moves with an abandon onstage that suggests an "I Love Lucy"  routine gone terribly wrong, stomping about with her accordion as she belts out  such ditties as "Love Slave."  </P> <P> And then there's Judy-ism, a self-styled religion wherein abuse from the  giver-goddess is the main tenet -- "An insult from me is like a blessing from  above," go the words to her set-opening song. Whereupon, she has her followers  repeat an oath that includes the line: "I promise to destroy all pigs who do  not worship Judy."  </P> <P> Tenuta's cult of fans does worship Judy, even the men -- "love pigs" and "stud  puppets" -- who take the brunt of her verbal assault. "They realize that I'm  the one true religious leader," Tenuta deadpanned during the interview. "Unless  you feel pain, you are not alive."  </P> <P> She claims (distinguishing fact from fiction with Tenuta can be a tricky) that  audience members are now coming to her to be healed -- like a guy in Phoenix  who came onstage during the current tour, seeking a cure for his gambling  addiction. Judy says he told her that he lost $9,000 in Las Vegas -- having  forgotten, in his gambler's haze, that the chips represented real money.  </P> <P> If he was looking for sympathy, he came to the wrong place. This, after all, is  the comic whose standard exit line is: "You people mean nothing to me."  </P> <P> "This guy, he looked like an eggplant with teeth," Tenuta relates. "They give  you these chips and you don't know what they are? What did he think, they were  Doritos? You crunch 'em and they make more?"  </P> <P> The biographical facts on Tenuta are hard to squeeze out from talking to her  but can be assembled secondhand: According to her press kit, she is 34, grew up  near Chicago, attended college and held a variety of jobs before taking a  course in improvisation at Second City. She has spent much of the time since on  the road, building a solid following with her . . . ah, distinctive stage  presence. She has appeared on several HBO comedy specials, cut an album and  starred in a very strange series of Pepsi commercials.  </P> <P> And where does Tenuta make her home these days?  </P> <P> "Seat 13-A of Air Turkey," she says, "because I spend so much of my time astral  projecting." Natch.  </P> <P>  Judy Tenuta performs today through Thursday at 8:30 p.m.; Friday at 8:30 and  10:30 p.m.; Saturday at 8 and 10:30 p.m. and Sunday at 8:30 p.m. at the  Improvisation, 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Admission: $10 to $15. Information:  (714) 854-5455.  </P> <P> </P></p>

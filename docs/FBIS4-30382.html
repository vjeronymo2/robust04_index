			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Letters" column] </F>   [Text] I refer to the report concerning the allegation  that the Al-Arqam movement had established a 213-man armed unit  being trained in several places, including Bangkok (New Straits  Times [NST], June 16).    I wish to inform the readers of the NST of the following:    Freedom of religion is guaranteed under our constitution.  All religions are freely propagated. There is an exceptionally  high degree of tolerance instilled in the Thai people to the  diversity of religious practice.    If there are members or supporters of a religious order who  practise their beliefs in Thailand within the law, they shall be  entitled to all due protection.    As regards the Al-Arqam movement, the embassy takes note  that  there are still differences of opinion within Malaysia and that  a dialogue between the two sides holding opposing views has been  advocated.    On this matter, the Royal Thai Government has neither the  policy nor the intention to interfere in the internal affairs of  others, especially our neighbouring countries.    With regard to the alleged training of the armed unit in  Thailand, there has been no clear evidence put forward by any  party.    We not only would like to receive such evidence but stand  ready to extend all necessary co-operation so that this issue  would become transparent, thereby preventing any  misunderstanding that may harm the cordial ties which have  happily existed between our two countries and peoples. [signed]  Suraphong Posayanon,    Ambassador, Royal Thai Embassy,    Kuala Lumpur</p>

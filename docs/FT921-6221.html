			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Royal Insurance omits dividend ROYAL INSURANCE, worst hit of the beleaguered UK insurance companies, is to omit its final dividend after reporting sharply increased losses for 1991. The group also said yesterday that it had taken steps to protect the value of its portfolio of UK equity investments in the event of a decline in stock market values. Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said: 'The key thing is we are in a recession and coming up to a general election. We simply could not afford the risk of the market going into free fall.' Mr David Barker, managing director of asset management, said: 'We are not bearish about investment prospects but if there is a significant decline it will have no negative impact on our balance sheet.' Royal bought a 'put option' last autumn covering a large part of its Pounds 400m portfolio of UK equities. Under this transaction, the option's seller, who Royal did not name, has agreed to buy the shares from Royal if the FT-SE 100 index falls below an agreed level. The group's decision to pass its dividend led to a steep fall in the price of its shares, which fell 16 per cent to 190p. Mr Gamble said Royal had anticipated a run on its stock but said Midland Bank's decision to maintain its final dividend had added to the pressure. The pre-tax losses for the year were Pounds 373m - nearly double those of 1990. The passed dividend - which had it been maintained at last year's level would have cost Pounds 96m, including advanced corporation tax - is part of measures to bolster a balance sheet battered by Pounds 220m of weather losses in 1990 and more than Pounds 300m of recession-related losses in 1991. Losses from mortgage indemnity policies - which insure lenders against any loss of value on the sale of repossessed properties - have climbed due to the difficulties of the housing market. They are expected to total more than Pounds 450m between 1991 and 1993. Royal has also reduced the amount of insurance it writes to improve its solvency margin - the yardstick measuring net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income. Total exposures have been cut by 10 per cent in the past year. Royal has also recouped Pounds 166m from the sale of its Dutch subsidiary to a European joint venture.

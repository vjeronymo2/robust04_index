			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 18 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The 20th OAS  special session closed here today with a commitment to zero in  attention on social problems in order to overcome poverty and  consolidate democracy on the continent.    Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello Macias, who presided  over the meeting, said at the session's closing that "as of  today, the OAS will tackle the social problems of our nations on  a priority basis." Tello Macias and OAS Secretary General Joao  Baena Soares considered the meeting named "Inter-American  Cooperation for Development" to be finished.    The commitment by the 34 OAS members materialized in two  documents that contain the conclusions reached following two  days of discussions between foreign ministers and  representatives at the Foreign Relations Secretariat  headquarters in Mexico City. On 18 February the delegates signed  the documents entitled "Commitment To Promote Joint Cooperation  and Overcome Poverty" and "Framework of General Policies and  Priorities of Joint Cooperation for Development."    The first document seeks primarily to strengthen democratic  institutions and contribute to maintaining peace and security in  the hemisphere as a formula for overcoming the poverty that  affects 43 percent of the population in Latin America and the  Caribbean. This document urges the "promotion of joint  cooperation for development as an OAS goal and as a suitable  tool to support ... local development efforts." The American  countries committed themselves to promote cooperation "without  seeking to impose preestablished individual models and by  valuing direct participation from the communities." The document  states that "the strengthening of national programs designed to  meet the basic needs of the population" is necessary to stem the  poverty problem, particularly regarding the most vulnerable  sectors of society.    The second document pointed out that joint cooperation for  development will support efforts br OAS states to achieve full  and sustainable growth. Specifically, the delegates will seek to  contribute to the eradication of poverty from the continent to  strengthen the commitment and the consolidation of democracy in  the area and its institutions.    The document is comprised of a framework of priorities for  the OAS and the Inter-American Council for Integrated  Development (CIDI). Those priorities include the improvement of  nutrition and health levels, attention to population issues such  as family planning, support for education, promotion of  productive employment, and support for the fight against drugs.    The delegates agreed that in order to support the poor  sectors "other actions are required (such as) insuring larger  and more efficient social expenditures in accordance with the  priorities and criteria established in each country." They added  that the OAS will welcome regional projects that respond to  multinational initiatives and that facilitate the participation  of public and private organizations.    The OAS offered to give special attention to countries that  "have faced serious situations of armed violence and that are  rebuilding their economies."    The foreign ministers and officials in charge of development  programs who attended the meeting agreed to share their  experiences as well as "to promote technology exchange, the  broadening of markets, and the mobilization of resources." In  order to achieve these goals, a coordination mechanism between  the OAS cooperation institutions and the CIDI will be examined.  This mechanism will come into force with the Managua Protocol.    The Managua Protocol was approved by the OAS General  Assembly  in June 1993, although it has only been ratified by Canada and  Mexico, which ratified it today. That commitment establishes,  among other points, Inter-American cooperation for development  as the tool to anticipate crisis and strengthen democracy in the  area.    The delegates also agreed to promote the immediate  ratification of the Washington Protocol, which includes the  eradication of poverty as a primary goal of integrated  development. They reiterated that: "The goals and principles in  the OAS Charter, namely the ideals of peace, democracy, respect  for human rights, social justice, solidarity, and integrated  development, constitute the basis of this organization."</p>

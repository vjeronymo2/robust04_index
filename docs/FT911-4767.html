			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / US copes with rail strike, but a day could make the difference: Industry is holding its breath US INDUSTRY was hoping yesterday that Washington would intervene quickly to halt a national rail strike that threatened to disrupt the economy. The American Association of Railroads said the stoppage, which began yesterday morning, was affecting freight traffic across the entire country, with picketing widespread. The association said it was not aware of any freight carrier which was trying to operate, although Amtrak passenger traffic in the north-east seemed to be flowing normally. The Illinois Central Railroad said: 'If it drags on, some customers that are dependent on rail transportation will have some real problems. They won't be able to get product out of their plants.' Mr Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said 70 to 80 per cent of motor manufacturing plants would be affected within 24 hours. All sites could be closed by tomorrow. Chrysler has warned about 'massive closures' in the industry if the strike were to drag on, but said yesterday morning it had made no immediate changes at its plants. It warned, though, that the position 'could change in a day'. USX, the steel and natural resources group, also suggested that there was unlikely to be any impact from the first day of the strike. It declined to say when the halt in railroad traffic might start to bite, but steel companies generally will probably be affected in a matter of days rather than weeks. USX said it had 'done what it could' by stockpiling raw materials before the stoppage, and by lining up alternative means of transport. The coal industry is also hoping for a short strike. Most US coal production is shipped by rail but, with winter over, the seasonal peak has past. Industries including chemicals, ore, and lumber, as well as second-, third- and fourth-class mail, also face slowdowns or outright stoppages if the strike is prolonged. The US Postal Service said it stopped sending mail via rail last weekend and planned to use trucks until the strike was settled. Minneapolis-based Cargill, one of the largest American grain companies, said it was working closely with customers to manage supplies and was operating its businesses by using alternative transport, stockpiled materials and additional storage facilities. Grain elevators, most of which use railways for shipping, are also being affected. There was no immediate impact on prices for grains and livestock on the Chicago futures markets yesterday. Livestock moves largely by truck and this is not the critical harvest time in the US grain season. In any case, traders do not believe the government will allow the strike to continue more than a few days. Chicago area companies that depend on rail shipments for supplies would be safe for the moment from the strike, if they have built up stocks. RR Donnelley, one of the largest US printing and publishing houses, for example, says that it is using stocks and increasing these by truck. Trucking companies reported rising business as a result of the strike, but played down notions of massive additional demand. 'It's been a trickle effect,' said Arkansas-based JB Hunt. 'It started slowly yesterday, and all our capacity is now fully utilised.' Ryder System, another big trucking group, painted a similar picture. 'Huge would be too strong a word for the upsurge,' it said. 'We have seen quite a few requests in the past week,' mainly from companies which had 'extremely time-sensitive requirements'. In Chicago, the biggest worry was commuter transport. However, some 75,000 Chicago-area commuters were virtually unaffected yesterday morning after a court order late on Tuesday had required the Chicago and Northwestern Transportation Company, one of the largest commuter lines, to continue operations. The case was brought by Metra, the Chicago-area commuter agency which contracts the railways. The order is to last 10 days. Railway companies had turned down union offers to keep operating the commuter lines, saying they would close all operations because of fears of vandalism and passenger safety. Mr Jeffrey Ladd, Metra chairman, said C&amp;NW was trying to inconvenience commuters so as to press Congress into legislating a solution unfavourable to the unions. He accused the company of a 'lack of corporate citizenship'. Incoming car traffic to Chicago, was normal. Service on Amtrak between Chicago and other key mid-western cities such as Milwaukee and Minneapolis was expected to be disrupted.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US: COMMODITIES CARRIED BY RAIL (1990)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Commodity                              % of total carloads Coal                                                  38.4 Chemicals                                              8.4 Grain                                                  8.3 Metallic ores                                          5.2 Motor vehicles and equipment                           4.9 Crushed stones, sand, gravel                           4.4 Others                                                30.4 TOTAL CARLOADS                           17,415,507 (100%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Association of American Railroads  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

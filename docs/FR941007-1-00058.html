			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the agencies would evaluate the extent to which an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution provides community development services and the innovativeness and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsiveness of such services, given the needs of the institution's community and the capacity and constraints of the institution. The revised proposal defines community development services as services that primarily benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, businesses or farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million, or businesses or farms that qualify as small businesses under a Small Business Administration program and that address affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) or other community economic development needs that are not being met by the private market. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Examples of community development services would include, among other things: providing technical expertise for not-for-profit organizations serving low- and moderate-income housing needs and/or economic growth and development, lending executives to organizations facilitating affordable housing construction and rehabilitation and/or development of affordable housing; providing credit counseling, home buyers counseling, home maintenance counseling, and/or financial planning to promote community economic development and affordable housing, school savings programs, and other financial services education; and offering lifeline deposit services, low-cost or free government check cashing, or participating in an electronic benefit transfer network. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Community Development Test for Wholesale or Limited Purpose Institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the December proposal, wholesale or limited purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions were defined as insured depository institutions that are in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business of extending credit to the public but do not make a significant amount of reportable loans ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> home mortgage, consumer, small farm and small business loans). These would have included institutions that make primarily large commercial loans, as well as credit card banks, and similar institutions. The December proposal would have required an evaluation of the CRA performance of these institutions primarily under the proposed investment test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance under that test would have been measured based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of an institution's assets devoted to qualified investments as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to its risk-based capital. Qualified investments would have consisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of lawful investments that benefited low- and moderate-income geographies or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals in an institution's service area, including investments that supported local affordable housing and community, economic, or small business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development. Eligible grants and loans that would have constituted a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment also would have been included within the investment test. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigning the overall rating for wholesale or limited purpose institutions, the institution's investment test rating could have been increased one level for outstanding performance and decreased one level for a ``substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance'' rating on the service test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the comments received, the revised proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace the investment test with the community development test as the primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. A number of commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered the investment test too narrowly focused to use as a tool for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing the CRA performance of wholesale or limited purpose institutions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested replacing the test with a test that focused on community development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities more generally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The community development test in the revised proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focus on a wholesale or limited purpose institution's record in helping to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the credit needs of its service area through qualified investments, community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development lending, and community development services. In general, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community development-related activities would be similar to the community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development aspects of the lending and service tests, and would adopt the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of qualified investments used in the investment test in the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. The community development test also would consider small business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and small farm loans as well as loans to low- and moderate-income individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and geographies as community development loans, whether or not reported or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected under the data collection requirements of the revised proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters believed the December proposal's definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of wholesale or limited purpose institutions did not clearly distinguish between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these types of institutions and retail institutions. Some commenters also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that these institutions be permitted to conduct a certain amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidental retail lending without losing their wholesale or limited purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution status. Several comments suggested that an institution should have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the opportunity to confirm its status as a wholesale or limited purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution with the agencies in advance of being examined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

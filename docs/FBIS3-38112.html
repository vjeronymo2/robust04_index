Yesterday, CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party] Defense  Minister Leo Delcroix presented his mid-term assessment,  commenting in passing on his plans for the current year. "This  will be the year when things really happen," he anticipated.  "The year during which the decisions on restructuring will be  implemented on the ground." Here Delcroix was referring to the  continuation of the Army reform process to which the government  gave a "green light" in January 1993. On the ground, this will  primarily entail repatriation from Germany of all units deployed  east of the Rhine (13,000 soldiers, including 3,200  professionals); in 1994, explained Minister Delcroix, no more  than 18,000 Belgians would remain in Germany, as against 48,000  in 1990. These movements have major socioeconomic implications.  Initially, the Defense Ministry had decided to build 250 homes,  at little cost (because they would in many cases be located on  military sites -- L'ECHO editor's note). Assuredly this number  will be insufficient.    As for the subject of personnel problems -- an item which  "eats up" 60 percent of the ministry's annual department -- the  former national secretary of the CVP has promised to pay special  attention to this. Being henceforth constrained to "follow" the  labor market with a view to lowering the average age of  officers, the Army will also adopt a policy of outplacement in  order to avoid "difficult situations" as far as possible.  Finally, 1994 will mark the arrival of the first short-term  volunteers, while the government has also just come out in favor  of employing military personnel outside the Army.  <H5>  A Budget To Be Earned </H5>   The speech by the successor of...Guy Coeme displays the  desire to manage a compressed budget as best he can. "The Army  must earn its budget," said Delcroix. Remember, one of the  first measures taken by the Dehaene government in the spring of  1992, was to decree a freeze in nominal terms of the national  defense budget for the entire period covered by the convergence  plan. In a nutshell, this means that the "envelope" would  remain at its ceiling of 98 billion Belgian francs [BFr] until  1997, which implies a progressive reduction in real terms (due  to inflation -- L'ECHO editor's note).    In order to gain freedom of movement within this tight  "corset," Leo Delcroix is expecting to make plenty of money from  the sale of military equipment and buildings, which began in  1993 and should give him some breathing space. Over the period  in which the Army will be restructured, i.e. until 1997, a total  amount of BFr3.6 billion had been budgeted as profit from such  sales. "However, it may turn out to be more," is the message  being whispered in the Ministry of Defense.    Nonetheless, until now, the balance from these sales  transactions is hardly brilliant, and is not yet giving cause  for optimism. In terms of "light equipment," since last May  public sales, which take place every two months in  Neder-over-Heembeek, have yielded BFr250 million. However, for  "heavy equipment," where the purchasers are nations, the balance  is zero. The sales procedure (especially regarding aircraft) is  long and tedious, requiring approval by the foreign minister  and, possibly, by his colleague, the minister for economic  affairs...or by the manufacturer. The most problematic  transaction, it would seem, concerns "surplus" (more than 80)  F-16's, which are in direct competition with the armada of 600  similar machines that the United States is looking to sell (and  where the U.S. manufacturer has a right of inspection of sales  by our country! -- L'ECHO editor's note).    Nonetheless, some dossiers, it is claimed, have progressed,  and the first effects of this should make themselves felt in the  very near future (the three minehunters and 60 Mirage fighters  are apparently arousing some interest).    Finally there remains the profit from sales of military  sites. Those whose reallocation does not pose a problem, brought  in a mere BFr15 million in 1993. However, the serious business  should get off the ground this year. In order to be able to  sell the buildings in question, and above all to gain price  estimates, the regions have been asked to launch the procedure  which would allocate these sites a specific function, depending  on their sectoral plans. Details are expected to trickle in  over the next few months.  <H5>  The Shadow of Guy Coeme </H5>   These sales of equipment and sites are important...for they  will determine the government's policy on purchases. Last July,  the government approved the "medium-term investment plan" (PMT)  proposed by its Ministry of Defense. This plan fixes the limit  on purchases that can be made over the years to come with a view  to modernizing the Army. As Minister Delcroix pointed out, the  main priorities of the PMT are modernization of the 48 F-16's  (that are being retained), purchase of 250 trucks for the Army,  and construction of four minesweepers for the Navy.    A second list of lower priority investments in  infrastructure  is subject to certain conditions. Its consideration and the  effective realization of the "urgent" list depend on the  budgetary resources and, consequently, on the result of the  sales. [passage omitted]</p>

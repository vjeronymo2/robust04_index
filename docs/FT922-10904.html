			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK attacked over HK constitution BRITAIN was yesterday criticised for failing to allow the people of Hong Kong to exercise self-determination and was urged to introduce full democracy into the colony before it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. A report by the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) expresses serious doubts about protection offered to Hong Kong's judiciary, its legislature and people by the Basic Law, the colony's post-1997 constitution, promulgated by the Chinese government in April 1990. The report strongly criticises Britain for not offering Hong Kong's people the right of self-determination in the form of a referendum over the terms of the Joint Declaration. In the absence of this the report says Britain should offer 3.2m holders of locally-issued British passports the right of UK abode. Robert Rice, Legal Correspondent, adds: Sir William Goodhart, the British QC, who with jurists from Australia, Malaysia and Germany visited Hong Kongfor the ICJ, said:  'The agreement was signed before the brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989. The big question is will the Chinese government allow the people of Hong Kong to exercise the rights and freedoms which it has denied so far to its own citizens?' Countdown to 1997. ICJ, PO Box 145, CH-1224 Chene-Bougeries, Geneva, Switzerland</p>

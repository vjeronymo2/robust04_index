			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Architecture: How to commission a good new building - Colin Amery describes what makes an FT Award winner Good architecture is fundamental to good business. This simple fact ought to be obvious, but it is still one of the more difficult tasks in life convincing the directors of a company that spending money on a good building will have benefits that are economically significant. To put it at its most stark: how can you quantify the benefits of employing a well-qualified architect? For nearly 30 years this newspaper has campaigned through its architecture award for a higher standard of design in the workplace, and that campaign has been successful. When the Financial Times Industrial Architecture Award began, it had a specific task in the post-war world - to move industry out of the satanic mills and into the white light of the second half of the 20th century. As the years have passed and we approach the millennium, the possibilities for architecture and for the world of work have changed completely. The Financial Times Architecture Award, for which applications are now invited, has become more broadly based, and is looking for the highest quality of architecture in a major new building. Recent years have shown that buildings as different as airports and libraries can win the FT award. The judges are looking for those qualities which make a work of architecture both distinguished and practical. There is not as much mystery about the award's criteria as some architects like to think. The jury is looking beyond style to lasting qualities of elegance and efficiency. Although the jury includes two distinguished architects, there is always a third and important member who is a layman. He is not exactly the man in the street, but he is a prominent businessman with the practical knowledge of commissioning buildings. As I have seen over the years, the layman plays an essential role in helping penetrate the arcane world of architectural fashion and discovering how practical and efficient a new building is. It may not be realised quite how the FT award works. Applications are sought not only from architects but from the commissioners of buildings and those who use them. Owners of new buildings, the contractors who have built them, engineers and surveyors can all nominate a building as a candidate for the award. What is taken especially seriously is an entry from a daily user of the premises. When the jury visits a building - unlike some awards, which are often judged purely from glamorous photographs, the FT jury visits every short-listed entry - the building's architect is not allowed to be present. The jury gets the whole story from the client and the users. It is not an uncommon sight to see the lay-judge lagging behind the chairman of the company's party, having a heart-to-heart chat with an employee who had problems with the office lighting, or is complaining about a lack of privacy, or about the building's hierarchical arrangements. This year, with the easing of the recession, we expect a strong entry of buildings that have been finished since August 1993. But with the cooling of the building boom of the last few years, I have suggested a certain flexibility in the time-frame for entries: some may have been completed for a little more than the last two years. The 1993 competition showed clearly the widening of the award and also the interesting problem facing the judges in finding real architectural originality and quality, while ensuring that the building worked. The winner was the Queen's Stand at Epsom racecourse, designed by Richard Horden. It is very much a place of work, and the judges were as interested in the quarters for the jockeys as they were in the architectural tour de force of the public areas. An important consideration was the relationship of the new stand to the glorious landscape of the Epsom Downs. In this regard the building scored very well, proving that a bold statement can complement a naturally beautiful location. The range of last year's commended schemes was also impressive, showing that there is a lot of good new architecture in Britain if you take the trouble to find it. The new airport at Stansted ran the winner very closely. Indeed, the work of Sir Norman Foster was included twice last year, both at Stansted and at his elegant and economical library at Cranfield management college. This marvellous small building showed that the employment of a distinguished leader of the architectural profession need not cost the client an arm and a leg, for the library was built within the tightest of educational budgets. The refurbishment of buildings also qualifies for the award, and Michael Hopkins' work on the old Bracken House, near St Paul's Cathedral - once the home of the FT and now of a Japanese bank - demonstrated how amazing new life can be brought to older office buildings. Entry forms for this year's award are available from the Corporate Communications Department, Financial Times, Number One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL. The closing date is the end of December. Judging takes place next spring.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ignores further falls in bond yields Wall Street US SHARE prices ended mostly flat to lower yesterday, in spite of further declines in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.15 down at 3,645.10. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.41 to 463.15, while the American SE composite edged up 0.37 to 458.97. Once again the Nasdaq composite outperformed other indices, rising 3.31 to a record 746.15. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 246.6m shares. Trading remained directionless for the third straight day, with dealers blaming the subdued mood on an unwillingness among investors to become involved ahead of the long holiday weekend, although some were reported to be readjusting their portfolios for the start of the new month. Falls in foreign markets, and early declines in bond prices, set the tone for a downbeat opening. The day's economic news also failed to lift sentiment - the National Association of Purchasing Management's August report showed that manufacturing activity stalled last month. Analysts were particularly worried by the decline in the NAPM's employment index, which led some to revise downwards their expectations for August payrolls, which will be unveiled in tomorrow's monthly employment report. The day's other economic news - in July personal income fell 0.2 per cent, personal spending rose 0.4 per cent and construction spending declined 0.5 per cent - provided contradictory evidence of the state of the economy, and was largely ignored. Although bond prices rallied later in the day, sending yields to new record lows, equities did not react, and remained trapped in a narrow trading range just below opening values. Honeywell dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 35 1/2 in volume of 1.5m shares and Litton Industries put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 67 as investors reacted to Tuesday's late news that a California jury had ordered Honeywell to pay Dollars 1.2bn to Litton for patent violation. Honeywell later said it would appeal. AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 on reports that it was considering spinning off three of its divisions into separate companies. The stock later succumbed to selling, however, and ended down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 66 3/4 . On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were mixed. Microsoft advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 76 3/4 and Sun Microsystems added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 27 1/8 , but Apple declined Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 26. Internet Communications forged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 6 5/8 after announcing a big improvement in second-quarter earnings. Canada THE Toronto market opened lower but gradually improved through the day to close with a small gain. The TSE 300 index was finally 6.2 up at 4,143.7 as rises led falls by 372 to 348. Volume came to 51.2m shares. Most of the sub-groups showed little movement, with seven higher and seven lower. Federal Industries said it will sell 7m 'A' shares at CDollars 6.65 a share to underwriters. The underwriters have an option for a further 700,000 shares at the same price. The 'A' stock slipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 6 7/8.</p>

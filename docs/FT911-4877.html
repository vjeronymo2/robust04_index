			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Hungary's stability may prove precarious: The apparent political calm will be tested to the full this year AN artificial calm prevails in Hungary while economic collapse and national conflict buffet its neighbours. By contrast, Hungary appears economically and politically stable. But it is a fragile stability which this year will be tested to the full. Most Hungarians have been suffering from stagnating living standards for a decade. Democracy and economic liberalisation were supposed to solve that. But patience is running out a year after free elections, and it is on that patience that Hungary's current equilibrium is precariously balanced. Nevertheless, on the surface at least, Hungarian politics have rapidly become surprisingly normal. When last spring's elections produced a governing conservative coalition, a strong liberal opposition and a socialist (ex-communist) rump, most commentators said it could not last. But the coalition has defied its critics, giving Hungary the closest thing to western-style two-party politics in eastern Europe. What is more, the move to democracy has been achieved without any abrupt change in government policy. The conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum came to power last spring with the slogan that it was 'The calm force' and the implicit claim that the party would not turn Hungary upside down. Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, has not let down his electors. The continuity is so striking that people can be forgiven for the commonly-held belief that nothing has changed since the election except the rising prices. There has been no about-turn on economic policy. The former government's tight monetary and fiscal stance has been maintained; quick and decentralised privatisation has returned to favour; and the commitment to repaying Hungary's Dollars 21bn debt has, if anything, been reinforced. December's appointment of Mr Mihaly Kupa to head the Finance Ministry, where he had been a widely-respected official, marked the victory of bureaucratic pragmatism. The cabinet reshuffle muted the ideological arguments within the cabinet which had crippled policy-making. Mr Kupa's self-proclaimed pragmatism has also taken the heat out of the wider debate on whether to treat the economy with shock therapy or not. Opposition politicians and economists are hard-pressed to take issue with the finance minister's programme of reform legislation. Nor has there been a witch-hunt of officials associated with the communist regime. 'Against the greatest pressure, we didn't kick out everyone or make a B-list,' said Mr Istvan Forrai, head of the prime minister's secretariat. While the government takes pride in its conservatism, the opposition accuses it of inaction and missed opportunities. 'What more can a government do in such a period but to maintain financial, internal, political and personnel stability?' asks Mr Istvan Forrai, head of the prime minister's secretariat, in return. So successful has this policy been that Hungary is now the most attractive country in eastern Europe for investment. Half of all western investment in the region went to Hungary last year, according to Mr Bela Kadar, minister for international economic relations. But that investment, and a boom in exports with the west, have not been enough to offset the slump of the surrounding east European economies. Hungary's exports to former Comecon countries fell by 24 per cent last year, the most important factor behind a 4-5 per cent fall in measured gross domestic product. The government predicts the same fall in output for 1991. Average living standards, cushioned by the black economy, are probably not falling by nearly that much. But the figures hide growing income inequality. A tenth of people are much better off, three-tenths are worse off and the rest stay the same, according to Mr Gabor Istvan, a professor at the Budapest University of Economics. The losers are numerous enough to make for widespread discontent, expressed in deep unpopularity with the government: one recent poll gave the Forum 14 per cent. More dangerously, an opinion poll commissioned by the European Community showed that 75 per cent of Hungarians were dissatisfied with the way that democracy had developed, much more than in other east European countries. No one quite knows what expression public disillusion will take. Last October, it emerged in a three-day protest against higher petrol prices. In a recent by-election it was shown by a 25 per cent turnout and victory for the socialists. The prime minister warned recently that the extremes of right and left 'together endanger the Hungarian political democracy which is being born.' One senior Forum official fears the demagogues within his own party who would emerge if the government fell. The industry minister fears a wave of strikes. Mr Mihaly Laki, an economic adviser to the opposition Free Democrats, fears the anti-parliamentary sentiment which would lead people to accept an authoritarian leader as the price of an economic miracle. But it is clear that there is a large and unpredictable body of Hungarians which appears to be indifferent to elections and is largely motivated by economic well-being. 'They are so secularised and atomised,' says Mr Forrai. 'They are real materialists. . . in a harsh and individualistic society.' The question is whether their discontent will ignite before economic prosperity can defuse it.</p>

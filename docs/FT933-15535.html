			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Government drops disputed Oxleas Wood road scheme THE Department of Transport yesterday scrapped plans to build a new road through Oxleas Wood in Greenwich, south-east London, giving environmentalists one of their greatest triumphs in recent years. The controversial scheme would have severely damaged one of London's last ancient woodlands and had been the target of vigorous campaigning by conservationists and local residents. It had also attracted the attention of the European Commission which earlier this year started proceedings against the UK government claiming it had failed to publish a proper environmental assessment of the project. The aim of the scheme was to provide a link between the A2 London-Dover road and the A406 North Circular by building six miles of dual carriageway leading to a new bridge over the Thames, the East London River Crossing. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced in answer to a written Commons question yesterday that he was dropping the Pounds 283m project because the section passing through Oxleas Wood failed to meet the environmental standards now applying to new road schemes. He said the government still intended to build a link across the Thames because the plan formed an important part of its strategy to regenerate the East Thames Corridor. But fresh proposals would now be put forward, incorporating a design competition for the bridge and possibly a role for private sector finance. Mr MacGregor added that his decision was 'quite independent' of the EC proceedings because the government remained convinced that the environmental assessment directive did not apply to projects already initiated when the ruling came into force. The main reason for the government's turnabout appears to have been an acknowledgment that it had virtually no public support from any quarter for its stance. The last straw came in May when the British Road Federation, a lobbying group which normally argues strenuously for more roadbuilding, allied itself with the campaign to stop the road through Oxleas Wood. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said: 'We have been campaigning to save the wood for eight years, so we are delighted that the government seems to have faced up to common sense.' But it warned against complacency: 'The fact that the government is still planning to build the bridge leaves an axe hanging over the wood.'</p>

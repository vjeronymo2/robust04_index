			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Japan's stock market falls sharply GLOOM over the Japanese economy intensified yesterday when the Tokyo stock market plunged 2.2 per cent, closing below the psychologically important 19,000 level for the first time in eight months. The fall was another blow to Japan's financial system, already staggering from the failure this week of Muramoto Construction, the biggest post-war corporate collapse. The Nikkei average, which retreated 431.45 to 18,949.79 yesterday, lost further ground when the market opened today. In less than an hour, the index slipped 405.44 to 18,544.35. Some of the blame for the weakness is being attributed to last week's partial listing of East Japan Railway (JR East), the semi-privatised railway group. The Tokyo market declined in six out of seven trading days since the flotation, losing 1,300 points, or 6.7 per cent. 'JR East has almost become an enemy of the market,' said a Japanese broker. Financial officials and brokers had hoped JR East would restore confidence among investors, leading the stock market out of the current slump. Instead, investors were discouraged by the halt in trading of JR East shares last week, as big selling orders for the stock jammed the computer system at the Tokyo stock exchange. Since hitting Y600,000 at its initial trading price, JR East has fallen 18 per cent, dragging down the Nikkei. Brokers also blamed the market plunge on absence of stock purchases by public pension funds, which have actively supported share prices since last March, only to disappear after the listing of JR East. The economic background in Japan remains grim and leading companies have started to announce large-scale staff cuts. The spate of corporate interim results during the past few weeks have indicated further deterioration in profits, as many companies have revised down earnings estimates for the business year to March. However, with finance ministry officials wishing to offload other state-owned companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining regional railway companies, the stock market may well see another round of public pension fund support.

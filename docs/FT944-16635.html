			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo holds its own in brands battle PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and fast-food company, brought cheer to its shareholders yesterday with quarterly figures suggesting it was fighting off the threat to its core Pepsi-Cola brand from own-label cola drinks. The news from its fast-food restaurant businesses, however, was less encouraging. Pizza Hut did particularly badly with operating profits dropping by 25 per cent, partly due to a decline in take-away sales in the US. Overall, net income for the third quarter to September 3 was Dollars 541.4m. This was 18 per cent higher than the comparable quarter's Dollars 458.2m - although excluding a tax adjustment in the prior year, growth would have been a less impressive 11 per cent. Sales rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 7.1bn and earnings per share, boosted by company share repurchases, rose to 68 cents from 56 cents. The results were a significant improvement over the second-quarter performance, when weakness in the soft drink and restaurant businesses brought underlying profits growth to standstill. Wall Street responded by marking the shares up Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34 in early trading. In the beverage division, strong sales growth pushed world-wide revenues up 13 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn. This produced a 19 per cent increase in operating profits to Dollars 422.2m in spite of higher discounts to retailers, a symptom of competition from other cola brands. Restaurant revenue increased by 9 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn, but profit advances at Taco Bell and KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken) were more than offset by the decline at Pizza Hut, leaving the division's operating profits 5 per cent down at Dollars 211.1m. For the nine months, underlying profits (excluding unusual charges) were 7 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.3bn.</p>

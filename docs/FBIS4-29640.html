			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 21 KYODO -- North Korea has  fulfilled conditions for a resumption of high-level talks with  the United States by not diverting spent nuclear fuel to  military purposes, according to U.N. diplomatic sources familiar  with Washington-Pyongyang negotiations.    The sources said late Monday Pyongyang's First Vice Foreign  Minister Kang Sok-chu said in a June 3 statement that North  Korea will not divert to military use any radioactive material  from fuel rods withdrawn recently from an experimental nuclear  reactor.    In the statement, Kang asserted it is still possible to test  the spent fuel rods to ensure that no plutonium has been  diverted to military purposes.    Kang urged the U.S. to resume talks with Pyongyang in order  to reach a package solution to the nuclear issue but also said  economic sanctions would be regarded as a "declaration of war."    During refueling operations of the research reactor in the  Yongbyon nuclear complex some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang  last month, North Korea rejected demands by International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors that they be allowed to take  samples from the 8,000 rods being withdrawn.    North Korean officials said it was setting aside 40 rods for  testing later by the IAEA inspectors, but the Vienna-based U.N.  monitoring agency rejected the offer as insufficient to ensure  the continuity of the safeguards agreement.    The U.S. and other Western nations suspect that Pyongyang  may be attempting to build an atomic weapons arsenal and are  threatening U.N. sanctions if it continues to reject IAEA  demands for checks.    Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful  purposes, but its intransigence over the inspections has fueled  suspicions it may be trying to conceal a weapons development  program.    Washington is offering to resume high-level talks with  Pyongyang but wants to see a freeze on the suspected North  Korean nuclear program.    This would include allowing two IAEA inspectors to remain in  North Korea, no reprocessing of the discharged fuel rods and no  reloading of the Yongbyon reactor.    Kang suggested in the June 3 statement that when a  comprehensive resolution to the issue is reached with the U.S.,  North Korea would allow regular and special IAEA inspections of  its nuclear facilities, return to the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty and change to the safer light-water type of nuclear  reactor.</p>

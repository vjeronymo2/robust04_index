			<p>BFN     [Text] It is now known that members of the parliamentary  committee for international affairs met in private on Thursday  to discuss the Yeltsin-proposed list of candidates for  ambassadorial posts in several countries including the United  States.    The committee approved the president's nominee, Yuliy  Vorontsov, currently Russian ambassador to the United Nations,  as head of the Russian embassy in Washington.    The post has remained vacant after the previous ambassador  Vladimir Lukin was elected to parliament and was appointed head  of its International Affairs Committee.</p>

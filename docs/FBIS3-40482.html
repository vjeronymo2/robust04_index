FBRs use molten natrium to extract heat from  the reactor core. At present, this natrium is circulated by a  mechanical pump that uses a propeller, but since an  electromagnetic pump would not generate vibrations, it is  expected to reduce the probability of breakdowns. The  electromagnetic pump will be an important element technology for  the commercial FBR that will follow the demonstration reactor.    Natrium is a metal, and in accordance with the Fleming rule,  it will start to move when a magnetic field is created and  electricity is passed. JAPCO and DOE will co-develop the  electromagnetic pump based on this principle. Natrium is  extremely reactive, and will cause serious accidents if it leaks  out and comes into contact with moisture. Problems with natrium  have been a weak point of FBRs in other countries as well.  Breakdowns will be rare with the electromagnetic pump because  there will be no mechanical drive system and vibrations will not  occur.    The prototype FBR ``Monju,'' in which the Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) plans to achieve  criticality in 1994, as well as FBRs under research in other  countries use mechanical pumps with propellers to circulate  natrium. Development of an electromagnetic pump will encourage  the development of commercial FBRs.    FBRs operate the same as light water reactors (LWRs) used  commercially in nuclear power plants that use heat created by  nuclear fission to make steam, which turns turbines to generate  electricity. They were called breeder reactors because they  produce plutonium, which can be used as a nuclear fuel, at the  same time as they produce heat.    While the LWR uses water to extract heat from the core,  however, the FBR uses 580C molten natrium. If it used  water, it would slow down neutron speed created by fission,and  this would not be suitable for plutonium breeding. That is why  the FBR uses natrium, which does not slow down neutrons.</p>

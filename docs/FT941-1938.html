			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Favourite first past the post at Epsom The favourite won the race for the Derby yesterday. Racecourse Holdings Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, will be the new owner of Epsom, where the next Derby will be run on June 1. It will also own Sandown Park and Kempton Park. The trust, always seen as the safest bet, made a winning bid of Pounds 30.25m. This outstripped bids from the two outsiders - Sunset + Vine, the sports television company, and a consortium headed by Mr Stan Clarke, owner of Uttoxeter racecourse. The three courses were offered for sale in October by the Horse-race Betting Levy Board, which has owned them for more than 20 years. Mr Rodney Brack, chief executive of the board, said the race had been close. All three candidates had satisfied the board's prime demand to safeguard the future of quality racing at all three courses. The Levy Board will face criticism that it has taken the safe option. The trust, whose main shareholder is the Jockey Club, already owns nine of the UK's 59 courses, including Cheltenham and Newmarket. Mr David Hillyard, RHT's managing director, said he was absolutely delighted. Anyone who accused the trust of being establishment and unimaginative 'clearly was nowhere near Cheltenham last week' for the three-day National Hunt Festival. The trust will borrow about 70 per cent of the purchase price, which includes Pounds 1m related to Derby sponsorship. The contract is expected to be concluded by the end of next month. A spokesman for Sunset + Vine said: 'Our bid was designed to improve and broaden the appeal of racing to the public, bring innovation and marketing expertise to the world of racing.' Sunset, which has a market value of less than Pounds 10m, had lined up a board that included Mr Robert Sangster, the millionaire racehorse owner, Mr David Lloyd, former British Davis Cup tennis player, and racehorse trainer Mr Luca Cumani. Mr Stan Clarke, who has turned round Uttoxeter racecourse from losses five years ago, put in a private bid with Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman of Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, and Mr Andrew Cohen, managing director of Betterware, the home shopping company.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'STRETCHING' ON FILM  </P> <P> Re Kenneth Turan's Dec. 2 article on Paul Newman: How dare Turan accuse one  responsible for so many critically and commercially successful films of  breaking an unspoken bargain with his audience and foolishly trying to broaden  his horizons.  </P> <P> The roles Mr. Newman played in "The Hustler," "Hud" and "The Verdict" are  outstanding character performances, not just performances that remain close to  audience expectations.  </P> <P> "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" introduces much of Newman's audience to classic American  literature, and some of that on the screen is better than none.  </P> <P> PAUL de SOUZA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

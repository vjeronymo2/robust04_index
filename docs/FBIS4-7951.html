			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DUMA PRESS" report] </F>   [Text] The BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] ended 1993 with  unpaid debts of 4.289 million leva, it was announced following  yesterday's meeting of the BSP Supreme Council, at which the  Council passed the accountants' report on the party's finances  and the balance sheet for 1993.    Income from party dues fell short of expectations by about  the same amount, namely 4.770 million leva. According to [BSP  leader] Zhan Videnov, the reasons for this were poor financial  control and failures to submit proper accounts. The BSP  chairman thinks the party must also seek ways to increase its  income from economic activities.    The BSP had a balance of 2.039 million leva at the end of  1993. Its assets were valued at 25.972 million leva, after  deducting the value of some of the party's buildings, its  shareholdings in state companies, the BSP library stock, and  other assets sequestered under the Party Property Confiscation  Act. However, the balance sheet continues to record business  inventory items and movable property that have not yet been  confiscated or have been seized without any authorizing  documents.    No accounts and balance sheets were submitted by the  regional  BSP councils in Blagoevgrad, Veliko Turnovo, Vratsa, Lovech,  Kyustendil, and Turgovishte, and by certain oblast BSP councils.    In conformance with the law, the BSP will submit its  accounts  for 1993 to the Parliamentary Commission on Party Property.</p>

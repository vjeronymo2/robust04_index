			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Broader disclosure urged in US US companies should give their shareholders more detailed information about the performance of different parts of their business, according to a committee set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The accountants also want companies to include only the results of their continuing, core operations in their reported net profits, and to identify exceptional or one-off items separately. The recommendations are included in a study of financial reporting undertaken by the AICPA during the past three years and published recently. It calls for financial statements to include more information about a company's plans and prospects, as well as touching on several specific accounting issues. The call for more detailed segmental information reflects concern from investors about the quality of information available. 'Users (of financial reports) tell us it is ineffectual,' said Mr Robert Israeloff, a member of the committee, who is due to take over as chairman of the AICPA this month. In the past, companies have always succeeded in fighting off greater segmental disclosure by arguing that it would reveal commercially sensitive information and therefore be against the interests of their shareholders. The AICPA has no power to change accounting rules. However, Mr Israeloff said the body would urge the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt the recommendations.

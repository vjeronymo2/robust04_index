			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Building Societies - Shifting ground: Support grows for Bank of England regulation Treasury ministers and senior officials are supporting proposals to transfer supervision of big building societies to the Bank of England. The move has been among ideas mooted in a government review of society legislation. A decision on the transfer of responsibilities for big societies from the Building Societies Commission to the Bank of England has been given added urgency by Lloyds Bank's proposed Pounds 1.8bn acquisition of the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society. That deal has highlighted the increasing similarity between the activities of big building societies and those of the clearing banks. Government officials expect more society takeovers and feel it would be far more efficient for one supervisor, probably the Bank of England, to decide whether depositors' interests would be best served by a takeover. 'There is a strong logic for financial institutions to be regulated according to their functions rather than their corporate structure', a senior Whitehall official said. Banks increasingly regard the bigger societies ranging from the Bradford and Bingley with Pounds 14bn of assets to the Halifax with Pounds 67bn, as their competitors. Small societies, friendly societies and credit unions would remain the responsibility of the Building Societies Commission. Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee, said Lloyds' proposed takeover raised the question of whether banks should be regulated separately from building societies. The committee's inquiry into regulation may recommend that there should be one regulator for banks and big building societies. At present, the Commission supervises 6,000 mutual societies - or institutions owned by their borrowing and lending members - most of them tiny. The Bank of England is responsible for banks, which have a corporate status. Bank of England and Treasury officials believe there are too many building societies and are convinced that the most promising route for securing rationalisation is to allow banks to buy the weaker societies. The Treasury may put pressure on the Building Societies Commission not to put unnecessary obstacles in the way of bank acquisitions of societies. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, called for the regulatory system to be overhauled. 'We need a proper framework to govern mergers between banks and building societies to ensure competition and consumer protection.' See Weekend FT, Page III and Men in the News, Features</p>

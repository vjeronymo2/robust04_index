Kofanov, Colloidal  Chemistry and Hydrochemistry Institute, Kiev; UDC628.162]    [Abstract] Micro-quantities of organo-chlorine compounds in  river water, often exceeding the maximum allowable  concentration, ends up in drinking water, since communal water  treatment facilities are not designed to remove them. A major  portion of these organo-chlorine compounds originate from  pesticides, even those which have not been used for several  years since they gradually wash out from the ground water and  enter the system. A secondary source of organo-chlorine  compounds in potable water is side reactions of chlorine in  water with aqueous humus and organic substances entering river  water from ground water deposits. These include chloromethanes,  polychlorophenols, and chlorophenolic acid. Experience in  France, Germany, England, and USA shows that the single most  dependable means for eliminating organo-chlorine compounds from  drinking water is filtration through an activated charcoal, such  as Filtrasorb-200 (Calgon Corp.) or Chemviron (Belgium).  Satisfactory results have been obtained from an anthracitic  charcoal produced in Ukraine, Akant-Mezo, developed at the  Colloidal Chemistry and Hydrochemistry Institute. In the present  work data are presented on total specific surface, meso-pore  specific surface, and distribution of specific mesopore surface  at radius limits of 1-4 nm in activated charcoals used in water  treatment, KAD, AG-3, AG-PR, activated anthracite AUA,  Akant-Mezo, and Filtrasorbs 100-400. From all indications,  Akant-Mezo meets the requirements for deep treatment of water.  Filtration of clear river water and tap water contaminated with  hexachlorocyclohexane in concentrations of 35-43 micrograms per  liter through a 0.3 meter column of Akant-Mezo, lowered the  hexachlorocyclohexane concentration 350-400 times. The residual  concentration was  0.1 microgram per liter. This meets the  most rigid European standards for PDK of organo-chlorine  pesticides in drinking water.

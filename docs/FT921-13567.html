			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shun Tak buys Ho gaming stake MINORITY shareholders in Shun Tak Holdings, the Hong Kong listed vehicle of Mr Stanley Ho, the Macau gambling magnate, yesterday approved the purchase of a 5 per cent stake in Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de Macau (STDM), the holding company for Mr Ho's gambling interest in the Portuguese colony. Shun Tak will pay HKDollars 233m (USDollars 30m) for the STDM stake, giving investors their first opportunity to buy into what is regarded as one of the world's most profitable casino operations. Shun Tak's share price eased 2.5 HK cents yesterday to close at HKDollars 4.80. Shun Tak, a diversified company, runs a jetfoil service between Hong Kong and Macau, and has interest in restaurants, hotels, aviation and property. In 1991, it made a profit after tax of Dollars HK171m. The addition to its portfolio of an interest in STDM could well be the jewel in its crown. Mr Ho, together with other Hong Kong investors, has held a monopoly on gambling in Macau since 1962; in 1986, STDM's monopoly was extended until 2001. STDM is a private Macau company and does not have to publish accounts. But in documents presented to minority shareholders by Wardley Corporate Finance, STDM said it had shareholders' funds of HKDollars 7.77bn at end-1991 and had paid dividends to shareholders over the three years 1988 to 1990 of Dollars HK210m, Dollars HK300m, and Dollars HK420m.</p>

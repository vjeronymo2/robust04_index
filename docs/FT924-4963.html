			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Lamont case adds to pressure for cabinet reshuffle PRESSURE ON Mr John Major to conduct an early cabinet reshuffle grew yesterday after disclosures that Mr Norman Lamont had received a Pounds 4,000 payment from the Treasury towards private legal costs last year. The report that he received the sum in a case involving the eviction of a tenant from his London home was confirmed in a statement by the chancellor on Saturday night. The incident has led several senior Conservative backbenchers to question Mr Lamont's judgment in accepting help from public funds. The prime minister's office yesterday rallied to the embattled Chancellor, dismissing speculation that either Mr Lamont's resignation or a cabinet reshuffle might be imminent. The Cabinet Office also released details from the confidential Guidelines for Permanent Secretaries that appeared to establish that the payment to Mr Lamont was in order and followed past precedents. Whitehall also rallied to Mr Lamont, with Treasury officials insisting the idea for the payment had been proposed by civil servants on the grounds that it met well-established criteria and that taking legal advice had been in the public interest to defend the chancellor's reputation. But Labour is determined to raise the case in the Commons today by demanding a statement from Mr Lamont justifying his decision to take taxpayers' money to meet a personal expense. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, led the protests yesterday, asking why the payment was kept secret if it was all in order. The Commons public accounts committee is also expected to examine the payment, which met part of a Pounds 23,000 legal bill, incurred in evicting a Ms Sara Dale from Mr Lamont's Notting Hill home. The balance was paid from Conservative party sources. The new disclosures, following last week's leaking of Mr Lamont's unpaid credit card bill, fuel the belief among some Tory MPs that the chancellor is irredeemably accident-prone. Many believe Mr Major has little alternative but to move him to a less prominent cabinet post in a reshuffle during the Christmas recess. Speculation on his likely successor has centred on Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary. One theory has it that Mr Clarke would move to the Treasury, to be replaced at the Home Office by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. Mr Lamont would move to defence. Some Tory loyalists came out firmly for the chancellor, blaming the media for launching a 'witch-hunt'. Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, said: 'If this was approved within the Treasury I would think there is no question of impropriety.' As Mr Lamont returned to Downing Street last night from his official country residence, Dorneywood, Bucks, he said: 'I am not going to resign.' Tarnished Lamont starts to lose support Page 8</p>

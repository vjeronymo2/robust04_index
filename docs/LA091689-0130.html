			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISTAKES ARE FATAL TO EDISON;  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY'S DEFENSE FORCES SIX FUMBLES IN 37-10 ROUT  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley's defense sacked, harried, rushed and intercepted Edison  quarterback Donnie Smith while defeating the Chargers, 37-10, Friday night in  front of 1,400 at Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> Damon Psaros and Dave Josker each sacked Smith twice. Tackle Mike Christian and  linebacker Motor Mosebrook, whose engine was in high gear, also dominated  defensively for the Cougars.  </P> <P> "I knew they were good. They had eight starters back on defense," Edison Coach  Dave White said. "I told the kids (Capistrano) might be the best defense they  would face all year."  </P> <P> White was disappointed in his team's intensity, saying, "We played with no  emotion. They were a real good football team that came to play and we were an  average football team that didn't come to play. Maybe now people will stop  saying we're number two (in Division I)."  </P> <P> The Chargers, already lacking in depth, were without wide receiver/defensive  back Mike Cunningham and center David Rider, who were injured in practice.  </P> <P> Guard Jeff Aselin, filling in at center, and Smith had trouble on the snaps,  with Smith bobbling the ball numerous times, and fumbling it three times. The  Chargers had a total of six fumbles. Capistrano Valley recovered two of them.  </P> <P> Capistrano's Chris Tarnowski recovered one of the fumbles at the Edison 42 late  in the first quarter. After a four-yard run by Paul Shaheen and a 29-yard pass  from Tony Solliday to Dan Zamora, Shaheen ran 25 yards for a touchdown to put  Capistrano Valley ahead, 12-0.  </P> <P> Offensively, the Cougars moved the ball freely with the help of a few key  Edison penalties sustaining them whenever their drives came close to faltering.  They scored on their first three possessions.  </P> <P> Solliday completed 11 of 20 passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns. Zamora was  on the receiving end of five of them for 59 yards and a touchdown. Dave Poltl  caught three passes for 59 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton was surprised his team dominated. "We were  very fortunate to jump out in the lead like we did and score as quickly as we  did. I knew we were quick and had some team speed, but I did not know how well  we would match up with their size and running game."  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley limited running back Shane Sherman to 65 yards in 15 carries.  </P> <P> Edison quarterback Smith rushed for minus 30 yards in nine carries. He  completed 18 of 30 passes for 194 yards, one touchdown and was intercepted  once.  </P> <P> To add insult to injury, the Edison players and coaches had their clothing  stolen from the visitors' locker room at Capistrano Valley sometime during the  second half. "We already lost our tails tonight, then we lost everything in the  locker room," White said. "We got everything ripped off. We lost all our  jewelry, rings, money, wallets. It was all there at halftime."  </P></p>

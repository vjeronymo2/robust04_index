			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Asda advances 14% to Pounds 105m - Chairman warns of serious threat from 'stampede of discounters' Britain's food retailers face a serious threat from a 'stampede of discounters', said Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, yesterday as he unveiled a 14 per cent jump in first-half operating profits. Mr Norman warned that the rapidly growing number of discounters, such as Aldi, Netto and Kwik Save, would double their market share in the next two to three years. Contrary to comments made by other retail chains, Mr Norman said discounters and warehouse clubs inevitably took sales from the superstores. 'A good Kwik Save will take Pounds 30,000 a week off our sales,' he said. However, he stressed that Asda had found 'a survival route, and a profitable one,' in fending off competition. 'Our space in the market will be Dales - Asda's own discounting chain which offers a higher proportion of fresh foods  -the superstores and the hypermarkets', he said. Discounters would pose the most significant threat in the south-east of England, where Asda had a lower exposure than the bigger chains. The group would also be offering a wider range of fresh food, clothing and leisure products as well as focusing on its value for money brand. Asda's strategy appeared to be paying off with like for like sales up 9 per cent to Pounds 2.4bn, with little impact from inflation. Operating profits rose from Pounds 91.9m to Pounds 105m for the 28 weeks to November 13. Pre-tax profits were depressed by the absence of last year's Pounds 98.1m exceptional gains on disposals and fell by 34 per cent from Pounds 126.7m to Pounds 83.9m. Profits were also hit by an increased loss of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 11.9m) from the Allied Maples business. Both the carpet and furniture businesses have since been sold to management. The store renewal programme was gathering pace, with 32 completed by Christmas at a cost of roughly Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m each. Total capital spending in the first half was Pounds 126m, with a further Pounds 100m budgeted for the second six months. Debt was down from Pounds 471.6m to Pounds 55.3m, following January's Pounds 347m rights issue. Interest charges fell from Pounds 51.9m to Pounds 7.9m. The interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 0.55p. Earnings, hit by the absence of exceptional gains, fell from 4.87p to 2.03p. See Lex</p>

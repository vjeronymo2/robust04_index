			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Oil price recovery is forecast Oil prices will recover to about Dollars 18 a barrel by the end of the year from Dollars 14 in the first three months, predicted NatWest Securities yesterday. The securities concern's oil and gas research team believes the recovery will come even if a group of countries not affiliated to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is not persuaded to cut output. It says the recent squeeze in the oil market will ease in the second half of the year as demand for Opec oil is aided by the recovery of economies.</p>

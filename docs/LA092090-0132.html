			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE NOTES: PANEL SEEKS TO SIMPLIFY INTERSTATE SALES  </P> <P> A national task force on the wine industry last week considered various rule  changes that would make uniform the laws to simplify the sale of wine from  state to state.  </P> <P> The aim of the Task Force on the Wine Industry of the National Conference of  State Legislatures (NCSL) is to reduce trade barriers for wine and come up with  universal standards that would make selling wine from one state to the next as  easy as it is for a U.S. producer to sell wine overseas.  </P> <P> The Task Force includes 33 states who have said they would like to smooth out  the trade barriers to wine that are permitted under the 21st Amendment to the  U.S. Constitution.  </P> <P> California Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese, chairman of the task force, said  NCSL's joint committee (which includes the National Conference of State Liquor  Administrators, the National Alcohol Beverage Control Assn., and the Federation  of Tax Administrators) met to look over proposals that would standardize  license applications and reporting forms to eliminate duplication and  inconsistencies between state and federal laws.  </P> <P> The task force will meet again later this year to discuss the various  proposals.  </P> <P> For one thing, Cortese said, there are two different types of state alcoholic  beverage control setups -- one for control states (where alcoholic beverages  are sold at retail through state stores) and one for license states, where  stores are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> "We'd like to see if we can find language and forms that everyone can agree  on," said a spokesman for Cortese.  </P> <P> In effect, said Cortese, the present system sets up a scenario where the  various states operate like foreign countries with one another in respect to  wine sales.  </P> <P> The recommendations attempt to deal with the barriers created in 1933 by  passage of the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition, when the states were  permitted to control the sale of alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> "Complying with the staggering array of state and federal regulations tests the  stamina of every American wine producer," said Cortese (D-San Jose), who is  also chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on California Wine Production  and Economy.  </P> <P> Since the 21st Amendment told the states they could make their own licensed  beverage laws, the federal government would not be involved in much of what the  wine task force hopes to accomplish, Cortese said.  </P> <P> The task force, noting that 43 states make wine from the grapes produced by  8,000 grape growers, said the wine industry "is one of the most heavily  regulated industries in the United States.  </P> <P> "As a grower of grapes, the wine producer is subject to all agricultural  regulation. As a producer of wine he or she is subject to alcohol regulation at  both the federal and state level," said the task force report.  </P> <P> "Each state has its own comprehensive set of regulations. Each state has its  own bewildering laws regarding wine, and no two states have the same laws. The  federal government has its own comprehensive set of regulations. As a result,  wine is one of the few products where interstate sales are spoken of in terms  of 'import' and 'export.' "  </P> <P> The trade barriers between the states, said the task force, "are bad for  business and employment. They steal the competitive edge and ultimately are bad  for the state and national economies . . . ."  </P> <P> The task force urged the adoption of interstate reciprocal shipping agreements  to "allow any consumer, winery, or licensee to ship up to two cases of wine to  relatives or friends in another state if both states have reciprocity." Such  laws already have been passed by California, Colorado, Wisconsin, Oregon and  New Mexico and a similar "reciprocity law" is being considered by other states.  </P> <P> The task force further recommended that agreements permit the shipping of wine  through the various states like "any package, with no other restrictions or  requirements."  </P> <P> The recommendations asked the states to adopt the standards of the uniform  labeling requirements of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  (BATF).  </P> <P> All labels on alcoholic beverages must be approved by BATF, but in some states  these federally approved labels must be submitted back to a state agency for  further approval, under varying different regulations. The task force said that  instead, the states should simply accept BATF's labeling procedures --  standards similar to those required by the European Economic Community.  </P> <P> The states should adopt standardized forms for application and permit systems  and eliminate the requirement to notarize forms, said the group. There's no  rational reason for vintners to be forced to leave their wineries to drive to  the nearest city to find a notary public, they said. "This is a waste of time,  effort and money," they said, adding:  </P> <P> "At a time when (Europe) is on the verge of becoming 'one nation' in 1992, the  United States is still '50 nations' when it comes to wine . . . . While the  Europeans have sought uniformity in their regulation of wine, we have not . . .  ."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wine of the Week  </P> <P> 1989 Newlan Napa-Villages ($7) -- The word Villages often appears on Beaujolais  Villages, from the French region that produces the lightest, most quaffable red  wines of the Burgundy district. Newlan in the Napa Valley has made a  Beaujolais-type wine from 80% Pinot Noir and the rest Gamay and Petite Sirah.  It is a rich, spicy wine with plenty of raspberry/strawberry fruit, takes a  chilling and can be enjoyed with a wide variety of foods.  </P></p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Domecq tumbles Spirits group Allied Domecq tumbled 13 to 583p as dealers said Cazenove, the company's broker, had downgraded profits expectations just ahead of Domecq's interim results. There was no confirmation from Cazenove, but the speculation led to strong activity in the shares and turnover rose to 5.1m, making it the stock's busiest session for nearly 6 months. Domecq reports interims on Thursday. The market range is Pounds 310m to Pounds 340m. Sentiment was hit further by news that Morgan Stanley had placed the stock on its 'sell' list from a previous 'hold' recommendation and weighed in with a sharp profits downgrade. The broker scaled back its profits forecast for the year 1994-95 by Pounds 26m to Pounds 646m and that of the following year by Pounds 36m to Pounds 778m. Analyst Mr Charles Winston cited destocking in the Mexican market, difficult trading at Carlsberg-Tetley, the brewing joint venture, and a revised interest charge. Nervousness ahead of this week's figures led to the initial retreat in the stock last week when Smith New Court downgraded current year earnings per share and moved the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' stance last Thursday.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nenad Ivankovic: "What Do the Americans Really </F> Want in Bosnia?"]    [Text] Bonn (from VJESNIK's permanent correspondent) --  Does the United States see the Muslim-Croat federation as a tool  to further its strategic-political interests in the Balkans, or  is creation of the joint Muslim-Croat state only an attempt on  the part of the mightiest world power to extricate itself from  its moral and other obligations in the former Yugoslavia and to  do so as painlessly as possible? At the same time casting the  entire burden of the risks and uncertainty on the victims of  Serbian aggression?    This dilemma is similar to the question: "Has the  development  of the events in Bosnia reached a phase that might be referred  to as a new-Yalta delimitation in this part of Europe between  Moscow and Washington, or is that only a forced construct that  answers more to wishes than to geopolitical reality?" The  questions and dilemmas suggest themselves spontaneously,  especially since last week's negotiations in Vienna and the  ministerial meeting of the United States, Russia, and the  European Union in Geneva. In just a few days the United States  has changed its own position, and has done so essentially to the  detriment of the Muslim-Croat federation. Whereas in Vienna Mr.  Redman, Clinton's special emissary for the former Yugoslavia,  supported on behalf of the United States the demand for the  future Bosnian federation to embrace 58 percent of the total  territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher suddenly reverted in Geneva to the European  position, accepting division in a ratio of 51:49 to the  advantage of the Muslims and Croats.    The Muslim-Croat federation was thus reduced by 7 percent in  just a few days, and that makes the psychological-political  damage from that U.S. loop-the-loop just that much worse.    Are the Americans backing the Muslim-Croat federation in any  serious way, and are the promises and guarantees they have made  to be believed?    1. There are reasons to believe that the U.S. commitment in  Bosnia and in the Balkans as a whole is being overstated by a  good bit. It is true that the Americans have made a stronger  commitment (since the NATO ultimatum in Sarajevo), but basically  the character of their commitment has not changed. It still does  not occur to Washington to send ground forces to Bosnia nor to  intervene seriously from the air in the events of the war there.  There are several explanations for that, but two seem to be  crucial: Since the disintegration of the socialist bloc and the  bipolar division of the world, tendencies towards isolationism,  one of the major constants and dilemmas of U.S. politics, has  become stronger in the United States. At the same time, because  the ideological and worldview confrontation with Moscow had come  to an end and because of Russia's obvious economic dependence on  the West, the Russian danger in Europe was reduced to a great  extent. In that sense Europe had begun to lose a bit of its  priority status for the United States. It would not be long  before the Clinton administration would turn its foreign policy  options and interests more towards Asia than the Old Continent.    What is more, aside from the moral and political obligations  that arise from America's many years of support to the former  Yugoslavia, Washington does not see its strategic and  national-security interests in this part of Europe, at least not  to the extent that perhaps was expected.    In one phase of his vacillating and frequently unclear  Balkan  policy, it is true, Clinton did attempt to explain strategic  U.S. interests in terms of the need to protect human rights and  freedoms, but that proved to be too weak a support for any  serious commitment of the United States in this part of the  world, especially since political conditions and relations in  today's world are more and more like those in the 19th century.  In his most recent book, which many say is his best, Kissinger  in fact predicts that in coming years and decades there will be  five or six great powers on the scene (instead of two blocs and  ideologies head to head), among which a balance of power will  have to be maintained in order to preserve global peace, and  that means that policy based on interests, rather than a policy  based on principles, will have to leap into the foreground.    Part of that vision proves to have been realized already in  Bosnia: The principles and moral-political standards from the  heroic period of the Cold War have been completely pushed away  into the middle distance or background, and all that is left is  harmonizing the interests of the key powers: the United States,  Russia, Great Britain, France, and -- in an altogether reduced  sense -- Germany.    2. Aside from the fact that U.S. national interests were not  directly touched or threatened in the former Yugoslavia,  limitations of Washington's involvement were also imposed by  other circumstances, the relationship with European allies first  of all. It has been no secret, neither yesterday nor today, that  Great Britain and France have been supporting the project of  creating a Great Serbia in one way or the other. Even back  during the war in Croatia, that tendency was evident, but it  took on its full physiognomy after the diplomatic recognition of  Croatia and Slovenia.    Since Germany deserves most of the credit for diplomatic  recognition, Paris and London tried in every way to conduct a  policy which in the end-game would repair the damage done to the  interests of those states by the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  This is the line pursued not only by the subtle anti-Croat  strategy, as a kind of substitute for a more open anti-German  policy, but everything has been done to block any serious action  that might halt the Serbian war of conquest. With his visit to  Sarajevo and Bosnia, Mitterrand deliberately cheated the  humanitarian commitment, which has blocked every other action,  with the result in the end-game that the Serbs today hold under  their control about 72 percent of the territory of Bosnia and  Herzegovina.    Those same factors have also frustrated every attempt to  settle problems in the occupied areas of Croatia, without  allowing Croatia even the possibility of solving that problem  with its own forces. To be sure, the situation in France is  today somewhat different than a few months ago. The  intelligentsia are no longer neutral or pro-Serb, but have  become fairly critical of Belgrade and Pale, which to some  extent has diminished Mitterrand's own opportunity for open  support to Serbia. But in essence France has not essentially  altered its policy in this regard; it has only become more  quiet. Finally, the most recent threats that Paris will withdraw  its Blue Helmets from the occupied areas of Croatia, and perhaps  also from Bosnia, are not aimed against the Serbs, but above all  against Washington. Paris is dissatisfied with the fact that the  United States did not put as much pressure on the Muslims as was  necessary for them to accept the division of Bosnia, which  basically guarantees Serbia recognition of the results of its  war of conquest.    In Britain the situation is more unfavorable in the sense  that the orientation of the intellectual elite (educated at  Oxford and Cambridge) is still profoundly pro-Serb,  pro-Karadjordjevic, so that one can hardly expect any movements  towards a new policy there. The statements by former Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher are only the exception to the rule  (incidentally, she does not come from the milieu of the  Cambridge-Oxford intelligentsia).    So, if the Americans were to embark on an extremely severe  course toward the Serbs in Bosnia and indeed in the former  Yugoslavia in general, that would necessarily bring them into  conflict with their European allies, with France and Britain  first of all. That would also jeopardize the minimum consensus  achieved in NATO already with the military threats to the Serbs,  which would not have been possible without the active support of  Paris. In a word: It is not possible at all to expect that the  Americans would risk their relations with their European allies  because of Bosnia, nor Croatia either, especially since this is  nevertheless a European problem and a European conflict.    3. Third, relations with Russia are an equally crucial  limiting factor. Even though the Clinton administration no  longer looks so naively on Moscow as was the case before  Clinton's visit to Russia early in the year, it nevertheless is  interested in as much partnership as is possible, that is, in  only as much confrontation as is inevitable. First, because it  always could be worse with Russia and because Yeltsin has no  alternative for the present. Anything else would make Russia  still less predictable, and, given the huge nuclear potential  which that country possesses, this could give rise to a global  danger. In a dual sense: directly in the form of Russian  military and political imperialism, and second, through the  uncontrolled spread of nuclear weapons and technology even into  the so-called "terrorist zones of the world."    Since Russia has up to now been standing behind Serbia, and  no one doubts that it will continue to do so, and since indeed  it itself has its own strategic interests in the Balkans, it is  clear that any radical course toward the Serbs would lead the  United States into confrontation with Russia. A confrontation  which in theory the United States ought not to fear, but which  Washington does not find sufficient national motives for and  which Clinton is simply neither psychologically nor politically  prepared for nor capable of.    4. All those limitations certainly do not mean that the  United States does not have interests on the soil of the former  Yugoslavia and will not attempt to pursue them. But certainly  not in the fashion that the victims of Serbian aggression have  at times imagined.    Washington objectively awakened from its Bosnian lethargy  the  moment when the Russians, following the Sarajevo ultimatum,  "marched into Bosnia" uninvited. In the White House, which  unfortunately is more preoccupied with U.S. health reform and  Clinton's real or fabricated romances and financial dealings,  they suddenly became aware of the fact that the Russians were  right there and right then! From that moment on the United  States has been attempting to halt that Serbian-Russian westward  spread through some kind of a new Yalta, and doing so with  methods and means that follow from the limitations and  self-limitations of U.S. policy in the Balkans we have  described. That is the moment when the idea was born of creating  the Muslim-Croat federation and later the confederation with  Croatia (which only then was becoming realistically possible!).    The goal in this, as can be seen, was for that Bosnian  federation, Croatia, then Macedonia, certainly Albania and  Greece, to fall into the western and U.S. sphere of interest,  although the last of these is pro-Serb, but, most essential for  the United States, it is a member of NATO. Although those states  do not make up a compact geographic zone, they nevertheless  guarantee U.S. control of the Mediterranean and indeed the  Adriatic, since the Croatian coast has become intact. This  actually frustrates the Russian outlet to the sea to a more  serious extent, since Kotor Bay is no serious point of support  in this respect, especially since everything else is under  someone else's control.    5. At the same time this explains why the Americans were so  yielding in Geneva concerning those 7 percent to the detriment  of the Muslim-Croat federation. The problem of the Americans is  not so much what is going to happen to a few thousand square  kilometers as how to get the Muslims to accept a peace plan  based on recognizing the results of the Serbian conquest without  exerting great pressure on them.    For them the essential thing is for the Muslim-Croat  federation to be large enough to survive and therefore perform  the role which Washington has assigned it. In addition, at that  lowest level of protection of Muslim-Croat interests in Bosnia  it is also possible to achieve, without major confrontation,  that accommodation with the Russians we have spoken of, as well  as agreement with Paris and London, and, finally, with Belgrade  and Pale.    Finally, the Americans have openly told Sarajevo that they  do  not intend to wage war on its behalf and that the solution must  be found at the negotiating table. To be sure, there are signs  that Washington would gladly remove the embargo on arms  deliveries to the Muslims, as well as to the Croats, which in  future would probably turn the situation to the advantage of the  present victims of the Serbian aggression. But is difficult to  believe that that will happen, since Paris and London are  strictly against removing the embargo, and Moscow has already  threatened countermeasures, which could particularly hurt the  Americans in a region as sensitive for them as, say, the Persian  Gulf.    6. Accordingly, we should not anticipate any greater U.S.  commitment when it comes to helping Croatia integrate those  occupied areas into its body as a political state. Today more or  less all serious observers and analysts are cautioning that they  see no way of forcing the Serbs to give up occupation and  secession. Especially since it is in the interest of France and  Britain for Croatia to remain "occupied" in this way. It is  generally held that there are two realistic solutions. The first  is for the occupied areas to remain a part of the Croatian state  only formally, while in actuality and in future they remain  under full Serb authority, that is, under Belgrade, with the  possibility of subsequent annexation to a Great Serbia. That is  why some of the observers hold that it is perhaps better for  Croatia not to make any concessions to the Serbs in the  direction of territorial-political autonomy, in hopes that in  that way they might come into possession of their occupied  areas. According to that version, it is better to keep things  open and wait perhaps for other times. That of course carries a  certain risk, especially with respect to possible pressures from  outside and Serb military provocations.    The other solution, which observers inclined toward Croatia  are afraid of, might be that in the end-game, as part of a peace  solution for Bosnia and Croatia, Croatia would be compelled to  give up its occupied territories, along with the minimal  possibility of a correction to its advantage, which would be in  the area of Osijek, western Slavonia, and the Zadar hinterland.  The Americans would certainly be in favor of that correction,  and it would guarantee integrity of the transportation system.    7. Kinkel's rather surprising demand, for the present the  only one of its kind, that is, that Croatia be accorded reentry  into the financial and business arrangements of the European  Union because of its demonstrated cooperativeness, was mainly  interpreted along those lines in Bonn. Minister Kinkel himself,  who really is sincerely interested in Croatia recovering its  occupied areas, seems to be realizing more and more that he  cannot gain allies for something like that on the international  scene. And Germany is unable to go it alone against all the rest.    It is for that reason, it is being said, that he wants to  "bring" the European Union to compensate Croatia for the  occupation with financial, i.e., economic, aid. Probably also  with the muffled hope that solid financial injections into  Croatia might perhaps have a sobering effect in the occupied  areas. It is believed that Germany might succeed in that, and  there are two reasons why. Most of the funds which the European  Union would possibly donate to Croatia would be German anyway,  since Bonn is paying the most into the Brussels treasury.  Second, France and Britain would consent to this, since Croatia,  and this is the most important thing to them, would still remain  "occupied."    8. Of course, just as events are unfolding in the field, so  political ideas and intentions are also subject to process. The  situation for the present seems to be as we have described it.  But that does not mean that this will necessarily still be the  case in six months or even later. Especially since the Croatian  position in the world has been strengthened and stabilized since  the Washington agreement, above all in the sense that the Serbs,  who bear the main responsibility for the war and the aggression,  have themselves remained out in the international cold. To be  sure, they still have fairly persistent and strong protectors,  but, as we have said, things are never completely glued together.</p>

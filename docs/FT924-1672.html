			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Industrial protests increase in Poland INDUSTRIAL PROTEST grew in Poland yesterday as more than half the country's coal miners went on strike and railway workers in Silesia, the country's industrial heartland, threatened to disrupt transport of freight, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Steel unions meet today to consider whether to join the protests, which aim to force the government to address the region's industrial restructuring needs. The strikers, led by Solidarity and supported by other local unions, are demanding that energy price rises this year and next be fully compensated with wage increases. The region accounts for 70 per cent of Poland's rail freight traffic and strike leaders see selected stoppages as a means of putting pressure on the government. But pithead coal stocks and power station reserves are high, giving the government a temporary advantage. It has yet to respond to the strikers' demands, Solidarity said yesterday. The strikes started on Monday with a two-hour national token stoppage by Solidarity in support of the wage rises. By yesterday afternoon 45 of Poland's 70 coal mines had stopped, as the stoppages spread spontaneously. Coal miners won significant pay increases after intermittent strikes in the summer and their wages this year have risen in real terms by 2 per cent against a 5 per cent real incomes drop throughout manufacturing industry. Forecasts see real wages staying at this year's levels in 1993.</p>

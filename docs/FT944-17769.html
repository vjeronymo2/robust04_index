			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: British Thornton shares take 32% tumble Shares in British Thornton Holdings, the packaging and specialist furniture group, tumbled 24p to 51p, a 32 per cent drop, following a warning that pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 were likely to be 'significantly below market expectations'. Analysts said the company was not on track to achieve the estimated Pounds 2.6m year-end figure. For the first half of 1993-94 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.15m, with Pounds 2.11m for the year to April 30. Volumes in the video games industry, particularly in the UK, had not recovered as expected, said Mr Brian North, chairman. The group's subsidiaries, Masterform and Masterpack, which make packaging and display materials, relied heavily on the industry. Mr North said video games sales were weighted towards the pre-Christmas shopping season and so it was difficult to predict the extent of any recovery in the second half. However, the company 'remained confident' of the market's long-term potential. It was seeking to develop closer links with Sega with a view to producing packaging and displays for a broader range of its products. The group is committed to expanding its non-Sega business and has won some new accounts, including Polygram.</p>

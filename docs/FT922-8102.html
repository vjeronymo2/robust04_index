			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Heseltine reaffirms mergers policy MR Michael Heseltine signalled yesterday that his move to the Department of Trade and Industry would not presage an early change in the government's competition-based approach to monopolies and mergers. The president of the board of trade made no direct reference to the present takeover battle for Midland between Lloyds bank and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. But his reaffirmation of the so-called 'Tebbit doctrine' is likely to be welcomed by Mr William Purves, the Hongkong chairman, who urged the government not to move the 'goalposts' of its competition policy. It will also win approval in the City where there has been disquiet over suggestions that he might want to take broader judgments of 'national interest' into account when assessing takeovers. Mr Heseltine restated, in a parliamentary answer, the doctrine which establishes the impact on competition as the main criterion for decisions on whether proposed mergers should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In his reply, Mr Heseltine referred to both the statement on merger policy set out in 1988 DTI white paper and the 1973 Fair Trading Act. He quoted the white paper as saying: 'The government's policy is that the main, though not exclusive, consideration in determining whether mergers should be referred to the MMC should be their potential effect on competition.' Mr Heseltine then added: 'This remains the position.' Replying to a question from Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman, Mr Heseltine said that the Fair Trading Act of 1973 required the MMC to take into account 'all matters which appear to them in the particular circumstances to be relevant in determining whether a merger or proposed merger operates or may be expected to operate against the public interest'. This meant that competition was an important consideration, though not the only one, in the monopolies commission's deliberations. Mr Heseltine's comments suggest that for the moment he has decided against adopting publicly wider criteria - including calculations of the national interest - for government policies on mergers. But the careful phrasing also suggests that he has left open the possibility of individual referrals on grounds other than competition. Mr Purves said yesterday he would be 'very disappointed' if Hongkong's bid for Midland, which is being examined at European Community-level, was referred to UK competition authorities. 'I would think the goalposts had been moved,' he said, emerging from a meeting with some 40 Conservative backbenchers. He said it would not be good for investment in Britain if current government policy was changed in any way. Lloyds 'faces two-year wait', Page 21</p>

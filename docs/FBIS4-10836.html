			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Juan Triana Cordovi, PRENSA LATINA </F> contributor and specialist at the Center for Cuban Economic  Studies: "Changes in the Cuban Economy: Self-Employment"]    [Text] [no dateline as received] More than forcing the  adoption of measures, cicumstances have compelled reflection and  swift but cautious action in applying basic economic operating  principles to the Cuban economy.    Within the ensemble of measures adopted so far,  self-employment and the resolution that regulates it comprise an  important step in stimulating and promoting each individual's  creative initiative and in resolving a number of community  problems that the state currently cannot resolve. Historically  -- because of organizational reasons, lack of control, and the  absence of alertness and rationale -- these problems have been  resolved in neither an efficient manner nor in keeping with the  community's needs.    This process of developing self-employment is a clear signal  of flexibility and pragmatism. It expresses something deeper --  that is, to address and resolve economic problems through  equitable methods without returning to administrative and  bureaucratic styles that have already been shown not to work.    The measure's economic significance will be proven by its  ability to absorb part of the official and unrecorded  unemployment the economic crisis and adjustment measures have  aggravated and will predictably aggravate in the future; to  reduce the fiscal burden and its impact on the GNP; to stimulate  small enterprises and services; and, in turn, to discreetly  improve the people's standard of living. Moreover, this measure  is greater than the sum of its parts; it is important because of  the synergy it can generate when implemented along with other  measures already in place or measures that will be implemented  in the future.    We must not overlook that like every other economic measure,  this measure, along with its benefits, will also generate a  series of disagreeable effects that must be corrected in due  time.    The following analysis is only a first draft of the study of  a very new phenomena that ultimately and undoubtably will  benefit the economy and Cuban society.    The promulgation of the decree-law overrides and somehow  negates an old and tiresome controversy (in Cuba) concerning the  theoretical question of whether or not monetary-commercial  relations should be used to build socialism.    Consequently, the resolution on self-employment means  promoting private initiative to satisfy the needs of the  population based on market economy mechanisms.    Likewise, any automatic association between the existence of  private enterprise and the market with social anarchy is also  proven wrong by recognizing that order, organization, and  control are key factors for the adequate functioning of this  phenomenon.    Planning, organization, and control methods, as well as ways  and means, cannot be based on a single or set pattern or be  divorced from the community's reality.    Requirements from control mechanisms, state institutions,  government, and the population (as clients) will be based on  legal, economic, and health regulations, in accordance with the  limits imposed by the market. Trying to establish prices,  quantities, and the quality of production and services without  taking into consideration the real economic needs would be a  mistake. The idea is not to subordinate to the market but,  rather, to use the market in a necessarily intelligent and  flexible manner.    The liberties granted to local governments can play a  significant role (nonadministrative) in creating  socio-psychological and political conditions to encourage  initiative and creativity to exploit the economic, political,  and social reserves that this economic measure entails. In this  regard, the regulations issued by the provincial government of  the city of Havana can contribute to expanding and consolidating  this new activity when contractual relations between  self-employed workers and state enterprises (in other words,  between socialist systems and systems of private ownership) with  regard to the sale on consignment of products by the  self-employed, rental of buildings or space within a building,  and rental of space in public areas or places and sites of  festivities and fairs.    Self-employment will be effective to the extent that the  supply of products and services it generates is stable and  systematic. This aspect is linked to sources supplying the  products necessary for this activity.    The stability and authenticity of supplies is undoubtedly  one  of the aspects that could be questioned. A stable supply of  component parts would be the result of a combination of personal  resources obtained through legal individual efforts; local,  territorial, and state efforts; and so on. The process must  develop with state supplies and legal supplies obtained outside  the free market and speculation.    It is relevant, however, to analyze some aspects that could  become deterrents to growth in production and income that this  law could promote.    The way in which the measure is explained in the resolution  introduces a sense that it is possible that the measure could  negatively affect the expansion of this activity, which is  considered necessary in light of today's reality in the nation.    The total prohibition imposed on university professionals  who  are not allowed to work on their own could be a negative factor  for the efforts to improve the country's economy, considering  they represent a large number in relation to the size of the  economy and their predictable structural reorganization. The  Cuban state has always guaranteed professionals employment and a  salary. Today, however, this is extremely difficult, and in  some cases only a nominal salary can be guaranteed and graduates  are not given jobs commensurate with their individual  aspirations.    Authorizing these professionals to perform said duties  would represent an alternate way of promoting the satisfaction  of those interests, encouraging creativity, and their employment  in tasks that would have a direct repercussion on the  population. This would also signify an alleviation of the  fiscal situation, although not significant.    If in fact the elimination of worker subsidies (because of  the current economic difficulties) in proportion to the amount  of the income is perfectly appropriate, it does not seem  possible to implement at least in the near future, given the  impossibility to corroborate the amount of earned income.    If in fact the prohibition for unemployed persons in areas  with a deficit of state workers to accept such chores turns out  to be explicable, it is not the adequate solution for such a  deficit, and it introduces an external economic element as a  solution for a problem that can be resolved within the framework  of the economy.    The territorialization [territorializacion] of solutions is  undoubtedly a fact that allows flexibility in the process. It  can also turn into some kind of restraint, based on subjective  interpretations of particular local situations.    For instance, the regulations of the provincial government  of  the city of Havana establish a suspension in the issuance of new  self-employed work permits for producers of fast foods,  collector-vendor of agriculture products, producer of dairy  products, collector of raw materials, and chauffeur, all of  whose tasks generate supply of goods and services that are  scarce in the capital and impossible to provide through the  state supply.    The law makes no reference to family work. Nevertheless,  self-employed work in many of the permitted activities in fact  tends to lead to family organization in its execution.    State control over the commercialization process, although  necessary, could also become a factor of constraint, and it  somehow contradicts the acknowledgement of the supply and demand  mechanism to set prices.    In the meantime, the lack of reference prices in many  activities or otherwise the general alteration of the relative  price system established by the current situation questions the  determination of the high nature of any price.    With regard to middlemen, the expansion of these tasks  generates naturally the appearance of these occupations so in  the future it would be preferable to regulate them.  <H5>  The Economic Dimension of Self-Employed Work </H5>   Time is still too short to quantify the effect of this  measure in great detail. However, some reflections on this  issue would be interesting. The measure is promulgated within a  very complex context, in which the depth of the economic crisis  gives it an apparent tactical character (which the very text of  the resolution somehow asserts).    However, the character and dimension of this crisis, which  exceed what is merely circumstantial and turn it into an event  of deep structural importance, gives it a significance that  exceeds what is simply tactical.    It, thus, has to do with the impossibility of enjoying the  advantageous relations that the country had with the socialist  sector, the need to insert itself into world economy, and the  impossibility of upholding the socialist development that had  been predominant throughout all these years, which has obliged  reevaluating different types of socioeconomic methods to be able  to maintain the achievements of socialism.    As long as the national economy is in the process of  improving its efficiency and the government sector remains  preponderant, self-employed work must become not only an  alternative to supply, wherever it is insufficient, but also an  economic activity which, due to its dimensions and the manner in  which it relates to the rest of the economy, cannot be carried  out efficiently by government production organizations.    In addition, the state's reorganization, which has to be  implemented to augment said efficiency, will also oblige it to  redefine sectors and types of production in this field and to  readjust the forms of operation in accordance with efficiency  parameters that are indispensable to survive and progress.  Self-employed work is also a "mattress" that will help soften  the negative effects of such readjustments. In this sense, it  is good to point out that up to the first days of last December,  there were, according to some estimates that have not been  officially confirmed, approximately 100,000 self-employed  workers throughout the country.    Should the average annual income be 5,000 pesos  (undoubtedly a conservative figure), its impact on the GDP would  amount to 500 million pesos; that is, about 5 percent of a 10  billion [currency not specified] PSG [expansion unknown] budget.  Should the predictions made by some officials who believe that  there will be 300,000 self-employed workers in 1994 materialize  and should we estimate an average annual income of 4,000 pesos,  then the resulting 1.2 billion pesos, a very significant amount  for the national economy, would represent 12 percent of the GDP.    In terms of employment figures, these potential 300,000  self-employed workers represent 8.5 percent of the country's  work force. In this case, however, we must take into account  that there are some state workers included in this figure. At  any rate, the amount is not insignificant in this scenario  either.    Finally, we will have to consider the fiscal effect of this  measure. Given the current estimate of the fiscal deficit and  the fixed taxes levied on these activities, which average 36  pesos in taxes per activity, collections will amount to about  3.5 million pesos, which in turn increases the revenues of the  secondary budget [presupuesto no significativo]. This is why  tax collection must be reconsidered as far as conditions allow  it.    Should tax collection reach 10 percent of total revenues  created by this sector and using the aforementioned 1.2 billion  pesos as a base, the difference with the collection level that  is currently charging fixed taxes would be substantial, and the  120 million [currency not specified] contribution to the budget  would represent 3 percent of the current budgetary deficit.  <H5>  The Political Effect </H5>   The political meaning of this economic measure is not less  important. Along with other internal measures such as the  decriminalization of foreign exchange tenure and the  reorganization of agricultural production methods, it would also  mean the recognition of the starring role that the population is  playing with regard to these changes, whether as subject or as  object.    This creative initiative phenomenon by a population segment  introduces a new and clear element to the shaping of the  popularity of the economic politics of resistance and  development that was implemented as a result of the worsening of  the current economic crisis and broadens the concept of national  unity. On that ground, such phenomenon can contribute to  maintaining national consensus and the identification with the  revolutionary project.    This contribution would be possible as far as the dynamics  of  this process serves as a demonstration, whereby the population  will be able to understand that the material and spiritual  well-being must be forged by the creative work and initiative of  each one of us, without expecting that all our needs and  expectations could be met by the socialist state, as has been  the case so far.    These measures reintroduce an old economic policy: the  relations among the individual, collective, and social issues in  the pursuit of national interests.    The balance of this system of interests is vital for the  economic reconstruction of the country. To assume that social  issues can survive without considering individual interests is  as old as falling into the old liberalism trap and accepting  that what is good for the individual is also good for society.  The same mistake would be made if collective and social issues  were routinely identified. The balance among these three systems  of interests lies in recognizing the place that each one of them  occupies in the economic arena and in the national  sociopolitical weave. This is a very difficult task that will  require constantly using the trial and error test as a suitable  identification formula. Time and the government's ability to  work out this system of interests without affecting the dynamics  of each one of us will allow us to evaluate the real  connotations of this measure.</p>

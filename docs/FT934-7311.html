			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Toyota to buy in GM cars TOYOTA is to sell some General Motors cars in Japan under its own name, giving the US carmaker the greatest access of any foreign manufacturer to the Japanese car market. Though the deal is expected to result in the sale of only 20,000 vehicles a year from 1996 onwards, it still gives a boost to US car makers' attempts to break into the Japanese market. The big three US companies sold only 14,093 US-produced vehicles between them in Japan last year. Under the deal, concluded yesterday, Toyota will buy GM's Cavalier cars and ship them to Japan on carriers which otherwise would return empty after bringing Japanese cars to the US. The cars will be sold as Toyotas through the company's 5,000-strong dealership, the biggest vehicle distribution network in Japan. Mr John Smith, GM's chief executive, said the deal showed 'the US has closed the competitive gap with Japan and is now in a position to build these global vehicles that can compete any place in the world'.</p>

At a meeting with journalists following the conference,  Antii  Vuorinen from Finland said that the radiation danger still  plagues the Baltic Sea region. To reduce that danger, it is  necessary that the newly freed Baltic states join with  agreements that have previously been concluded with the Soviet  Union. These would include agreements on curbing the  proliferation of nuclear substances and, in case of danger,  making information available promptly. Vuorinen was pleased that  the problem of removing nuclear waste from Paldiski is close to  being solved.    Foreign ministry advisor Mark Sinisoo elaborated on his  remark. Namely, the working group had received new data on  several of the problems recently. To remove nuclear waste from  Paldiski, Russia wants to use a brand new TK-18 type of  container that has never been used for that purpose before. This  is why they have to be tested, which is to be done in March.  What if Russia's nuclear monitoring agency should declare them  unfit?    Russia, at this time, does also not have a policy for  storing  nuclear waste, and this needs to be coordinated with the  government. Besides, this policy supposedly also depends on the  availability of money and on Russia's so-called `global nuclear  problems.' By way of consolation: The Paldiski issue will not be  coming to a standstill because of these snags.    The working group also discussed Sillamae and matters  related to radioactive beacons. Other news pertaining to the  not-so-secret Salaspilsis reactor in Latvia (a science-oriented  facility) revealed that it uses 90-percent enriched uranium. The  latter presents quite a hazard.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: GREAT WHITE "TWICE SHY." CAPITOL **: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> This group of old school rock 'n' rollers kicks back on its latest LP and tries  for more of a pop angle. It keeps a few of the metal trappings -- a guitar  crunch here, some bump-and-grind drums there -- so it won't lose its hard rock  audience, but songs like "Move It" and "House of Broken Love" seem obviously  slated for the Top 40 crowd. When tattooed party dude Jack Russell attempts to  pass himself off as a sensitive guy by warbling "The Angel Song," it just plain  doesn't work. Great White needs to get real and get down.JANISS GARZA  </P></p>

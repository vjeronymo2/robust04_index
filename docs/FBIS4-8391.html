			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Victoria Stegic] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, April 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic said Wednesday he was "cancelling" all  agreements signed with the United Nations as international  mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg flew into Sarajevo  to try to defuse the crisis.    In a letter to UN chief Butrus Butrus-Ghali Karadzic said he  was cancelling all accords signed by the Serb side in the  Bosnian conflict prior to NATO airstrikes launched at the  weekend against Serb forces attacking the eastern enclave of  Gorazde, the SRNA news agency reported.    "All of the accords that have been signed and the positive  efforts, based on trust, are cancelled and we must interpret the  behaviour of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) as coming from a  potential enemy force," Karadzic said in his letter.    He added that the strikes by warplanes of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation against Bosnian Serb positions in the  government-held Gorazde pocket could be not justified and meant  that the United Nations was siding with Bosnia's Moslems.    As such, he added, "relations between us can no longer be as  they were before this thoughtless act."    Karadzic said Butrus-Ghali should understand that the Serbs  "could no longer cooperate" with the UNPROFOR command and said  they would have to be "more careful regarding UNPROFOR troop  movements and any equipment they transport."    The airstrikes and other "hostile acts" toward the Serbs  must  "cease immediately," he warned.    About 40 UN observers based in Serb-controlled areas in  Bosnia were placed under house arrest following the NATO raids  in Gorazde Sunday and Monday.    UN peacekeepers have also been blocked in weapons collection  points throughout the UN-imposed exclusion zone around Sarajevo.  The Serbs have reportedly placed mines near these points.    An AFP reporter observed Wednesday that a UN convoy was  still  held up at a checkpoint near the village of Kubiljaca, around 30  kilometres (18 miles) from Sarajevo, by Serb policemen who had  placed a dozen anti-tank mines in front of the leading  transporter and behind the three trucks that were following it.    The convoy was stopped on Sunday "for customs reasons," the  Swedish commanding officer said.    Meanwhile the Geneva conference co-presidents, Owen for the  European Community and Thorvald [Stoltenberg] for the United  Nations, arrived here amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed  at defusing the crisis.    They went immediately to the headquarters of the UNPROFOR  chief in Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose, for talks  with U.S. special envoy Charles Redman and Russian envoy Vitaliy  Churkin.    Later they were to hold talks with the Bosnian authorities,  a  government spokesman said.    UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and the UN Protection Force  chief in former Yugoslavia, General Bertrand de Lapresle, were  also due in Sarajevo later in the day, arriving from Belgrade  following talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,  UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said.    On Tuesday they had attempted without success to travel to  Pale for talks with Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.    Churkin was making his third visit to Sarajevo in as many  days, arriving from the Serb stronghold of Pale, 20 kilometres  (12 miles) east of the Bosnian capital, where he has been in  talks with separatist Serb leaders.    Talks aimed at securing an overall ceasefire in Bosnia-  Herzegovina have stalled following a UN threat to order air  strikes against Serb forces unless they pull back from their  assault on Gorazde, a UN-designated safe area.</p>

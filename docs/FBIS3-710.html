According to an independent Niger newspaper quoted by  the NIGER NEWS AGENCY [ANP], the coup plot was aimed at  arresting the head of state, the prime minister, the speaker of  the National Assembly and his first deputy, and the chief of  Army staff. The operation was slated for last night at the  mosque where the grand prayer of the Night of Power was  scheduled to take place.

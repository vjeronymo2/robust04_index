			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Beazer beats the retreat FT-SE Index: 2,503.8 (+13.0) The planned break-up of Beazer suggests that yet another grandiose folly of the late 1980s is about to be disentangled the hard way. Shareholders are to be offered shares in the original UK business, thereby being asked to pay for their old company all over again. The rest - the grand global strategy erected on the UK base - is implicitly worthless. Or perhaps not quite: if, as Beazer suggests, the original business is worth Pounds 500m, the group's present market capitalisation of Pounds 525m values the rest, including the Dollars 1.7bn Koppers acquisition, at just Pounds 25m. After the split, the old shares will consist of a half entitlement to the UK business and a punt on Koppers' future. Since US ownership of Beazer is now some 50 per cent and rising, it can be assumed that the company represented by the old shares will end up US-owned and probably US-domiciled. The new company will doubtless be UK-owned and eventually floated in its entirety. Until more details are known, the whole can scarcely be valued. Much will depend on whether the UK company will be independently run, rather than subject to fresh empire-building by the old management. Even more will depend on whether the flotation itself goes smoothly. The cash target of Pounds 250m is ambitious, but may be essential in the context of net debt still close to Pounds 800m. The snag is that the way things are going, by the third quarter of the year new equity in UK construction companies could be something of a glut on the market.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Video-on-demand set for homes test Oracle, the US software company, said yesterday that it planned to launched limited trials of its video-on-demand system, Media Server, in the UK within the next few months. The system, which can handle thousands of transactions a second in audio, video and text, is being evaluated by British Telecommunications. Oracle plans to launch its first video-on-demand experimental service for around 60 homes in the Ipswich area in the spring. Mr Jim Abrahamson, chairman of Oracle Corporation, which had revenues of Dollars 1.5bn in the year to May, promised that a more extensive trial involving 250,000 homes in Washington DC would go ahead later this year following the announcement of a joint development deal with Bell Atlantic, the US telephone company. Video-on-demand services allow consumers to order the film or television programme of their choice to be relayed down conventional telephone lines or cable television networks. The technology was based on 'massively parallel processing' - a system containing several thousand microprocessors so that 1,700 different films could be played out for different customers at the same time. Oracle said yesterday that if 1m homes were connected, the cost of the system - including the black box in the home needed to convert the signal - would be Pounds 50 a year for each home. A commercial presentation in London organised by Oracle attracted around 1,000 people from the UK and other European countries. This was an indication of the interest in what is known in the US as 'information superhighways'. Apart from video-on demand, the system can also be used for other services, from home shopping to home banking.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / More voting in Ukraine Elections to fill the final third of Ukraine's new parliament were held yesterday. If the remaining 112 seats are won by democrats and moderates, they could wrest control of the 450-seat body from the Communists and their left-wing allies. However, democratic organisations have failed to present a united campaign. 'The democrats have not learned their lessons,' said Mr Yaropolk Kulchyckyj, Kiev head of the US-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems. 'They are again fighting against each other. Communists can slip through into the lead.' The empty seats are a result of Ukraine's inefficient electoral law, which only managed to elect 338 MPs in two rounds of voting last March and April. Many of the vacant seats are in metropolitan districts, often empty at weekends which could mean a low turnout. With nine candidates on average per district, even the central election commission has predicted these elections will go to a second round on August 7.</p>

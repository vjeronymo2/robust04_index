			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kamran Qurah Dafghi: "Israel and Iraq"] </F>   [Text] This is not the first time that Iraq leaks to the  press that it is secretly contacting Israel through  European-Palestinian go-betweens. This time around, in a  departure from the previous time, Baghdad apparently chose a  European capital, rather than Amman, to leak the "information"  and opted for a French rather than a Palestinian mediator as a  conduit between it and Israel; apparently to lend validity to  the leak.    The first time was six months ago when the Iraqis leaked  through Jordanian newsmen that Baghdad would be willing to  patriate some 400,000 Palestinian residents of South Lebanon in  return for Israeli intercession with the United States to lift  the economic embargo of Iraq.    First of all, that contacts with Israel are no longer an  Arab  no-no and the Iraqi regime did not have to shroud such contacts  in secrecy. That has not been a problem since "Madrid." Secrecy  has been meaningless since the Oslo talks and no longer seems to  create a magical aura. Furthermore, the Iraqi regime is not one  to shy away from any action that would deliver it from its  current isolation.    The question here is not whether Iraq is secretly seeking to  contact Israel. Rather, it is whether Israel would agree and  whether it would serve its interests to do so. The answer lies  in such questions as: Is Israel willing to create a problem,  even a crisis, with the United States for the sake of a regime  that Washington and its allies in the West, and particularly in  the region, consider a threat to their interests and security?    What could Israel, at a time when it is pre-occupied with  the  peace process and the negotiations with the Palestinians,  possibly gain by contacts with a regime whose validity is at a  low ebb; which is isolated from the Arabs and from other  countries of the region and of the world; and which no longer  has any political, military, or moral weight and whose continued  existence is a burden to the region and to the rest of the  world? The only possible outcome of such contacts would be to  create complications for Israel, for the Americans, and for the  Palestinians and other Arabs.    The peace process, therefore, would not be served under  these  circumstances if any of the parties concerned embroiled itself  in secret contacts with Baghdad. The problem is that it is in  Baghdad's interest to seek contacts with Israel and with any  other party that could help it escape its isolation. But, what  can an isolated regime like Baghdad's do to gain Israeli  acceptance and willingness to help it in its crisis and despair?    Iran is the only card that Saddam believes to be meaningful  to Israel. Truth is, the Iraqi president has never ceased to  allude to that card in order to entice the United States to  forgive him on the premise that any other regime would mean that  Tehran could extend its influence to Iraq; and that the  constancy of his regime is therefore the only guarantee against  the Iranian threat to Israel and to the peace process. This  reasoning is practically the only argument underlying Iraq's  current diplomatic campaign to lift or ease the embargo against  it. This premise has been emphasized by Tariq 'Aziz in all his  meetings two weeks ago with members of the Security Council.    It is unfortunate for Saddam Husayn that his premise was not  seriously "bought" either by Israel, which denied six months  ago, and still does, that it is in contact with Iraq; or by the  United States to which Baghdad had previously relayed its desire  to contact Israel. Israel has determined that it is in its best  interests to support Washington's "dual containment" policy  towards both Iraq and Iran. The only distinction is that a  dialogue between Washington and the regime in Tehran is not  being spurned.    It behooves everyone to abandon those flights of fancy  perpetuated by the Baghdad regime. The only practical long-range  strategy to isolate fundamentalism and bolster the process of  peace and security in the region can be provided only by an Iraq  that derives its strength from a peaceful system of multipartite  democracy.</p>

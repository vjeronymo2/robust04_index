			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Foreign groups fear tax assault by Democrats: New Congress may tighten transfer price rules FOREIGN companies with subsidiaries in the US are waiting anxiously for the result of Tuesday's presidential election, expecting a new assault on their US profits if Governor Bill Clinton wins. Regardless of who wins, the next Congress is expected to try to raise more revenue from foreign corporations by tightening the rules on the transfer prices at which companies ship goods to their US subsidiaries. But Governor Clinton has used the assumption that he can raise an extra Dollars 45bn over four years from foreign companies as one of the cornerstones of his Dollars 50bn a year investment plan. Mr Clinton is not alone in eyeing this source of new revenue. Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, has pencilled in Dollars 21.4bn of additional revenue over the five years from 1994 to 1998 from tighter transfer pricing rules. Bashing foreign corporations is good politics, but the target may be more tempting than realistic. Mr Harry Gutman, chief of staff of the non-partisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, told a recent tax seminar in Belgium that his committee does not consider the Clinton figure accurate. Tax lawyers and accountants, as well as officials from the Internal Revenue Service, agree that both Mr Perot's and Mr Clinton's estimates wildly exceed any realistic expectation. Their forecasts range from Dollars 168m to a maximum of Dollars 3bn a year. If Mr Clinton is exaggerating the jackpot by between 10 and 50 times, as these officials calculate, the basis of his budget plans starts to look very shaky. Complaints that foreign companies are abusing the transfer pricing rules to evade US taxes have been based largely on studies showing that foreign companies pay lower taxes, as a proportion of their sales, than US companies. Particularly galling to congressmen is the fact that around 72 per cent of foreign businesses in the US do not pay any corporation tax. The Organisation for International Investment (Ofii), a Washington-based group of foreign companies, argues that taxes paid by foreign companies as a proportion of net worth or of assets are as high as or higher than those paid by US companies. Even if the whole discrepancy were attributable to transfer pricing abuses, IRS figures show that closing the tax gap would only provide an additional Dollars 3bn a year - not the Dollars 9bn Governor Clinton expects in 1993. A more aggressive approach towards taxing foreign companies is sitting on the table in Congress in the shape of a draft bill floated as a discussion document last summer by Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, and Mr Bill Gradison, the senior Republican member of the committee. That bill suggests arbitrarily taxing foreign companies on the basis of the average profitability of US companies in their sector. This has drawn howls of outrage from a number of European countries as well as from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Paris-based grouping of industrialised countries. 'The across-the-board, minimum profit approach of the Rostenkowski bill is too much of a blunt instrument. It moves too far in sacrificing fairness for simplicity,' argues Mr Carr Ferguson, a tax lawyer at the New York firm of Davis, Polk and Wardwell. Mr Clinton has not backed the Rostenkowski approach, which could invite retaliation against US companies.</p>

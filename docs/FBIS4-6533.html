			<p>BFN     [Text] New york, April 20 (YONHAP) -- An official at the  North Korean mission to the United Nations reiterated Tuesday  that Pyongyang will not permit further inspections of its  nuclear sites before a third round of Washington-Pyongyang  high-level talks is held.    "We received all the inspections needed to guarantee the  continuity of safeguards that have been agreed with the United  States," said the North Korean official. "We are willing to  discuss the issue of additional, regular and special inspections  of our nuclear facilities and Pyongyang's return to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) once the third-round talks are  held."    Asked about the possibility of resuming working-level  meetings for further high-level talks between Washington and  Pyongyang, the official said that "it is not clear for now at  least. The important thing is that the United States suspend  Team Spirit (the annual South Korea-U.S. joint military  exercise) as Washington agreed Feb. 25 and hold the third round  of talks."</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Delhi acts to ease share market upset THE INDIAN finance ministry yesterday acted to end uncertainty in the country's stock markets caused by an income tax investigation into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of last year's Bombay securities scandal. Officials held meetings with representatives of the income tax office and of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the securities watchdog which is concerned that the tax probe should not disrupt normal market operations. Reports that the ministry had urged tax inspectors to conduct their investigation in a way which did not hurt investors' interests brought some relief to investors and brokers on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The index of leading stocks, which had fallen 130 points since the start of the week, dropped a further 41.44 yesterday to close at 2,580.24. But brokers took comfort that the index finished 23 points above its opening level when sentiment was at its gloomiest. They said confidence grew during the day as reports from Delhi, where the finance ministry meetings were being held, indicated that officials were taking investors' interests into consideration. Last night the ministry made clear seizures of shareholdings by the tax department were limited to identified shares of a few companies held in the names of specified persons. A statement said that 'transfers relating to genuine transactions by all genuine investors including institutional investors in respect of shares lodged for transfer with the companies covered by the provisional attachment orders will be freed from the existing curbs after the necessary formalities are completed.' The release said there was 'no reason for any apprehension in the minds of genuine investors or the broker community in this regard.' The income tax investigation began last year after Mr Mehta was arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rs42bn (Pounds 875m) scandal which rocked the Bombay securities market last year. Mr Mehta and other brokers were accused of trading illegally in the interbank securities market, often in collusion with bank employees, in order to syphon funds into the stock market. The tax probe disrupted the market this week when it emerged that the income tax authorities had frozen dealings in large blocks of stock, which they claimed were being held by 134 different individuals and companies on Mr Mehta's behalf. The affected stocks are shares in nine leading companies including ACC, a top cement producer, and Reliance Industries, a chemicals and textiles group.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Roy Strong has skirted perilously closely around the trapdoor reserved for TV show-offs in the first two of his Royal Gardens series (8.30 BBC2) but has not yet tumbled in. His accounts of Hampton Court and Kew have had as much to do with entertainment and history as with horticulture. Today he turns to the gardens created or remodelled by George IV: Brighton Pavilion, Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. As that finishes, assuming you can tear yourself away from the repeat of Blackadder Goes Forth (a considerable assumption) you can watch the first in a new Channel 4 series, Spirit Of Trees (9.00), which, it seems, is about precisely what it says. Episode 1 also goes to Windsor .. Today's Crime Story (9.00 ITV) is about a nasty and yet undeniably fascinating case involving newspaper proprietors' families. Criminals intending to kidnap Rupert Murdoch's wife snatched the wrong woman. Her body has never been found. The most fascinating aspect of Between The Lines is not the investigation of police corruption but the frantic sex life of the chief character, Tony Clark (9.30 BBC1).</p>

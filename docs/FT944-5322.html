			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: A glimpse of worlds within worlds - Wise, witty and fantastic fiction for older children The latest book by Gillian Cross, former winner of the Whitbread Children's Novel Award, is a tour-de-force. In New World (OUP, Pounds 9.99), two children, Miriam and Stuart, are given the task of testing out a new computer game: 'New World', the game, is shrouded in secrecy. Miriam and Stuart never meet, but play against each other on separate computer screens, tackling a terrifying electronic world of skeletons, cowboys, spiders and crocodiles. The intrigue extends beyond the game - a third child, a code-smasher, is trying to infiltrate the action. The tension in the novel arises from the race between the children to crack the puzzle, but each becomes aware of a more sinister side to an apparently innocent computer game. Eventually the children band together to defeat the megabuck company which is planning to flood the market with it. But Cross's book is more than just a thriller. It is a serious indictment of the addictive hold computer games can have over children. 'Miriam wanted to stand there gazing, until the doors opened again. Until she could get hack into the New World where she had been really alive and awake.' New World explores the children's increasing feelings of alienation, fear and paranoia as they dig deeper into the game - as a metaphor for drug addiction it is frightening; as a straight story it is a gripping piece of writing. Sylvia Waugh's Mennyms in the Wilderness (Julia MacRae, Pounds 9.99), a sequel to The Mennyms, is a different type of book altogether. The Mennyms are human-sized rag dolls who inhabit a house in suburbia. Since this is an English suburb, they have managed to keep themselves a secret for years but now their house is threatened by a new motorway and they must flee or be discovered. Help arrives in the form of a shy academic named Albert Pond who helps the Mennyms move to his crumbling ancestral home in the Dales. Putting a city family (albeit a rag-doll one) into the depths of the countryside allows Waugh all sorts of fun, but the charm of the book lies in the characters of the Mennyms - these are warm-hearted and loving, but, nonetheless, they bicker, fight, feel envy and fear. This is a wise, witty book, fantastic in a way that will appeal to the average nine or 10-year-old, but with enough domestic detail to make it instantly recognisable to a younger child. Necessary Parties by Barbara Dana (Oxford, Pounds 9.99) tells a story about divorcing parents and unhappy children. When his parents split up, Chris Mills, using as his guide the book The Rights of Young People, decides to take his parents to court on the grounds that they are irresponsibly wrecking the life of his younger sister, Jenny. He finds an eccentric young lawyer who charges a dollar for his services and, with the help of his lonely granddad and a car-owning friend, proceeds to build up the case against his parents. Necessary Parties has a happy ending which may make it a dangerous book to give to children whose families have irretrievably broken down, but it gives a forceful and much needed boost to the idea that children can be active participants in family life, and to the notion that divorce is not always the only answer. The most ambitious and inventive children's novel published this year must be Ian McEwan's The Daydreamer (Cape Pounds 8.99), in which Peter, an 11-year-old boy teetering on the edge of adolescence, inhabits a magical world of ideas and inventions. Like a domestic Attila the Hun, Peter's imagination runs riot amid the debris of family life: a pot of vanishing cream discovered in a drawer enables him to make his family disappear; a peculiarly horrible, balding, one-legged doll becomes a Jimmy Knapp-like presence in the nursery demanding better living conditions; and, one cold winter's day, envious of William's ability to sleep all day on a radiator, Peter swaps spirits with the family cat, feeling 'his whiskers springing out from the sides of his face . . . his tail curling behind him . . . and his fur . . . like the most comfortable of old woollen jumpers . . .' As a cat, Peter is an heroic figure, but when he gets inside the skin of Kenneth the baby, he becomes a victim of circumstance: 'He was just drawing breath to fill his lungs and bawl out his sorrow when something powerful clamped under his armpits and he shot fifty feet into the air. 'His mouth hung open, he was dribbling in his amazement. He was staring into his Aunt Laura's face which was as sheer and colossal as a cliff . . .' Peter, as Kenneth, is overwhelmed by sensation; the explosive taste of egg, the beauty of shadow patterns on a wall. Even Baa Baa Black Sheep seems suddenly interesting. This is the infant version of the Martian's postcard home, and a telling prelude to Peter's last metamorphosis - into a grown-up, sitting stolidly on a deckchair while his friends play on the beach below, having his first taste of coffee: 'It tasted foul, as if burnt cardboard had been mashed up and boiled in bathwater.' The Daydreamer is illustrated with eerie black and white drawings by Anthony Browne (who also reviews picture books for the Financial Times - see above). Browne makes a further appearance this winter in a large format picture edition of King Kong (Julia MacRae, Pounds 12.99). Gorillas have always figured strongly in his work, but Browne's version of the story by Edgar Wallace and Merian Cooper in which a giant, time-warped gorilla is pursued and captured by greedy entrepreneurs, takes the simian world to new heights of sophistication. Traumatic illustrations showing the agony of the captured King Kong, and his chilly depiction of an old New York crowded with sharp ladies and men wearing Homburg hats, make Browne's King Kong a classic in its own right.</p>

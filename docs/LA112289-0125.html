			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL SUPPORTS TENNIS CLUB, CONDOS  </P> <P> Reversing the Planning Commission, the City Council voted unanimously Tuesday  to support a 10-acre tennis club and 53 adjacent condominiums near the corner  of Camino Capistrano and Oso Road.  </P> <P> Concerned because the project adjoins the flood plain of the Oso and Trabuco  creeks, the council asked the developer to change the street and lot plan in  order to locate homes farther away from the creeks and to bring the plan back  for final approval.  </P> <P> "This may be the best we can hope to do," said Councilman Anthony L. Bland. "We  have to look at the willingness of the developer to put something on a  difficult piece of property."  </P> <P> The project includes 22 lighted tennis courts, a 20,000-square-foot clubhouse,  a public tennis academy, swimming pool and health spa adjoining a gated,  six-acre neighborhood.  </P> <P> The project, proposed by developer Cecil R. Bunnell and planned since 1986,  previously drew criticism from city officials and neighbors.  </P> <P> But the revised plan approved Tuesday night was supported by several residents  who said the city needs a second tennis club.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission last month unanimously rejected the proposal because it  included a plan to build 25 homes near Trabuco Creek, which is designated as  permanent open space.

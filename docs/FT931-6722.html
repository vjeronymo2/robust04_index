			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Revenue opens itself to more complaints A POWERFUL new post to be advertised by the Inland Revenue in the next few days should be good news for taxpayers with grievances. As part of the government's Citizen's Charter initiative, an independent 'revenue adjudicator' should be in post by May to cope with complaints from the public for periods after the start of the new tax year on April 6. The Revenue expects that person to receive 20 to 50 complaints each week. He or she will consider complaints about the way tax affairs have been handled, but will not be involved in hearing appeals on tax assessments. Appeals on tax are, ultimately, heard by the general and special commissioners for tax and by valuation tribunals, before heading into the courts on appeal. On the handling of tax affairs, the Revenue says that the first person for complaints should, ideally, be the district inspector of the local tax or collection office who is most familiar with the cases and officials concerned. It says the vast majority of complaints are handled successfully at this level. Those who are not satisfied should contact the regional controller, whose address is available from the local tax office. After that, many complaints go to the board of the Inland Revenue in London. Others are sent to members of parliament who can, in turn, refer them to the parliamentary commissioner for administration or 'ombudsman' - who takes on a handful of cases each year. Officials hope the public will make contact with the new adjudicator only after trying the regional controller of the payer's tax area, but add that the adjudicator will always be available to process problems or refer them to the appropriate individual. They say they dealt with around 14,000 complaints last year. One-fifth were about technical and procedural matters; one-fifth with delays; and another 18 per cent related to systems, policy issues or questions about why individuals should have to pay tax at all. Some 5 per cent concerned investigations. All the rest concerned topics such as failure to keep the taxpayer informed, incomplete handling of cases, and failure of liaison. About half of all complaints relate to pay-as-you-earn. The Revenue stresses that a national survey of taxpayers it conducted last year showed that 65 per cent were satisified with the overall service they received. It says it is taking on board suggestions which resulted, including improving its educational activities to ensure that people pay the right amount of tax - neither too little nor too much. In the past few days, the Revenue has also released three new codes of practice designed to bring together and make public its existing guidance for staff. Mistakes by the Revenue. This points out possible redress against the organisation when it has made a serious mistake or delay - such as paying interest on money owed or costs related to delays in processing enquiries. Inland Revenue investigations. This stresses that even when taxpayers' affairs are being investigated, they are entitled to the same rights and courtesies as anyone else and can ask for explanations at any time. Inspections of employers' and contractors' records. This says the Revenue will respect confidentiality and give notice of visits to examine records. A new version of leaflet IR 120 (You and the Inland Revenue), available from local tax offices, will be printed shortly containing details of the new arrangements.</p>

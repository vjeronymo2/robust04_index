			<p>BFN     [Text] The congress of the Republican Party of Russia today  elected 38-year old Vladimir Lysenko its chairman. He was a  cochairman of the party jointly with Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy.  Yesterday, the congress introduced changes to the rules,  introducing the posts of chairman and deputy chairman instead of  the institution of cochairmen. Both Lysenko and Shostakovskiy  are State Duma deputies. They are members of the Yabloko  faction. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the faction, reported  several days ago that within the next few days the faction would  discuss the question of expelling Lysenko from the faction,  because his actions run counter to the stand of the majority.    At the congress yesterday, Lysenko spoke out against the  party going into opposition on a course pursued by the president  and the government. Shostakovskiy favored a democratic  alternative to this course.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NO-HIT SUSPENSE ENDS IMMEDIATELY, BUT RYAN GETS ONE-HITTER  </P> <P> He wasn't close to his sixth no-hitter, but 42-year-old Nolan Ryan pitched the  11th one-hitter of his career and second this season Saturday night at Seattle.  </P> <P> Ryan's first one-hitter of 1989, on April 23, was close, however. The hit came  with one out in the ninth on a triple by Toronto's Nelson Liriano.  </P> <P> There was no suspense in this one. Harold Reynolds, the first Mariner batter of  the game, singled. Ryan then shut down Seattle as the Texas Rangers scored a  6-1 victory.  </P> <P> Ryan has been flirting with his sixth no-hitter all season. In his second start  for the Rangers, on April 12, he pitched a perfect game for six innings, lost  his no-hitter in the seventh and gave up one hit before retiring after eight  innings.  </P> <P> The all-time strikeout record-holder broke a record he shared with Bob Feller  with his 16th low-hit (no-hit or one-hit) game.  </P> <P> He struck out 11 and walked two, improving to 6-3.  </P> <P> Ryan finished with a flourish, retiring the last 22 Mariners.  </P> <P> Oakland 7, Cleveland 0 -- By this time a year ago, the Oakland Athletics had  established themselves as one of the best teams in baseball.  </P> <P> What Tony La Russa's club has accomplished at the one-third mark of this season  is even more impressive.  </P> <P> Probably the most banged-up club in the majors, the Athletics are still  battling for first place.  </P> <P> In 1988, Jose Canseco was well on his way to 42 home runs and 40 stolen bases  to establish the 40-40 club.  </P> <P> Because of injuries, he hasn't even had an at-bat this season. But Canseco  merely heads the list of Athletic stars who have been injured. The list  includes Mark McGwire, the other half of the powerful home run duo.  </P> <P> Two recent additions to the hospital list are sorely missed. Dennis Eckersley,  the top relief pitcher in the league last season, has a shoulder injury. His  absence has cost the Athletics a couple of victories already. Friday night, the  league's leading hitter, Carney Lansford (.356), suffered a strained left  hamstring and is out indefinitely. And shortstop Walt Weiss recently underwent  surgery.  </P> <P> Before every game, La Russa has to search to find enough healthy athletes to  field a team. He was able to do so Saturday at Oakland against the Cleveland  Indians by putting catcher Terry Steinbach in left field.  </P> <P> He also had one of his better pitchers ready -- Bob Welch. Welch (7-4) shut  down the Indians on seven hits in eight innings, and the Athletics ended a  two-game losing streak. The Indians had won five in a row.  </P> <P> Toronto 10, Boston 2 -- Boston's Fenway Park attracts thousands of visitors  each year, but none more appreciative of the landmark than the Toronto Blue  Jays.  </P> <P> With rookie Junior Felix driving in four more runs on three hits, the Blue Jays  breezed behind Dave Stieb (4-3) to their 11th consecutive victory at Fenway  Park.  </P> <P> Felix, 21, hit an inside-the-park grand slam Friday night to spark Toronto's  7-2 victory.  </P> <P> Baltimore 4, Detroit 2 -- The Orioles keep building on their lead in the East.  Jim Traber singled home the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning at Detroit,  the Orioles won their sixth in a row and their lead jumped to four games.  </P> <P> Former Dodger Brian Holton was holding a 2-0 lead for the Orioles on Cal  Ripken's two-run home run when rain delayed the game for 21 minutes in the  sixth inning. When play resumed the Tigers chased Holton and tied the score.  </P> <P> It was only the Orioles' second win over Doyle Alexander in the last 11  decisions involving the veteran right-hander.  </P> <P> Minnesota 5-1, Chicago 4-2 -- The White Sox ended their home losing streak at  11 by winning the second game of the doubleheader.  </P> <P> In the opener, Minnesota left-hander Frank Viola, who has trouble beating most  teams these days, staggered to his fourth victory in 11 decisions.  </P> <P> But Carlton Fisk, one day off the disabled list, hit a sacrifice fly in the  eighth inning of the second game to break a 1-1 tie. It was Chicago's first  victory at home since May 7. They had lost 13 out of 14 overall.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 2, New York 0 -- Bill Krueger came out of the bullpen to pitch five  strong innings at Milwaukee in his first start since 1986.  </P> <P> Krueger, who had made 11 relief appearances, gave up four hits and improved his  record to 2-0.  </P> <P> Richard Dotson held the Brewers hitless until the fifth when two singles and  Jim Gantner's double accounted for both runs.

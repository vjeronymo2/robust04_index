			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon plans changes to board pay structure MB-CARADON, the building products, security printing and packaging group, is to ask shareholders for authority to double the amount it can pay non-executive directors. A resolution will be put to them at the annual meeting on May 14. At present the group is allowed to spend up to Pounds 100,000 a year on employing non-executive directors. It currently has five, including the chairman, and is close to the Pounds 100,000 limit which the group said was a restraint. It wants to move to a limit of Pounds 200,000 though it does not expect to reach that for some years. Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, received Pounds 50,096 in 1991 - up from Pounds 36,255 in 1990, according to the group's accounts which were published yesterday. Three other non-executives appeared to have been paid between Pounds 15,001 and Pounds 20,000. A new non-executive director has been appointed to replace one who will retire at the annual meeting. Executive directors of the group suffered a pay cut in 1991 because part of their remuneration was bonus related to growth in earnings per share. Earnings for the year were unchanged at 15p on a fully diluted basis. The highest paid director who is not named but is understood not to be either Mr Peter Jansen, group chief executive, or Mr Daniel Cohen, group finance director, received Pounds 223,000. In 1990 Mr Jansen was the highest paid with Pounds 256,000. The group is to also ask shareholders to approve a plan to cancel the Pounds 161.6m share premium account and transfer it to a capital reserve against which goodwill arising on acquisitions can be written off. There is Pounds 88.8m of goodwill shown in the balance sheet as a negative reserve which would be written off if the plan goes through. The change would not affect the group's net assets.</p>

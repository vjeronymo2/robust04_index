			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Xu Penghang, vice minister in charge of the State  Economic and Trade Commission [SETC], and his party inspected  Anhui recently and investigated and studied conditions of  technical transformation projects there. In a discussion  meeting called by the provincial government yesterday, Vice  Governor Wang Xiuzhi reported to comrades in charge of the SETC  on current conditions of technical transformation exercise in  Anhui, and strategies adopted by the provincial party committee  and government for its success. Wang Xiuzhi said: In attaching  great importance to enterprises' technical transformation, the  provincial party committee and government have adopted the  strategy of "one mainstay and two wings" -- taking  infrastructure as the mainstay and town and village enterprises  and technical transformation as the two wings -- with emphasis  on strengthening the former and expanding the latter to ensure  an economic takeoff in Anhui. It has been proposed in the  Knowing Well Your Responsibility Certificates signed between the  provincial government and departments and bureaus in charge that  over 20 billion yuan will be invested in technical  transformation projects within three years, during which about  200 high-tech, fast-running projects will be completed, so that  output value of technical transformation will contribute not  less than 30 percent to the total industrial output value. Wang  Xiuzhi said: With a completed investment of 6.26 billion yuan  in technical transformation projects in 1993, Anhui has  succeeded in improving its enterprises' technical, equipment  level and thus consolidating the strengthening of its economic  strength.    Speaking at the meeting, SETC Vice Minister Xu Penghang  pointed out: Thanks to conscientious implementation of technical  transformation projects, Anhui has entered a relatively high  economic growth period. This strategy should be strengthened in  the future by well preparing all technical transformation  projects before their implementation and by laying emphasis on  speed -- speed in examining and approving well identified  projects, in commencing production, in entering the market, in  making money, and in repaying debts. The state will lend its  strong support to provinces excelling in helping enterprises  with good performance.    Xu Penghang and his party successively inspected some  enterprises in Suzhou and Hefei City, as well as high and new  technology industrial development zones. Provincial Governor Fu  Xishou called on Xu Penghang and his party on the evening of 6  June.    Persons in charge of relevant departments, including the  provincial discipline inspection commission, the provincial  economic and trade commission, the Commercial and Industrial  Bank, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank, and Customs,  attended yesterday's discussion meeting.</p>

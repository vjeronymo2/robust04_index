			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] [passage indistinct] the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] intends to rule in Huambo  and it officially stated its intention to the mediator today.  This morning the mediator, the observers, and government and  UNITA representatives met at the Mulungushi Conference Center to  discuss swearing in UNITA members of parliament. Although the  outcome of the talks is not yet satisfactory, reliable sources  have just told us that the government and UNITA are trying to  find a solution to that and other issues. So, it is still  believed that an agreement may be reached in Lusaka because  there are no obstacles that cannot be overcome.    Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim this morning  summoned Angolan and foreign newsmen to inform them about  UNITA's official position regarding its participation in  governing the country. Angolan journalists insisted that  Valentim confirm or deny his statements to the TIMES OF ZAMBIA  that UNITA would continue to demand that the government allocate  it the Foreign and Interior Ministries. Valentim simply said,  quote, I have no comments. I can just say that UNITA wants to  govern Huambo and this position has already been officially  presented to the mediators, unquote. Meanwhile, it has been  reported that the government and UNITA will this afternoon  continue the discussions to find solutions on the issue being  discussed and come up with an agreement that would conform with  the interests of the negotiators. Everything now depends on the  goodwill of both sides.</p>

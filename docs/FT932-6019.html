			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / 200 Libyans arrive for pilgrimage in Israel A Libyan collects documents from an Israeli policewoman yesterday at the border with Egypt as he and some 200 fellow-Libyans arrived for a pilgrimage to Moslem holy places in Israel. This was unprecedented for citizens of an Arab state formally at war with Israel. Libya said it sent the pilgrims to Israel because Saudi Arabia had refused to let them fly to the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

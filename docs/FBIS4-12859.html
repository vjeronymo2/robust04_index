			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn, 13 Apr (MENA)--Qatari Foreign Minister  Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani has stated that his country is  not trying to undermine the importance of the Suez Canal as a  vital artery for world trade. In a statement to the MENA  correspondent in Bonn, he said no agreement has been concluded  with Israel on transporting gas through al-'Aqabah Port [name of  port as transmitted], as German media have reported.    Shaykh Hamad said the press has inflated this issue, which  does not exist, indicating that any dealings between Qatar and  Israel hinge on the termination of its occupation of all Arab  territories occupied in 1967. He explained that the gas export  agreement was concluded with an Italian firm, which then delayed  its implementation.    On Qatar's relations with Iraq, Shaykh Hamad said his  country  deals with peoples and not with regimes. He indicated that  contacts between Doha and Baghdad depend on Iraq's  implementation of the UN resolutions. He spoke about the  importance of cooperation and resolving differences among the  Arab states, indicating that the Arab world cannot bear any new  differences at present.    Shaykh Hamad said that in the event a Gulf state is  threatened, help should come from the friendly Arab states  before it comes from foreign countries. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "What Has the State Done to </F> Caktas?"]    [Excerpts] Sinisa Caktas, engineer and businessman from  Split, co-owner and managing director of the firm Nova, is in  custody under investigation for alleged misappropriation in the  transformation of the Split Dairy. Caktas had big plans and  announced a sensational purchase of Split firms undergoing  transformation, but his arrest has halted him in creating his  business empire. He was at the center of a conflict between the  Fund for Privatization and the commercial courts on additional  capitalization, which is what got Caktas into trouble, an  unconstitutional act in the transformation process, although the  Croatian Parliament has passed a law allowing it. The  Constitutional Court will decide the fate of the 120 firms which  have been sold under arrangements for additional capitalization  and in which a great deal of money has been invested, with  certain foreign firms among the investors. This has even been  debated by the Fund's board of directors, and it seems that yet  another farce in the transformation process is on the horizon.  At the center of it is a man who announced the purchase of "half  of Split," a man who could have become the employer of  one-fourth of Split's employed labor force. [passages omitted]  <H5>  Caktas' Plans </H5>   Caktas came into prominence when he bought or announced the  purchase of certain firms in Split that were being transformed.  Nova first bought a complex of commercial space for 2 million  German marks [DM] on Gunduliceva Street in Split. Then it  purchased the firm Transsped and Adria Color by paying the  workers cash for the shares of that firm, so that it became its  100-percent owner. All those transactions, if we ignore rumors  in the city, were regarded as ordinary transactions in the  transformation until Caktas and his firm aroused public interest  by offering to build a pontoon bridge over the Novska Gorge,  seeking concessions for operation of the bridge in return. Aside  from the pontoon bridge, the offer also called for building a  new bridge above the Novska Gorge. Sensational announcements  followed on the economic environment of Split in which Nova  would buy shares to round out its business empire. Caktas  announced that he was going to buy from the Fund for  Privatization shares in Pomgrad, Dalmacijavino, the construction  firm Lavcevic, the fishing firm Jadran, Neptun, and  Auto-Dijelovi, with the Dairy at the end of the list. The value  of those transactions was greater than DM150 million, and Caktas  would have become employer of one-fourth of the employed labor  force of Split.    This of course aroused great interest in Caktas, and it is  only logical that resistance and enemies should have emerged.  Those familiar questions began to be asked: Who is Caktas? Who  is he working for? Whose money is it? Soon Caktas himself, in a  statement for the media, revealed some of his business plans and  announced that he would be buying all the industrial plants  around the Municipal Port and moving them elsewhere to build a  commercial center on the quay. This was one of the key  statements that set in motion resistance to Caktas' business.  Caktas confidently presented his plans for all these firms, and  it is interesting that no one contested those plans with  arguments, but there was constant speculation that Caktas would  buy all those firms to grab up the attractive commercial space  and construction sites in the center of the city and make money  by doing so. Incidentally, he said that himself. However, no one  explained what would be wrong with moving the factories from the  center of the city to the outskirts and building commercial  centers in the center according to urban planning and  architectural designs prescribed by the city executive  authority. It seems the only thing in dispute was the  possibility of someone making money with a good idea and money  invested. That was a bad thing in the former system as well.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Additional Capitalization Contested </H5>   This is only one of the drastic conflicts between government  agencies and the courts, which are sometimes waged over the  backs of the businessmen and small shareholders. This time the  dispute is over additional capitalization of the firms, an issue  on which the courts and the Fund cannot agree. The Fund feels  that additional capitalization is acceptable and indeed  desirable, since it stimulates investment in the firms. The  buyers can in this way enlarge their capital holding and gain  the controlling block of stock, but the firm also gets equipment  and money to facilitate its operation. The small shareholders  and the trade unions in particular consider this form of  purchase thievery and a threat to the rights of the small  stockholders. The presiding judges of the commercial courts have  met to debate this problem, since some courts have refused to  enter such firms in the court register. That is what happened to  Caktas in connection with the purchase of the Dairy. In short,  the courts judged that this was unconstitutional and a flagrant  violation of the rights of the other shareholders. The Fund of  course defended the entire idea, and the decision on all this is  to be made by the Constitutional Court. This has also been  debated by the Government, and after that session the Supreme  Commercial Court ordered the lower courts to resume entering  those firms in the court register, and if the Constitutional  Court proclaims this unconstitutional, the firms will be deleted  from the register. But the Commercial Court in Split did not  want to enter the Dairy in the court register even after that  intervention.    So far there have been about 120 cases of additional  capitalization. The Parliament has in fact allowed this in  amendments to the Law on Transformation, but now this  privatization procedure, which involves the investment of a  great deal of domestic and foreign capital, is in jeopardy. If  the Constitutional Court says that additional capitalization is  unconstitutional, 120 various investors will be in a fix. How is  the money invested to be returned and interest paid on it, and,  especially, how are they to collect for the time and work  invested in the firm's business operation? Or, if the court  decides otherwise, who is going to compensate Caktas, and how?    The sale of firms is debatable anyway, since this right has  been left to the "magnificent 13" on the Fund's board of  directors, who can sell or preserve for the state the shares of  the great majority of Croatian firms as they see fit, with no  accountability and without any clear strategy for development of  the Croatian economy. The case of additional capitalization  calls into question once again the way in which Croatian firms  are being transformed, and it could greatly diminish the  interest of domestic businessmen in making an investment. Not to  mention foreign investors.</p>

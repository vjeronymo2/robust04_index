			<p>BFN     [Text] France has reportedly summoned Prince Sirivut to go  immediately to Paris to see the French foreign and defense  ministers so that more military aid can be provided to the  two-headed government to do away with the Cambodian nation and  race.    The general public asks why France openly makes itself the  frontline enemy of the Cambodian nation and people. Have the  latter ever done anything affecting French interests that  prompts it to implement a dark policy toward Cambodia?    To answer this question, it is worth recalling:    1. A long time ago in Indochina, France adopted a policy of  constant support for the late Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese strategy  of swallowing and incorporating Cambodia into Vietnam's  Indochina. In 1949, the French Government of (Kuch Floret), the  then master of Indochina, decided, without consulting the  Cambodian side in the least, to give Cambodia's Kampuchea Kraom  to the Vietnamese King Bao Dai with the aim of protecting French  interests in Indochina. The action was an encroachment upon the  rights of the Cambodian nation and people, who are the owners of  Kampuchea Kraom, and the right to self-determination of millions  of Cambodian people living there. Why did France sell out the  Cambodian nation and people in Kampuchea Kraom? The reason was  that it needed to include Vietnam's Indochinese federation in  its arena for the purpose of serving its strategy in Southeast  Asia and the Pacific. Although Cambodia lost its race, France  did not care about the country's destiny and future. What was  important for it was its status as a colonial power. It did  whatever it could to achieve its strategy.    2. In November 1991, when the Paris 23 October 1991 accord  was being implemented, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas came  to Phnom Penh immediately to combine two parties -- one  belonging to Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for  an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and  the other to Hun Sen of the Vietnamese puppet Cambodian People's  Party [CPP]. The French foreign minister's intention was to  encroach upon the Paris accord, which demands that the four  parties achieve national reconciliation. France was opposed to  the Party of Democratic Kampuchea and the Supreme National  Council headed by Prince Norodom. In connivance with its  alliance, France assisted the Vietnamese aggressor troops to  reinforce the communist Vietnamese regime in Cambodia, enabling  it to smash the Democratic Kampuchea forces. French General  Loridon, commander of the UN forces in Cambodia, said blatantly  that the Khmer Rouge [KR] should be smashed to pieces and so on.    3. Along with this, France and Akashi [head of the UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia], as well as their alliance,  forged a law making millions of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia  eligible to vote. They also declared that Vietnamese nationals  would be allowed to flow into Cambodia at will.    4. Shortly after the elections organized by UNTAC [UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia], even though the communist  Vietnamese puppet CPP was defeated, France further strove to  immediately combine the communist Vietnamese puppets with the  FUNCINPEC of Ranariddh to form a two-headed government and an  army to attack Democratic Kampuchea and the people at Phnum  Chhat and Stoung, and then Anlung Veng and Pailin as now. In  January 1993, the French defense minister made an urgent trip to  Phnom Penh, and later, the French General Staff chief and  foreign minister also came in order to join in mapping out a  military plan to (?attack) the Cambodian nation and people in  the Democratic Kampuchea-controlled regions during the 16th dry  season.    5. Now, despite serious defeats suffered by its alliance,  the communist Vietnamese and the two-headed government, on the  Anlung Veng, Pailin, Route 5, Poipet, and Sisophon battlefields,  France remains adamant on further inflaming the war of  aggression. It has summoned Prince Sirivut -- who is now having  a good time in Paris touring, drinking, and dancing -- to see it  so that more military aid can be provided for destroying the  Cambodian nation and people in accordance with the strategy  applied by its alliance and the communist Vietnamese in Cambodia  and the region.    The Cambodian nation and people as well as all patriotic  forces are determined to continue to hold aloft the banner of  the struggle to preserve the survival of the nation and race.  Peace-loving countries in the region, including the ASEAN  states, are vehemently opposed to the communist Vietnamese' and  their alliance's policy of furthering war in Cambodia and  Southeast Asia. They want Cambodia to recover national  reconciliation and peace in accordance with the king's  five-point national reconciliation plan.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Easy victor Zedillo faces an uneasy future: Damian Fraser reports on the Mexican president's 'chaotic' inheritance Three months after his easy victory in Mexico's presidential election, Mr Ernesto Zedillo prepares to take office tomorrow in a turbulent and uncertain political environment. The infighting within the government that has followed assassinations of two senior politicians, the continued unrest in the state of Chiapas and volatile financial markets have led some to conclude that the Institutional Revolutionary Party is facing its most serious crisis in 65 years in power. 'The legacy of Salinas to Zedillo: a country in chaos, a political system in disintegration,' said Proceso, Mexico's weekly political magazine, in this week's cover story. Many businessmen, investors, and government officials, although their confidence has been shaken by recent events, point out that the last four Mexican presidencies having all ended in turmoil, only for stability to return as the new president assumes control. They take comfort from the resilient economy and the recent return of investors to the stockmarket, reckoning that the worst is over. Much will depend on Mr Zedillo's actions in the first weeks. After being quiet for three months, he will over the next month have to establish leadership within government, set out his policy objectives and appoint ministers able both to implement his programme and keep the party unified. His first task will be to heal divisions in the PRI that have arisen over allegations that the two most senior figures of the ruling party, Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the president, and Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the secretary-general, conspired with the attorney-general, Mr Humberto Bentez Trevino, to block the investigation into the assassination of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official of the PRI. The accusations, made by Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, the former deputy attorney-general and the brother of the slain politician, caused a bombshell in Mexico, and have fuelled suspicions that Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder was ordered by senior figures in the government, who are being protected by those still higher up. The allegations could present Mr Zedillo with an awkward dilemma. If he does not push for a thorough investigation, then his own credibility would be tarnished and his proposals for legal and judicial reform would meet with cynicism. But if there is some truth to the allegations  - so far strong evidence has been lacking - and if he moves against Mr Pichardo or Mr Bentez, he risks alienating a powerful political faction in the ruling party that has been among his staunchest backers. Mr Zedillo's cabinet appointments, especially that of attorney-general, are likely to give some indication on his approach to the investigation, to political reform and his willingness to fight corruption and illegality within his own party and government. Many observers are hoping that Mr Zedillo appoints to the attorney-general's position a respected figure independent of the ruling party as a sign that he is serious about implementing far-reaching legal reform that would subject everyone to the rule of law. The second critical test Mr Zedillo will face in December is in the southern state of Chiapas, where the leftist opposition and the Zapatista peasant rebels are seeking to prevent the PRI governor from taking office on December 8. The Zapatista rebels, who launched an armed uprising in January this year, have predicted war if the PRI governor is allowed to take power; the leftist opposition has made political concession in the state an important condition for talks on national democratic reform. However, the election result in Chiapas has been ratified by the local congress and Mr Zedillo is unwilling to follow President Salinas's habit of deposing legally elected governors as a way of consoling the opposition. Instead he appears ready to begin negotiations with both Zapatista rebels and the leftist opposition on local and national political reform. But it seems unlikely that such negotiations could produce results in the time available, raising the prospect of conflict in Chiapas over the next few weeks and casting a cloud over efforts to secure all-party consensus over the next stage of democratic reform. What is fortunate for Mr Zedillo is that the economy has recovered strongly from the recession of last year, with third-quarter growth of 4.5 per cent compared with the same period last year. If the economy continues its recovery, then Mr Zedillo can afford to push for a relatively conservative budget on December 15 without endangering his target of 4 per cent growth for next year. An orthodox budget, and continued commitment to pro-market economic reform, may help stabilise financial markets, and give Mr Zedillo more breathing room on the political front.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Businessmen who bore for Europe: Dominic Lawson asks why employees of multi-nationals care so little for their democratic birthright I HAVE always enjoyed talking to businessmen. About business, that is. When people know what they are talking about, it always pays to listen and learn. But when businessmen get on to politics, they tend to divide into two categories, neither of them edifying or instructive. On the one hand there are the saloon bar bar gin-and-it bores whose views are indistinguishable from the traditional taxi-driver's, but without the pithy articulacy of the cockney cabbie. On the other hand there are those businessmen, normally employees of very big companies, whose political views, such as they are, seem to be entirely conditioned by their corporation's business objectives. As individual citizens they have virtually no political views at all. One can see this most clearly in the debate over the Maastricht Treaty on European Union (to give it its proper name). Almost limitless seem to be the articles by businessmen denouncing notions of sovereignty as 'sentimental', and demanding the speedy implementation of moves towards European currency and political union. They think, with their employee's hat on, that it will make running their business so much simpler. No need to hedge against nasty foreign exchange risks in the European market, no need to bribe, sorry, wine and dine, lots of silly ministers, when you will only have to br . . . wine and dine one commissioner in Brussels. And thus they are quite happy, as citizens of one country, to sign away the absolute right to vote in or out of office those who decide how much tax they will pay, those who decide what battles their armed forces will fight. It is, I suspect, no accident, that the businessmen who have such a limited vision of political morality tend to be managers in multi-national corporations. They spend so much of their time flying from one time zone to another, living off airline food, staying at hotels of truly international colourlessness, talking only to other people with the same way of life, that they have quite lost a sense of the intrinsic differences between countries. Business class air-conditioning has frozen their synapses and jet lag has entered their souls. The Confederation of British Industry, increasingly dominated by the larger multinational companies, has become particularly addled. It was almost comical, and certainly tragic, how that organisation loudly and persistently defended the notion that sterling should not be allowed to fall below DM2.78, even as that rate was demolishing the earnings of its members and the domestic interest rates required to support the rate were becoming politically unsustainable. And all was justified because this havoc was deemed essential to keep Britain on the fabled 'fast train to Europe.' ICI had been a particular supporter of this doomed policy, and it was hard to stomach its chairman's recent statement, as the company laid off 4,000, to the effect that the newly competitive pound would help to restore its business opportunities. If I was one of those 4,000 I would have liked to see Sir Denys Henderson next to me in the queue at the Jobcentre. His company was at it again last week. An article by ICI's chief economist, one Richard Freeman, in the Evening Standard, went under the strap line 'The benefits of a complete Single European Market are too large to be put at risk by sentiments about UK sovereignty.' Freeman showed he is not sentimental about sovereignty. The 'S' word appeared only once in an article of about 1,500 words. As Lord Stoddart responded next day: 'How well it shows that big business is more concerned with profit than democracy, freedom and self-government. It is surely no coincidence that it is big business in Hong Kong which is opposed to Mr Patten's democratic reforms and big business here in Britain that wishes to give away to remote institutions those democratic freedoms we have left.' We should not be unjust. Perhaps we have left out a third category of businessman, who is neither a saloon bar bore, nor a deracinated jobsworth. He is the one who knows that the drive towards European federalism is unworkable but is damned if he is going to stick his neck out and say so in public. As has been said before now, capital is a coward. Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHELDON LASHES OUT AT PRODUCER OF GAY-ORIENTED SOAP OPERA DURING A TV FACE-OFF  </P> <P> Anti-gay Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of Anaheim and David Gadberry, producer of a  gay-oriented soap opera being made in Orange County, faced off Friday on a  live, nationally televised call-in talk show and, not surprisingly, sparks  flew.  </P> <P> During the show, "Nine Broadcast Plaza," which was transmitted from New Jersey  over independent cable channel WWOR, about 1,500 viewers phoned in to answer:  "Should a gay soap opera be allowed to air on TV?" Fifty percent said no, 49%  said yes and 1% were undecided.  </P> <P> Gadberry was joined on the program by Hal Cobb, a member of the cast of "Secret  Passions," the soap opera Gadberry is targeting for public access cable.  "Secret Passions" had its cable TV debut in New York City on Tuesday night and  was screened at a Costa Mesa nightclub Wednesday.  </P> <P> Gadberry said he plans to submit the pilot Monday to nine Orange County  public-access stations and to others in at least 15 U.S. cities. Public-access  operators must air any non-commercial program (unless obscene or indecent) for  which they have the time, according to a Federal Communications Commission  spokesman.  </P> <P> Gadberry, who had not met Sheldon before, asserted on "Nine Broadcast Plaza"  that his program, thought to be the first of its kind nationwide, will  realistically portray the gay life style and will help promote understanding of  the gay community.  </P> <P> "We're not doing pornography," he said. Noting that there will be kissing in  the serial, he added: "'What we're doing is not wrong; it's natural. When two  men are in love, they kiss."  </P> <P> Sheldon, who has waged a highly publicized campaign against homosexuality, has  said he intends to monitor "Secret Passions" to determine whether the  Traditional Values Coalition he heads will take action against it. So far, he  said, he has seen only excerpts, such as one aired Friday showing two  bare-chested men in bed.  </P> <P> Still, Sheldon said, the program is immoral and "disgusting" and has no place  on TV.  </P> <P> Asked by the talk show host, Matt Laury, if he doesn't think Gadberry has the  First Amendment right to produce anything he wants, Sheldon replied: "Do you  want (people) to be able to promote apartheid and (a return) to slavery?"  </P> <P> Children "model" or imitate "same-sex homosexual acts" when exposed to them,  Sheldon said, raising his voice and leaning forward in his seat. Gadberry  rolled his eyes.  </P> <P> Friday's studio audience, clapping and cheering, seemed to be as evenly divided  as those who phoned in their opinon of the soap, which has been written about  in TV Guide, USA Today and other media nationwide.  </P> <P> From the Sheldon camp came the observation that the Bible does not tell about  Adam and Steve in the Garden of Eden. The homosexual life style "should be kept  (in the bedroom) where it belongs," one irate woman said.  </P> <P> And from a man in the Gadberry gallery: "I'm not gay myself, but  (homosexuality) is a part of life and people are going to have realize it."  </P></p>

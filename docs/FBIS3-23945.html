Chernomyrdin at enlarged session of </F> Russian Federation Government 4 March 1993: "The Government  Intends To Abide by Its Program No Matter How Difficult It May  Be"]    [Text]    Esteemed President,    Esteemed participants in the government session!    This is our first meeting in this composition in the new  year, 1994. However, I want to stress in particular that the  Russian Government, which is meeting today in an enlarged  session with the participation of leaders of the regions and  deputies of the Federal Assembly, is not a new state organ born  in January this year. It is the same pro-reform cabinet which,  together with the president and under his direct leadership, has  carried out and is continuing to carry out the qualitative  transformation of the country's economy.    The main directions of this multifaceted work have been  determined in the Message of the President of Russia to the  Federal Assembly and in effect to all Russians. The government  fully supports the aim set out in the Message -- the  strengthening of the Russian state. It is this which is the  basis of the continuation of the reforms, the elimination of the  crisis, the implementation of the structural restructuring of  the economy, and the creation of conditions for economic,  political, and social stabilization.    As far as the government is concerned, the president's  Message is the point of departure in the formation and  implementation of socioeconomic policy.    In recent weeks we have often been accused of maintaining a  prolonged silence, of lacking an action program, and of having  nothing to say.    On the one hand, there have been demands for a change of  course. On the other hand, there has been a flurry of  accusations that we are deviating from the reform policy.  Chernomyrdin is being accused of constantly stating his loyalty  to the reforms while at the same time being unprepared to prove  that in practice.    I want to clearly and precisely define my position right  now.    First of all we see neither a justification nor an  opportunity for a radical change of course.    The government has its program, adopted 6 August 1993 and  approved by the president. We intend to abide by this program  and will implement it no matter how difficult that proves to be.    At the same time we reject in principle the dangerous theory  of "letting things drift." We are not satisfied either with the  pace and intensity of the reforms or with the quality of work of  management structures at all levels -- from federal to local --  and we fully share the president's alarm and society's concern  at the country's economic situation.    However, neither are there any grounds for hasty conclusions  about an imminent catastrophe or that the reform has stopped and  that it is necessary to go back to 1992 in order to "renew" the  radical transformations.    I should like to recall the old saying: Do not make the same  mistake twice. The country, the reforms, and we all are not  what we were a year or two ago. One can and must discuss what  has been done and what has not been done and why. But we cannot  fail to see the obvious: A market economy already exists in  Russia.    Now it is necessary to move on, not backward but forward,  taking into account the qualitative differences in the economic  and political situation prevailing at the start of 1994 and  drawing the lessons from our own errors and omissions.  <H5>  1. 1993. Trends and Lessons </H5>   A detailed account of the characteristics of economic  development over the past year is contained in the materials  distributed to the participants in the session. So I would like  to pay greater attention to the qualitative aspect of the  results in 1993 and the government's work to implement the  program for the development of reforms and stabilization of the  economy.    In the complex domestic political situation of 1993 the  government succeeded in taking major steps to promote the  progress of reforms. The moderately tough financial and  monetary policy made it possible to keep inflation under control  and reduce it significantly by the end of 1993. Privatization  proceeded dynamically and additional measures were adopted to  liberalize foreign economic activity. The government did  everything it could to support production.    Nevertheless, the economic situation remains alarming. At  the end of the year the slump in industry intensified. We have  come very close to the point of the irreversible destruction of  our scientific and technical potential. The country's situation  as regards foreign economic activity and hard currency remains  tense. The problem of nonpayments has worsened again.    I am certainly not saying all this so as to "inflame" the  atmosphere or to attribute all our own failings to "objective  circumstances." We intend to draw conclusions for ourselves  first and foremost.    For example, in the fight against inflation we got carried  away by the sequestration of budget expenditure but sometimes we  cut to the quick and did not examine in detail the consequences  of the reduction of this or that budget item.    As a result the budget was not able to pay in full for  output  produced for the state's needs or for a number of other  commitments, including the payment of wages in the budget-funded  sphere. Instead of seeking reserves to strengthen the revenue  base and rationalize expenditure, measures of a "crisis  management" character were adopted.    I have to say bluntly that we sometimes fail to keep pace  with events simply because of the low quality of work by  ministries and departments.    For over a year we have been talking about the disastrous  impact of nonpayments on the financial position of enterprises,  the budget, and the economy as a whole and we have been issuing  instruction after instruction. But what is the result? We  still do not have a full, day-to-day account of reciprocal  indebtedness in the national economy.    I am not saying that the problem is simple. But at times you  get the impression that neither the Finance Ministry, nor the  Economy Ministry, nor the State Committee for the Management of  State Property, nor the Central Bank considers this to be its  problem. Meanwhile the situation is getting worse day by day.    I want to talk in particular about sectorial ministries and  departments. It seems at times that even now their main aim is  to obtain money and benefits for their enterprises in the belief  that [the constraints of] state policy and the government's real  potential do not apply to them. Meanwhile, very little specific  work is being done with enterprises, including work to sort out  nonpayments, to evaluate the state of and prospects for  enterprises, and to prepare effective recommendations for them.    The Finance Ministry must be reminded that it is not merely  a  bookkeeper and that ultimately the budget and its execution are  among the main instruments of the government's economic policy.  A host of grievances and mutual recriminations sometimes result  from an elementary reluctance to explain the real situation  regarding state finances and the reasons for harsh budget  restrictions. I know that it is very difficult to work in this  area today. Nevertheless, the economy does not exist for the  sake of the Finance Ministry, the Finance Ministry exists for  the sake of the economy.    Last fall we adopted the action plan to implement stage one  of the government program. How is it being carried out?    An analysis has shown that only one-half of the 88  instructions included in the plan have been implemented in full.  Furthermore, in a number of cases that implementation is  clearly only formal. The implementation of such fundamentally  important decisions as, for example, agricultural  production-sharing, the development of agricultural credit and  insurance, and the introduction of land as a surety and  mortgages, has been frustrated. Yet the Ministry of Agriculture  knows that beyond these decisions lies the solution of many  difficult problems in agriculture.    The leaders of ministries and departments must view the  economy as a whole and pursue an overall state policy. By no  means all leaders proved capable last year of resisting the  pressure of lobby interests especially when these attacks were  accompanied by a powerful "barrage of noise," which,  furthermore, had political overtones.    I want to make one more point. It is impossible to implement  a reform if one looks down on the country and the people and  does not explain things or ask for the consent of those on whose  behalf we are actually working. Or on whose behalf we should be  working at any rate. I want our government and leaders of the  executive organs of power in the regions to be able to see the  country's economic problems from grass roots level -- through  the eyes of our citizens. Then I am convinced that the majority  of the poeople will understand and support the reforms.  <H3>  2. Move Forward While Taking Account of Socioeconomic  Realities </H3>   When summing up the results not just in 1993 but also over  the past two years of reforms, we must see first and foremost  the new problems which the Russian economy is encountering today.    First, a new situation has developed over prices. Domestic  prices for the majority of goods and services (apart from energy  sources) have moved close to world prices. This, on the one  hand, has helped to saturate the market and has been conducive  to the free establishment of new economic ties and the  development of trade and normal market relations. Russian  enterprises have experienced the competition of foreign goods  and a perceptible blow has been dealt to monopoly practices.  But, on the other hand, a steadily growing number of  enterprises are running at a loss and are proving inefficient  and uncompetitive.    Second, the moderately tough financial and monetary-credit  policy did yield definite fruit although it failed to stop  inflation. The rate of inflation, disregarding January 1994,  has slowed perceptibly. In February it was 13-15 percent at  most, in other words it was at the level of November-December.  There are grounds for hoping that we will be able to maintain  that level in the next few months and then achieve better  results.    However, I make no secret of the fact that we are alarmed by  the asymmetrical response of the national economy to the  measures contained in the tough monetary policy: On the one  hand the swelling of the money supply is a powerful boost to  inflation but, contrary to expectations, it is not leading to a  stabilization of production and is blocking the so vital  processes of its structural restructuring.    At the same time, the slowdown in the rate of growth of the  money supply is causing a sharp slump in production and  increasing the strain on enterprises' financial situation  without influencing price movements.    This is what we have gained as a result of the powerful  pressure on the money supply in June-October 1993.    Consequently it is necessary to recognize not only the fact  that macroeconomic stabilization has not been achieved yet, but  also that this can hardly be achieved by means of a tough  monetary policy alone.    You cannot make great progress by cutting budget expenditure  or by raising taxes alone. Nonpayments and the large tax  arrears today are attributable not just to budget debts and the  debts of the CIS countries but also to the extremely poor  financial discipline and mutual lack of exactingness by partners  who prefer to address all their claims to the government.  People often talk about the lack of money in the economy as a  consequence of the shock therapy policy. But the facts indicate  otherwise: On the whole there is enough in circulation, what is  lacking is order and the normal control of money movements.    Third, the slump in production in 1993 and in the opening  months of this year proved greater than anticipated. Efficiency  is in decline and there is a threat of mass unemployment and the  reduction of the production apparatus. In a number of sectors  the volume of production is less than 50 percent of the January  1990 level.    Stoppages of work at production units, including such major  enterprises as "Avtovaz," "Kirovskiy Zavod," "Baltiyskiy Zavod,"  and others have acquired a new and hitherto unseen quality.    The crisis has affected not just those sectors where the  greatest reduction of production was forecast but also those  which are producing what is, in principle, competitive output,  output which is in demand, such as consumer goods.    In these conditions it is obvious that the question can no  longer be expressed merely in terms of "more or less money." It  is clear that without a sufficiently tough financial and  monetary policy no progress will be made here, just as has  happened in other countries.    But it is hardly possible to radically change the situation  in the country for the better by these means alone either.  Hence the need to use the full range of market methods of state  regulation.    Thus today, while not slackening our efforts in the sphere  of  economic stabilization in the slightest, we must operate equally  resolutely on other aspects of Russia's economic life. Many of  the reserves of the reform have not been fully utilized.    The solution, in our opinion, is to focus efforts on the  solution of the following main tasks:    -- the strengthening of state power and the imposition of  order in all spheres of the economy and society's life;    -- the implementation of an intelligent, moderately tough  financial policy;    -- the resolute stepping up of structural investment policy;    -- substantial changes to the privatization policy so as to  direct it not simply toward the distribution of state property  but also toward increasing production efficiency, stimulating  investments, and stepping up the structural restructuring;    -- using every opportunity to intensify social policy so as  to finally steer the reforms toward the people and eliminate the  main sources of people's discontent;    -- and the consolidation of all the healthy forces in  society  to resolve the tasks of the new stage of the reforms and achieve  national accord on this platform.    I proceed from the premise that virtually the entire range  of  these tasks of ours was presented in the president's message.  That message tells us what we must do. Our duty is to  determine how to do this and fulfill what has been planned.  <H3>  3. Formulating Effective Mechanisms for Economic  Stabilization </H3>   Let me begin with the imposition of order and the  strengthening of the state principle in the economy. The  measures we have proposed have nothing to do with unquestioning  administration by decree or autocratically putting the screws on.    It must be understood that we are not talking about  reverting  to the old methods of government or restoring the omnipresent  role of the state.    The objective is to put an end to chaos and secure  elementary  things that are natural in any civilized state, but which are  regrettably lacking in ours, namely the proper fulfillment of  commitments to partners, the payment of taxes and debts, or  failing that, a declaration of bankruptcy.    Therefore, as far as I am concerned, order is synonymous  with  reliable laws that work and a developed system of institutions  which are needed for a full-fledged market economy. Let me say  that the president's message says outright that the  institutional avenue of reform should be the main one.    On the other hand, the creation of new market institutions  effectively means the continuation in the economic sphere of the  general guidelines for state building that Russia is  implementing today.    What are the immediate urgent tasks here?    We will set up the missing institutions in the investment  and  social spheres and in the management of the domestic and foreign  state debt, as well as support for Russian industrial exports.    On the other hand, it is necessary to take a careful look at  what has been achieved by, for example, existing institutions  like the State Investment Fund, the Financial Corporation, the  Russian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and countless  extrabudgetary funds. Plenty of time has already elapsed since  they were set up. What return have these structures provided,  especially since many of them were given the rights of  government agents?    There is just one approach here -- state funds and state  prestige must serve national economic interests.    Institutional transformations will be continued in the  sphere  of banking. The Central Bank regrettably does not always rise  to the situation. We expect it to make specific proposals on  how to develop the banking system. We are in favor of  amalgamating banking capital and bringing it closer to  production up to the point where it would be directly involved  in the financial-industrial groups that are being formed. We  are also in favor of lifting the unwarranted restrictions on  participation in privatization and the investment process in  1994. I think that life will force us to take a different  approach to competition with foreign banks. Our bankers by no  means benefit from "hothouse" conditions. We cannot see or feel  any initiative, where is it?    Strengthening legislative backup for market reforms remains  the government's special concern. Using its constitutional  right of legislative initiative, the government has prepared  over 60 top-priority draft laws for the State Duma to examine.  Suffice it to mention the draft Civil, Commercial, and Criminal  Codes, amendments to the laws on enterprises and on banks, draft  laws on state monopolies, on the fundamental principles of  self-government, on mortgages, and so on.    It would take too long to list all the draft laws we have  initiated. A list of them has already been sent to the State  Duma. What is more, it is very important that the draft federal  constitutional law "On the Government of the Russian Federation"  be drafted and submitted to the Duma forthwith.    The adoption of this law would be the culmination of the  reorganization of the federal executive structure in line with  the Constitution.    The government's work is also being restructured to preclude  duplication and draw a distinct line between the areas of  competence of the Presidential Administration, the Security  Council, and executive organs at local level. To date the  number of federal executive and state government organs has  dropped from 93 to 77, including a fall in the number of organs  in the Government from 37 to 23. The number of apparatus  personnel, including government apparatus personnel, is also  being cut.    Agrarian reform provides a classic example of the formation  of new market institutions. I will be frank and say that its  future is beginning to cause misgivings. The government's  interest in this is supremely clear. The more intensive the  transformations in the agrarian sector, the more effective the  structure of ownership, the fewer problems with reform, and the  less strain on the budget. Subsidies for agricultural producers  are essential, but they are burdensome for the budget and often  ineffective now. We must be realists after all! By the middle  of last year we had not only drawn close to, but had effectively  overstepped the mark in terms of the amount of budget aid that  we can give agriculture without jeopardizing other sectors of  the economy.    At the same time I must also mention the unscrupulous  speculation regarding the government's policy on the agrarian  sector. The figure of 34 trillion rubles [R] -- which  Chernomyrdin allegedly wants to earmark for agriculture from  budget funds -- has been brought up by someone and has begun to  appear in the press. That is not true, I would willingly  provide that amount, but where is it to come from? The measures  of state support in force in 1993 will remain the same in 1994,  but no more.    We are embarking on the radical reform of the whole system  of  state support for agriculture. We will provide money in return  for a guaranteed result and for strictly defined purposes.    We must know how much food -- and of what quality -- Russian  citizens will receive in return for the budget funds allocated.  We will extend our support for agricultural production via the  network of specialized credit and other market institutions:  cooperative, mortgage, and land banks, consumer credit  companies, and wholesale food markets.    Everything that I have mentioned, plus rigorous observance  of  the balance of powers and responsibility between the Center and  the regions, are the main components of policy in 1994, a policy  that is designed to streamline the economic system.    But there are also urgent problems that need to be resolved  over the next two-three months.    These are primarily the creation of mechanisms to resolve  the  crisis of reciprocal nonpayments in the national economy.    In order to combat nonpayments the government has formulated  additional measures to improve settlements in the national  economy. We will introduce compulsory registration of all  enterprises' accounts, including those abroad, and tighten up  administrative and financial liability for concealing such  accounts and for exceeding the timeframe for processing payment  documents.    The work on converting overdue debts into bills of exchange  will be completed in March or April. This will make it possible  to tackle the nonpayment problem on a regular basis in line with  the requirements of a market economy. And we will rigorously  apply the following rule: If you do not have the money to pay  your debts, your property is forefeit. It is time that  creditors learned to recover their debts via the courts and not  put their trust in "kind uncles" in the government.    However, resolving the problem of nonpayment and collecting  taxes in full is not just the task of the Federal Government.  The Central Bank of Russia is being intolerably slow in its  work to create a reliable, fast payment system based on  interbank clearing and the use of modern technical facilities  and new means of payment. Controls have been relaxed with  regard to the activity of commercial banks which "hold" to their  own advantage money which enterprises have paid to cover  reciprocal debts or in taxes. Tough, prompt steps must be taken  here. Consider this both a request and an instruction to the  Central Bank leadership.    The economic situation requires a resolute enhancement of  the  effectiveness of financial policy.    We cannot allow ourselves the luxury of living for two years  without a ratified budget, to all intents and purposes amid  financial lawlessness. Therefore the number one task is to  complete the work on the draft budget for 1994.    The key task here remains to prevent the budget deficit  rising through inflationary sources of funding. The main means  of stopping this is to reduce the rate of inflation to 7-9  percent by the end of the year and the federal budget deficit to  no more than 9-10 percent of GDP.    I would point out that these parameters must be regarded as  the maximum permissible levels -- particularly in terms of the  level of inflation -- as a kind of "minimum program." When  implementing the budget and carrying out other measures, we will  actively seek reserves which make it possible to consistently  move toward the figure of 3-5 percent inflation by the end of  the year mentioned in the president's message.    Needless to say, this represents a fairly tight framework  especially since we have to pay in full the debts carried over  from 1993.    Regrettably, this year too we will be unable to avoid  sequestration. But how are we to approach this? A simple  repetition of last year's method, using the principle of  something for everyone, can only aggravate the situation.    We may "lose" all structural and investment policy if we do  not carry out a detailed preliminary analysis of the financial  situation in each sphere of budget funding and the consequences  of a further reduction in spending. And we have no right to  permit that now.    The structure of budget spending and the mechanism for  funding this spending are being substantially reformed.    Extremely tight supervision is being established to ensure  that budget appropriations reach their destination promptly and  are used for their prescribed purpose. The results of 1993  showed that state funds by no means always reach those for whom  they were destined. As happened, for instance, with the budget  loans to cover grain procurements, which were used by  Roskhleboprodukt to fund its current spending.    Beginning in March, the Ministry of Finance will be  responsible for delivering monthly reports to the government  regarding the results of inspections to verify that budget  appropriations have reached their destination.    A government commission will carry out similar inspections  regarding the utilization of centralized credit resources. The  situation here, as you know, is even worse: The recipient  receives the money every six months, or not at all. Things are  particularly bad with regard to credits for "shipments to the  North."    Funding of targeted social security, along with support for  certain sectors of industry, the agro-industrial complex, the  fuel and energy complex, and the investment complex remain a  priority in state spending in 1994.    It is envisaged that over 20 percent of all budget spending  will be channeled into these areas. Spending on financial  support for the regions is up from 10 to 13.4 percent. Compared  with 1993 appropriations for payment of wages in the  budget-funded sphere are also up (from 6.7 to 7.2 percent).    Financial stabilization cannot be ensured without an  effective /tax system./ It is here that the main reserves for  raising budget revenue are concentrated.    The government regards the following as priority tasks:  ensuring the stability of the tax system, considerably  simplifying and streamlining taxation procedures, abolishing  individual concessions to enterprises and regions, and  reinforcing the tax service.    At the same time we will improve tax legislation in order to  ensure that it helps to support commodity producers and  stimulate investments.    That will ultimately enable us to avoid introducing new  taxes  and levies and reduce the overall burden of taxation.    Tax arrears and extremely poor financial discipline are  still  the major problem. The situation here is not merely  intolerable, but effectively an emergency. In 1993 alone the  federal budget failed to receive R7.5 trillion or 30 percent of  the total predicted revenue.    Enterprises' and organizations' tax arrears which are  increasing every month amid the ongoing nonpayments crisis are  particularly alarming. In January 1994 alone the federal budget  was owed almost R1 trillion in tax arrears.    These figures conceal a scandalous situation, one that  affects virtually all sectors of the national economy, moreover.  In the fuel and energy complex, in particular, in the last six  months alone tax avoidance has been revealed to total R200  billion! Especially major irregularities have been revealed at  the "Kirishinefteorgsintez," "Permneft," and "Orenburgneft"  Production Associations and other enterprises. Thus an audit at  the "Kirishinefteorgsintez" Production Association revealed that  hard-currency profits had been concealed along with major  irregularities in financial documentation. The budget has  recovered around R13 billion, including fines.    Nevertheless, the tax service and the tax police still have  an extremely low success rate. Since it spends a considerable  amount of money on over 135,000 personnel in these organs, the  state has a right to expect them to be more effective in  suppressing tax crime and in collecting the state revenue due in  full and on time.    I would particularly like to dwell on the radical  restructuring of budget relations with the regions, which is one  of the main areas of financial policy in 1994.    The new system of budget federalism will be based on unified  rules whereby state spending and revenue are to be allocated  among the federal budget and the budgets of Federation  components. With no exceptions. That will make it possible to  avoid unnecessary centralization of spending and to create a  real revenue base for federal and regional budget autonomy.    The main principles and avenues for the reform of budget  relations have been laid down in the president's message and his  22 December 1993 edict. Our task is to work out forthwith a  coordinated mechanism for their implementation in the 1994  budget.    To wind up the subject of the budget I would like to  underline particularly the following point: To all intents and  purposes in this document we have tried for the first time in  many years to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. It is  all there for the public to see: How much we have at our  disposal, how we intend to handle what we have got. The  government has no "secret hiding places." Let us act on the  basis of reality and learn to live according to our means.  There is no, and there will be no other option.    The choice is an extremely tough one: If we allow  hyperinflation, we will break into a flat spin from which there  is no escape. If we stop production, we will end up with a  country in ferment, amid collapse and chaos. Thus, we have to  literally walk on a knife edge and show strength of character in  order to prevent any breakdown. That is the main question today,    Structural-investment policy is taking center stage today  among the priorities of economic reform. Very many industrial  enterprises have found themselves in an extremely difficult  situation -- either they reorganize production and find  themselves a real long-term foothold in the market or they close  down, forever. I think that everyone is aware of the social  consequences of this choice, which may be an extremely common  phenomenon.    This is why the state simply no longer has the right to  remain aloof. We have no more resources. Financial  restrictions are becoming tighter and tighter. But we must  therefore start the maneuvers that will in time enable us to  expand the frontiers and create the conditions for stable growth.    The national economy already has certain resources in the  form of private savings. But they are not geared to production  investment in current conditions without state support. At the  same time the amount of budget spending on state investment is  far inferior to subsidies and grants and, at the same time, the  bulk of this money is invested in facilities with a dubious  return, to put it mildly. This is an impasse from which we must  extricate ourselves.    We will first embark on the radical redistribution of budget  funds into state investment. To total 3 percent of GDP (up from  1.7 percent). Three-fourths of budget funds destined for  capital investment will be used to fund the construction of  federal installations within the framework of the corresponding  state programs. Naturally, we must review the list of these  installations and considerably tighten our belts.    Without abandoning our avowed priorities in structural  policy  we are now switching to a more specific "point-by-point"  definition of these priorities. Investment policy in 1994 is  being adjusted with an eye to this. Around 40 of the 66 federal  programs that have already been ratified and submitted to the  government this year will be implemented. At the same time we  are revising the procedure for the provision of subsidies and  grants. They will drop from 9 to 7.4 percent of total budget  spending in 1994. And that is not the end.    It is also necessary to learn that state investments are not  only investments in capital construction but also in enterprise  reorganization, improvement of management, scientific  developments, the development of a sales network and marketing  services, and personnel training. Small investments in  "eliminating" countless difficulties and adapting enterprises to  market requirements that will bring a return in a year or two  can more rapidly ensure a breakthrough in the production sphere.    We cannot further delay work to shut down ineffective  production units. We already have a list of enterprises whose  viability is to be checked out. Many will simply have to be  shut down. Needless to say, we will do that in our own good  time, mindful of people's interests, the state of cities and  regions, and opportunities for creating new jobs. It will be a  hard decision. But it must be done.    The government will help in carrying out major investment  projects involving private capital that are of fundamental  importance for the future of the Russian economy. We have  something to offer the private sector and foreign investors. We  already have projects for housing construction, the construction  of toll highways and bridges, and the development of civil  aviation and the automobile industry, projects whose  implementation will provide hundreds of thousands of extra jobs  by forming new markets and reviving business activity in these  and associated sectors -- namely the development of highway  machine building, the construction industry, and so on.    It is particularly important that real conditions should  emerge for major resettlement programs in many parts of the  Chernozem Zone, the Nonchernozem Zone, and the Urals, for  instance, which people left in order to open up new areas and  build industrial complexes in the former USSR republics, and so  on.    I think that state funds will bring the greatest return if  they are provided on commercial principles, via banks and other  financial institutions. It is these institutions that can  select, professionally formulate, and evaluate investment  projects, invest their own resources and those they have  enlisted in these projects, and bear economic accountability for  their effective use as scheduled.    I must say that banks and entrepreneurs are already  beginning  to show interest in this work. I have got to sign a government  decree which envisages measures to stimulate private investment  organized by a consortium of Russian banks and entrepreneurs.  It is intended to provide state guarantees for private  investment in projects they have chosen in conjunction with the  Russian Ministry of the Economy. New proposals of this kind  must be implemented and formulated without fail.    I take this opportunity today to urge entrepreneurs,  bankers,  and leaders of major joint-stock companies, in a word, Russian  business people to be bolder in participating in investment  projects and enlisting capital to our Russian market. And there  are projects in which to invest. Splendid projects,  interesting, highly profitable projects in which investors can  recoup their investment. The government will do all this and  will be accountable, jointly with you, for the results.    I am convinced that only then will foreign investors be  bolder and more confident about following your lead.    The result being that we will obtain what the country needs  so badly today -- highly productive labor, "high" technologies,  modern machinery and equipment, and production discipline and  order that are up to world standards. And we will therefore be  able to produce output that society really needs, output that  will not be afraid of competition on either the home or the  foreign markets.    I am convinced that we can achieve this by joint efforts.    During the next stage of reform one of the most important  instruments for the structural restructuring of the economy,  which is proceeding by strengthening the institutions of private  ownership, is /privatization./    By 1 July we must complete the program of mass (check)  privatization. This means that we must provide every Russian  citizen with an opportunity to invest vouchers in shares in  enterprises or investment funds, in plots of land, and other  facilities.    A new phase of privatization policy will start as of the  second half of the year. During this phase the main form of  privatization will be commercial and, most importantly,  investment tenders with fairly tough terms which ensure the  reorganization and modernization of enterprises and the  requisite flow of investment, including from abroad.    The progress of privatization is undoubtedly one of the most  important criteria by which one can judge the extent to which  the Russian economy is acquiring market qualities. From this  viewpoint it is extremely important to ensure that in 1994  privatization becomes a kind of locomotive of reform at  microlevel. We must bring reform to enterprise level and  consolidate it via real changes in the economic behavior of  Russian commodity producers.    In order to achieve this it is necessary to, first, launch  mechanisms for financial recovery and bankruptcies at  enterprises that are recognized to be insolvent debtors, which  are essentially unnecessary and operating at a loss.    Second, it is a question of postprivatization support for  enterprises. One "sound" plan based on the "LOMO" Association  in St. Petersburg is already prepared. I know that another 12  similar projects are in the offing. That is something. But  efforts must be stepped up. In 1994 we must create a continuous  flow of projects to restructure enterprises. We will use  foreign credits provided by the G-7, the World Bank, and the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for this  purpose.    The purpose of all our privatization efforts today is to  move  away from distributing and redistributing property to creating  the conditions to enhance the effectiveness and competitiveness  of production, improve management, and stimulate investment.  There are tremendous reserves here and we must utilize them.  <H5>  4. Carrying Out Reform for People </H5>   It should be acknowledged that social policy has proved to  be  a weak point in the government's work. Such a situation cannot  be tolerated any more and must be rectified forthwith.    The majority of citizens should feel that the reforms are  bringing real benefits to them, their families, and the people  around them and that the full burden of the crisis is being  borne not only by ordinary working people but also by those who  -- in the new conditions -- have drastically shot ahead in terms  of prosperity.    We are, of course, carrying out reform not in order that  "there be no rich" but, on the contrary, in order that there be  no poor. But we have no right either to allow a ten- to  elevenfold gap to develop in incomes and standard of living  between the lowest-income and highest-income groups of the  population and let Russia become the world record holder in this  regard.    Reform should be not just economically effective but also  socially just!    In this regard the government has recently been working on  the formulation of a more vigorous social policy course. You  have been issued with the draft Basic Guidelines of Social  Policy of the Russian Federation for 1994, supported by a list  of priority tasks. Incidentally, several of them have already  been implemented.    Seeking to ensure that social policy take more specific  account of the interests of all strata of the population, the  government intends first and foremost to enhance targeted  support for the disadvantaged and strengthen the financial base  of the relevant funds. Recalculation of the old-style pensions  will start on 1 April 1994, in accordance with the president's  edict. The new pensions law, the draft of which will be  submitted to the Federal Assebly for examination, will be the  next step aimed at improving pensioners' material position.    It is extremely necessary to do everything possible to  ensure  that priority is given to veterans and those people who simply  cannot wait for an overall solution of the problem during the  process of /gradually restoring the savings/ of citizens. Some  of the savings could and indeed must be restored by transferring  some state property -- shares, state enterprises, and land -- to  depositors. The government is now working on this task.    Unemployment has become tangible. There is still relatively  little overt unemployment, but almost 4 million people are now  working part time. And we must be prepared for an upsurge in  the problems of unemployment in the immediate future -- we must  be prepared in psychological, material, and organizational  terms. It is essential to start considering right now in  specific terms the organization of public works, particularly  the construction of housing, roads, bridges, and other socially  important facilities. I am repeating myself again, but I do  regard this as extremely important. We will give priority  support to all private capital initiatives in this sphere.    The government intends/to intensify incomes policy/  substantially, we will introduce tougher progressive taxation of  high and very high incomes and the declaration of incomes when  carrying out major purchases, and will make changes to the  taxation of real estate.    The procedure for regulating enterprises' outlay on labor  remuneration is being changed. The gap between the wages of  enterprise directors and the wages of the bulk of the workers --  which is sometimes gigantic -- must be closed. It is  unacceptable when the average wage of a worker is 50,000 rubles  [R] while the director allocates himself 3-4 million for his  vacation.    The introduction of an official subsistence level and the  linking of the size of the minimum wage and minimum pension to  it will be an important step. The country's financial position  does not permit their equalization during 1994. However, the  government does consider the creation of conditions for their  subsequent harmonization to be one of its most important tasks.    And one more thing I would like to say. Is there anyone at  local level and in the sector departments thinking about what  people will do if their plant goes bankrupt or production comes  to a halt?    They may have skilled hands, a clear brain, and an enormous  desire to work, but a host of bans, restrictions, and  bureacratic obstacles prevent their opening up a "business" --  the business may be small but it could develop with time into a  major production unit of Russia-wide importance. I see the  government's task here as being to remove as quickly as possible  all obstacles to displays of initiative, enterprise, and hard  work by our citizens.    Today we should promote the task of drastically boosting  housing construction and making the acquisition of housing  easier for the population, particularly for low-income groups.  This is, in the full meaning of the word, a nationwide task. A  package of decrees has already been adopted on the development  of a system for granting credit in the housing sphere and on  subsidies for the construction and acquisition of housing,  including subsidies to people on waiting lists, servicemen, and  others in preferential categories. But this is extremely  little. In future we intend to increase out efforts, developing  above all extrabudgetary forms of investment in housing  construction, attracting private capital and foreign investment  into this sphere, and bringing new credit and mortgage  mechanisms into operation.    It has to be honestly admitted that today we are not in a  position to repay in full from the federal budget all that is  owed to the spheres of science, education, and culture, notably  as regards compliance with the president's edict No. 1. This is  both our misfortune and our pain. I consider that it is  impossible for the regions either to stand aloof from this now.  At the same time, while I do understand the sense of  dissatisfaction felt by higher education lecturers, students,  and staffers of scientific institutes, I have to say frankly  that the system of science and higher education will not survive  without rationalization of their activity, sensible  redistribution of resources, and jettisoning of superflous  tiers. A selective approach is also required here -- the best  must be kept.    The underfinancing of social expenditure is a very serious  question. But there is also another aspect too. The  preparation of documents and decisions aimed at radically  reforming the social sphere has been dragged out intolerably and  the new mechanisms for social protection and the implementattion  of incomes policy are being developed and introduced into  practice extremely slowly. I want to draw the attention of  ministers with a social brief to this.    Fighting crime is our nationwide social, political, and -- I  would also say -- economic priority task.    I would like to convey to you our serious concern over the  current state of law and order in the country and the ability of  the authorities to counter the aggression of the criminal world.  There are still to date very, very few real and, most  importantly, effective measures capable of easing the tension  surrounding the growing threats to society and to people's life,  health, and property. Russians have the right to expect and  demand more from us all.    I will refer to just a few trends, first and foremost those  in the economic sphere.    The danger of organized crime and corruption is growing.  According to the figures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  criminal associations control at least 40,000 businesses,  including buisnesses in the state sector. The unprecedented  scale of criminal activity in the finance and banking systems is  causing special alarm. We estimate that the damage now runs  into hundreds of billions of rubles.    All this is no longer just a list of unpleasant facts. What  we have here is a dangerous trend toward the malignant  degeneration of a number of pieces of the living tissue of the  economy. We see the danger and will block it.    We are carrying out tough measures aimed at freeing state  structures from the influence of mafia elements, organized  crime, and corrupt individuals. We will act regardless of the  person involved, as it were.    We are also implementing the task put forward in the  president's message of taking all necessary financial, cadre,  and organizational measures necessary to ensure the normal  operation of the law enforcement organs. We will be doing all  within our power to ensure that the just-adopted federal  anticrime program operates to its full potential.    Esteemed participants in the session,    the government bears a great responsibility today --  responsibility for the progress of reform, its cost to the  millions of people, and for the political temperature of the  young Russian democracy, which is going through the difficult  period of its self-determination both in this country and the  world.    Each week this year will see this responsibility merely  augmented by more and more facets.    We do not have classic "government parties" in our country.  Nor do we have monotonous "orthodoxy" subject to some kind of  party discipline. We have already gone through all that. There  are parties whose representatives work in the cabinet on a  professional basis. In presenting to society today our  understanding of the tasks at the new stage of reform we can see  that they are in keeping with the demands and manifestos of many  parties and movements. And it follows from this that political  consolidation and national accord are gaining real ground in  Russia today.    I would like to express the hope that the State Duma's act  of  political and economic amnesty will, for all the differences in  interpretation of that decision, nevertheless become a step  toward reconciliation and not signify another spiral in  confrontation and destabilization of the situation in society.    The president and the government stand as firm guarantors  ensuring that no such development of events occurs.    I cannot today avoid touching on a problem that is extremely  important both for me personally and for the government I head.  The point is that a noisy campaign has recently been launched by  some mass media organs aimed at "convicting" the government  chairman of concentrating power, of taking too much upon  himself, and of virtually organizing plots to take over the  presidency. Even some polls have begun to be organized on this  topic.    Let me tell you honestly and frankly that I am not one of  those versatile "whizz kids" who can immediately leap from being  laboratory head to being a minister and then president.    First: Russia is not a racing car and I have not gotten  behind its wheel, taken it for a spin, and then gotten out of  it, leaving the whole country trembling as if suffering from a  fever.    Second, I consider it impossible and simply unethical to  hold  any discussion on the presidency while there is a president in  office. We have a nationwide leader elected by all the people,  and I have no intention of scheming against him.    And, third, attempts to drive a wedge between the president  and the chairman and cause us to fall out are in vain. It won't  work. There is no point in trying.    We all need accord today. All branches of power and all  leaders, whichever posts they occupy, need it. Accord is  essential for all the people.    All the conditions for this are in place. There is the new  Constitution. There is the president, who acts as a reliable  guarantor of reforms and stability. There are the bases of the  concept of national development formulated in the president's  Message. There is parliament, which, for all the diversity of  views on the country's present and future represented in it,  aims to secure Russia's strategic interests. There is the  government, which is committed to the president's course and is  open to businesslike cooperation and professional work with  everyone who is ready and really want this.    There is finally the Russians' common desire to revive the  country as a great, powerful, and prosperous state.    This year promises to see the development and strengthening  of many healthy economic processes. There is therefore every  reason to hope that the gradual stabilization of the economy and  normalization of life will finally become a tangible reality for  miliions of people.    For all this to happen we have to think more about work  today. Strict dicipline, order, and a sense of responsibility  are absolutely essential to us.    All of us must really shake ourselves up and realize that  what we need today is to create and work, ditching old relations  and old production units while maintaining and supporting modern  high-tech production and the fundamental sciences, for otherwise  we will fall into the trap of stagflation, which will lead in  turn to the total degradation of the whole economy    We must not fall below the start-up level so essential if a  powerful upsurge in the industrialization of the country is to  be launched.    Although certain "friends" very much wish this upon us.    We cannot allow the people of a country, which possesses  powerful resources and all that is required for [economic]  reproduction, to live in poverty -- that is a crime, a crime  which can be neither explained nor understood.    I appeal to members of the government, the leaders of  departments, the intelligentsia, and academics -- we must create  the conditions and mechanisms for free labor, and we need to do  this quickly, without delay.    I appeal to parliamentarians and the two speakers of the  chambers -- we expect of you the laws and statutes that are so  essential and necessary, and also perhaps provisional statutes  at times during this transitional period -- the main thing is  that work should not stop.    I appeal to our labor collectives in all regions of the  country -- the difficulties we face are enormous, but trying to  solve them by strikes and stoppages is a delusion, it will only  make the situation of your families and friends worse rather  than improving it. That is not what is required today -- we  must all stand firm together, that way we will pull through.    We need less moaning and whining today and more initiative  and self-discipline. That is the only way we will be able to  pull out of the spin we are in, gain height, and develop a  cruising speed for reforms.    This is where I today see the thrust of the government's  work  in 1994.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Games move by Olympic bidder MANCHESTER yesterday took the first steps towards bidding for the Commonwealth Games in 2002, with the aim of ensuring that a national stadium is built in the city as a springboard for another attempt to host the Olympic Games, this time in 2004, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Organisers of the failed bid for the 2000 Olympics have started talks with potential backers and sporting interests. If a consortium can be formed the Commonwealth Games Federation for England will be asked to make Manchester its candidate. Mr Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, acknowledged that many recent Commonwealth Games had lost money, but said media rights would be more attractive after South Africa's re-admission. Mr Bob Scott, leader of the Olympic bid, said the stadium and athletes' village would continue to be focal points for regeneration in Manchester.</p>

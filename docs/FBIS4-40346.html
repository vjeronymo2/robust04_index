			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with head of state Eduard Shevardnadze by </F> correspondent Nato Oniani on 14 June; place not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] Today or tomorrow peacekeeping forces  will enter Abkhazia. [passage omitted] How hopeful are you on  the eve of the introduction of peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia?    [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] The Russian president and I  welcome the fact that this operation is carried out under UN  supervision and with the UNHCR's [UN High Commissioner for  Refugees] active participation. UN supervision and an active  involvement and assistance of one of its structures, the UNHCR,  combined with the participation of Armed Forces from Russia and  the CIS, which is an interregional organization, create a fairly  promising atmosphere. This should answer your question about  the level of my expectations.    There is always some doubt before any such operation. I may  have certain doubts too, especially if our bitter experience and  the serious lesson we have been given are taken into account.  But we had to make a choice. I think that the decision that we  made was the only possible option at this stage. Moreover, as I  told you, the peace-keeping operation will to a certain extent  be supervised by international organizations.    Returning to your question about whether or not I am  hopeful,  I would say that yes, I am hopeful and I believe that this  operation will certainly be a success. Tens of thousands of  people will return to their homes. This problem, which is a  matter of concern in Georgia and elsewhere, is now closer than  ever to its solution. This is my opinion and my answer.    [Oniani] As regards the choice, the opposition has a  different opinion. They believe that there was an alternative  solution, which is something that Azerbaijan has opted for.  Although Azerbaijan faces the threat of losing Ganja, it  nevertheless would not agree to the introduction of Russian  troops.    Parliament heard today [14 June] that Russian peace-keeping  forces had already shown their true colors in Samachablo [South  Ossetia] and Tajikistan. There was also dissatisfaction with  the planned participation in the operation of the parachute  battalion regiment stationed in Gudauta, which, to put it  mildly, was giving us a lot of trouble during the war in  Abkhazia. It was also said that Georgia was losing whatever was  left of its sovereignty.    [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] It would not be right to  draw a parallel between us and Azerbaijan just because it has  lost a fifth of its territory but is still holding its ground.  Such comparisons are not right because Azerbaijan has its own  distinctive qualities, resources, reserves, and perhaps even  some countries behind its back. All this requires a deeper  analysis and serious consideration. A lot has to be taken into  consideration before an accusation is made, especially when it  is made in parliament.    I am not in disagreement with the Azerbaijan leadership at  all. We have excellent relations and we often confer with each  other. I have nothing to say that would be critical of Heydar  Aliyev's position. But we in our position had either to take  the current course of action or that of war.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Extension for Queens Moat petition Mr Dennis Woodhams, a dissident Queens Moat Houses shareholder, and the company were yesterday given a further 14 days to present evidence to the Companies Court to back a petition he issued last November under S459 of the Companies Act. Mr Woodhams complained that shareholders had been given insufficient information and this was prejudicing the interests of some shareholders. In an affidavit Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive of QMH, said the petition was premature as the group could not give shareholders detailed information until it had agreed terms of its planned Pounds 1.3bn debt refinancing. QMH regards Mr Woodhams as a needless diversion running up legal costs. The court ordered a full hearing of the petition without delay, although this is not expected to take place for a few months.</p>

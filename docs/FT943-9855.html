			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Failed directors beware - Disqualifications are poised to increase in the UK Regulators are sharpening their teeth for an altogether more aggressive approach towards the conduct of those in charge of insolvent companies. The Department of Trade and Industry plans to increase considerably the number of directors of failed companies that it seeks to have disqualified. It is also acting to ensure that insolvency practitioners in the private sector take a tougher line in providing the information to bring disqualification proceedings. The changes follow a critical report last year from the National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog, suggesting that too few directors were disqualified as a proportion of companies that collapse. The NAO suggested that the DTI's Insolvency Service was acting against only about half the directors identified by practitioners or its own staff as candidates for disqualification. For two consecutive years, the service has been given extra resources for disqualification work. It is also clearing a backlog of outstanding cases. In the 12 months to the end of March, while there were more than 20,000 company insolvencies, only 464 cases were brought for disqualification, as well as 257 prosecution reports on companies and 392 on personal bankruptcies. In stark contrast, in a parliamentary answer in June, Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, said there were likely to be 750 to 800 disqualification petitions this year. There will also be what the service calls a 'significant' increase in prosecutions. Even this level will be below the rule of thumb used by many insolvency practitioners, who estimate that about 10 per cent of the directors of failed companies deserve to be disqualified. Ian Bond, an insolvency partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that difficulties in identifying miscreant directors are compounded by how hard it can be to make a case in court. 'One of the problems is that there hasn't been enough publicity to get directors really frightened,' he says. Insolvency practitioners must fill out 'D-forms' or conduct reports on all directors connected to the companies on which they are working. They comment and tick a box if they believe disqualification should take place. The Insolvency Service is putting pressure on practitioners to ensure that they provide sufficient information to make the basis of the case to prosecute a director. Practitioners make their recommendations for disqualification based on guidelines from the Insolvency Service which directors would do well to heed. Those deemed important in judging whether a director is not 'fit and proper' to run another company include: Misfeasance or breach of duty: whether the directors have received money for services other than remuneration which has resulted in a loss to the company; authorised payments to themselves; undisclosed transactions which resulted in loss. Failure to comply with the Companies Act requirements to keep and preserve accounting records and information such as statutory registers and returns. Misappropriation or retention of company monies or property. Transactions defrauding creditors. When the company has become insolvent, factors for practitioners to consider include: Causes of failure and insolvency. Trading without regard to the interests of creditors. Trading without reasonable prospect of payment of creditors' claims. Use of 'phoenix' companies where assets, customers or trading style may resemble closely those in a previous company. Taking payments or deposits if the directors know the company is insolvent. Undervaluing transactions, preferences and dispositions of property. Duty of the directors to assist the insolvency practitioners in their work. The insolvency practitioner will also consider the sums at stake and the degree of public interest in disqualification. If the rules are introduced and the Insolvency Service prosecutes, directors who have not paid heed may find themselves in prison, or banned from taking on new directorships for as many years as the courts decide.</p>

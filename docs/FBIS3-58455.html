			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has said current  intensive attempts on the part of the Greek Cypriot  administration towards armament are incompatible with the  principles of goodwill at a time when the confidence building  measures have been included on the agenda and efforts are being  exerted to resume the intercommunal talks.    In a written statement on Greek Cypriot armament efforts,  Atun said that some 5 trillion Turkish lira has been allocated  to arms purchases in the Greek Cypriot defense budget for 1994.  He added that the arms purchases, which have been intensified  within the framework of the military doctrine signed with  Greece, once again show that Kliridhis' disarmament proposal is  not serious. Atun said that it is beneficial to know that  trust cannot be built between the two peoples while policies of  armament and enmity continue, adding that the countries that are  selling arms to the Greek Cypriot community cannot contribute to  the peace process. He noted that Greece and other European  Union member countries, by arming the Greek Cypriot  administration, clearly demonstrate why the role the EU wants to  play in the Cyprus problem is unacceptable.    Drawing the attention of the UN secretary general and the  Security Council members to the armament activities that have  intensified following the signing of the Greek-Greek Cypriot  military doctrine, Atun called on the United Nations to put an  end to adventurist moves that will disrupt the atmosphere of  peace reigning on the island and that will create new tensions.</p>

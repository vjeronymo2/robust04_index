			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Machines in need of maintenance: Andrew Baxter explores the response of UK engineering companies to recession The reinvigoration of British industry has been pushed towards the top of the political agenda by the Conservatives' general election victory. Mr Michael Heseltine's appointment as secretary of an enlarged Trade and Industry Department heralds a more interventionist stance by a traditionally free-market government and a rejection of the DTI's recent minimalist role. Nowhere will this shift be felt more keenly than in the engineering sector, which is finding recovery hard after 20 years of decline compounded by 18 months of recession. So protracted has been the weakening of the industry and so severe the damage to its competitiveness that government help may be needed to foster a revival. The appointment of Mr Heseltine, who is committed to focusing the 'averted gaze' of government back on to industry, has met with a welcome response. 'We believe this will invigorate the DTI and help it find a strategy for industry,' said a senior executive at one engineering group yesterday. But the broad economic background does not look encouraging: engineering output has fallen from 11.8 per cent of the UK's gross domestic product in 1970 to about 8 per cent, and most engineering sectors grew at a lower rate than GDP from 1979-1989. Two recessions have reduced employment in engineering from 3.3m in 1979 to below 1.9m, and jobs are still being shed. The UK balance of trade in the main engineering sectors plummeted from a Pounds 4.32bn surplus in 1980 to a Pounds 5.34bn deficit in 1990. It recovered last year to a small surplus of Pounds 240m, according to an estimate by the Engineering Employers' Federation, as the recession choked off demand for imports. On a brighter note, UK engineering workers improved their productivity - average annual growth of real output per person - by 5.1 per cent from 1979-1989, a better performance than their Italian, French and German counterparts, but still lagging behind improvements in Japan and the US. So what is the future for Britain's engineering companies? A Financial Times series over the next 18 months will try to answer that question by tracking regularly the performance of six different engineering companies. The companies were asked how they have responded to the current recession and what lessons they have applied from the previous 1980-81 downturn; what is the short-term outlook for their UK business; and what might be the long-term effects of the recession on their ability to compete in domestic and international markets. The initial conclusions are decidedly mixed: five of the companies do not expect a real recovery in their UK markets until next year, either because they see no signs of life in the domestic or because the evidence of recovery is too slight. However, a better-managed industry has learnt lessons from the recession of the early 1980s and responded more quickly to a downturn of unprecedented severity. 'No corner has been left unexamined,' says Mr Gilbert Johnston, chief executive of JCB. The recession has forced companies to examine businesses and investments with a more critical eye. 'Like a rough sea, it shows where all the leaks are,' says Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group. However, the longer the recession persists, the greater the risk that business will stabilise permanently at its current low levels as the customer base is eroded. None of the six companies in the survey believes that has happened - yet. In contrast, all six paint a rosy picture of long-term growth. But, given the record of the UK's engineering decline, their confidence raises the question of whether they will be able to manage their way through the recession without sacrificing long-term prospects. The responses from the six companies suggest that the evidence is broadly positive: Extent and severity of recession. Operating in a variety of markets, the six went into recession at differing times and speeds. Weakening demand in the UK truck market hit the component business of Bloxwich Engineering as early as 1989 while Fenner marks the start of the UK recession at November 1990. At Senior's engineering products division, the UK market has been flat for 10 months, says Mr John Bell, divisional chief executive, while other companies 'hit bottom' only last autumn. A number of companies were surprised by the sudden onset of the recession, and had to grapple with a market decline that has been steeper, and lasted longer, than in 1980-1981. JCB's production volume has fallen by 40 per cent over two years from the heady levels of 1987 to early 1989. In the three years from 1980-1982, the decline was only 22 per cent, says Mr Johnston. Cost-cutting responses. All the companies have taken action in this area. UK workforces have been cut by an average 20-25 per cent, and every aspect of cost has been examined. But cutting jobs without causing serious long-term damage has been a concern for many companies. At Fenner, the UK headcount has been reduced by 20 per cent over the current recession. Mr Peter Barker, chairman, points out that 'there has been a steeper rate of decline than in the previous recession, and not so much to cut at'. But Fenner and others believe they have made such cuts without impairing their long-term research and development efforts. Other cuts have been made 'behind-the-scenes' in a way that does not affect long-term customer relationships. The 600 Group no longer makes its Colchester lathes in the Essex town and has switched production to its Harrison lathe plant in west Yorkshire, with the loss of 280 jobs. But the marketing network has remained unchanged. Strategic responses. The larger companies are trying to expand their sales overseas, especially in continental Europe, either because of relatively better market conditions  -such as in JCB's case - or to change the long-term balance between UK and international earnings so as to diversify income sources and reduce dependence on the UK economy. Senior's recent Dollars 40m acquisition of Flexonics, the largest US manufacturer of metallic flexible hose assemblies, exemplifies this trend. Although cyclical, the US market is less of a roller-coaster than the UK. Others have responded by taking advantage of non-recurring opportunities. At Fenner, production of some low-value added power transmission components has moved to Hong Kong - a response as much to a long-term shift in terms of trade as to the recession. Among the smaller companies, Posiva has learnt from its reliance on supplying the textile industry during the previous recession. This time it has moved quickly to supply gears to crane manufacturers and other industrial sectors, says Mr Reg Bricknell, chief executive. Capital spending. Here the picture is mixed. Posiva has benefited from the capital spending of its German parent company, while JCB, says Mr Johnston, has slowed its capital expenditure because of heavy investment in 1988 and 1989 which gave it a manufacturing capacity of 20,000 units a year, compared with current production levels of 10,000 units. But all six companies agree that the investment tap cannot be turned off in a recession. 'In engineering, if you do not invest to keep up to date, all you are going to do is go under in the next century,' says Mr Peter Burton, chief executive of Bloxwich Engineering. His company has invested in training and new machinery aimed at providing more quality in its vehicle components. Implications for long-term competitiveness. There is little doubt that if the six had not developed responses to the recession, the implications for their long-term competitiveness would have been severe. That is due as much to the length as to the depth of the downturn. Collectively, the six serve virtually every sector of UK industry, and have seen customers collapse, or struggle, under the weight of the recession. Mr Barker hopes the erosion of the UK customer base will be nothing like the 20 per cent reduction seen in 1980-81. To protect against such an eventuality, Fenner, along with the other companies, is redoubling efforts to internationalise. The recession, says Mr Johnston at JCB, has strengthened the company's determination to expand in Europe - particularly in the rapidly expanding German market. At Senior, Mr Bell says that 'the longer the UK recession goes on, you have to start wondering whether something more structural is happening. I don't believe it has thus far. It has not changed our perception of what things will return to.' But just as some customers have disappeared, so some of the companies' UK rivals have collapsed or been weakened. And, at least in JCB's sector of construction equipment, foreign rivals have become charier of entering a UK market described as 'perfectly ghastly' last year by one independent analyst. In contrast, the smallest company of the six, Posiva, is virtually restricted to selling in the UK and Ireland. But it recovered more quickly than larger competitors from a poor year in 1990. In response to a sharp fall in demand, Mr Bricknell cut the workforce from 24 to 18. Now, however, he is taking on two more salespeople 'to get more of a smaller cake'. Small engineering companies, it seems, can survive the vagaries of the UK market with a responsive management. Although some of the cuts may have been painful, the results may come through eventually in higher profits - an important factor for the sector's long-term competitiveness. Mr Gaskell at 600 Group says recessions do not have to be as deep as the present one to force companies to examine their cost base, but his company will be Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m more profitable when business recovers because it has cut costs and strengthened management. Similar benefits are expected across the companies surveyed. The only trouble is that the upturn has not arrived yet. And only when it does will it be possible to judge whether the companies have done enough, or cut too much, to exploit it. Subsequent articles in the series will establish when that recovery arrives, and whether the companies' long-term confidence is well-founded or just bluster. For now there is a glimmer of light. JCB said last week it is taking on 97 more employees in preparation for an expected increase in orders. Like its counterparts across the engineering sector, it will be hoping the light will not again be extinguished by recession. This is the first article in a series on the six engineering companies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK ENGINEERING INDUSTRY: SLIDING DOWN THE LEAGUE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Employment in engineering sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Million               1979      1989*      % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                    3.33      2.32          -30.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Italy                 1.96      1.57          -19.8 France                2.20      1.77          -19.4 US                    8.99      8.30           -7.6 W.

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong There is something unnerving about a market which rises as fast as Hong Kong has this year. A gain of nearly 8 per cent by yesterday suggests it is time for a correction, especially since the inspiration for the final spurt was classic froth - a false report that the Chinese government was dropping criminal charges against former leader Zhao Ziyang. Yet on a slightly longer perspective the heights reached by the Hang Seng are not so giddy. Relative to Wall Street, it has only just made up its loss following the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. It has still underperformed the S&amp;P Composite by over 15 per cent since the October 1987 crash. Since the market multiple of around 12 is not particularly expensive and the territory is bound to benefit from the recent trade accord between the US and China, there are solid grounds for presuming further upward movement. Progress is unlikely to be linear, however, and the pace is being forced at present because Hong Kong's link with the US dollar is holding money market rates well below the 11 per cent inflation rate. This advantage should unwind once US rates start rising again. The local prime rate has lagged the money market as interest rates have fallen. Official worries about inflation mean it is unlikely to do so as they come back up. By then a rising currency could make local products less competitive just as export markets in Germany and Japan are turning down. The resulting squeeze would leave equities facing much less settled times.</p>

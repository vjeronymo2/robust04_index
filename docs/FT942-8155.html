			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Versatile and various - Where your money goes . . . investment trust / Second in a series by Anthony Bailey on the true costs of investing Investment trusts are a versatile vehicle. They allow people access to a diverse range of portfolios - from general funds investing across the world to UK blue chips and higher-risk funds which specialise in a specific country, region, type of market or type of company. In addition, the range of shares in split capital trusts allows investors to select those which fulfil a particular aim. The actual costs of investing in these funds are not easy to compare with similar unit trusts. This is because the price of investment trust shares is determined by supply and demand in the market and not solely by the value of the underlying investments they hold. Dealing costs Since investment trusts are companies listed on the stock exchange, the most obvious cost for investors is that of buying and selling the shares. What you pay will depend on which broker you use, his commission, the value of shares you buy and, if you are investing only a small amount, the minimum commission. So, if you invest through a broker who charges 1.5 per cent, the cost of buying rises to 2 per cent (once 0.5 per cent stamp duty is added) - more if you invest a small amount and have to pay the minimum commission. A similar 1.5 per cent commission when you sell puts the total cost at 3.5 per cent of what you invest, or Pounds 35 on an investment of Pounds 1,000. These, along with the dealing spread (see below), are the figures to compare with the bid/offer spread of 5, 6 or 7 per cent incurred when you invest in unit trusts. Cheap entry The traditional broker is not the only way to buy investment trust shares. A number of management companies run schemes which allow investors cheap entry, either through regular monthly savings of at least Pounds 20 to Pounds 50, or via single lump sum investments of around Pounds 250 to Pounds 500. A few schemes make no dealing charge at all, while others have low dealing commissions of 0.2 per cent and perhaps a flat rate sale charge of Pounds 10. Even those schemes that charge 1 per cent compare well with many brokers, especially if there is no minimum charge. The snag with some schemes is that they do not deal every day, or even every week - so check. You also need to check just how cheap these schemes are. If you go through a financial adviser rather than directly to the management company, you might have to 'agree' to pay the adviser commission of up to 3 per cent. The bid/offer spread As with all shares, there is a difference between the higher offer price at which you buy and the lower bid price at which you can sell. This spread needs to be added to the buying and selling cost of shares to get a true comparison with the bid/offer spread of unit trusts. With some large, well-established general trusts, the spread can be narrow. It is 1.4 per cent with F&amp;C's original general trust, but 3.1 per cent on F&amp;C Germany. On City of Oxford's warrants, it is 27 per cent. New investment trusts There is no brokers' commission or stamp duty when you buy shares in a newly-launched trust, but that does not mean investing is free. The prospectus will have details of the launch costs, which could amount to 2 or 3 per cent or more. The new Fleming Indian investment trust had a launch cost of 4 per cent, so the starting net asset value of the investment was 96p a share. In practice, though, measuring the effect of this cost is not straightforward because what matters to investors is the actual value of the shares in the market place, not the net asset value. The management costs As with unit trusts, the managers of investment trusts charge an annual fee. In the case of Fleming Indian, the management company gets 1.2 per cent a year. This sort of charge is roughly comparable with the annual charge levied by unit trusts. But as well as paying a fee to the management company, an investment trust is a company in its own right with its own running costs. These must be added to the management company's fee to reach a figure for the total cost to investors - this being money which is not actually placed in stocks and shares. The best place to ascertain these costs is to look at the investment trust's annual report and accounts. Some of the larger, older general trusts may have overall costs of under 0.5 per cent, but others may be well over 1 per cent. One reason why investment trust costs can be lower than unit trusts is that the former is a closed-end fund. It does not have to maintain a dealing desk to respond to the constant demand from investors to buy and sell units. The discount/premium With a unit trust you are, essentially, paying for the costs of getting a professionally managed portfolio. So, costs - the money not actually invested - are an important factor (although, ultimately, it is the skill of the investment managers and the return in your hands which counts). Investment trusts are a bit different. One reason is that the price at which investors buy and sell is determined by market forces and not by a formula relating to the value of the actual assets held. Not so long ago, discounts of 30 per cent were common. In other words, you could buy assets worth 100p for 70p. While this sounds like a bargain, it is not so wonderful if you have to sell the shares at a 30 per cent discount, too (although you will have had the benefit of dividends on 100p worth of assets in the meantime). Discounts have narrowed, though, and the average discount now is nearer 8 per cent. Some shares are trading at a premium to the trust's net asset value. That is one reason why, on average, investment trusts have given investors better returns than unit trusts. But a narrowing discount is a one-off bonus  -and discounts may widen again. Purists would argue that discounts and premiums are nothing to do with the cost of investing; that they are part of assessing whether an investment trust share is good value. It is a fair point. But private investors who may be comparing the relative merits of investment and unit trusts with the same investment remit do need to be aware of this crucial difference.</p>

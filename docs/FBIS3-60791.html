As you may recall, 42d Criminal Court Judge Oscar Vera  Sandoval, who was in charge of the proceedings, issued an arrest  warrant against Halvorssen, former president of the CANTV  [National Telephone Company of Venezuela] and former  presidential commissioner of the Republic, as well as against  other people indicted in this case, including Ramiro Francisco  Helmeyer Oquendo.    The case was turned over to a higher court where 18th  Superior Court Judge Hector Marcano Batistini had to modify or  ratify the sentence handed down by the lower court. Dr.  Batistini announced his decision yesterday and just as expected,  Halvorssen was released early this morning. Halvorssen, who had  been confined for approximately two months in El Junquito  Judicial Penitentiary, abandoned the prison, accompanied by his  lawyers Luis Lugo and Vicente Puppio. [passage omitted]    Vicente Puppio and Luis Lugo, who defended Thor Halvorssen,  made statements as soon as they learned of Judge Marcano  Batistini's decision. Puppio spoke first, explaining that "we  always said that Halvorssen was innocent, as has been confirmed  by the decision of the 18th Superior Court judge." Halvorssen  was released, but we have to note that the judge of the 18th  Criminal Tribunal left the investigation open. [passage omitted]    Luis Lugo said that there is still an investigation pending  on the case, "but that Halvorssen regained his total freedom."    At 1145 Thor Halvorssen left El Junquito penitentiary, after  the papers for his release were taken to the prison in  compliance with the judicial order.    Upon leaving he said that the decision shows that justice  still prevails in Venezuela. He also reiterated his claim of  innocence. He asked to be allowed to meet with his family and  promised to hold a news conference in the coming days to explain  his position and to report publicly about the irregular  situation.</p>

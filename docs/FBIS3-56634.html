Opposition  Newspapers Suspended"]    [Text] According to the People's Front of Azerbaijan  (PFA)'s press service, local Internal Affairs Ministry officers  in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic have been carrying out  mass arrests of PFA activists since 12 January. Yadygar  Mamedli, chief of the PFA press service, said that "at 0500 on  12 January officers of the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs Ministry  were put on alert and were ordered to search the apartments of  the local PFA branch's activists." Within an hour, PFA members  D.Gasanov, I.Salakhov, V.Asadov, I.Mamedov, A.Mamedov, and  N.Agayev were arrested. A few days later, another two PFA  activists were detained in Babek rayon. All the detainees are  currently held in custody at the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs  Ministry's investigatory confinement block.    During Abulfaz Elchibey's stay in power they fought at the  Saderak front (in the western sector of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  border -- A.S.) as members of a volunteer battalion of the  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's Internal Affairs Ministry.  Following Abulfaz Elchibey's overthrow they all left the  battalion and expressed their loyalty to the former president.  Your SEGODNYA correspondent was told at the PFA press service  that no charges have yet been brought against the detainees.    The chief of the PFA press service said in a telephone  conversation with a SEGODNYA correspondent that "PFA leaders  assess the arrests as political reprisals and see them as  preparations for Abulfaz Elchibey's arrest." According to  Mamedli, "It cannot be ruled out that following the suit of  their Georgian counterparts the Azerbaijani authorities are  planning to destroy the former president physically," because  the other day Azerbaijani General Prosecutor Ali Omarov said on  republican television: "As long as two former presidents --  Ayaz Mutalibov and Abulfaz Elchibey -- exist, the threat of  political destabilization in the republic remains."    Aside from the arrests, the opposition is threatened with a  newspaper ban. In the new year a number of opposition  publications, such as MUKHALIFET, DZHUMKHURIET, YENI MUSAVAT,  KHURRIYET, ISTIGLYAL, and others, have already been suspended.  At present only 20 out of 600 registered newspapers are being  published in the republic. While previously officials at the  "Azerbaijan" printing house, which was resubordinated to the  presidential staff upon Geydar Aliyev's arrival to power,  attributed this to a lack of printing equipment, after the  newspapermen themselves found everything they needed, the  printing house's chiefs refused to sign a contract with  opposition newspapers. Opposition leaders say that this runs  counter to the republic's Law on Anti-Monopoly Activity, which  was passed last year by the Azerbaijani National Assembly.</p>

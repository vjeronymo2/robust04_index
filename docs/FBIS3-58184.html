Al-Qaysi first visited Foreign Ministry Under Secretary  Ozdem  Sanberk. The two delegations later held talks headed by the two  under secretaries, respectively.    Before the meeting, Sanberk said Turkey supports protecting  Iraq's unity and integrity, and sincerely hopes that country  will reassume its place in the international community.    Sanberk stressed that the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline is  an important investment for both countries. We have been  discussing the pumping of the oil in the pipeline for some time  now, he said. We have been making contacts and working on ways  to eliminate the problems created by the fact that the pipeline  was idle for three years, he said, and on ways to reactivate the  system once the embargo is lifted in the future.    Sanberk said that at the meeting they would discuss what  kind  of a common solution can be found to the problem within the  framework of UN Security Council resolutions.    Al-Qaysi said relations between the two countries are  historical ties of friendship. We will exchange views, he said,  on issues concerning the two countries.    Foreign Minister Hikmet will receive the Iraqi delegation  this afternoon.</p>

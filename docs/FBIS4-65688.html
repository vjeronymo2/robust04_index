			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "R.R.": "Occhetto Very Critical: Unfit </F> Government"]    [Text] Rome -- All [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi's  allies and Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian  Industry] like his program, but it is the subject of a barrage  of attacks from the opposition forces of both Left and Center.  And Gianfranco Miglio did not like the image of the "dream"  taken from Martin Luther King: "He is one of the people I  abhor," he commented, caustic as ever, "like all preachers and  people of that kind." The Northern League's Roberto Maroni was  pleased, appreciating the pragmatic nature of the speech and its  references to federalism. According to Gianfranco Fini  [National Alliance], "Berlusconi is not only someone who likes  specifics, but someone who is quite clear about this  government's political profile." New Minister Clemente  Mastella, of the CCD [Christian Democratic Center], was excited  by the prospect of a million new jobs: "It is like an athlete  trying to beat the world record."    The comments from adversaries were very different. While on  the one hand reassuring Berlusconi, ("ours will be a democratic  and constitutional opposition,") Occhetto reaffirmed his very  tough verdict: "This government humiliates Italy because of its  unfitness, the intrigues and maneuverings that accompanied its  formation, and the violation of the promises made to the  voters." As for its program, the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] leader described it as "very vague," and described as  "frightening" the absence of any reference to the issue of  southern Italy. Cesare Salvi, the PDS Senate leader, was blunt  about it: "Our `no' is unconditional." Luigi Berlinguer, the  PDS floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies, observed: "Rather  than a government program, it seems to me more like a television  program." Armando Cossutta, leader of the Communist Renewal  caucus, dismissed the speech "for three reasons: the failure to  reject all vestiges of fascism; the arrogance displayed with  regard to the political and ethical incompatibility between his  assets and the prime ministership; and because in economics he  is even further to the Right than Confindustria." The PSI's  [Italian Socialist Party] Ottaviano del Turco dismissed it as  follows: "Reticent on the subject of fascism, vague with regard  to guarantees, and generic with regard to all the points in the  program." The Rete's Mancuso criticized the speech for being  "obvious" and "demagogic, designed to win easy applause on the  subject of [killed anti-Mafia judges] Falcone and Borsellino."  Without going into details, the Democratic Alliance's Passigli  reaffirmed: "None of us will vote in favor." The Greens too  were tough; they do not believe in Berlusconi's promises with  regard to environmentalism: "If it really interested him,"  Manconi said, "he would not have granted the ministry to  Matteoli, who is a real enemy of the environment." On the  Center, officially all the responses are negative. "It would be  irresponsible to grant a vote of confidence," Rosy Bindi  commented; "it would be like setting a locomotive on a track in  the knowledge that you cannot in any way influence its course  and direction." Segni [Pact for Italy] called it "a second-rate  speech, just as the government team is second-rate." Senator  Agnelli summed it up as follows: "The part on foreign policy  was excellent, the part on economic policy was good, and the  rest was mediocre." He will decide how to vote after hearing  Berlusconi's reply. Giovanni Spadolini [Italian Republican  Party], however, has already decided not to vote in favor.  Roland Riz (South Tyrol People's Party) considers the speech  "good on the whole" but nevertheless confirmed that he will not  be granting his vote of confidence. Cesare Dujany (Val D'Aosta  Union) is still undecided, but wants more guarantees with regard  to local government. Last, the social partners. Confindustria  "acknowledges with pleasure" Berlusconi's pledges, and positive  assessments also came from Confartigianato [General  Confederation of Italian Artisans and Craftsmen] and CIDA  (business managers). The trade unions were more cautious,  preferring to judge the government on its actions.</p>

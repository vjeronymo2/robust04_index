			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BTR forms UK packaging arm BTR, the industrial con-glomerate, has brought together its UK packaging interests in a new company, ACI Rockware Group, which it said would create a focus for future growth under new management. BTR dominates the market for glass containers in Australia and the Pacific Rim, and bought into the UK and Europe through its Pounds 197m acquisition of Rockware in 1991. The new group will comprise Rockware Glass, one of the UK's biggest manufacturers of glass containers; Dartington Crystal, which makes giftware; ACI Rockware Plastics; and ACI Rockware's UK metal packaging operations, Decorpart and Presspart Manufacturing, plus Presspart's US associate. ACI Rockware said the reorganisation in the UK was designed to consolidate the management and operation of the group companies. Mr Alan Peterson, 45, who joined Rockware on 1990 as managing director of ACI Rockware Plastics, will fulfil the same role for the new group. Mr Allan Mawby, 43, previously finance director for ACI Rockware Plastics, will be group finance director. The group will continue to be part of ACI Packaging, which manages BTR's worldwide glass and plastics packaging operations. ACI is a division of BTR Nylex, the highly profitable subsidiary in which the UK company has a 61 per cent stake.</p>

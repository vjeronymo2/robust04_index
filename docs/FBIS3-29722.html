			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Chin-sok] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 19 February that the U.S.  Government, accepting the ROK Government's request to reconsider  the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK, decided to  tentatively withhold the deployment.    In a meeting with U.S. President Clinton on 18 February, ROK  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu revealed the ROK Government's hope  that the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK be  reconsidered in view of changes in the situation on the Korean  peninsula, and President Clinton expressed his will to respect  the position and opinion of the ROK Government.    A high-ranking official in Washington said that "the U.S.  Government's decision to tentatively withhold the deployment of  Patriot missiles to the ROK was made considering the changes in  security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean  acceptance of nuclear inspection, and of the ROK Government's  position calling on the United States to take into account  forthcoming North-South dialogue and U.S.-North Korea relations."    It has been learned that Gary Luck, commander of the U.S.  Forces in the ROK, recently sent an additional request to the  U.S. Defense Department that it tentatively withhold the plan to  deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK.    Commander Luck had requested earlier the Defense Department  mobilization and deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK  considering the state of security affairs on the Korean  peninsula, and the U.S. Government approved his request. Based  on this, the United States has been reviewing various issues,  including the timing of the deployment.    It was also learned that Luck, commander of the U.S. Forces  in the ROK, received from Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the ROK Joint  Chiefs of Staff, a message from the ROK Government on its  position that the timing of the deployment of Patriot missiles  to the ROK is not appropriate and that the plan for the  deployment should be reconsidered.</p>

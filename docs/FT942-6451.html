			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Tuesday: With the dollar still weak, attention will focus on this week's spate of US industrial and monetary data. Figures published today are expected to show a slight drop in personal consumption in April, but little change in consumer confidence in May. Wednesday: In the UK, the purchasing managers' index is likely to provide further evidence of recovery. Last month, it rose to its highest level ever. Another strong figure would suggest the pick-up in manufacturing continued into May. Thursday: Speculation about French interest rates will be raised when the Bank of France holds its council meeting. Although the Bundesbank's failure to cut rates last week suggests that the French authorities will also sit tight, some analysts believe a small monetary easing, of around 10 basis points, is possible. Friday: A flood of US data will shed further light on the strength of the US recovery. The May non-farm payroll is expected to show a small rise, with a larger rise in the manufacturing pay roll. But home completion and car sales figures are expected to remain flat.</p>

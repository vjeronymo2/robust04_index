			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Legal wrangle over Europa deal Legal proceedings are being used to stall the proposed three-way merger between Europa Minerals and two Australian groups with which it is already associated - Burmine and Austmin Gold - Samuel Montagu, Burmine's adviser, claimed yesterday. The claim came after Burmine was successful in discharging an injunction obtained by Mount Edon Gold, another Australian company, restraining Burmine from despatching its offers for Europa and Austmin. Burmine also succeeded in having Mount Edon's action entered on the Western Australia Supreme Court's 'expedited' list, which should ensure the action will be heard soon. Mount Edon obtained the injunction by claiming that the proposed Pounds 15m offer by Burmine for Europa would be in breach of Australian Corporations Law and incapable of being implemented in its present form. Samuel Montagu said the legal proceedings were being used by Mount Edon 'to promote its own, unsuccessful takeover offer for Burmine'.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANT HANDS NORTH HOLLYWOOD 2ND LOSS  </P> <P> Images linger from Wednesday's Grant-North Hollywood high battle of the  neighborhood rivals:  </P> <P> Grant point guard JoJo Halberstadt, leaping about at midcourt, gleefully waving  his arms after having fired a bullet-like pass to teammate Rene de la Hoya, who  scored the game's final -- and winning -- basket with five seconds left.  </P> <P> The Grant student section, simultaneously erupting in a frenzy.  </P> <P> North Hollywood forward Harry Marks, after a stellar performance, burying his  head in a towel -- and not surfacing for some time.  </P> <P> On last-second heroics, Grant prevailed, 48-46, in this marquee game of the  Valley Pac-8 Conference season.  </P> <P> North Hollywood (15-2, 3-1 in conference play) had suffered its lone loss to  Grant in a December tournament game. In an understatement, then, the Huskies  had looked forward to the rematch.  </P> <P> Grant Coach Howard Levine, though, knew that his team could beat the Huskies  again if the Lances just neutralized the Huskies' do-everything center, Dana  Jones.  </P> <P> The Lancers (14-3, 4-0), therefore, stuck to a 2-3 zone that gave new meaning  to the term clogging the paint. Any time North Hollywood even considered  passing the ball down low to Jones, five Grant players, principally led by  center Brunell Mori, collapsed into the key.  </P> <P> Mori and the defense stifled Jones to the extent that he attempted just four  field goals. He scored only six points.  </P> <P> "That was the plan," a smiling Levine said after the game.  </P> <P> With Jones ineffective, the contest turned into a battle between the game's two  most intense players -- Grant guard Keith Weinstein and North Hollywood's  Marks. The two traded clutch baskets throughout the game.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 37-37, and 6:03 remaining, Weinstein launched -- and was  fouled on -- an NBA-distance three-point shot that hit all net. The free throw  made it 41-37. Marks -- who finished with a team-high 20 points -- retaliated  with a three-point shot of his own and then, after a steal of the inbounds  pass, hit a 10-foot jump shot to swing the lead back in North Hollywood's  favor, 42-41.  </P> <P> There was more. With 28 seconds remaining and North Hollywood leading, 44-43,  Weinstein -- who finished with a game-high 25 points and five three-point  baskets -- picked up a loose ball on defense and broke away for a layup. Again  he was fouled and he converted the free throw to give Grant a 46-44 lead.  </P> <P> Marks, however, would not roll over. Fouled with 17 seconds left, he nailed  both free throws to tie the score, 46-46.  </P> <P> But that set the stage for Halberstadt's 10th -- and most vital -- assist. De  La Hoya's layup finished the scoring and finished the Huskies.  </P></p>

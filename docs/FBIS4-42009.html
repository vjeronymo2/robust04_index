			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Gypylov: "We Shall Grow Through Siberia </F> if We Raise It Up, `Siberian Accord' Members Believe"]    [Text] Irkutsk -- Saturday and Sunday were working days on  Lake Baykal for the members of the "Siberian Accord" regional  association. The leaders of 19 components of the Russian  Federation -- from the Urals to the Transbaykal -- met at the  lake to coordinate the activity of republics, krays, and oblasts  on socioeconomic problems. State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin,  Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, and Federal Assembly upper chamber  chairman Vladimir Shumeyko took part in the latest session.    The principles of regional policy, charges for electricity  and rail transport, measures to overcome adverse phenomena on  the labor market were the range of questions discussed. Without  going into details I shall note the main thing: The Siberians  have a reasoned and persistent desire to play a leading role in  the country's state development. No one likes the role of  pawns. Their only "diversion and delusion of youth" was that a  year ago they spoke of their own Siberian republic.    And until the October rebellion everyone repeated that  Russia  would be saved by the regions. Irkutsk Governor Yuriy Nozhikov  believes that "these phrases were current while the authorities  sought allies in the provinces but when they no longer needed  allies they could not see the role of the regions...." "But now  they have developed a unified position so that the attitude  toward the regions is not seen as the attitude of the  metropolitan state toward a colony?" the reporters asked the  "fathers" from "Siberian accord." The latter replied "perhaps,"  "it must be supposed...." Now there are real constitutional  powers but.... They cannot sense any unity. The components are  waging a quiet but very noticeable permanent struggle. Both  among themselves and with Moscow.    Perhaps this does not apply only to Irkutsk Oblast and  Krasnoyarsk Kray. They have much in common in their economies  and raw material resources and they are linked by the same  Angara-Yenisey waterway.... Of course, they also defend their  own interests -- and win. Here they recalled how some time ago  by an edict of the president instructed that the local very  powerful hydroelectric power stations -- the Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk,  Ust-Khantayskaya, Kureyskaya, and others -- be transferred to  the ownership of the "Unified Power Grid of Russia" Russian  state joint-stock company which has been created. Their  turbines generate an enormous quantity of energy, which is the  cheapest in the country. This is the most profitable item of  the local budget. If a joint-stock company were formed they  would have to buy their own electricity, but at high prices.  That is why there was powerful resistance from the regions. It  was settled by the Constitutional Court in favor of the two  components. The victory on this principled dispute was a lesson  to others. We must talk with the regions in a civilized  language, observing mutual interests.    The Baykal meeting showed that the activity of the "Siberian  Accord" is nonetheless characterized by a further attraction  toward the integration of the regions and toward the improvement  of people's economic standard and consequently their living  standard. Incidentally, it was noted that life expectancy here  is five to 10 years less than in the central part of the country  and that Siberian health today is a myth.    In elaborating the new concept of economic collaboration all  factors of the reform were considered. They are reflected in  the documents which were adopted. A new regional ideology is  taking shape, albeit slowly -- the further decentralization of  power and, as they said here, their "decolonization."    Indeed, Russia will grow through Siberia if Siberia itself  acquires the right it needs to independent economic initiative.    All participants in the meeting liked the great lake, its  deep water, and wide, free expanses. The guests tasted the  famous Baykal fish, the omul. And their courteous hosts -- the  leaders of the Irkutsk and Chita Oblast administrations and the  Buryatia Government -- reminded the country's eminent officials  that the "law on Baykal" has been languishing in their files for  a long time now. Two years ago they prepared this document but  were unable to achieve its adoption in the former parliament,  and the State Duma is still only studying the draft.</p>

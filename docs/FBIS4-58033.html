			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, United Nations, 29 Apr (INA) -- Yesterday,  after presenting a report to the Security Council about his  mission in Baghdad, Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Security  Council Special Commission, said that "Iraq is cooperating with  the Special Commission. We are working together to shorten the  trial period of the monitoring regime." Ekeus also said that he  is very optimistic.    Ekeus added that the Security Council member states would  like to have a monthly follow-up on the monitoring regime.  Ekeus said: I have told them that the Committee has positive  developments to report in all fields.    Ekeus noted that work on the monitoring regime in the  missile  and the chemical fields will be finished in May and in the  biological field in June.    INA has learned that the PRC envoy has asked that the  Security Council acknowledge the very positive developments in  Iraq's implementation of UN resolutions. He suggested that the  Security Council adopt a partial lifting of the blockade.    The Russian envoy also spoke about the need to give Iraq a  chance for more cooperation. The British envoy acknowledged  that progress had been made and that Ekeus' report to the  Security Council was encouraging.</p>

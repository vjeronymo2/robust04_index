			<p>BFN     [Text] The chief commander of the Russian Baltic military  fleet has said that the Lithuanian Defense Ministry was supplied  with Russian armaments in accordance with an inter-governmental  agreement, denying a number of allegations surrounding the  transaction.    Admiral Vladimir Yegorov in his Wednesday interview to the  Baltic News Service refuted accusations that Russia has supplied  low- quality arms to Lithuania. A scandal broke out in  Lithuania in March after searches were carried out in the flats  of a number of former Defence Ministry officials and one man was  arrested on charges of illegal actions when buying the armaments.    The Russian military official expressed his regret that  these  developments hampered Lithuanian-Russian relations. Admiral  Yegorov also said, commenting on Russia's transit over Lithuania  territory, that transit was vital to the Russian troops  stationed in the Kaliningrad enclave.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPILLS OF RAW SEWAGE ONTO COUNTY BEACHES  </P> <P> A short time ago raw sewage spilled into the beach at Newport. Last month raw  sewage spilled into Aliso Beach in Laguna. Shall we wait until there is an  epidemic of cholera, dysentery and several other death-causing diseases before  the city or county declares a moratorium on building and until the adequate  filter beds and larger sewer lines are built and installed to accommodate the  ever-increasing amount of sewage from new construction in Orange County?  </P> <P> JAMES L.

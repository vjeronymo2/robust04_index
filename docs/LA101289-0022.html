			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> In an effort to eliminate traffic backups during stadium events, two  lane-control signs with illuminated arrows will be installed on Friars Road  near San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium by January, a city official said.  </P> <P> The signs will direct motorists heading east and west on Friars Road into the  stadium's west entrance or to continue straight. When the parking lot is full,  all lanes will be designated as through lanes.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the signs is to give motorists time to make a lane change  before the stadium entrance. They are located far enough back so cars can  change lanes before getting stuck in traffic in front of the stadium," said  John Mills, project director for the city's engineering and development  department.  </P> <P> Once the $220,000 signs are installed, police directing traffic at stadium  events will no longer have to manually flip signs in front of the stadium. It  will take about four months to complete the custom-made signs, Mills said.  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not so much funny as wrong Sir, I was disappointed by last week's Observer ('We like sheep', March 3) which labelled IT people as 'only glorified electricians' and further likened them to cleaners and tea ladies. While your special brand of sardonic wit is usually quite well received, even on this side of the Atlantic, in this case the humour escapes me. Aside from the smug and elitist slap at people who roll their sleeves up at work, the point is that you are dead wrong. The leading securities and investments companies would no doubt agree there is no function more critical for their continued success than IT as an integral part of the company's overall business strategy. Firms that ignore this do so at their peril, and risk going out of business like many before. Perhaps it is such antiquated attitudes that helped lead to the Taurus debacle. I submit your loyal readers do not find having flushed some Dollars 600m down the tubes over the past decade very funny.

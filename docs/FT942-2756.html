			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chloride returns to the black Chloride Group, which is transforming itself from a batteries business into an electronics group, returned to the black for the year ended March 31, but profits were not high enough to restore the dividend. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.21m on total turnover of Pounds 101.4m, compared with a Pounds 1.58m loss last time on sales of Pounds 100.2m. After tax and the preference dividend losses per share were reduced from 2p to 0.5p. Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chief executive, described the results as a 'significant improvement'. The profit was struck after a loss of Pounds 1.7m on the disposal of battery businesses in Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Malawi. Operating profits on continuing operations were Pounds 2.8m on turnover of Pounds 89.5m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 86m. Operating profits, including discontinued operations, were Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 869,000). The electronics division made a profit of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 2.26m loss) on sales of Pounds 78m (Pounds 74m). The division - comprising uninterruptible power supplies for computers, emergency lighting, and power conversion - was the key to the group's future, Mr Hodgkinson said. The uninterrupted power supply business performed particularly well, helped by last year's purchase of Ondyne, a European manufacturer specialising in the office products sector. Mr Hodgkinson said the world office uninterrupted power supply market was growing at more than 10 per cent a year. The group was satisfied with its progress in electronics, but saw plenty of room for improvement in both sales and margins. The continuing battery businesses, comprising a subsidiary company in Egypt and associated companies in Nigeria and South Africa, made profits of Pounds 1.03m on sales of Pounds 11.5m, slightly below the previous Pounds 1.25m on Pounds 12.1m. The group is continuing to seek buyers for these businesses. Mr Hodgkinson said the group wanted to return to the dividend list as soon as possible, but had to be sure that payments could be sustained. The group ended the year ungeared, with almost Pounds 1m net cash. This left it in a strong position to make acquisitions to complement its electronics side, said Mr Hodgkinson.</p>

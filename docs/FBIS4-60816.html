			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, at the Russian Foreign Ministry Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis held a news conference. A certain  amount of tension exists in relations between Russia and Latvia,  and it is connected first and foremost with the situation of the  Russian-speaking population in this Baltic Republic, and also  with the presence of Russian servicemen there. It seems that  these issues were at the focus of attention of those taking part  in the news conference. However, let us listen to Ulmanis  himself. Trusting the assembled journalists' promises not to  criticize him for his incorrect use of Russian, the president  summed up the results of his visit:    [Begin Ulmanis recording] We came here with the firm  intention of expressing our attitude to those issues that are  presently hampering the existence of normal, good-neighborly  and, I would say, friendly relations between our two neighboring  countries. The issues in question are the withdrawal of troops,  the elimination of the Skrunda radar station, and matters  relating to economic relations. I must straightaway acknowledge  that I met with full mutual understanding on President Yeltsin's  part. As a result, one treaty, three agreements, and one  protocol have been signed.    The documents boil down essentially to the total and  unconditional withdrawal of Russia's troops before 31 August  1994. In the course of talks with the defense minister it was  stated that the troops might be withdrawn considerably earlier.  A treaty was signed on the status of the Skrunda radar station.  It will have the status of a military establishment under  civilian control, and cannot have the status of a military base.  An agreement was also signed on social guarantees for all the  people affected by this process. In the main, this concerns the  military pensioners and their future destiny. We view this  package of documents as a unified whole and as a regrettable  necessity, with which history has presented us. It is viewed as  a unified package of documents, which pursues the single goal of  normalizing relations between the two states.    Two things recently have been very important for us: We have  received from the Russian side information on the numbers of  military pensioners. As president, I need always to know this  figure by heart. There are 22,320 of these people, and the  social guarantees apply to them. Secondly, we are together with  the Russian side creating a repatriation fund, which will help  in a civilized way those people so wishing to leave Latvia.    I am left deeply impressed by all that has happened today,  since history has never before known a day when the national  anthem of a free Latvia has been played in a free Russia. I  should very much like this day to have broken the ice of  distrust and the hostility -- we shall not hide it -- which has  existed both in Russia and in Latvia, because our task and our  results will only be positively achieved when the population of  Latvia and the population of Russia begin thinking in the way  that we now desire.

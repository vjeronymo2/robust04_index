			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Observer: Chatting up The men in charge of repairing the reputations of two much-maligned public figures were working overtime yesterday. First on the phone was Colin Byrne, the Labour party's former chief press officer now in the Prince of Wales' employ. Had Observer noticed that Donald Keough, president of Coca-Cola, was among the corporate chieftains backing the Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum? Indeed, it says something for the POW's growing international pulling power if his forum can recruit top executives like Keough and Volkswagen chairman Carl Hahn to pontificate on corporate social responsibility in the latest edition of First magazine. In the past the Prince's choice of business leaders seems to have been driven more by people who want to know him, rather than people he should get to know. Observer's second call of the day was from an aide to Amstrad's Alan Sugar pointing out that his boss had just opened the Pounds 800,000 Sugar wing of an old people's home in Essex. Well done Alan, but in terms of corporate good deeds, it falls well short of Gerald Ronson's generally unpublicised largesse.</p>

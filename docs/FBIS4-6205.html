			<p>BFN     [Text] [Iraqi] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf,  President Saddam Husayn's envoy to Indonesian President Suharto,  met in Jakarta today with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas. Al- Sahhaf briefed his Indonesian counterpart on the  status of the relations between Iraq and the United Nations  regarding the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions,  especially Resolution 687. He stressed that a clear majority  has emerged at the UN Security Council calling for dealing with  Iraq in light of the implementation of the resolutions. This is  in order to set a clear timetable for closing the file of Part C  of Resolution 687, which would mean that the UN Security Council  should immediately start implementation of Paragraph 22 of the  resolution, allowing Iraq to export its products abroad.    The foreign minister also briefed the Indonesian side on the  recent National Assembly speaker's statement on Iraq's readiness  to receive a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation.    Ali Alatas expressed understanding of Iraq's position. The  two sides discussed bilateral cooperation and coordination  within the Nonaligned Movement. They also discussed ways of  bolstering bilateral relations in the interest of both countries.

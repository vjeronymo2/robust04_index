			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Books: Scrolls that put flesh on history THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS UNCOVERED by Robert Eisenman and Michael Wise Element (Shaftesbury, Dorset) Pounds 14.94, 286 pages THE FIRST scrolls the Bedouin found in the desert caves above the Dead Sea at Qumran, on the West Bank, appeared 45 years ago during the troubled time of the birth of Israel. In the 1950s more were found, and the Bedouin still seek them. From the start, it was obvious that these fragmentary religious texts would give an alternative, contemporary picture of life and thought at the time of Jesus, and of how Christianity grew from its start in Bethlehem 1,992 years ago. Quick publication of such finds was essential. Did it happen? No. It is still not done. The scholars have bickered about their 'rights to publish' and the region's politics have not helped. Outsiders have no chance of understanding the long-running disputes, nor of deciding whether Robert Eisenman and Michael Wise were scholarly bounders when they rushed to publish a large number of unknown texts in this book. But, for the public, these new scrolls are welcome. Their value is that they echo many attitudes in the Gospels and confirm that Jesus was truly part of his time, when the Romans were hated imperialists and Palestine abounded with sectarian leaders all claiming unique divine authority - so like the Middle East today. Some scrolls identify true prophets and smear the false ones. Several fragments interpret the Old Testament, partly to answer the vital question of which OT books were sacred. A precis of Genesis selects Noah, Abraham, Gomorrah, and Reuben's insult to his father by sleeping with his concubine; stories of Jews at the Persian court parallel Daniel's adventures with those capricious kings. The dying leader's farewell message, 'Do not put the man with a covetous eye in charge of Riches,' sounds like an OT proverb. 'In the Meekness of Righteousness, bring forth your words' could be the Sermon on the Mount. Making sacrifices in the Temple for the Gentile Romans was wicked and - as in the Christian concept of the pure life - violence, fornication and lying were out. But would Jesus have had time for the attitude that, on the Sabbath, you should not pull an animal out of the mud but could throw a person a garment and haul him out? The texts about the Messiah and the New Jerusalem are astonishingly close to the Gospels. 'The Lord will visit the Pious and the Righteous will He call by name,' they say. 'He shall release the captives, make the blind see . . . heal the sick, resurrect the dead.' And who is the Messiah, 'the Leader of the Community?' He is 'the Branch of David, a staff from the root of Jesse.' And his fate? 'Put to death' at the orders of the high priest and the 'Kittim' (Romans). This was not Christianity, but it was very close to it. The Dead Sea Scrolls are just fragments, but they add depth to the picture of Palestine at the time. The ideology of the Qumran community, like that of the first Christians, had firm roots in the traditions of Judaism.</p>

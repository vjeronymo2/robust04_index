			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Calluna coming to USM with Pounds 35m price ticket Calluna, which designs and manufacturers miniature hard disk drives, yesterday announced it would raise Pounds 10.3m in a placing on the Unlisted Securities Market which will value the Scottish company at Pounds 35m. Nearly 17m new shares are to be issued at 65p each, representing 32 per cent of the enlarged share base. Following the placing, the management's stake will fall from 39 to 28 per cent, with the remainder being taken up by a variety of old and new institutional investors. Mr Norman White, managing director, said that neither the management nor current investors in the three-year-old company would be taking any money out. 'All the proceeds from the placing will be put back into the company in order to fund our planned expansion,' he said. The company's prospectus issued yesterday contained two pages of 'risk factors' - highlighting the unpredictable nature of the computer component market with regard to intellectual property rights, developing new products and competition. Calluna incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.69m for the 12 months to March 31 1994, compared with a Pounds 1.37m deficit for the 18 months to March 1993. The company made its first sales last year amounting to Pounds 301,000. Mr White said that he expected the company to make an operating profit by the middle of next year. The company manufactures high capacity 1.8 inch removable disk drives which can be inserted into slots conforming to the PCMCIA industry standard in the latest generation of personal computers. The drives enable users to increase their storage capacity, move data and remove different sized amounts of data from PCs for security reasons. Calluna developed a revolutionary 1.8 inch hard disk drive, capable of storing more than 80 megabytes of data. It also makes 130MB and 170MB drives and will soon announce a 260MB product, all under the Callunacard name. It points out that a recent industry report forecasts the number of worldwide shipments of 1.8 inch hard disk drives will rise from 694,000 this year to 20.6m in 1998. Dealings in the shares start on October 31.</p>

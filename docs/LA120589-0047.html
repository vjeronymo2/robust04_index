			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIN CAN'T RESIST: BOARD AGREES TO NEW MCCAW BID;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS: DIRECTORS VOTE TO SELL CONTROL FOR $3.4 BILLION AFTER RIVAL  SUITOR BELLSOUTH FAILS TO RAISE ITS OFFER.  </P> <P> After nearly six months of struggling, directors of Lin Broadcasting on Monday  abruptly voted to sell a controlling stake to McCaw Cellular Communications for  $3.4 billion.  </P> <P> The vote, coming after McCaw again raised its offering price, drew McCaw closer  to victory in a high stakes battle for control of some of the most lucrative  cellular telephone properties in the world.  </P> <P> In light of rival BellSouth Corp.'s failure to make a counteroffer to McCaw's  bid of $154.11 a share (up from last month's $150-a-share offer), Lin's board  suddenly dropped its resistance. The purchase of the 21.9 million shares,  together with the 5.1 million Lin shares it already owns, would give McCaw  majority control.  </P> <P> Lin's board "was compelled to do what they did. It doesn't mean that they  suddenly prefer a merger with McCaw to BellSouth," said Frederick Moran,  president of Moran &amp; Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., investment concern  that controls shares in both Lin and McCaw.  </P> <P> In Atlanta, BellSouth, which had stepped in as the white knight to save New  York-based Lin from the Kirkland, Wash., upstart, said it was studying McCaw's  new offer and would have no immediate comment. But many analysts said they did  not expect BellSouth to raise its offer.  </P> <P> "I think if they wanted to continue to play this game, they would have made  their wishes known by now," said Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst  with Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood of Minneapolis. He and others in the industry  cited BellSouth's conservative management's reluctance to take on a high amount  of debt and dilute the company's earnings.  </P> <P> The battle for Lin began in June with McCaw's hostile $120-a-share bid for all  of Lin and seesawed as Lin's board adopted a course of determined resistance.  McCaw lowered its bid to $110 a share after Lin lost a court bid to compel  Metromedia Inc., its partner in New York and Philadelphia franchises, to sell  out to Lin.  </P> <P> Lin finally turned to BellSouth, proposing that BellSouth and Lin merge their  cellular telephone operations to form the nation's largest company that would  absolutely control the valuable big city markets. McCaw, currently the nation's  largest independent cellular telephone operator, pursued Lin vigorously for  precisely that reason -- it lacks a significant presence in the urban markets  that are expected to grow the fastest.  </P> <P> As BellSouth showed a determination to go further with Lin, McCaw opted to  dramatically increase its offer to $125 a share -- but for a majority stake for  which it could finance instead of the whole.  </P> <P> After raising the offer again without a response from Lin's board, McCaw  threatened to try to oust Lin's board, and the battle became a war between  accountants over arcane accounting interpretations that would make each side's  proposal look best.  </P> <P> The tide turned late Friday when McCaw submitted a new offer. Lin said it  discussed the revisions with McCaw over the weekend and convened a board  meeting Monday to review the offer and any other proposal.  </P> <P> While BellSouth Corp. was invited to submit a proposal to revise its merger  plan, "BellSouth has not done so at this time," Lin said in a statement. Lin  said it asked BellSouth to withdraw its merger agreement so that it can enter  into a binding agreement with McCaw. If BellSouth doesn't withdraw, Lin could  terminate the agreement if its stockholders on Jan. 12 do not approve the  BellSouth proposal.  </P> <P> "Throughout this long process our goal has been to maximize stockholder value,"  said Lin President and Chief Executive Donald A. Pels. "The board's action in  recommending the revised McCaw offer is in accordance with that goal."  </P> <P> The McCaw offer was superior to the BellSouth proposal at $150 a share, Moran  said. "Today's further improvement was even better," he explained, forcing the  Lin board to accept it or face the wrath of shareholders.  </P> <P> In addition to raising the cash price, McCaw said it would transfer to Lin its  nearly 5% interest in a Los Angeles Cellular Telephone. Lin currently owns 35%  of the franchise and BellSouth holds 65%, meaning that McCaw would become  partners with its rival in the important Los Angeles market if the new  transaction is approved.  </P> <P> Under the new proposal McCaw would still cause Lin to buy $425 million of McCaw  stock and distribute it to Lin holders as a dividend. McCaw also said it agreed  to amendments to the part of the proposal where it would guarantee to buy  remaining Lin shares at a certain value including limiting purchases to 75% of  shares outstanding instead of 81%.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Russian government 'likely to fall' THE Russian government is likely to fall in the next few months,possibly next month, according to a senior Russian parliamentarian accompanying President Boris Yeltsin on his trip to the US. Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the parliament's foreign relations committee, told a private audience at Harvard University that 'the possibility of the government falling is quite realistic'. He was speaking off the record, but later let his speech be reported. Mr Lukin said Mr Yeltsin would be able to dissociate himself from the government in spite of being its head - he is also prime minister. Mr Lukin added: 'The most important thing is for the president to survive. Where the government has a popularity rating of only 10 per cent, Mr Yeltsin has a rating of around 40 per cent'. He warned of possible serious social disturbances in February and March, when food held in people's refrigerators ran out. The next government, he said, would be composed of people 'with their feet on the ground, practical people'. They would re-establish price controls on a much wider range of goods than at present, and would give more prominence to rapid privatisation. 'The important thing is to be able to change the personalities while keeping up reform'. Aides travelling with Mr Lukin said the Russian parliament would be likely to pass legislation to deprive Mr Yeltsin of the right to appoint ministers by decree. Parliament would demand the right of joint control of ministerial appointments. Mr Lukin, whose memorandum to Mr Yeltsin, advising him to take a tough line towards Ukraine, was leaked last week to the Russian press, called in his speech for a 'slowdown' in the disintegration of the former USSR in order to allow the military forces to be properly divided among Russia and Ukraine. Mr Lukin, in his memorandum, called for the Black Sea Fleet to be transfered to Russian jurisdiction. If Ukraine objected, Russia should threaten to reopen the question of control of the Crimea, where the fleet has bases. The Russian parliament is discussing the legality of the transfer, in the 1950s, of the area from Russian to Ukrainian rule.</p>

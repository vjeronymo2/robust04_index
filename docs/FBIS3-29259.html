			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 16  February carry articles speculating on the purpose and  background of the purported visit to Pyongyang by Representative  Ronald V. Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 16 February carries on page  3  a 1,200-word article by New York-based correspondent Kim  Sung-yong entitled "To Play a Messenger's Role To Ascertain `the  North's Intent' First-Hand." The article notes that Dellums'  visit is made with 21 February, the supposed deadline for North  Korea to accept IAEA inspections, only a few days away, and  adds: "Many hold expectations that he will play the role of  messenger to make a first-hand ascertainment of the North Korean  leadership and to precisely convey the U.S. position, though his  visit may not directly offer a key to resolving the issue." The  article then notes: "There is a possibility that North Korea  may try to use Dellums' visit as a propaganda opportunity to  stress its rationale for its present position."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 16 February carries on page 3 a  1,300-word article by New York-based correspondent Kim Su-chong  entitled "Why Is the Chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services  Committee Visiting Pyongyang?." The article notes optimistic  expectations held by some that "Chairman Dellums' visit to  Pyongyang could contribute to the resolution of the North Korean  nuclear issue." The article then notes: "The United States  could send a letter from President Clinton to Kim Il-song or  explain the atmosphere of the U.S. Government and Congress to  the North Korean ruler." The article then observes that  "Dellums likes to utter the theme `peace is my passion,' and  Pyongyang might have interpreted it to represent a personal  trait, making it easier for him to generously appreciate  Pyongyang's position, according to one analysis."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 16 February carries on  page  3 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim  Hak-sun entitled "Why Is the Chairman of the U.S. House Armed  Services Committee Visiting Pyongyang?--The `Final Mediator' for  the North Korean Nuclear Issue--`In-Depth Dialogue' May Be  Possible as a Dove." The article begins by noting the  significance of Chairman Dellums' visit to Pyongyang in light of  the possibility that he is carrying a personal letter from  President Clinton and in light of his position in Congress and  his capacity to precisely convey the U.S. position to the North  Korean authorities. The article then notes, "The fact that he  is one of the most moderate doves in the U.S. Congress might  give North Korea credibility." The article then notes: "It is  not certain whom Chairman Dellums will meet when he goes to  Pyongyang, but because he will probably be carrying a letter  from President Clinton, he may well be meeting President Kim  Il-song. President Kim Il-song will probably make extra efforts  to heartily welcome him, according to Washington's North Korean  experts."</p>

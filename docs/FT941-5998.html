			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chief quits French financial group Mr Jean-Louis Petriat, one of France's most prominent businessmen, yesterday resigned as chairman and chief executive of Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires (GMF), the ailing financial services group. The departure of Mr Petriat, 59, marks the latest instalment in the troubled recent history of GMF, a powerful force in the French insurance market, but one which has faced heavy losses from an unsuccessful property venture in the Netherlands Antilles, and from its travel insurance business. The losses from these ventures forced GMF into capital-raising moves designed to stabilise finances. Last year, it had to put up for sale its controlling interest in FNAC, the largest chain of music and book stores in France. The FNAC sale, however, was clouded by controversy when the French stock market authorities mounted an official investigation into a bid from Altus Finance and Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, after complaints from minority shareholders. Altus and Phenix were eventually forced to raise the value of their offer. Mr Petriat, a flamboyant figure known for his penchant for bow-ties, has been chairman of GMF since 1987. He has come under the spotlight in recent years as the chief opponent of the Sunday trading campaign mounted by Virgin, the UK-based retail group and FNAC's strongest competitor in France.</p>

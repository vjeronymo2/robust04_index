			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SOONER THE BETTER;  </P> <P> OKLAHOMA TURNING ON THE CHARM FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES  </P> <P> Southern California is not alone in its appreciation of what high housing  prices, increasing congestion and high taxes can mean for the economic  environment.  </P> <P> While various states and even foreign nations have found fertile ground in  California for recruiting businesses that seek to move to less expensive  locales, Oklahoma has become the first state to open a full-time economic  development office in this region. Gov. Henry L. Bellmon even showed up in  Orange County this week to make the pitch.  </P> <P> That's pretty ironic when you remember that in the 1930s, Depression-era  frustration drove thousands of migrant workers to Southern California from the  Dust Bowl and provided inspiration for John Steinbeck. Today, far different  economic conditions are prompting the opportunistic Sooners to entice  businesses their way.  </P> <P> The pot of gold in Oklahoma's rainbow is cheaper housing, lower corporate and  personal income tax rates and less traffic. One Newport Beach oil services firm  has already moved.  </P> <P> There's a lesson here for Southern California, which has prospered as a  promised land for generations -- from Oklahoma and elsewhere. Today the work  that needs doing is not just to create new jobs but to make the area livable  and affordable.  </P> <P> Los Angeles and Orange counties both had annual rates of growth in new  employment of less than 2% last year. But Orange County, which enjoyed growth  in the 6%-to-8% range during the late 1980s, has no economic development  program. And while the city of Los Angeles has such a program, many people  still can't get their share of the good life. UCLA professor James Johnson says  that many discouraged black residents simply move away.  </P> <P> Census figures do show people are still flocking to Southern California despite  our problems. But the area also needs some comprehensive strategies. Otherwise,  more California businesses may start whistling Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes.  </P></p>

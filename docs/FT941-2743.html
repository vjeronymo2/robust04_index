			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Other big moves USM-quoted Learmonth and Burchett Management Systems plunged 44 to 96p after announcing that difficult trading conditions meant group results for the year to April were likely to fall 'well short' of market forecasts. Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott dropped 55 to 184p on its second profits warning in six months. It said it was unlikely to make more than Pounds 3m in the year to April and would therefore cut the total dividend to 5.3p a share from 8.3p last time. Regional newspaper group Midland Independent saw its shares make a sparkling debut as they opened at a 25p premium to their flotation price of 140p. They continued to rise throughout the day and closed at 172p with nearly 24m traded, the heaviest turnover on the London stock market. New issue Israel Fund, a closed end investment trust concentrating on Israeli companies, made a successful start with a hefty turnover of 13m. The shares that traded with a warrant attached to every five rose from 82.4 to 86 cents. Other statistics, Page 31</p>

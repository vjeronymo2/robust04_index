			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Regina loss cut to Pounds 224,000 Regina, the USM-traded Royal Jelly products company, slipped back into the red in the second six months and for the full year to August 31 ran up a loss of Pounds 224,000 at the pre-tax level. That was a marked improvement on the previous year's deficit of Pounds 1.23m and was scored from turnover marginally higher at Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.91m). Losses per share were cut from 0.91p to 0.18p. In the opening half year sales were ahead of budget, primarily because of stocking up by the new UK and Singapore distributors. Profits for the period amounted to Pounds 143,000. However, Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, chairman and chief executive, said it was not possible to sustain the sales increase in the second six months. Looking ahead, he said the Japanese market showed 'great growth potential'.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / People: Philosopher Scholar for the Welsh Office The new permanent secretary at the Welsh Office is to be a Treasury philosopher. Michael Scholar, who will take over when Sir Richard Lloyd Jones retires at the end of July, is currently deputy secretary at the Treasury in charge of civil service management and pay. But he started his working life as a philosophy teacher at Leicester University - his special interests were Wittgenstein and Aristotle. Since joining the civil service in 1969, Scholar, 51, has taken several front-line positions. He was private secretary to Joel (now Lord) Barnett when he was chief secretary to the Treasury in the run-up to the arrival of the IMF in 1976. He was also private secretary to Margaret Thatcher from 1981-83, through the depths of the economic recession and the Falklands war. Between 1979 and 1981, he was seconded to Barclays Bank International. Unusually for a Treasury man, Scholar is noted for his sense of humour and his lateral thinking. He is also an accomplished musician, playing the piano and organ; an Associate of the Royal College of Organists, he is a noted accompanist. Promotion to the Welsh Office takes him home - although brought up in London, Scholar was born in Merthyr Tydfil.</p>

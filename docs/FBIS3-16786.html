Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation  Defense Minister, Tours Kaliningrad Oblast"]    [Text] Pavel Grachev arrived in Kaliningrad on the  afternoon of 17 March and was "besieged" by journalists as soon  as he deplaned. Their interest was entirely understandable,  despite the planned nature of the defense minister's trip. The  naval force withdrawal from Poland and the Baltic countries, the  fact that Kaliningrad Oblast is an enclave, and, finally, the  concentration there of many Russian Federation Ground Force  units withdrawn from abroad all ultimately determine the  region's position from a specifically defense-based viewpoint.    Pavel Grachev described the aim of the trip as follows:    "First, it is necessary to look in detail at the state of  Ground Force and Baltic Fleet subunits. Second, we must listen  to the proposals from Admiral Yegorov, the fleet commander, and  from Lieutenant General Anatoliy Pimenov, commander of the 11th  Separate Combined-Arms Guards Army, for the rational deployment  of troops and the creation in Kaliningrad Oblast of a special  defensive region.    It needs to be stressed that work in this area has been  under  way previously. On the eve of the defense minister's visit to  Kaliningrad Oblast representatives of the General Staff were  already at work. On the eve of the defense minister's visit to  Kaliningrad Oblast representatives of the General Staff were  already at work. Army General Konstantin Kobets, chief military  inspector and deputy defense minister, and the commanders in  chief of the Russian Navy and Ground Forces have also been here  to work out their own proposals.    Such close attention to the problems of the ground and naval  forces deployed in Kaliningrad Oblast has given rise to various  suggestions, including some very unlikely ones. For instance,  certain analysts have proposed that Russia might give up the  Baltic Fleet for purely economic reasons.    But Pavel Grachev stated at the airfield: "I want to see the  fleet more combat capable than it is at present." He went on to  note that the naval forces would most probably be based in both  Leningrad and Kaliningrad Oblasts. And in the numbers necessary  to safeguard security and ensure the reliable defense of our  state. "The operational grouping that is being created here  should ensure the defense of the territory from military threats  not only from the sea, but from the land as well," Pavel Grachev  said.    This was also discussed during the Russian Federation  defense  minister's meeting with garrison officers. Army Gen. Grachev  also talked about the progress in reforming the Russian Armed  Forces, noting the weighty contribution made by Kaliningrad  Oblast to solving the problem of the drafting of young people to  the Russian Federation Armed Forces. The draft plan has been  more than 40 percent overfulfilled in this area. This is the  best indicator of any region.    The defense minister paid particular attention to the  condition of naval and Ground Forces units in Kaliningrad  Oblast. By dint of its position the oblast has a special place  within Russia. This makes increased demands on the system for  the command and control of naval forces and Ground Forces units.    On the whole, the defense minister said, the forces of the  Baltic Fleet and the 11th Army are carrying out the tasks they  have been set. But even higher results are expected during  these checks.    The defense minister briefed those present on what is  currently being done in the Russian Armed Forces and talked  about certain results of the start of the new training year.  Army Gen. Pavel Grachev stressed that main efforts have been  focused on the practical implementation of the plan for the  Armed Forces' organizational development, the creation of force  groupings -- above all, mobile force groupings -- the  enhancement of the command and control system, the search for a  fundamentally new approach toward Armed Forces utilization, and  the improvement of the organizational and personnel structure.  But the main task for the Russian Armed Forces in 1994 is to  maintain their combat readiness and combat capability at a level  that ensures that the state is defended under any circumstances,  and to carry out the tasks laid down by the main provisions of  Russia's military doctrine.    In the first two and a half months of 1994, the defense  minister said, the plans for troop and naval force training have  been carried out. Two command post training sessions have been  held at the strategic level and more than 10 at the  operational-tactical level. It is planned to hold another  training session before the end of the training year on the  command and control of Strategic Nuclear Forces, and the "South  '94" command post exercise. It is planned to hold the  "Northwest," "Baykal," and "Vostok" regional command post  exercises and the "West" operational rear services command post  exercise. This, in Army Gen. Grachev's words, will make it  possible to prevent any decline in the level of combat readiness.    The defense minister's order on the early promotion of a  number of the most outstanding Army and Navy officers was read  out at a meeting at the garrison Officers House and valuable  gifts were presented. A brigade of artistes under the  leadership of Iosif Kobzon gave a concert.    The same day Army Gen. Pavel Grachev heard reports from Adm.  Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet, and Lt. Gen. Pimenov,  commander of the 11th Army. That night the naval forces were  rallied upon the signal to assemble.    On Friday the defense minister visited the fleet's alternate  command post, attended a naval infantry brigade tactical  exercise, and met with the crew of the destroyer Nastoychivyy.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW GETS IN HOLIDAY MOOD, ADVANCES 22.07  </P> <P> The stock market broke the stalemate of the past several sessions with a rally  in quiet pre-holiday trading Thursday.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 22.07 to 2,751.80, finishing the  week with a net gain of 34.68 points.  </P> <P> That snapped a streak of six consecutive trading days in which the Dow  industrials neither rose nor fell by as much as 10 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 908 up, 573 down and 518 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume was 142.47 million shares, against 141.08 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in  those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled  173.70 million shares.  </P> <P> Analysts said traders came into the session with low expectations, given the  market's recent sluggish behavior and the approach of a long holiday weekend.  The markets will be closed for Good Friday.  </P> <P> In that kind of environment, observers said, an absence of selling pressure  helped produce some pleasant surprises in the price fluctuations of individual  stocks.  </P> <P> The government reported that retail sales dropped 0.6% in March, in contrast to  advance estimates of a small increase. That served as a new suggestion of  continued sluggish, erratic economic growth, along with possibly less upward  pressure on interest rates than has been feared of late.  </P> <P> Brokers also noted that favorable profit reports from several companies  contributed to the upbeat mood. For example, Chemical Banking, which posted  higher quarterly profits, gained 1 1/8 to 24 1/2. Most other money-center bank  issues moved up in sympathy.  </P> <P> Federal National Mortgage jumped 1 3/4 to 36 3/4 after reporting on Wednesday a  67% increase in its first-quarter profit.  </P> <P> Fannie Mae warrants, which give their owners the right to buy the stock at  $14.75 a share, rose 1 1/2 to 21 7/8.  </P> <P> Capital Cities/ABC jumped 15 1/4 to 541 1/2, apparently on optimism about  earnings. Elsewhere, Teledyne tumbled 3 1/4 to 67 7/8 after reporting that  earnings from continuing operations fell 7% in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Vons lost 1 1/4 to 21 1/4. But the drop appeared to be the result of a single  trade of a large block rather than broad selling, traders said.  </P> <P> Gainers among the blue chip industrials included GE, up 1 1/8 at 66; IBM, up  3/4 at 107 1/8; McDonald's, up 1/2 at 32 5/8; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1/2 at  71 1/4, and Coca-Cola, up 1/2 at 80 1/2.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei stock index closed at 29,623.20, up 182.92  points, or 0.62%. In Frankfurt, the DAX index jumped 24.40 points, or 1.3%, to  1,918.17, driven by foreign demand for shares, traders said.  </P> <P> In London, shares closed mixed with a firmer tone taking heart from gains on  Wall Street, but volume was light ahead of the Easter holiday. The Financial  Times 100-share index closed up 6.6 at 2,222.1.  </P></p>

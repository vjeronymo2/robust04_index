William Miron, police found Jesus Campos Bernal Jr., 19,  stabbed several times, at 1:25 a.m. Bernal was taken to a nearby hospital,  where he was in stable condition.  </P> <P> About 40 minutes after the stabbing, officers responded to calls of gang  activity in the 600 block of Chatsworth Street and the 800 block of Mott  Street. Vehicles seen in those areas matched descriptions of those seen fleeing  the stabbing.  </P> <P> Police stopped one vehicle and Favazzo pursued a second to a cul-de-sac on  Rincon Avenue. As Favazzo approached the vehicle, the driver attempted to run  him down. Favazzo fired at the vehicle, which sped away. Police later found two  loaded shotguns in the cul-de-sac. No one was arrested in the first car.  </P> <P> Police were searching for the occupants of the second car Sunday, but did not  release descriptions of them.  </P> <P> Miron said the shooting will be investigated by Favazzo's supervisor.  </P></p>

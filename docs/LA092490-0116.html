CRIME  </P> <P> Maverick GOP gubernatorial candidate Pierre Rinfret today called for armed  vigilantes to battle crime in New York City.  </P> <P> "What I really want is a vigilante system with people carrying guns, unknown to  anybody, so anybody who comes along and mugs somebody may have, standing next  to him, a man who's been authorized," Rinfret said.  </P> <P> Aides later said the Manhattan-based economist envisioned a volunteer corps of  up to 100,000 police-trained vigilantes.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Gov.

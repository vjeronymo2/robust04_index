			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Auditing rules to be tightened ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will be forbidden from auditing the accounts of companies for which they have valued brands, pension funds, property and other assets under draft ethical rules released yesterday by their professional bodies. The action was widely welcomed in submissions from accountancy firms and other bodies received in advance of the guidelines, which were issued by the chartered accountants joint ethics committee. The committee represents the three Institutes of Chartered Accountants - in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland. The guidelines state that a firm should not audit any valuation of a significant size performed by the same firm or an associated practice where the valuation would be incorporated into the accounts as either the firm's or the directors' valuation. Among firms likely to be affected is Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which conducted brand valuation for companies includ-ing Mirror Group Newspapers while acting as auditors. Another draft guideline issued yesterday states that firms should refuse to give a second opinion on contentious accounting issues to a company audited by another firm, unless they are in full possession of the information on the subject held by the auditor. The guidelines follow identification by the ethics committee of a number of instances of 'opinion shopping', by which companies have undermined the authority of their auditors by going elsewhere for a more sympathetic ruling from another accountancy firm not familiar with the issues involved. Both sets of guidelines will now go before the councils of the three institutes, and if accepted they should come into force by late December. The ethics committee also yesterday launched a discussion paper on 'predatory pricing' by which firms under competitive pressure offer to conduct audit work at substantially discounted rates. The practice has raised doubts about the quality of auditing provided. It has drawn up three possible options, ranging from leaving pricing decisions to the free market to forbidding firms from bidding at below the direct labour costs of the professionals employed on the contract.

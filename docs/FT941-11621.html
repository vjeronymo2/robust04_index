			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shows decline to Pounds 1.23m in first quarter Pre-tax profits at Huntingdon International Holdings, the life sciences and engineering services group, fell by 67 per cent from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 1.23m in the three months to December 31 1993. The fall, which had been flagged in a warning last month, reflected a sharp drop in profits at the company's US engineering and environmental services business. For the year to last September there was a 39 per cent drop in profits to Pounds 8.79m. Turnover, net of subcontract costs, was 5 per cent lower at Pounds 38.1m (Pounds 40.1m). US turnover (50 per cent of the total) fell by 12 per cent in dollar terms as demand for environmental services fell well below the company's expectations. Operating profits in the US were also affected by a large increase in contingency provisions and fell from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 370,000. The Life Sciences group in the UK saw turnover fall from Pounds 9.86m to Pounds 9.56m and operating profits decline to Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 2.14m) as a result of delays in project start-ups and the effects of a staff flu epidemic on volumes. Mr Bernie Wooley, chief executive, said that despite the setback the company intended to maintain its capital investment programme and remained confident in the long-term operating potential. Earnings per share fell from 2.9p to 1p. The shares were unchanged at 114p.</p>

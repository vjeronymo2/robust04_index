			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNGIPHILE STALKS WILD MUSHROOM FOR FUN, PROFIT -- AND GOOD TASTE  </P> <P> Mohamad Ismail is frankly fond of fungi. The 35-year-old Playa del Rey man  collects them for fun and profit.  </P> <P> Ismail, who owns Pacific Exotic Mushrooms in Van Nuys, is one of a handful of  Southern Californians who supply local restaurants and produce companies with  wild mushrooms. The demand, he said, is considerable. "Every major Westside  restaurant that has a menu item over $10 wants chanterelles, morels or porcini  mushrooms."  </P> <P> Ismail, who has been gathering commercially since 1982, has sold to La Toque,  Spago, Michael's and other well-known restaurants in Los Angeles and Santa  Barbara. He also dries and sells wild mushrooms under his own label.  </P> <P> A fungiphile before he was a myco-merchant, Ismail first hunted local mushrooms  for the sheer pleasure of finding something scrumptious growing in the wild. He  started out during his undergraduate days at UCLA, gathering chanterelles,  yellow mushrooms that smell like apricots and thrive in the local mountains  during wet winter months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Amazing Variety  </P> <P> "My goal at that point was to go out and find something to eat once or twice a  week," Ismail said. He recalls leafing through the hefty Audubon Field Guide to  North American Mushrooms and thinking, "My God, there can't be this many  mushrooms." Since then, he has verified the existence of hundreds of species.  </P> <P> Most fungi thrive on moisture, Ismail said, and Southern California is usually  too dry to be prime mushroom territory. "We don't have that many good years,"  he said, "and we haven't had a good year since 1984-85."  </P> <P> Wild mushrooms are also seasonal. The morels, as sure a harbinger of spring as  income taxes, have already disappeared from the San Bernardino Mountains and  the Sierra Nevada. But Ismail recently harvested 50 pounds of giant puffball  mushrooms in the San Bernardinos, leaving all but the choicest specimens  unpicked. "I left behind 100 pounds, easy. They were past their prime, and I  couldn't sell them." Slices of puffball, Ismail pointed out, are terrific on  pizza.  </P> <P> To keep his clients in wild mushrooms during the local off-season, Ismail  usually goes to the Pacific Northwest each year between August and October. In  Washington and Oregon, mushrooms thrive in the moist forests like, well,  mushrooms.  </P> <P> While in the Northwest, Ismail presents slide shows, training others to  identify commercially valuable mushrooms and giving pointers on how to find  them. Morels, for instance, flourish on ground that has been burned over.  </P> <P> As a result, Ismail said, "I know there are going to be hundreds of pickers  converging on Yellowstone." (People who gather mushrooms commercially almost  always need a permit to pick on public land. Non-pros should also check on the  conditions under which they can gather.)  </P> <P> Ismail earned a master's degree studying mycology -- the science of fungi -- at  the University of New Brunswick in Canada.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only in Wild  </P> <P> Unlike the white buttons in the supermarket, some of the most popular wild  mushrooms, including chanterelles, morels and porcini mushrooms, cannot be  cultivated, Ismail said. As a result, chanterelles may sell for as much as $18  a pound, morels for even more.  </P> <P> To stalk the wild mushroom, Ismail wears a simple uniform -- jeans, hiking  boots and "my mushroom shirt," a black sweat shirt with long sleeves to protect  his arms from brambles and nature's other scratchers and stingers.  </P> <P> He uses a hunting knife to harvest the mushrooms and carries his treasure home  in five-gallon plastic buckets. Ismail is not as proprietary about his choice  hunting grounds as some of his colleagues, who place sentries with  walkie-talkies around their secret places. But he does not hand out maps  either.  </P> <P> Ismail loves being in the wild on these expeditions. "Sometimes it's almost a  religious experience out there," he said. "Once you get hooked on mushrooms,  you can't get them out of your system." Mushrooms are extraordinary in their  variety, he noted. Some look like undersea corals, some like floor mats. Some  smell like pine, others like shrimp and maple syrup. They are every imaginable  color, including bright purple -- and some exude a blood-red liquid when  bruised. There are as many flavors as there are varieties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Losing Directions  </P> <P> Like other wilderness activities, mushroom hunting has its perils. "I never get  lost in the woods, but sometimes I get turned around," Ismail said. He once  became disoriented in an early snowfall while looking for American matsutake  mushrooms in the Siskiyou Mountains, near the California-Oregon border.  </P> <P> He wandered in the snow for an hour or two until the sun suddenly came out and  revealed the path below. "It took me two hours to get up that ridge. I was down  in 10 minutes," he said.  </P> <P> He has heard wild boar while mushroom hunting, but the only injury he has  suffered was a severe sting after he dropped his knife into a bee hive.  </P> <P> Ismail, who is vice president of the Los Angeles Mycological Society, says wild  mushrooms are far less dangerous than most people believe. Only a small  percentage are poisonous, he said, and those are readily identifiable.  </P> <P> "The difference between the deadly ones and the edible ones is the difference  between apples and oranges," he said. "I've eaten over 100 varieties of  mushrooms, and I've never been poisoned. I've never come close to being  poisoned."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caution on Gathering  </P> <P> However, no one should gather wild mushrooms until he or she learns to identify  them positively, he cautioned. And he recommends cooking all wild mushrooms  before eating them.  </P> <P> Gathering mushrooms, Ismail said, "isn't getting me rich but it's paying my  rent." He would like to expand the business, perhaps becoming a grower of  mushrooms as well as a forager. "Some varieties aren't being cultivated but  could be."  </P> <P> As a consumer, Ismail is hard-pressed to name his favorite among the wild  mushrooms. He likes matsutake, hedgehog, cauliflower, horn of plenty. . . . As  to his favorite recipe, it couldn't be simpler. "I'm a purist," he said. "I  like them sauteed in butter, with salt and pepper and a little garlic."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The XINHUA  News Agency Hong Kong Branch spokesman today made a statement on  the report on Sino-British relations issued by the British  Parliament Foreign Affairs Select Committee. The following is  the full text of the statement:    We have yet to see the full text of the "report." Judging  from the excerpts that have been revealed so far, we can see  that the report by the British Parliament Foreign Affairs Select  Committee has ignored the objective fact that Chris Patten's  political reform package violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings reached  between the Chinese and British governments, refused to adopt  the suggestions of some official British participants that the  British government resume cooperation on the basis of the  agreements between the two sides, deliberately confused the  truth, supported the British Government's policy of further  confrontation with China, boosted Chris Patten's "three  violations" political reform package, openly recommended that  Britain play the "international card" on the Hong Kong issue,  and openly advocate intervening in Taiwan and Tibet, which are  China's internal affairs. The "report" also made wanton and  unreasonable attacks on certain provisions in the Basic Law of  the PRC Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The report is  a negative example; it makes people see how veteran colonialists  racked their brains in exploiting every opportunity to continue  their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong. However, all  these efforts are futile. Nobody can change the Chinese  Government's determination to reclaim Hong Kong and restore  sovereignty over it as scheduled in 1997. The Chinese  Government has announced more than once: We will establish the  first government and legislature of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region in accordance with the relevant provisions  of the Basic Law and National People's Congress resolutions. No  decisions made unilaterally by Britain during the transition  period on key issues straddling 1997 will be recognized by China.</p>

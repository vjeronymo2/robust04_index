			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: World Stock Markets (America): Dow stronger on signs of economic recovery Wall Street FURTHER evidence of economic recovery helped US equities to post solid gains yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 25.94 higher at 3,359.12, making a two-day advance of 51 points. Trading was moderately active, with more than 223m shares changing hands on the big board. Advances outscored declines by 1,184 to 557. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved ahead 2.93 to 414.95 and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks climbed 8.74 to 578.68. Investors were encouraged by unchanged initial jobless claims for the week ended April 18. The market had expected a slight increase in the number. In addition, the Chicago area purchasing managers report provided further evidence of expansion in the manufacturing sector in April. General Re, the biggest US reinsurance group, was one of the weakest stocks of the day. It tumbled Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 81, below its previous 52-week low of Dollars 85, on reporting a fall in operating profits from Dollars 135.1m to Dollars 116.5m for the first quarter and warning that underwriting results were likely to be unsatisfactory for the balance of the year. The figures from General Re cast a pall over the whole insurance sector, with Travelers dipping Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 3/4 , Cigna Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 3/4 , Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 and American International Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 83. Disappointing first-quarter results from Chrysler depressed the shares. The stock edged Dollars  1/4 lower to Dollars 19 3/8 in active trading after Chrysler turned in a loss of 7 cents a share for the quarter, including a special gain of 75 cents. A year earlier, Chrysler had a loss of Dollars 2.66 that included special charges of Dollars 1.14. Trading was also active in Ford and General Motors, which respectively slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 and Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 1/2 . In the airline sector, UAL, parent of United Airlines, put on Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 124 1/2 in spite of a first-quarter loss of Dollars 3.86 a share by the parent company. A year earlier, UAL had a loss of Dollars 7.05 a share. Third-quarter earnings from Duracell, the battery manufacturer, helped the stock climb Dollars 2 to Dollars 26 7/8 . The company had profits of 4 cents a share, against a loss of 33 cents in the year-ago period. Strength in the technology sector helped the over-the-counter market outpace the big board. Apple Computer jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/8 , but Microsoft lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 110 1/4 after rising in morning trading. Seagate Technology rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 15 1/2 . Canada TORONTO ended little changed after moderate trading. The composite index was off just 1.5 at 3,355.6. Rises led falls by 309 to 221, however, after volume of 23.7m shares. Traders said it was too soon to tell if the Ontario budget, announced late yesterday, will have any effect on the market today, but anticipation of the budget has undoubtedly slowed the market this week. The golds group index was up 1.38 per cent and financial services down 0.69 per cent, with other leading groups showing little change. Air Canada set a total of 350 job cuts this year and did not rule out further job losses. It said its advanced bookings for May are ahead of last year. The stock was off CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 5 1/2 .</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Jamaica secures SDR109m credit The International Monetary Fund has given Jamaica access to credits of SDR109.1m (Dollars 153m) under an extended fund facility to be drawn down by December 1995, writes Canute James in Kingston. The Jamaican central bank said the money would support the government's medium term economic programme, and that the policies agreed with the IMF would be presented to parliament soon. Mr PJ Patterson, prime minister, said recently he expected the extended fund facility to be the last credit agreement Jamaica would have with the IMF. The island's depleted foreign reserves would have been rebuilt by 1995. Jamaica has had several IMF credit agreements since the mid-1970s, and owed the Fund Dollars 337m at the end of last month.</p>

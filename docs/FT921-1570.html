			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / View from Washington: Different strokes for similar folks IT WAS purely coiecidental that on March 11 President George Bush held a press conference only hours after the British general election was called. What was remarkable, given the subdued level of interest in British politics in this country, was that he was asked a question about it. That question was predictable, and could have been asked - indeed, might even have been invited - when Mrs Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan were in office. It was whether or not the president was concerned that the Labour party, saddled with - by implication - unsound foreign and defence policies, might win. Mr Bush responded artfully, praising Mr John Major as a solid partner in the western alliance but adding that the worst thing he could do was to be seen to intervene with a preference in any important foreign election. Some thought that his praise of Mr Major amounted to just that. Obviously, a conservative administration in Washington prefers a conservative government in London. As vice-president and president, Mr Bush has dealt with the Thatcher and Major governments for more than 11 years. There is no reason to doubt that his personal relationship with Mr Major is close and warm. However, the president was also diplomatic enough to welcome Mr Neil Kinnock to the White House in 1990 and to say that if the Labour leader became prime minister, he would welcome the opportunity to do business with him. Mr John Newhouse, a staff writer with New Yorker magazine, says: 'Major is fuzzily regarded as a good thing while Kinnock did not make a very good impression.' But he adds: 'I don't think Kinnock's the sort who would frighten our children.' He also notes that 'we are both having (elections) at the same time, which is unusual' - the last time there were general elections in the same year was 1964 - 'and they do make us inward-looking'. Comparisons between the two incumbents are commonplace. Both succeeded distinctive leaders, both head parties well into the second decade of executive power, both have oppositions moving towards the centre, and both preside over weak economies. Both have also had to endure much sniping from the right wings of their respective parties. However, the probability is that the US economy will 'come right' for Mr Bush later this year in a way that it cannot for Mr Major before April 9. Both leaders - in the British Budget and in Mr Bush's war with Congress over a reflationary package - claim that they have turned their economies around, with the principal platform of not increasing taxes. If the Tories lose, it might be seen as a harbinger for Mr Bush and the Republicans. But the political differences between the two countries are so great as to make such conclusions very speculative. The British embassy reports that it spends most of the time devoted to the UK election explaining these differences, but concedes that it has not been inundated with requests for clarification. However, honesty also requires reporting that nothing in the British campaign has attracted America's attention as much as the end of the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of York. That is a real story.</p>

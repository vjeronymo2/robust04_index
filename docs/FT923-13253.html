			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (8): Beating the cardsharps - Plastic fraud cost the UK industry Pounds 165m in 1991 ASK ANY UK banker what the main issues in the payments cards industry are and he is certain to list fraud among them. Last year fraud on payment cards cost the banking industry Pounds 165m, up from Pounds 122m the previous year. Though the UK has a mature payment card market, its experience is fairly typical. Criminals across the world are waking up to the fact that stealing money with a plastic card is easier and less dangerous than trying to rob a bank by more traditional method. They have also discovered that because the payment card market is a global one, it is especially vulnerable to fraud. Counterfeiters in Hong Kong can manufacture phoney British credit cards for use in third countries where retailers will have difficulty spotting them. Visa debit cards stolen from handbags or wallets in London can be smuggled across the Channel in a few hours to be used in retail outlets before they get on to hot card lists. Two sorts of payment card are especially vulnerable. One is the gold card which has long attracted counterfeiters and collusive retailers. Until recently it was possible for fraudsters to use the gold cards of some banks to draw down quite large amounts of cash on the spot with no questions asked. The other especially risky category is debit cards. A fraudster can siphon money directly out of a current account with a series of small purchases deliberately pitched below retailers' floor limits. Because the money is coming directly out of his or her current account, the distress to the card holder is likely to be greater than it is on credit card fraud. Still, card fraud has to be seen in perspective. The loss of 0.2 per cent of sales on card fraud is still tiny whencompared to other losses by the banks or even to the 2 or 3 per cent of their turnover which retailers find goes on 'shrinkage' - a euphemism for theft and breakages. Since the banks carry the risk of any losses on fraud, naturally they see things differently from the retailers. 'We have set up sophisticated authorisations procedures which are expensive to run. It is the retailers who benefit, very considerably, from this service. Is it not reasonable to request that they contribute to the benefits they receive?' asks Mr Tim Green, chief manager of Switch card services. Two years ago, the banks set up the Plastic Fraud Prevention Forum, chaired by Barclays. One of its main activities is to try and encourage consumers and retailers to be on their guard. Card issuers now also accept that more transactions will have to be carried out on-line - ie, with the terminal linked by a telephone call to a central computer. In the US, 85 per cent of card transactions are on-line. In Britain, telecommunications costs are much higher, but the banks are now hopeful that they may soon be able to negotiate a deal with British Telecom. Early this month, Barclays announced an agreement with BT allowing retailers using its PDQ electronic terminals to make free authorisation calls from September. Barclays will absorb the cost of the calls, at present around 5p each. Two years ago, Barclays Merchant Services, handled less than half of its transactions electronically. Today, the figure is 78 per cent. Checking that funds are available and that the card has not been registered as missing or stolen is one side of the battle against fraud. The other is to ensure that the person using the card is actually the one named on the card. Last winter, Mr Kenneth Baker, the then Home Secretary, held several meetings with the main UK credit card issuers to see how the fraud problem could be tackled. The talks centred mainly on the problem of identifying cardholders. Mr Baker and senior police officers believe that card fraud is closely linked with drug smuggling and that sophisticated gangs of thieves channel the revenue from card fraud to finance drug-dealing operations. The Home Office particularly favoured the use of photographs on cards, prompting suggestions that in effect it was trying to get the banks to introduce identity cards through the back door. Mr Baker persuaded the banks to pledge Pounds 500m on fighting card fraud over the next three years but he failed to convince them of the virtues of putting photographs on credit cards. Though two banks, TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland, are now running trials with photocards (and seem to have found them popular with their customers) most bankers believe there is an inherent flaw in putting photographs on cards. 'Photocards means that retailer staff at the point of sale have to make a decision whether or not to go ahead and accept a card. We think it is much better if the procedures automatically make it clear whether or not a card can be accepted,' says Mr Jim Parsons at APACS. As a result British banks are now looking at other ways of establishing that a card is being used by its rightful owner. Their dilemma is that many of the methods which can be used to make cards more secure may be more expensive to introduce than the fraud which would otherwise take place. The two front-runners are PIN numbers at the point of sale and dynamic signature verification, storing information on the card about the way a cardholder signs his or her name. But there are other possibilities ranging from fingerprinting to scanning the cardholder's retina with a laser beam. This method has been used in military establishments for years apparently without problems, but banks seem to think that it will not go down well with the general public. The advantage of dynamic signature verification is that it is not intrusive and makes little difference for the customer to what happens at the point of sale. But it has several snags. One is that it probably implies a shift from magnetic stripe to smart cards to store the information on micro-chip and a new generation of terminals to read the chips. Another is that signature verification technology has not yet reached the point where it always gets things right. Trials suggest that a few bona fide card-holders would get rejected, while some talented forgers would get through. So the banks could well decide to go for PINs, at point of sale. Some retailers in Europe already use PINs, apparently without problems. Consumers may not love PINs, but if they reduce the losses on card fraud, they will be the ultimate beneficiaries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today the Senate passed the final form of Article 2  of the Draft Bill on the Regulation of the Juridical Status of  Certain Dwellings Which Became the Property of State by  Nationalization. After debates that lasted many hours and after  six amendments proposed by the opposition representatives and by  the special Senate panel had been rejected, eventually they  passed, by ballot, the amendment proposed by Senator Ion Culcea  of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]. In concordance  with the text proposed by the senator, Article 2 was adopted in  the following wording:    The persons mentioned by Article 1, that is, the former  owners or their heirs, are to benefit from restitution in nature  in the form of regaining their right to property over the  apartments they currently live in as tenants, while for all  other apartments they are to be paid damages under the terms of  Article 12 of this bill.    Article 2 was passed by only 60 votes in favor, 15 against,  and 4 abstentions; that is, the total number of votes was just  79. This happened because before the article was submitted to  ballot, the representatives of the opposition, with the  exception of the Democratic Party senators, walked out of the  hall.    Immediately following this, Senator Alexandru Popoviciof  PL-93 [Liberal Party '93] explained their gesture by pointing  out that the opposition cannot associate itself to theft and  that it decided to definitely withdraw from the discussions on  the aforementioned draft bill.    According to our correspondent, Dan Preda, immediately after  the opposition senators walked out Omnia Hall [Senate  headquarters] they met with representatives of the press. Here  is the declaration that was adopted in the end of that meeting  and which was sent to us via fax by our correspondent:    Considering the fact that today the parliamentary majority  in  Senate adopted in principle merely the paying of limited damages  for the nationalized dwellings or other dwellings that after 6  March 1945 went into state property under any other form --  expropriated, confiscated, or taken by abuse;    -- considering that this solution actually represents a  second and final nationalization;    -- considering that this solution violates Romania's  Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights;    -- considering that the ruling coalition has rejected all  the  amendments suggested by the opposition, including the ones  adopted by the [Senate] Commission for Public Administration and  the Organization of the Territory, as well as other variants to  those amendments;    -- considering that the ruling majority has not accepted the  proposals of the opposition regarding the social protection of  the tenants;    -- not wishing to be coauthor of such legislative abuse, the  signatory parties of the present declaration withdraw for good  from the discussions and vote-taking on the draft Bill on the  Regulation of the Juridical Status of Certain Dwellings Which  Became the Property of State by Nationalization.    The declaration is hand-signed by representatives of the  PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party], the UDMR  [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania], the PAC [Civic  Alliance Party], the PL-93, and the PNL-CD [National Liberal  Party-Democratic Convention].</p>

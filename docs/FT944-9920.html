			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / National Theatre may make a loss The National Theatre warned yesterday that it might make a loss this year after reporting a surplus of Pounds 539,000 on a turnover of Pounds 28.3m in 1993-94. The Royal Shakespeare Company, the UK's other leading publicly funded theatre company, reported a surplus of almost Pounds 1.4m last year on a Pounds 27.4m turnover. The hot summer and the failure of some new productions, notably Johnny on the Spot, hit box office income at the National Theatre, with seat occupancy down on the 77 per cent achieved in 1993-94. It is returning its popular success, The Wind in the Willows, to the repertoire in the next few weeks which should help to keep any deficit below Pounds 500,000. The National Theatre has been successful in controlling costs in recent years, and has accumulated a reserve of Pounds 927,000. In contrast, the RSC still has a deficit - of just over Pounds 1m - but for the third successive year it has managed to cut it. Both companies are suffering from the freeze in government subsidy, which accounts for just over 40 per cent of their incomes. The National Theatre received Pounds 12m from the Arts Council in 1993-94, but, like the RSC, has been allocated a standstill grant in 1994-95, equivalent to a 2.5 per cent loss in income. The RSC received Pounds 8.47m from the council, but is also supported by the Corporation of London.</p>

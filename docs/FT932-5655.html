			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: New Straits Times group up slightly NEW Straits Times Press, Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing group, has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 47.97m (USDollars 18.6m) for the six months to February 1993. The result is a 3.7 per cent improvement on last year. Group turnover rose 9.5 per cent to MDollars 188m, while net earnings per share improved to 18.4 cents from 17.6 cents previously. NSTP directors said they expected year-end results to be broadly in line with those of last year. In the year to August, 1992, NSTP earned pre-tax profits of MDollars 96m, compared with MDollars 82m the year before. Until a management buy-out early this year NSTP was part of the Renong group, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates with close connections to the ruling United Malays National Organisation. Renong sold its controlling stake in NSTP, along with a 43 per cent stake in TV3, the country's only privately-owned TV station, for MDollars 800m. SIA Engineering, the aircraft engineering subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, is likely to be one of a number of regional aerospace companies investing in a Dollars 63m maintenance centre in China. Aviation sources say SIA is negotiating to take a 15 per cent stake in the new aerospace facility, to be built near the coastal city of Xiamen. The prime mover behind the China project is the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering (Haeco). Others said to be involved are Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong carrier, Japan Airlines, and local Chinese interests. Haeco's move to China is prompted by space restrictions in Hong Kong and lower Chinese wage rates. In recent years, several aerospace centres in Asia have been opened in response to the sharp increase in regional aircraft traffic. The International Air Transport Association forecasts that airline passenger numbers will double in the Asia Pacific region over the next six years.</p>

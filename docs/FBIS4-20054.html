			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Nation's Accounts: 1993, the </F> Black Year"]    [Text] In 1993, France experienced the strongest recession  since World War II with a fall in its GDP of 1 percent, which is  even worse than economic analysts had forecast, according to the  annual figures published yesterday by INSEE [National Institute  of Statistics and Economic Studies].    You have to go back to 1975, the year following the first  oil  crisis, to find the previous recession in the French economy  (minus 0.9 percent). France has only been in recession twice  since World War II.    In February, the INSEE was still expecting a 0.7-percent  drop  in GDP for 1993. The gap between this and the figure of 1  percent published on Friday [22 April] can be explained by the  fact that the recession was stronger than expected at the end of  1992, which meant that 1993 started with a bigger deficit.  Moreover, 1993 seems to be the lowest point of a cycle which  began back in mid-1990. However, this figure of 1 percent is  merely an annual average: The recession ended in the spring [of  1993] and GDP has not fallen any further since then.    The crisis did not spare any sphere of activity last year.  The fall was particularly sharp in manufacturing production,  which dropped by 5.3 percent in volume. In the BTP [public  buildings and works sector], the fall was 3.9 percent in volume,  and service activities fell by 1.6 percent excluding the health  sector.    Employment has paid a heavy price for the crisis. Following  a net loss of 188,000 jobs in 1992, another 255,000 jobs were  lost in 1993. Unemployment affected 11.6 percent of the working  population on an annual average, in other words 2.9 million  people. Employment reacted rather late to the resumption of  activity in spring, the INSEE points out, and the deterioration  in the job market only started to slow down in the summer.  Since then, we have observed an increase in temporary and  limited contracts.    Other major victims of the recession are government budgets,  whose deficits increased despite contributions decided in the  first months of the Balladur government. The financing  requirements of public administration departments increased  further, reaching 5.8 percent of GDP (412 billion francs [Fr]),  compared with 3.9 percent in 1992 and 2.2 percent in 1991. At  the same time, however, state levies on national wealth have  increased from 43.6 percent in 1992 to 44 percent in 1993.    The increase in the CSG [general social contribution] and in  property taxes burdened the income (after tax) of the French  people. The growth in their income slowed down markedly, going  from a 4.7-percent increase in 1992 to a 3-percent increase in  1993, in other words, an increase in real purchasing power of  only 0.6 percent taking inflation into account (2.1 percent and  falling). In the course of 1993, households began to dip into  their savings to maintain a certain level of consumption.    But, despite this change in behavior, consumption only  increased by 0.4 percent in volume, the lowest increase recorded  for 30 years. In the years of strong growth, consumption  increased at a rate of 3 percent per year. Last year, the fall  was particularly noticeable in the automobile sector, the  clothing sector, and tobacco. Businesses reduced their stocks  on a huge scale. Finally, exports fell by 0.4 percent in volume  (while imports fell by 3.1 percent).    Contrary to the devastating effect it had on the state's  coffers, the crisis has not emptied those of business. The  reduction in investments and erosion of stocks have "helped to  considerably improve the overall financial situation of  businesses," INSEE stresses. Thus, for the second year, they  have an overall financing capability. The banks have also come  out well thanks to the good performance of their market  activities, boosted by the intense activity of the foreign  exchange markets and the high interest rates. In addition, the  banks distributed less credit and were thus able to continue to  improve their margins. Thanks to the improvement in their  financial situation, the banks were easily able to cover the  risks linked in particular to the property market and industry's  problems.    In all, France has the money, even if the imbalances in its  distribution have increased. According to the INSEE, the  country's financing capacity amounted to Fr77 billion last year.</p>

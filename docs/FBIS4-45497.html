He made this request  at a news conference held after delivering his closing speech at  the 24th OAS General Assembly in this, the capital city of Para  State. Amorim noted that because funding for drug enforcement  operations is very limited in Brazil, it is very important for  our country to receive financial cooperation from countries  where drugs are consumed.    Amorim said: Drug producing countries are receiving  resources to implement alternative crops. Yet countries that  are being used as drug routes have not received the same kind of  support.

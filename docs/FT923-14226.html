			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Typewriter rivals in phantom factory feud THE trade bill debated by the House of Representatives yesterday includes a controversial clause which would make it more difficult for foreign companies to circumvent anti-dumping duties. The bill's supporters, mostly Democrats, want to close a loophole in the 1988 trade law allowing foreign companies to avoid anti-dumping duties by setting up 'phantom' factories in the US. These assembly operations import all their parts from third countries which are not covered by the anti-dumping order. The bill would give the US Commerce Department added authority to judge whether a company is evading anti-dumping duties by considering 'actual and potential' threats to US industries. This change in the law primarily stems from a trade feud between Smith Corona and Brother Industries of Japan. Smith Corona accuses Brother of evading a dumping duty by assembling typewriters at its Tennessee plant with parts imported from Singapore and Malaysia. Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, says Brother set up the low-wage, low-skill assembly plant expressly to circumvent the 60 per cent duty. Brother admits it swallows losses to keep market share (a tacit admission of dumping, argues Smith Corona). Mr Patrick O'Leary, the company's lawyer, counter-attacks with the charge that Brother loses money because Smith Corona dumped the US market with personal electric typewriters made in Singapore. The Japanese company filed its own anti-dumping case against Smith Corona. However, the Commerce Department last year ruled Brother had no standing because it did not qualify as as American manufacturer protected by the law; the case is now in court.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Mobile phone contracts won in Hungary US WEST, the US regional telecommunications company, has strengthened its leading position in eastern Europe's thriving mobile communications business by winning one of two concessions awarded yesterday by Hungary to run digital cordless services. The second of the fiercely contested licences was awarded unexpectedly to Pannon GSM, a consortium of national operators from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. US West has recently won tenders to develop digital mobile networks in 10 Russian cities and to help operate analogue networks in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Its existing joint venture with the Hungarian Telecommunications Company (HTC), the state-owned national operator, providing an analogue mobile telecommunications service in Hungary, already has 33,000 subscribers after just three years of operation. Pannon GSM squeezed out the DBFH Consortium, a powerful coalition of Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, British Telecom and France Telecom, for the second licence. It originally topped the bidding with an offer of Dollars 48m, against Dollars 46m by the US West consortium. But Pannon GSM, previously third-placed with a submission of Dollars 45m, is understood to have raised its bid at the last minute to Dollars 50m. Senior German, British and French diplomats intervened vainly yesterday with the Hungarian prime minister's office on behalf of DBFH, which later threatened 'further steps'. Competition between the three leading contenders was fierce because there is tremendous suppressed demand for telephones in eastern Europe and the mobile communications market has shrugged off regionwide recession. Hungary is the most developed market for cellular services and the first east European country to grant licences for digital systems using the pan-European GSM standard. The Hungarian authorities' desire to promote competition in telecommunications may have contributed to DBFH's defeat. Bids are due in October for a stake of more than 30 per cent in HTC. Deutsche Telekom, as well as being leader of the DBFH consortium, will be a prime contender.</p>

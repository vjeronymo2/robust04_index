			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / US adminstration wants to sell F-15 fighters The US administration has told Congress that it wants to sell F-15 fighters built by McDonnell Douglas to Saudi Arabia, writes George Graham. The 72 F-15s, worth an estimated Dollars 5bn, are understood to feature on a classified list of possible arms sales the administration is obliged to give Congress each year. McDonnell Douglas has argued vigorously for the sales, contending that if the US refuses to allow Saudi Arabia to buy F-15s, it will instead turn to European-built Tornadoes and possibly also join the European Fighter Aircraft development programme.</p>

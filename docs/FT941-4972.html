			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Dartford bridge likely to pay for itself by 2001 The Dartford bridge, the first project to be completed under the government's initiative for private funding of transport links, is expected to pay for itself by the year 2001, seven years ahead of schedule. More than 37m vehicles used the crossing last year, generating income from tolls of Pounds 41m, the Department of Transport said yesterday. The bridge, which carries the M25 motorway across the Thames east of London, was completed a little over two years ago for Pounds 86m. Mr Robert Key, transport minister, said the success of the Dartford crossing, officially called the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, showed the value of the government's private-finance initiative. However, other attempts to bring private finance into infrastructure projects have been blamed for delays in getting work under way. The Dartford bridge was built and financed by a consortium consisting of Trafalgar House, the construction company, merchant bank Kleinwort Benson, Bank of America and the Prudential insurance company. They were awarded a concession to collect tolls for up to 20 years. Once the consortium breaks even on the bridge, ownership will transfer to the government, which may then levy tolls for one year. If it wants to continue tolls for longer it must seek parliamentary approval, although the transport department hopes to introduce tolls on the entire motorway network from 1998. The British Road Federation said the bridge had ended congestion on the river crossing but it owed much of its success to a lack of alternative bridges or tunnels east of London. The Automobile Association said motorists would be surprised the tolls had been set at a level allowing such prompt repayment of the bridge's debts. It called for the tolls to be dropped when the bridge reverted to public ownership.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Philip Stephens and John Willman: "Tories Dealt </F> Fresh Blow in Euro-Poll"]    [Text] Mr John Major's government suffered another  humiliating electoral blow early this morning as the first  results of the European elections suggested the Conservatives'  representation in the Strasbourg parliament would be at least  halved.    The Labour party registered strong gains in its target seats  in the Midlands and southern England. But the divided  opposition to the Conservatives in the south appeared to have  saved the government from the electoral "melt-down" predicted in  some opinion polls.    The protest vote against Mr Major's administration left  Labour celebrating early victories in the symbolically important  seat of Essex South, which embraces the Westminster constituency  of Basildon, and in most of its top target seats. Mr Jack  Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said that the  results had re-established, the party as the only real  challenger to the Conservatives across the country.    Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats won their first ever  seat in the Strasbourg assembly, but the early signs were that  their share of the vote had fallen substantially since last  month's local elections.    On the basis of BBC projections after 22 results, the  Conservatives would have 29 per cent of the vote, Labour 43 per  cent and the Liberal Democrats only 15 per cent. Labour,  confident of winning more than two-thirds of the 84 British  seats in the Strasbourg assembly, claimed that the election  outcome marked the beginning of the end of the Conservatives'  15-year grip on power at Westminster.    Despite the Liberal Democrats win, the surge in support for  the party earlier this year was checked in the European poll by  the strong rise in the Labour vote in southern England. That in  turn allowed the Conservatives to retain control of some of its  vulnerable seats. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat  leader, acknowledged the shift with the comment that "Labour has  saved the Tories."    Among the clutch of other early results the Conservatives  held on to Wight and Hampshire South, one of the Liberal  Democrats target seats. But it lost Somerset to the Liberal  Democrats and Northants and Blaby, Norfolk and Leicester to  Labour.    Earlier, even before the votes were counted, sharp divisions  in the Conservative party over Europe and Mr Major's leadership  re-emerged as the government braced itself for the anticipated  defeat.    Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, signalled the start of a  concerted cabinet operation to shore up Mr Major's premiership.  Mr Hurd, who defended Mr Major's strategy in the European  campaign, said it would be "absolutely crazy" for the  Conservatives to think about changing leader for the second time  in four years. He told BBC Radio: "We have someone whom I  believe to be an excellent prime minister."    That view was echoed by Sir Norman Fowler, the party  chairman, and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, as  the cabinet prepared for a backlash from disgruntled MPs when  they return to Westminster tomorrow after the Whitsun recess.    Characterising the European elections as the low point in  the  government's fortunes, Sir Norman held out the prospect that  strengthening economic recovery would pave the way for tax cuts  well before the general election due by mid-1997.    But hopes that the party's warring factions would maintain  the fragile truce which held during the European campaign were  shattered by outspoken criticism of Mr Major from both the right  and left.    From the right the prime minister faced calls for a radical  reshaping of the government's domestic policies combined with a  toughening of the sceptical approach to Europe which featured in  the campaign.    But pro-Europeans, in a warning that Mr Major would depend  crucially on their support if he was challenged for the  leadership, said he must stop "appeasing" the Tory Euro-sceptics.</p>

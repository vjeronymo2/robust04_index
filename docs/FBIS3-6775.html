			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear listeners. Soldiers from the SLORC [State Law  and Order Restoration Council] defense services have the habit  of forcefully abducting villagers from Shwekyin Township, Pegu  Division with various reasons, and sometimes none. Some of  those abducted died in prison, while others have been jailed for  prolonged periods without any charges. Ko Soe Min will present  the news as reported by Ko Hnin Wai, a Democratic Voice of Burma  [DVB] journalist from the Manerplaw Bureau.    Dear listeners: On 11 April 1992, Lieutenant Chit Swe Myint  and group, a SLORC military column, from Regiment 57, forcefully  arrested U Shar Maung, 57, from Mingalar Village for  collaborating with insurgents. U Shar Maung was jailed in the  Shwepyinyein camp in Shwekyin Township and then transferred to  the jail in Pegu. Although his wife, Daw Daung, had to pay a  bribe of 20,000 kyat for the release of her husband, U Shar  Maung died in the Pegu jail on 11 October 1993 because of  injuries he received during his arrest and lack of food while in  jail.    On 5 November 1992, Company Commander Lt. Myint Zaw and  group  from Regiment 349 came and arrested (Tatlulu), 26, son of U  (Toeyoto) in (Mar Gauk) village -- a red faction Pa-O village --  in Shwekyin Township. During the arrest, the soldiers also  destroyed the (?curry pots) which were meant to be sold to  woodcutters. (Tatlulu) was jailed in Shwekyin, where he died on  18 October 1993.    On 1 May 1992, woodcutter U Po Pein, 52, from Myetnu  Village,  Shwekyin Township, was wrongfully arrested by Deputy Regimental  Commander Major Hla Nyunt and group from Regiment 350 and he is  detained in Shwekyin jail till now. Similarly, on 1 May 1992,  while U Kyaw Myint, 27, from Shansu village, Shwekyin Township,  was on his way to cut firewood, Company Commander Lt. Thein Win  and group from Regiment 350 tied him up and took him away,  accusing him of being a hardcore insurgent. U Kyaw Myint is  still in the Shwekyin jail today. On that same day, U (Khawtaw  Ne Oo), 22, from the same village, was taken into custody by a  group led by Sergeant Sann Myint from Regiment 350, and he is  believed to be in the Shwekyin jail. Similarly, Ko Kyaw Shwe,  27, from the village of Shansu, was arrested by Company  Commander Lt. Thein Win and group from Regiment 350. Villagers  U Po Pein, U Kyaw Myint, and (Khawtaw Ne Oo) are still in the  Shwekyin jail.    Furthermore, on 1 May 1992, U Saw Thi, 41, (Ko Khin Maung  Aye), 21, Saw Tharsehmu, 32, and (Kawethe), 28, all villagers  from Mahawthabin, Shwekyin Township, were abducted by Company  Commander Lt.

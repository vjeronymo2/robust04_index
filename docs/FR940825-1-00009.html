A means of egress comprises the vertical and horizontal ways of travel and shall include intervening room spaces, doorways, hallways, corridors, passageways, balconies, ramps, stairs, enclosures, lobbies, horizontal exit, courts, and yards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. ``Noncombustible Construction'' is construction in which the materials have been tested in accordance with ASTM E136 and conform to the criteria contained in Section 7 of that test method (e.g., gypsum wallboard).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. ``NRTL'' is a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. ``Opening Protectives'' are the parts of an opening in a fire barrier that ensure the integrity of the protected barrier.

In addition, structural members have fire resistance ratings not less than 221 or 200 (see NFPA 220, Table 3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40. ``Type IV Construction'' is that type in which exterior and interior walls and structural members that are portions of such walls are of approved noncombustible or limited-combustible materials. Other interior structural members, including columns, beams, arches, floors, and roofs, are of solid or laminated wood without concealed spaces and comply with the provisions of NFPA 220 section 3&hyph;4.2 through 3&hyph;4.6. In addition, structural members have fire resistance ratings not less than 2HH (see NFPA 220, Table 3 and section 3&hyph;4 for additional information on Type IV construction). Interior columns, arches, beams, girders, and trusses of approved materials other than wood are permitted by NFPA 220 section 3&hyph;4.1 provided they are protected to provide a fire resistance rating of not less than 1 hour. Certain concealed spaces are permitted by NFPA 220 section 3&hyph;4.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41. ``Vertical opening'' is an opening through a floor or roof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> c.

No flammable or explosive substances or equipment used for repairs or alterations shall be introduced or stored in an ATCT while the ATCT is in operation, unless safeguards are provided to prevent any additional danger (e.g., contractor-provided fire watches, use of only those amounts of flammable substances in the ATCT necessary for the immediate task at hand).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> e.

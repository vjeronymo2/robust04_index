			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Ankara today, Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet  Golhan rejected in principle the personal initiative of his  Czech counterpart Antonin Baudys for resolving the Bosnian  situation. During his talks with Antonin Baudys, Golhan stated  that the initiative did not reflect the present situation in  Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Turkish side opposed above all the  supposition that the conflict in this former Yugoslav republic  was religiously motivated. According to the Turkish minister of  defense, Ankara was aiming above all to preserve the territorial  integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state that had been  recognized by the United Nations and by the international  community. The Baudys initiative is, on the contrary, alleged  to envisage the split of the republic.</p>

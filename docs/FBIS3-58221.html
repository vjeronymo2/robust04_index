Mitterrand, in an exclusive interview with AFP on the eve of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit in Brussels, also  reiterated his opposition to a resumption of nuclear testing by  France and dismissed any possibility of his country rejoining  the alliance's integrated military command.    President Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of NATO's  integrated military command in 1966.    NATO's "first priority is to take into account Europe's  identity" in terms of defense, Mitterrand said.    "In the United States, the Clinton administration seems  willing to take into account this progressive ability by the  European Union."</p>

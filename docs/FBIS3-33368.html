			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 19 February, PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal  Party] leader Domingo Laino announced that if the serious social  problems are not solved the party will form an opposition front  that will tighten its stance and make concrete demands through  mobilizations. This announcement marks the end of the  Governability Pact between the opposition and national  government.    Laino said there is a time for everything, and the  opposition  has patiently waited long enough to see if the government would  improve things but unfortunately it continues to be partial,  represents a single party, has not allowed the opposition to  participate, and has not shown any political will to fight  corruption.    Laino also said the party would seek new paths other than  the  Governability Pact to speed up the country's democratization  because it believes the social situation in Paraguay is  unsustainable.    The former "authentic" presidential candidate said the  government has no political will to respond with due dignity and  respect to social demands and charged that corruption continues  to plague the state apparatus.    Laino added: "We believe that with only a 30 percent success  in the struggle against corruption we already would have enough  money to buy land and invest in the construction of hospitals  and schools, which is precisely the key to the challenge we are  facing."    The opposition leader said the current social situation is  too serious; therefore, one cannot think about long term  socioeconomic plans because in the long term we will have all  died. In our case, we cannot even talk about a medium-term  plan, only of a national emergency plan. Laino added that the  social situation is absolutely serious and if the government  does not respond to the demands now, we are going to find  ourselves in a situation that may turn the current system not  only unstable but also make the country ungovernable.    Laino then insisted again that the Paraguayan opposition  must  start thinking about changing its own policy regarding the  government because it already has waited long enough and cannot  continue waiting another seven months, and that the executive  branch should be aware of this because "our attitude has always  been responsible, sensible, but there are no signs of a solution  to the social problems."</p>

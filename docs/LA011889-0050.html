			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE FACES BEHIND MANY NOTABLE CASES  </P> <P> The Courage of Their Convictions: Sixteen Americans Who Fought Their Way to the  Supreme Court by Peter Irons (Free Press/Macmillan: $22.95, 420 pages)  </P> <P> Shortly after starting law school, I was delighted to discover that the case  law of the American judicial system amounts to a mammoth library of dramatic  narrative. Each opinion of an appellate court arises from a "case or  controversy" -- that is, a struggle between human beings over love, money,  liberty or power -- and each case book is rather like a collection of short  stories. To this day, if I lack for quick leisure reading, I will pull a copy  of California Reports off the shelf of my law library and read a case at  random.  </P> <P> Peter Irons approaches the daunting subject of constitutional law with a  similar (if distinctly weightier) attitude in "The Courage of Their  Convictions." He reminds us that much of the recent struggle for civil rights  and personal liberty in contemporary America has been conducted in the  courtroom, and he encourages us to look beyond the headlines and the op-ed  pieces to see the intimate human values that are often at stake in a  constitutional lawsuit.  </P> <P> "Almost without exception, the notoriety of Supreme Court cases is matched by  the obscurity of the people who began them," Irons explains. "What little we do  learn is distorted by the media's lust for the sensational and the trivial."  His solution is to allow 16 otherwise anonymous constitutional litigants --  "women and men . . . black, white, Hispanic and Asian . . . gay and straight .  . . carpenters, bartenders, doctors and lawyers" -- to speak for themselves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Just the Facts  </P> <P> Each of the 16 cases is treated in two parts -- first, Irons narrates the facts  of the case and discusses the holding of the Supreme Court, and then the man or  woman behind the lawsuit gives a first-person account of his or her experiences  as a "test case." In that sense, "The Courage of Their Convictions" is a kind  of annotated oral history of constitutional law in America -- a footnote that  gives a name and a face, a heart and soul, to what Irons characterizes as "a  living Constitution."  </P> <P> At its best, the book reveals and explains the scholarly but spirited debate --  and the considerable intellectual contortions -- that are the stuff of a  judicial decision. At the same time, Irons allows us to understand that the law  has an intimate and sometimes overwhelming impact on the human beings whose  lives and liberty are at risk.  </P> <P> "We live by symbols," Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote (quoting his "judicial  hero," Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes) in an 8-to-1 decision upholding the  expulsion of a schoolgirl named Lillian Gobitis, a Jehovah's witness, for  refusing to salute the flag in a Pennsylvania schoolroom in 1935.  </P> <P> "I loved school," Lillian Gobitis recalls of her childhood ordeal. "I was  actually kind of popular. And I felt that, 'Oh, if I stop saluting the flag, I  will blow all this!' And I did."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Test Case  </P> <P> We hear, too, from Gordon Hirabayashi, a college senior who refused to sign up  for "relocation" after Pearl Harbor: "I had no plans to being a test case," he  recalls. "I was so naive, I'd never even seen a jail."  </P> <P> Dr. Jane Hodgson is a physician who challenged a Minnesota law against  abortion: "It gradually dawned on me that this was lousy medicine we were  practicing, and something ought to be done about it. But I never thought I'd  see it in my day. I thought it would take forever."  </P> <P> Elmer Gertz is a Chicago lawyer who helped to change the laws of libel in  protracted litigation against the John Birch Society: "One interesting thing  about the case is that actually my earnings did not decrease. They went up!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'The Door ... Opened'  </P> <P> And Michael Hardwick is an Atlanta man whose arrest on charges of sodomy  prompted a recent unsuccessful attack on laws against private sexual conduct:  "The door . . . .opened up and I looked up and there was nobody there. I just  blew it off as the wind and went back to what I was involved in . . . I heard  another noise and I looked up, and this officer is standing in my bedroom."  </P> <P> Irons, a draft resister in the 1960s and a Harvard-trained civil rights lawyer  today, teaches political science at UC San Diego. He is the author of "Justice  at War," a chronicle of the unsuccessful legal challenges to the wartime  internment of Japanese Americans. So we should not be surprised that his book  focuses exclusively on what he characterizes as "some of the deepest and most  enduring divisions among Americans -- those of religion and race, protest and  privacy," as he puts it.  </P> <P> Nor should we be surprised that the book reads all too often like a  friend-of-the-court brief for the litigants and their causes. Irons is an  unabashed activist, and he concludes his book with a call to further activism  in the courts: "All we can hope is that Americans like the people in this book,  people with both courage and conviction, will continue to bring these issues to  the courts, and that judges will look behind the 'masks of the law' to see the  many faces of America."  </P></p>

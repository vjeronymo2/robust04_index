			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> QUAKE'S FINANCIAL IMPACT STILL FELT  </P> <P> Economic aftershocks of the collapse of the Cypress freeway in the Oct. 17,  1989, Loma Prieta earthquake are still being felt, according to a report to be  issued Monday by transportation and economic experts. The report calculates the  closure of the 1 1/2-mile freeway, which linked downtown Oakland with the San  Francisco Bay Bridge, has cost $22.5 million to date in added travel times for  motorists, higher vehicle operating costs and delays in shipments of products.  "The devastation caused by the Loma Prieta earthquake has taught us some hard  lessons -- one of them being that investment in transportation infrastructure  is a critical element in any strategy to sustain economic growth in the  region," said Mike McGill, executive director of the Bay Area Forum, which will  issue the report along with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.  </P></p>

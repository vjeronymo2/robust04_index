			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush defends status of China - Why it is likely to stay a most-favoured nation IN ONE of his recent rambling discourses with the press, President George Bush transmitted a succinct message to Congress. Despite congressional anger over Chinese human rights abuses, persecution in Tibet, and the growing bilateral trade deficit, he is not prepared to take away China's most-favoured nation (MFN) trade benefits. The president insisted he had not yet made a decision on China's MFN status, which comes up for renewal on June 3. However, he left little doubt what he would do, insisting that 'reasoned relations' with Peking had 'paid off in spades' when China threw its support behind the allied coalition in United Nations votes on the Gulf war. A country with MFN status is accorded the standard tariff treatment the US extends to almost all its trade partners. Among the exceptions are the Soviet Union and 'international outlaws' such as Iran, Iraq and South Africa. China was given MFN status in 1980 when it basked in the sunshine of widespread US approval for its economic reforms. It is clear President Bush is not relishing the inevitable battle, not least because he and Congress have already spilled much blood over the two-year extension of the fast-track negotiating authority for the Uruguay Round of trade talks and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). But there is so much at stake for business interests and foreign policy that it is a struggle the president is almost certain to wage. Congressional opposition to China's MFN status has been building since Chinese soldiers killed hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators in Peking's Tiananmen Square in 1988. While some of the concern may be real, there is no denying the political advantage for Democrats who use the issue to portray the president as 'a moral wimp'. Congressman Joseph Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, accuses him of being unwilling 'to stand up to China'. Congressman Tom Lantos, a California Democrat, complains about China's use of slave labour for some of its exports and about its weapons exports to dangerous customers. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, has, with the support of Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, re-introduced a bill to revoke China's MFN status. For China to be denied MFN status, a majority in both houses would have to pass a resolution of disapproval 90 days after the president issued the extension. It could then be vetoed by the president, in which case Congress would have to muster two-thirds in both houses to override the veto. The greater threat to China's MFN status, according to Mr Peter Lo, Hong Kong minister of economic and trade affairs in Washington, is a bill granting China 'conditional' MFN. The bill was introduced by Congresswomen Nancy Pelosi, head of the Congressional Working Group on China. 'We believe the magnitude of congressional support would be larger for conditional MFN than for outright revocation,' said Mr Lo, who warns that such legislation would be disastrous for Hong Kong. The conditional legislation would give China MFN status for a year but it would require an improved human rights record, an accounting for and release of political prisoners, an end to religious persecution in China and Tibet and harassment of Chinese students in the US, and freedom of the press in China. According to Mr Lo, these conditions would be anathema to China. For Hong Kong, which now handles 70 to 80 per cent of China's exports, the trade damage resulting from the loss of MFN would be between Dollars 9bn and Dollars 12bn and 40,000 jobs. Mrs Pelosi insists that China would yield to her conditions rather than lose market share. 'While the Chinese leadership does not like capitalism, it does love money,' she said. The Bush administration has acknowledged real frustration with China over human rights. Mr Robert Kimmitt, a US under-secretary of state, has just returned from Peking where he warned that human rights would be considered when MFN was up for renewal. The administration is also disturbed that China's trade surplus has grown from Dollars 3.5bn in 1988 to Dollars 10.4bn last year and may reach Dollars 15bn this year. But it is more likely the administration will deal with China as it does its other trading partners - with threats and sanctions - in an attempt to preserve a mutually beneficial trading relationship and the president's dream of a 'new world order'. The loss of most-favoured nation status for China would mean 'a devastating blow to the economy and confidence of Hong Hong' as well as millions of dollars in losses for US banks and businesses, says a delegation of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. The group is among the hundreds of lobbyists on Capitol Hill trying to ensure that MFN status remains a cornerstone of US and China's trade relations.  ---------------------------------------------- TOP 10 US EXPORTS  TO CHINA (1990)  ---------------------------------------------- Commodity                  (Dollars millions)  ---------------------------------------------- Aircraft                         609 Fertilisers                      544 Wheat                            497 Cotton                           277 Wood                             175 Polycarboxylic acids             145 Aerospace parts                  140 Machinery parts                  114 Data processing machinery        113 Machines                          97  ---------------------------------------------- TOTAL US Exports               4,807  ---------------------------------------------- Source: US Dept of Commerce Statistics  ----------------------------------------------</p>

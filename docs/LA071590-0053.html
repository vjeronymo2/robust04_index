			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT STING USED AGAINST WASHINGTON'S MAYOR BARRY  </P> <P> The smoke-screen claims of racism and law enforcement overkill to explain the  Mayor Barry sting are missing the main point of the government's extraordinary  but necessary efforts to arrest Barry, who at the time of his arrest was the  No. 1 law enforcement officer in the District of Columbia. To catch a big  criminal fish the government's legal net has to be larger and stronger than one  required to arrest and convict an ordinary criminal. No ordinary police officer  could walk in and arrest Richard Nixon for conspiracy, or Michael Milken for  fraud. The status and power of the alleged offender has to factor into the law  enforcement effort necessary to bring the offender to justice.  </P> <P> For example, the legal process for attempting to convict the criminal  conspiracies of Richard Nixon required the entire Congress and even the Supreme  Court. Despite all of this legal firepower Nixon eluded being convicted when  his deal with his selected President, Gerald Ford, resulted in his  comprehensive pardon. Former President Reagan (who no longer remembers the  alleged criminal offenses committed within the context of the Boland  Amendment), and President Bush because of their political positions and power  have eluded the criminal net for their alleged crimes in the Iran-Contra mess.  Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese through various legal maneuvers managed to  avoid prosecution for various deviant acts he committed in his powerful  position. It is simply more difficult to arrest and convict people in power,  who control some of the legal machinery that is in place to deal with their  crimes, than ordinary offenders.  </P> <P> In Barry's case, it should not be forgotten, that in an earlier effort to  apprehend him for using drugs in a hotel (a criminal act testified to by  several witnesses), the police in Barry's police department were called off at  the last moment. Power-status crimes require extraordinary and powerful police  and judicial procedures for the effective administration of justice.  </P> <P> LEWIS YABLONSKY  </P> <P> Professor of Criminology  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / US-Russian push for Bosnia deal The US and Russia both said yesterday that the arms embargo against Bosnia's Moslem-led government could be lifted if it accepts a new partition plan for the republic while the Serbs reject the proposal. 'I think there is a recognition that the pressure to lift the arms embargo may become irresistible, unavoidable,' said Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. He was speaking at a meeting in Geneva, where he and his counterparts from Russia, Britain, France and Germany endorsed the peace plan. Ministers from all five countries stressed that they were committed to the idea of using threats and inducements to encourage the warring parties to accept the partition plan. However, there have been ominous signs of disagreement between the five over how far the 'carrot and stick' approach should go. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said the warring parties had been given two weeks to respond to the proposal, which awards 51 per cent of Bosnia to a new Croat-Moslem federation and the remainder to the Serbs. The Serbs currently control about 70 per cent of the republic and there was continued fighting yesterday over strategic ground in northern and central Bosnia. Mr Kozyrev described the proposal as the only possible alternative to continuation of the war and stressed that both sides could expect generous treatment if they gave a positive response. The Russian minister said that if the parties did not agree to the proposal, enforcement of existing UN sanctions would be tightened. He added: 'As an extreme measure, a Security Council decision on lifting the arms embargo may be unavoidable.' The joint warning from the US and Russia amounted to a determined effort to keep up a common front, although the domestic pressures in the two countries run in diametrically opposing directions. A formal resumption of arms supplies to Bosnia, while very popular in the US Congress, would be anathema to Russia. Mr Kozyrev warned earlier this week that western moves to penalise the Bosnian Serbs for their alleged intransigence could lead to a world war. Senior figures on both sides have said they would rather fight on than accept the peace plan, but neither party wants to accept the international opprobrium of being the first to reject it. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, told Moslem ambassadors in Geneva that he would not reject the peace proposal out of hand and would try to keep the peace process going. At a meeting with ambassadors from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Mr Izetbegovic also said his army had managed to acquire large amounts of weapons despite the UN arms embargo on former Yugoslavia. He did not hide his dissatisfaction with the peace plan, but one diplomat quoted him as saying: 'Our answer will not be some radical No . . . We believe it wouldn't be wise to reject the plan fully. In other words, we believe that peace negotiations should continue.' Reviewing the military situation, Mr Izetbegovic said the Bosnian army was better off than a year ago. 'We have managed, despite the blockade, to bring in some quantities of weapons and we consider it our right,' he said.</p>

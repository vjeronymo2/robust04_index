OSHA believes these provisions are essential to reduce the number of injuries that occur during felling activities. According to the WIR survey, tree felling is the most dangerous activity in the logging industry. Of those who reported injuries in the WIR survey, 23 percent were engaged in felling trees at the time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  OSHA's FCI report also indicates that felling operations are the most hazardous operation in the logging industry (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The report indicated that 43 percent of all employees who died did so when they were felling trees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The State of Washington study indicated that more than 40 percent of employees killed from 1977&hyph;83 were performing felling operations (Ex. 4&hyph;129). This study concluded that many of the deaths would have been prevented had logging employees been following safe work practices and had remained out of hazardous areas (e.g., adjacent occupied work areas).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  One commenter said that certain of the work practices proposed by OSHA should not be required of each feller (Ex. 5&hyph;54). This commenter said the work practices did not take into account the variation in feller experience, production requirements, and the trees themselves. This commenter also said the work practice requirements did not allow for innovations in felling technology and for recognition of other safe ways to perform felling tasks. OSHA points out that these work practice requirements have been widely recognized and accepted in the logging industry. Most of the State logging standards contain most of these work practices (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K). These requirements were included in OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, that adopted the 1971 ANSI logging standard. In addition, these requirements were contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The ANSI standards are national consensus standards which were developed, approved and followed by the logging industry itself. Presumably, they represent what the industry has viewed to be necessary and reasonable to prevent injuries and deaths in this high hazard industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In paragraph (h)(2)(i) of the final rule, OSHA requires that before a feller even begins felling a tree, a retreat path must be planned and cleared. This provision also requires that the retreat path extend diagonally away from the expected felling line. This provision also includes an exception to the diagonal retreat path when the employer demonstrates that in the particular situation such a retreat path is not feasible or poses a greater hazard than an alternative retreat path. The proposed rule contained a requirement for planning and clearing a retreat path before commencing cutting. However, the proposed rule required that the retreat path ``extend back and diagonally to the rear'' of the expected felling line. This language also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  One commenter contended that a diagonal retreat path may not lead to the safest location in the felling area, therefore, it would be inappropriate for OSHA to designate a required retreat direction in the standard (Ex. 5&hyph;35). The record shows that the clearance of a retreat path so the feller is able to move rapidly and safely away from a falling tree is essential to prevent injuries. According to the WIR survey, 24 percent of all reported injuries resulted from being hit by a tree and half of these injuries involved falling trees. OSHA believes there are many kinds of hazards that necessitate a quick and clear retreat path. For example, the tree being felled can split and part of the tree may then fall in an unexpected direction. In heavily wooded areas, the tree being felled can strike another tree that can cause the first tree or parts of either tree to fall or fly in an unexpected direction. In addition, planning and clearing a path prior to cutting a tree is especially important when the terrain is covered with obstructions such as snow, water or heavy undergrowth. These obstructions could cause the feller to be injured if they impede the feller's ability to rapidly retreat or cause him to trip or fall. For these reasons, OSHA has retained the requirement to plan and clear a retreat path before felling the tree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

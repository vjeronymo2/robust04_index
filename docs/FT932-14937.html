			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Prospect of hung jury looms over LA trial JURORS yesterday ended without a decision their sixth day of deliberations in the trial of four white Los Angeles police officers charged with violating the civil rights of a black motorist, Mr Rodney King, in a beating incident that was recorded on videotape. Fears that the illness of one of the jurors on Wednesday might delay a verdict in the closely watched trial proved unfounded as all 12 jurors returned to the federal courthouse yesterday morning. However, there was rising speculation that the jury might be having difficulty in reaching a consensus on the civil rights charges and that the two-month trial could end with a hung jury on some of the charges. The officer's acquittal 12 months ago in a state court, where they were charged with using excessive force in the arrest of Mr King, sparked riots in Los Angeles and exposed to world-wide attention some of the city's most deprived districts, including South Central Los Angeles, an area that few of the city's affluent residents, and most of its many visitors, ever see. The scene of some of the worst violence in last year's riots, South Central is the focus of attention once more. There are widespread fears that it might again erupt in burning and looting if the men are acquitted. Police, the national guard and US marines at nearby Camp Pendleton are all preparing for the worst. Yet on the streets of South Central there is an eerie calm. The area seemed to have been almost deserted yesterday, with few people on the streets and only light traffic. Everywhere the ugly hulks of last year's fires remain. Many burnt-out buildings have been torn down, the empty lots surrounded by fences scrawled with graffiti - the trademark of local gangs. At intersections there are vacant lots where petrol stations once stood. It was at one such that Mr Reginald Denny, a truck driver, was dragged from his cab and brutally beaten in the full view of television cameras. Most depressing are the blocks and blocks of tiny boarded-up, metal-barred shops and businesses, most of them closed since last year's riots. Of those that remain in business, most seem to have been fortified and closed. Yet only yards away, on the side streets of South Central, life goes on behind locked and grilled doors in row upon row of tiny bungalows. For most residents of this ethnically mixed community, there is no escape. As businesses close, unemployment rises, and property values decline. In Crenshaw, known as one of the toughest parts of the city, the bungalows give way to four-storey apartment buildings and a large shopping centre. Although there are fewer visible signs of last year's riots in this part of the city, it was the scene of numerous shootings and large-scale looting of department stores and supermarkets. Further north, in Korea Town, target of attacks by roving gangs a year ago, uniformed security guards now stand on the pavement outside fortified electronics shops. Additional metal grids are being installed over the windows of other shops. The heavy police presence, so widely publicised by city officials, is not visible in these parts of Los Angeles. In two hours of touring, this reporter saw only four squad cars - moving in pairs - as well as a few 'undercover' police, not very well disguised, in unmarked cars, apparently going about their business of searching for drug dealers. While the 12 jurors in the Rodney King beating trial continue their deliberations in the federal court downtown, it is on the streets of South Central, Crenshaw, Korea Town and other poor neighbourhoods of Los Angeles that the verdict on civil rights and social injustice will ultimately be cast. The efforts of community leaders - black, Asian and hispanic - may be successful in preventing an uprising of the devastating proportions seen a year ago. More pragmatically, people who live in South Central say simply: 'There is nothing left to burn.'</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Wall Street jerks the strings - London 'For the umpteenth time, I'm not going to support Mr Dehaene,' asserted John Major over a Euro-summit dinner last weekend in Corfu. Using the 'just say no' strategy of Nancy Reagan, Major stopped the Belgian prime minister from becoming. If only it were so easy for European markets to disengage themselves from the dollar. They managed to for several days this week but only when concerns over US inflation and growth lay dormant. But when Wall Street twitched on Thursday, European bourses and bond markets jerked. In a commendable performance, albeit on light volume, the FT-SE 100 index rose four out of five days for a net gain on the week of 59.8 points. This failed to repair fully, however, the damage of the previous week when the index fell 146.3 points. Thursday was a fittingly down-day to end a depressing half-year. Once February's peaks were scaled, it was downhill all the way. The Footsie took the brunt of the sell-off, falling 14.6 per cent over the half-year. The worst sectors were gas distribution and financials which fell more than 25 per cent. The best were oils, minerals and chemicals which fell less than 4 per cent. The FT-SE 250 index of mid-sized companies outperformed it, however, on the way up and down. It was off 9.95 per cent at the half-year end. The best performance came from FT-SE Small Cap index, home to the remaining 330 companies in FT-SE-A All-Share Index. Having enjoyed the strongest rally in the first month of the year it was down only 4.7 per cent by the end of June. The trigger for February's market reversal was the first monetary tightening of the cycle by the US Federal Reserve. Again this coming week, the fate of global markets will hang on the Fed as its policy-setting committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. Will it or won't it raise its Fed Funds rate? Some analysts and investors hope that higher US interest rates will bring stability to the dollar and thus bond and stock markets. They argue that rapid US growth and inflationary dangers warrant a rise in Fed Funds by at least one-quarter of a percentage point, if not one-half. Others argue that a rate rise is unjustified by domestic US economic conditions and anyway it would be as flimsy a prop to the dollar as intervention and jaw-boning by central bankers. The fundamental weakness of the dollar and strength of the yen defy such easy policy remedies. The no-change camp has several good arguments. The US economy has shown signs recently of decelerating, commodity prices (except coffee) have cooled, and the Fed is sporting President Clinton's first two, and presumably more dovish, nominees, Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen. Sharp criticism of another rate rise comes from Robin Aspinall of Panmure Gordon. 'Raising interest rates hardly ever succeeds in saving an intrinsically weak currency . . . the forces driving the yen higher look irresistible.' But his far greater concern lies with the lack of money flowing into markets. The problems of the dollar are entwined with those of stock and bond markets. 'The Fed knows that when they pricked the speculative bubble in February, they generated an intense liquidity crisis. That liquidity crisis poses a continuing threat to the markets and the economy. And the correct response to a liquidity crisis is to cut rates.' Not surprisingly, given his position, chancellor Kenneth Clarke takes a more upbeat view. Unveiling the Treasury's forecasts this week, he said the economy was enjoying 'quite the best combination of circumstances . . . for a very, very long time.' The Treasury expects growth this year of 2.75 per cent (against its forecast of 2.5 per cent last November) and another 2.75 per cent in 1995. It believes retail prices minus mortgage payments will rise 2.5 per cent this year (against November's forecast of 3.25 per cent) and 2.75 per cent next year. One analyst seeing a stronger dollar and an opportunity to pick stocks accordingly, is Paul Walton, James Capel's UK strategist. He believes higher interest rates in the US and lower rates in Europe will bolster the US currency. His analysis of 50 large UK stocks sensitive to the dollar shows that they out-perform the market by 2 to 4 per cent for every 10 per cent rise in the dollar against sterling. Typically, the stocks are in the aerospace, pharmaceutical, drinks, packaging and textile sectors plus a handful in media and engineering. If you think, however, the dollar will fall by 10 per cent, then his group of 50 would be likely tounderperform by 1 to 2 per cent. Picking the next stocks to buy has been much on the minds of institutional investors through all this recent market turbulence. Many still believe the downside to the market is limited and that a rally will come. But will there be a discernible trigger for it? Probably not, says Barton Biggs, the strategic guru of Morgan Stanley in New York who is on a European tour. 'It will be just a spontaneous combustion in the compost heap.' One long-smoldering corporate saga which burst into flames this week was Enterprise Oil's bid for Lasmo. The bid battle never moved entirely beyond rhetoric from either side to a more elevated discussion of the merits of merger. The final straw for some Lasmo shareholders was Enterprise's Wednesday tea-time raid which gave it 10 per cent of the stock. Only a handful of investors were able to sell out at up to 169p. The shares closed yesterday at 136p after Enterprise's bid failed. To Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, an overwhelming majority of Lasmo shareholders just said no.</p>

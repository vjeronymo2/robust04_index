			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Thanks to revisionist historians it is no longer a secret that the famous 'Dam Busters' raid by 617 Squadron was not as effective in damaging German manufacturing effort as the British pretended, even if it was a mighty propaganda triumph. More than half a century after the event Secret History sets out to give a sober version of events, and re-unites the crew of F for Freddy, the bomber which was supposed to breach the Sorpe dam but failed (9.00 C4). In Great Railway Journeys Michael Palin moves down a gear or two from his globe-trotting stunts to travel from Londonderry to Kerry (9.30 BBC2). Thursday is the night for those who like modern comedy. The All New Alexei Sayle Show (9.00 BBC2) finishes just in time to switch to BBC1 for the second episode in the new series of Abfab, or Absolutely Fabulous as they still bill it, and that is followed immediately by The Man From Auntie. Thus in 90 minutes of continuous humour you get Sayle, Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley and Ben Elton.</p>

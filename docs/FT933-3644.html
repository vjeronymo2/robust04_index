			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Food industry slams Euro rates freeze THE UK FOOD industry was up in arms yesterday about a European Commission decision on Thursday to freeze fluctuations in 'green' currency rates until the end of September to protect farmers from losses. The 'green' money rates provide a mechanism for translating EC-guaranteed farm prices into national currencies. The UK Food and Drink Federation will send a letter to Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture minister, on Monday complaining strongly about 'the sudden and arbitrary decision'. Mr John Bradbury, group buying director for United Biscuits, said: 'It's absolutely abominable. We now face a month of complete uncertainty over our input prices with no idea what may happen at the end of that.' Mr Bradbury's purchases of raw materials such as flour and sugar cost about Pounds 300m a year and small changes in exchange rates can have a significant effect on the company's margins. The EC's system of floating 'green' rates was introduced at the start of the year, replacing the previous process of fixing 'green' rates annually. However, German farm groups strongly opposed the new scheme as they feared that their payments would fall and they would face too much uncertainty on prices. The issue will be discussed at a meeting of agriculture ministers on September 20, when Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, is expected to oppose any revision of the current system or a continuation of the freeze. UK food processors are furious. Mr Paul Williamson, external affairs director at Cadbury Schweppes, said: 'We can't plan our business like this. We had been trying to hedge our currency risk and now this leaves us exposed.' The Food and Drink Federation said: 'the system must be transparent and predictable for as long as it exists. It is of great concern that the rules agreed last December should be changed arbitrarily and the industry put into such an uncertain position.'</p>

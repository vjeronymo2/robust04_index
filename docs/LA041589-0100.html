			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> 'Ashik Kerib'  </P> <P> Soviet Union, 1988, 90 minutes  </P> <P>  6:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  Co-director Sergei Paradjanov ("Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors," "The Color of  Pomegranates") has created another rapturously strange, eccentric fairy tale: a  poor minstrel's 7-year odyssey to prevent his loved one from forced marriage by  her Turkish merchant father. This simple story becomes a visual feast, filled  with fruits, silks, castles, camels, birds, magical landscapes, mysterious  hills and plains -- as Paradjanov and co-director David Abachidze give us the  tale in painterly images, constant music and two layers of narration and mime.  Great: my nominee, among those I saw, for the Festival's most extraordinary  film. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

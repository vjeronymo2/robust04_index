			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Der fliegende Hollander - Opera in Amsterdam There was at least one notable turn-around in the balance of payments during the 1980s. After a decade or more in which Britain regularly imported opera producers from overseas, usually Germany both East and West, the trade is now starting to go in the opposite direction - British producers are increasingly to be found at work in the opera-houses of continental Europe. The Muziektheater in Amsterdam has proved among the keenest to sample the British product. The new production of Der fliegende Hollander, which opened there at the end of January, is by Richard Jones, probably the most quirky British talent of his generation. We have come a long way since the political Wagner of the East Germans, which was starting to become so predictable a few years ago. This whole evening was typically bizarre, invigorating, full of panache. It also looked stylish. In Nigel Lowery's designs the theme of the Dutchman's picture, which has obsessed Senta, was applied to the opera as a whole. The stage itself was encased in a giant frame and every scene within it took the form of a black-and-white line drawing - a quite dazzlingly effective idea, although it was a shame that the changes of set were so cumbersome. A better feeling for the technical side of theatre was needed here. The only character to be seen in colour throughout was the Dutchman, in an appropriate, deep-sea blue. Senta was most definitely restricted to drab greys from the outset. For in this production she has become the archetypal Plain Jane, her bearing hunched, her hair hanging lifeless, resentful, defensive, obsessive, the object of spite and ostracism on the part of the other girls in the spinning factory: a right odd-ball, in fact. On her stooping shoulders rested all that this production had to say and it was thanks to Kathryn Harries's brilliant portrayal that it said it with such conviction. The meeting between her and the Dutchman was the high-point of the evening. In no other staging have I understood so well the feelings that overwhelm Senta, as she is faced in real life with the man she has idolised in his portrait for so long. This was an powerful confrontation and it hardly mattered that Harries's soprano only has an intermittent hold on sure focus and beauty of tone. Wolfgang Schone's Dutchman, a Nordic traveller with long, blond hair, was nothing like so individual a character. One sensed he was there merely to act as a catalyst in the fulfilment of Senta's destiny, rather than vice versa, as would seem to be the case from the story. Nevertheless, he sang with sufficient power and clearer German words than most of his colleagues. Kenneth Garrison was the unsubtle, full-steam-ahead-on-each-note Erik; Artur Korn sang Daland and Glenn Winslade an appealing Steersman. It would be nice to report that the musical side of the evening had the same strength of purpose as the dramatic, but that was not really so. Christof Perick encouraged the right blended Wagnerian sounds from the pit, but there was not the dynamism that can make this relatively early Wagner score exciting, nor the ability to drive home the big moments. The men's choruses, so important a feature, lacked certainty of attack too often. Perhaps some of the stage business put them off. For the spinning chorus the ladies had no spinning-wheels, but wiggled their fore-fingers in the air; the sailors had no ropes to pull on and were left performing physical exercises. Before she met the Dutchman, Senta fell through his picture and returned dressed in blue. In another twist the brightly-coloured pictures of fish which hung on the wall at the beginning had turned into black-and-white fishbones by the end. All very amusing and strange, but then that was half the fascination of the evening. British Wagner is set to be a far less predictable commodity. Performances continue at the Muziektheater until February 21</p>

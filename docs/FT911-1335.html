			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Granada seeking to raise Pounds 350m GRANADA Group, the UK television, leisure and computer services group, is poised to make disposals and launch a rights issue, which together could raise up to Pounds 350m. The group wants to bolster its balance sheet ahead of its bid to retain the commercial television franchise in the north-west. Bass, the UK brewer which recently announced a Pounds 558m rights issue, is front-runner to buy the bingo business which comprises more than 80 venues and could be worth Pounds 150m. Other disposals, for example of overseas television rental activities, might bring the total sale proceeds to more than Pounds 200m. But with borrowings likely to have risen from the Pounds 436m disclosed last September, representing debt-equity gearing of 86 per cent, a rights issue is needed to ease the balance sheet strain further. If about Pounds 150m were raised, gearing could come down to less than 20 per cent - leaving aside nearly Pounds 150m in off-balance-sheet guarantees and loans to BSkyB, the satellite television venture. The expected rights issue has put the position of Mr Derek Lewis, Granada's chief executive, under threat. He has been told that some institutional shareholders and the group's merchant bank, SG Warburg, believe a top-level change is needed. Mr Lewis has been criticised for the group's Pounds 200m diversification into computer services. Granada's problems have come at a difficult time because it must submit its bid to retain its north-west commercial television licence on May 15. At Friday's close of 203.5p, its market value was Pounds 612.8m.</p>

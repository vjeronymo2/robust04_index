			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 15 May (NA) -- The People's  Revolutionary Army (ORP) today denied any involvement in the  attack on the Japanese Embassy on 13 May and blamed  incriminating reports on "counterintelligence maneuvers."    The ORP states that pamphlets linking the ORP to the attack  "are a pathetic attempt to involve the organization in an  incident that is without political motive."    The ORP press communique stresses that it has "always"  admitted responsibility for its actions, adding that this  "attempt" to link it to the attack "a pathetic  counterintelligence maneuver."

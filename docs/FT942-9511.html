			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Polls show Gonzalez lagging The damage that recent corruption scandals have done to Mr Felipe Gonzalez's Spanish government is shown in a series of opinion polls giving the conservative opposition a decisive lead in next month's European parliament election. The polls also show the ruling Socialists losing their absolute majority for the first time in the regional parliament of Andalucia, where elections are being held at the same time as the European ballot on June 12. Mr Gonzalez, launching his party's European campaign in Madrid on Friday, said it would have to make 'an enormous mobilisation effort'. He admitted that the elections were taking place at 'an extremely delicate moment'. The daily El Mundo, which has spearheaded allegations of corruption and financial misconduct by senior officials, published a poll yesterday showing the Socialist share of the vote falling to 32.8 per cent, against 40.2 per cent in the last European election four years ago. This was almost five points behind the conservative Popular party, whose vote was shown rising to 37.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent in 1989. This would give the Popular party 27 of Spain's 64 European parliament seats, against 15 at present. The Socialists would lose three or four of their current 27 seats. Another poll commissioned by the conservative Barcelona daily La Vanguardia gave the Popular party a lead of 5.9 points, although half its respondents were undecided or had decided not to vote. A majority thought the government was not doing enough to combat corruption, and almost 45 per cent thought Mr Gonzalez should resign. An earlier survey published by the right-wing Madrid newspaper ABC showed the Popular party 6.8 points ahead. All the polls pointed to a strong result for the Communist-led United Left.</p>

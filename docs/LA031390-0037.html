			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON;  </P> <P> HIGH FIBER FOR DIETERS  </P> <P> Question: Why are high-fiber foods recommended for someone who is on a diet?  Don't they have calories?  </P> <P> Answer: One reason high-fiber foods are recommended for dieters is that they  fill the stomach and give the dieter the feeling that his or her appetite has  been satisfied. This, of course, enables the dieter to control his or her  appetite.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / People: Green adviser for Jupiter Tyndall Stanley Johnson, the ebullient environmentalist who recently penned what many deem to be one of the leading tomes on the Rio earth summit, is joining the 'Green' advisory committee at investment managers Jupiter Tyndall. Johnson will join a team advising the City of London's longest-established environmental investment company. Jupiter Tyndall has two 'Green' funds; the International Green Investment Trust and The Jupiter Ecology Fund. Reflecting the still embryonic status of ethical funds, the two account for just Pounds 50m of the Pounds 4.2bn Jupiter Tyndall has under management. The Jupiter advisory committee comprises three familiar environmentalists who help to shape the research, methods and priorities of the research department. Johnson, who is also an adviser on environmental matters to Coopers and Lybrand, should help to sharpen the committee's teeth in deciding in which companies the funds should be invested. Apart from serving in a variety of environmentally-sensitive positions at the European Commission, he sat as a member of the European Parliament from 1979-84. Johnson's arrival represents a shot in the arm for Jupiter Tyndall after the departure earlier this year of Tessa Tennant, the high-profile campaigner on ethical investment issues, together with other members of the ethical investment team to National Provident Institution. Tennant's move was followed by the resignation of the entire Advisory Committee, which is now gradually being replaced. NPI, which has had relatively limited exposure to environmental funds, wants to beef up its standing in ethical investments for pension fund clients.</p>

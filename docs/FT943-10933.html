			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: First-half boost for MUI from HK interests Earnings from recent purchases of three Hong Kong companies helped to boost the first-half profits at Malayan United Industries (MUI), the Malaysian-based conglomerate with interests ranging from hotels to cement trading and financial services to news-papers. Profits in the six months to the end of June advanced 61 per cent to MDollars 38.37m (USDollars 14.79m) from MDollars 23.89m a year earlier, on turnover substantially lower at MDollars 222.4m, against MDollars 347.37m. Pre-tax profits of MDollars 57.28m compared with MDollars 47.18m in the first half of 1993. The group recently acquired substantial stakes in Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (Holdings), Kerry Financial Services, and Morning Star Holdings to boost its international investment division. It went on a buying spree after selling off its MUI Bank and MUI Finance to Malaysia's Hong Leong group for MDollars 1.1bn cash. MUI said contributions from the group's cement-based associated companies also improved with the increased production capacity of the cement plants.</p>

			<p>Zulia,   Tachira   <F P=102> PA3103220494 Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 25 Mar 94 p 4-24 </F> <F P=103> PA3103220494 </F> <F P=104>  Caracas EL UNIVERSAL </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose G. Ramos] </F>   [Text] Following a number of inspections along the border  with Colombia, agents from DEA and other international  organizations have determined that 80 percent of the drug  traffic that passes through Venezuela--some 100-150 tonnes a  year--crosses the border between the states of Zulia and Tachira.    MAS (Movement for Socialism) Deputy Julio Montoya has  reported that the Perija Cartel [as published] has appeared  along the Venezuelan border as a result of the displacement and  reorganization of the Medellin Cartel's medium-level leaders.  This comes after Colombian authorities dealt the drug  traffickers smashing blows by killing or arresting their topmost  leaders as part of the fight against drug trafficking in  Colombia.    Montoya said he has proof that the kidnapping of cattlemen  along the border--which occurred last year at the alarming rate  of three kidnappings per month along the country's western  border, and, so far this year, has risen to four per month--is  the result of a plot being carried out by the Colombian drug  cartels. He said the drug traffickers' strategy is to force  hacienda owners to leave the area to allow traffickers to buy  the abandoned property with laundered money. According to  Montoya, "Once this is done, the region will become an  operations center with the installation of labs and other  infrastructures to process drugs."    According to the investigation conducted by Montoya, six of  every 10 haciendas in the area have been put up for sale because  of the hacienda owners' fear over the current situation. He  said: "The effect on our agriculture and livestock industry is  evident--lower production of beef, milk, and several  agricultural products."</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: French Connection bank deal FRENCH Connection Group, the USM-quoted fashion manufacturer and retailer, has agreed new bank facilities after its founder added a further Pounds 2m to his loans to the company. Mr Stephen Marks, who owns about 70 per cent of the equity, has now lent the company a total of Pounds 3.6m. The company has been in discussions with its bankers, with Barclays as the agent bank, since last year. During 1991 it dismissed its chief executive and its finance director and incurred a pre-tax loss of nearly Pounds 5m on turnover of Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 28.7m) in the first half. Mr Michael Shen, former chief executive, has sued for wrongful dismissal. Latest figure for net debt was on July 31, when it stood at Pounds 5.5m, or 84 per cent of shareholders' funds. With full-year figures to be announced next month, the company would give no further balance sheet details yesterday. The business is being reviewed by a new management team headed by Mr George Wardale, former chief executive of Highland Spring, the bottled water company. His appointment and that of Mr John Ellis, formerly of George Wimpey, the builder, were also announced. Mr Marks continues as chief executive. Mr Wardale led a turnround in the fortunes of Highland Spring, which he joined from Lonrho in 1986. He said: 'I have chosen this company to spend the next few years of my life and I would not have done so unless I had thought that it was not only a decent company, but also that the deal was doable.' He said the core parts of the business were French Connection wholesale and retail, and the Nicole Farhi shops. The Bukta subsidiary was not regarded as core.</p>

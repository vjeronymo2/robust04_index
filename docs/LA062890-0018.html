			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NELSON MANDELA'S CONTROVERSIAL TIES TO ARAFAT, KADAFI AND CASTRO  </P> <P> Hearing Mandela state that he feels a "kinship" with Castro, Kadafi and Arafat  because they have supported the anti-apartheid movement makes me wonder if one  could extend the same logic to expect a connection with Hitler, Stalin or  Attila the Hun, as long as they met the needed criterion.  </P> <P> Mandela appears to be a man of extraordinary intelligence and dignity.  </P> <P> I would ask him to consider what kind of relationship the new (post-apartheid)  South Africa will have with the likes of Arafat, Castro or Kadafi. He will be  beholden to proven liars, violators of human rights and proponents of every  anti-democratic dogma.  </P> <P> There is an adage that Mandela would do well to remember: "He who lies down  with dogs, wakes up with fleas!"  </P> <P> SHERRI LIPMAN  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

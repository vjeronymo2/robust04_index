			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Joint venture with Goplana gives Nestle Polish production base NESTLE, the international confectionery and foods company, has won the exclusive right from the Polish authorities to negotiate a joint venture with Goplana, the last major state-owned chocolate manufacturer. This gives Nestle its first production base in the country. The successful bid, mounted only two months ago, thwarts a two-year effort by ED and F. Man, the cocoa and sugar brokers, working with Elite Industries from Israel, to establish a joint venture with Goplana in Poznan, which controls 10 per cent of the domestic market. Nestle said it would take 42 per cent in the new joint venture, making its investment worth around Dollars 32m. This leaves a 5 per cent share with the recently privatised Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy based in Poznan, which bid with Nestle. The level of additional spending by Nestle on developing Goplana has yet to be negotiated before a final contract is signed. Poland's other important chocolate manufacturers have already been sold with Wedel, the best known brand going to PepsiCo Foods International, while Wawel in Krakow has been taken over by management and employees. Kraft Jacobs Suchard have also bought Olza, a chocolate and biscuit maker in Cieszyn. Meanwhile, Pozmeat, a Poznan-based meat processor, was sold yesterday to management, employees and private investors, including Animex, a major meat foreign trader, in a deal valuing the plant at 80bn zlotys (USDollars 4.1m). The purchasers have pledged to invest 90bn zlotys over the next four years in Pozmeat, which reported sales worth 358bn zlotys in the first half of this year with a net profit of 10bn zlotys. The sale came as the government announced that Rolimpex, Poland's state-owned grain and farm produce foreign trader, would be privatised through a public share offer by the end of March next year. Up to 40 per cent of Rolimpex's shares are to be sold to private investors with 35 per cent retained by management and employees. Twenty-five per cent of the equity is to be retained by the treasury and state-owned institutions.</p>

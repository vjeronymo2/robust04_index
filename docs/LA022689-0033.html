			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: RESISTING THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE: MICRO  </P> <P> I have always fought progress, change and vision. This is because progress,  change and vision always come with a manual. On my husband's last birthday, I  presented him with a microwave oven so he could heat up the milk for his coffee  without scorching every pan in the house. It came with a manual that could have  been made into an eight-hour miniseries.  </P> <P> Leafing through the book of instructions, I came across the chapter on how to  replace the light bulb in your microwave. It gave new meaning to the old joke,  "How many (fill in your own group) does it take to replace a light bulb?" In  this case, the answer came to two nuclear physicists, one man with asbestos  hands and an authorized service representative who would determine the bulb's  availability.  </P> <P> There was an entire chapter devoted to "probe cooking." I had never  probe-cooked before. (Or is it cooked probe before?) There was a series of  graphics that outlined the "control panel," and a few words leapt off the pages  -- "burn risk," "electric shock," "injury to persons," and "excessive microwave  energy." Cher in "Silkwood" came to mind.  </P> <P> Even if I had had the patience to read the entire manual, I knew I'd be so  intimidated, I'd just use the oven to store bread and crackers. The decision  was made to fake it. Using a microwave without directions is like parallel  parking a tank without a license.  </P> <P> I have paid an exorbitant price for my stubbornness. Did you know that a bagel  left in a microwave a mere two seconds longer than it should can pull out the  entire top row of your teeth when you bite into it? Or that a whole egg left to  hard-boil will detonate after a while? When all the water boils out of a coffee  mug, the mug will likewise explode like a land mine.  </P> <P> And here's an interesting phenomenon: If you keep cooking bacon until it gets  "real crispy," it will eventually melt down, and you will have to suck the  flavor out of the paper towel.  </P> <P> It is ludicrous to read microwave instructions on the boxes of food you buy, as  each one will have a disclaimer: THIS WILL VARY WITH YOUR MICROWAVE. Loosely  translated, this means, "You're on your own, Bernice."  </P> <P> I guess I'm inspired by the millions of children in this country who can  operate a microwave before they know how to read. They eventually rise above a  warmed-over pizza that comes out like a Ping-Pong paddle with pepperoni.  </P> <P> A child was visiting the other day and asked: "Mrs. Bombeck, the clock on your  microwave is blinking. Want me to set it for you?"  </P> <P> I lifted him off the floor so he could reach it. He was small for 4.  </P></p>

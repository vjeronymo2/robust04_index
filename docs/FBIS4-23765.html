			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan with </F> domestic correspondents in Abidjan; monitored in progress --  live]    [Excerpts] ...before we start analyzing the first details  of the results of this measure in the current economic context,  and last, touch on some economic prospects. First, concerning  the backup measures, the main objective of this CFA franc  adjustment was the restoration of our economies'  competitiveness, which should significantly increase exports and  investments. However, in order to ensure the success of the CFA  adjustment and achieve the objectives that we sought, it was  absolutely necessary to adopt a set of backup measures, which  government endeavored to implement after the decision was  announced. The government's first objective was to check  inflation and uncontrolled price increases. Thus, the machinery  to control price increases following the devaluation was  immediately set up. On 13 January, a decree was signed by the  president of the Republic aimed at freezing, for a maximum  period of three months, the prices of 34 items which were  considered essential. [passage omitted]    What is the bottom line on the devaluation at the end of  these first five months? On the whole, the balance sheet could  be said to be positive. First, the results obtained in the area  of inflation are very encouraging, since the rate for the first  four months of this year stood at about 21 percent. Even  better, the monthly consumer price index trend since the  devaluation shows a downturn in the inflation rate. For  example: The consumer price index for an African household  headed by a workman registered a monthly increase of 8 percent  in January -- the month of the devaluation -- 6 percent in  February, 5 percent in March, and down to 1 percent in April.  Similarly, the consumer price index for an African household  headed by a professional also showed a monthly increase -- of 9  percent -- in January, before falling gradually to 1.5 percent  in April. The index for a European household, which, as  everybody knows, involves more imported goods, registered a  17-percent upturn in January -- before stabilizing at about 7  percent in February and March, and then falling to 2 percent  between March and April.    The obvious result is that we are winning the battle with  inflation, and this is thanks to the support of the entire  private sector and all the different social categories of the  population. Already we can see that the prices of certain  specific items have stabilized, or even dropped. This  significant progress made in the area of prices shows that the  devaluation is being well managed, and that, for the moment, it  is a success. It is a success for everyone, Ivorians and  resident businessmen in Cote d'Ivoire, who have shown a great  sense of responsibility on this issue. I would therefore, on  behalf of the head of state and the government, like to thank  them for the efforts and sacrifices they made in managing the  devaluation.    The second area of satisfaction concerns the trend in public  finance. Looking at the trend in revenue and expenditure, we  can say that the primary balance -- the balance between revenues  and primary expenditures -- of the state's financial operations  has improved significantly, and stands at a very positive level  of about 100 billion, as against the 57 billion projected under  the program. This trend is expected to continue in the coming  months and years, and should enable a gradual reduction in the  payment of mostly domestic arrears, which is a vital factor for  economic revival.    The third area of satisfaction is the resumption of economic  activities. Of course, it is early yet to talk of very  appreciable growth. However, the blossoming of activities that  we have observed indeed confirm that there is a reversal of  trends. The reasons for this phenomenon are many: The  restoration of the Ivorian economy's ability to compete, the  gradual return of the private sector's confidence in the  post-devaluation running of affairs, political stability, and  the social peace prevailing in Cote d'Ivoire, despite the  considerable shock caused by the devaluation.    All these factors explain the changes currently taking place  within our economy. Thus, for the first quarter of this year,  the index for industrial production increased by 5 percent; for  agro-industry, it rose by 15 percent; and for the electricity  and water sector, by 8 percent during the same period. This  favorable development is even more evident in the area of the  country's external trade. The restoration of competitiveness  led to a 13- percent increase in the volume of exports during  the first quarter of this year resulting mainly from a  substantial increase in the export of food crops to other  countries, rough and processed timber, and especially industrial  goods, whose volume increased by about 34 percent for the same  period. This really shows that the devaluation has opened up  new development prospects for our goods in external markets.    Concerning imports, the trend is also encouraging. The  volume of food imports decreased by about 3 percent during the  first quarter of this year, which also shows a gradual change in  eating habits of Ivorians, who now tend to consume more locally  produced goods, thus reducing the need to import foreign goods.    As for the monetary situation in our country, the process  is going smoothly and positively and it is marked by a money  supply worth 112.04 billion CFA francs which is an increase  amounting to 149 billion CFA in terms of external assets. For  the money supply, this evolution is characterized essentially by  an increase in bank deposits worth 106.03 billion due mainly to  the progress made in increased assets in the private sector  amounting to 14 billion CFA francs. This, in conjunction with  the return of private capitals, added to the automatic effect of  the devaluation on the upturns of export goods. As for external  assets, the 149 billion-increase is the result of the loans by  the Central Bank of West African States of 49.9 billion CFA  francs and the reorganization of the banks' external statements  of 99.1 billion CFA francs. The Ivorian banks have now become  creditors vis-a-vis overseas banks.    As for internal debts, they are now reduced to 75.5 billion  CFA francs, compared with December 1993. This reduction is  achieved through joint government's aid that has also been  reduced to 21.8 billion, and economic loans that have been  reduced to 57.3 billion CFA francs. [passage omitted]    The devaluation should enable us to start afresh. The first  indicators I briefly presented showed that we are on the right  path. Indeed, much remains to be done. We should therefore  make more efforts to achieve economic growth and significantly  reduce unemployment, particularly within the ranks of the youth.  The palliative measures aimed at rural areas should continue.  The productive sector should be more dynamic in order to  integrate this new environment by seeking new markets by  increased production. Efforts are to be still made at the level  of interest rates which should be reduced. The banking system  should play a leading role in the financing of investments  necessary for economic revamping. [passage omitted]    In conclusion, all this is aimed at achieving an increase in  the kind of economic growth we enjoyed in the past and at making  Cote d'Ivoire -- like the Asian dragons -- an African elephant  of which Ivorians and Africans would be proud. An African  elephant, that is, a country with a solid, sound, and  diversified economy, capable of efficiently and victoriously  resisting the various economic storms. An economy with an  agriculturally and industrially diversified basis and a sector  of functional services immune to variations in agricultural  product prices. All these efforts would yield results only if  peace prevails as President Henri Konan Bedie stressed on May  Day. A peace that was dear to our founding father, late  President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Therefore, we must continue  to work together under the high authority of President Henri  Konan Bedie for a better future for Cote d'Ivoire and in order  to see this great Ivorian dream come true. Thank you. [passage  omitted]</p>

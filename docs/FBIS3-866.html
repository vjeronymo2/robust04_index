It will now  be in force from midnight to 0530, that is from 2300 to 0430  GMT, as of tomorrow, the national radio announced today. It was  in force from 2100 GMT to 0430 GMT.    The curfew was imposed following the disturbances that  marked  the reelection of President Bongo on 5 December. The results of  the poll were challenged by the opposition, and the government  decreed a "state of alert" marked by the curfew and banning of  gatherings.    This "state of alert," which was lifted on 13 February, was  reimposed a week later, because of a general strike launched by  a confederation of labor unions close to the opposition. The  strike engendered acts of violence which resulted in the death  of nine people in four days, according to official figures.</p>

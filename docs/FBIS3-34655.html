			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sakher Abu El Oun] </F>   [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Feb 10 (AFP) --  Palestinians in the occupied territories shrugged off the  Israel-PLO security accord on Thursday [10 February], doubting  that much would change for them in the near future.    'Arafat tried to tell his people that Palestine was back.    "Palestine and the name of Palestine have returned to the  map  of the Middle East," he said after signing the deal in Cairo on  Wednesday night.    But few seemed to be listening on the Gaza Strip and West  Bank, where reaction was at best prudent.    "I'm bitterly and cautiously optimistic," said 32-year-old  sweetshop owner Taysir Al-Khudari.    "The Oslo agreement did not fulfil our hopes and this Cairo  agreement is no better. But what can we do? We have to accept  it because the international situation is not good for us.    Gazans were more occupied with stocking up with delicacies  for Ramadan, the Moslem fasting month which starts this weekend.  The market was packed with people queueing for the oriental  sweetmeats "halawa" and "amardine."    The eruption of joy which marked the signing of the  Declaration of Principles for autonomy in Washington on  September 13 seemed part of a distant past.    "I danced for eight hours because I thought the Israeli  soldiers were going to leave straight away or at least by  December 13 at the latest," Taysir said.    "But the deadline passed and nothing happened. There is no  hope left here," he said, to nods of agreement among his  customers.    Army jeeps still patrol the mean streets of the Gaza Strip,  watched by a resentful population of 780,000.    "The occupation continues and the oppression will stay the  same up to the last minute," said artificial limb manufacturer  Hisham Saqallah. "I will start being optimistic when I see the  last Israeli convoy leave."    The reaction of the Islamic fundamentalist movement HAMAS,  which opposes the Middle East peace process, was predictable but  nonetheless severe.    "Israel has imposed its conditions on the Palestinians, who  could not make their voice heard," said Khalid al-Hindi, a HAMAS  official.    "This agreement gives Israel the right to continue to hunt  down Palestinians. This agreement is good for Israel because it  opens the door wide to the Arab world."    Even 'Arafat's men were downbeat.    At the PLO offices in Gaza City, official Safran Abu-Zayda  said: "The agreement does not satisfy our demands. But if the  occupation and (Jewish) settlement continue the accord will not  hold," he warned.    "Nothing has changed until now," said Fatah official Ahmad  Hillis.    "Today is the same as yesterday. We have learnt to be  cautious because every time the Israelis block implementation of  the agreement."</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A ROAD NOT TAKEN BY ELLA FITZGERALD;  </P> <P> JAZZ: SHE COULD HAVE BECOME A DANCER ON A FATEFUL DAY IN 1934. OPTING TO SING  INSTEAD, SHE'S CLUNG TO HER ROOTS AND KEPT A YOUTHFUL OUTLOOK. SHE PERFORMS IN  COSTA MESA TONIGHT.  </P> <P> In an interview before their appearance this past August at the Hollywood Bowl,  83-year-old saxophonist Benny Carter talked about the first time he saw Ella  Fitzgerald sing.  </P> <P> "It was 1934, and she was doing the amateur show at the Apollo Theatre in New  York," Carter said of the now-legendary night when a 15-year-old Fitzgerald,  worried that her legs were too skinny, made an instant career change. "She was  going to enter a dance contest there and something happened that changed her  mind and she sang instead. And that was the beginning of history."  </P> <P> Is that really the way it happened?  </P> <P> "Oh yes," Fitzgerald, who appears tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center, said recently in a phone conversation from her home in Beverly Hills.  "I went on stage to dance. I had made a bet with a girlfriend of mine. We had  signed up for the amateur hour, and she told me I would be chicken if I didn't  go out and do it. And of all the times for it to happen, I was the first  amateur they called out.  </P> <P> "When I saw all those people, I lost my nerve. And the man said, 'You're out  here, you have to do something.' So I tried to do a song that my mother was  madly in love with that was sung by Miss Conee Boswell -- she played that  record all the time. So I started to sing and won first prize. But there was no  way in the world that I was going out there to dance."  </P> <P> The saxophonist was so impressed with the singer's Apollo Theatre performance  that he took her to meet bandleader Fletcher Henderson.  </P> <P> "But he didn't want a girl singer at the time," Fitzgerald recalls. "He told  me, 'Don't call me, I'll call you.' "  </P> <P> The turndown from Henderson was only a brief pause in the singer's rise to  stardom. Fitzgerald was soon recording with drummer Chick Webb's band, and, by  1937, she won the first of many Down Beat magazine polls, an honor she shared  that year with Bing Crosby.  </P> <P>  Carter, who's worked on and off with Fitzgerald in the last 55 years and  appears on her most recent album, "All That Jazz," recorded in 1989, still has  high praise for the singer. "Ella's singing is indescribable," he said. "She's  a creator who uses her instrument just as the guy who blows into his saxophone.  She has such acute hearing that she can hear the changes that are being played  and create accordingly. She's a great talent."  </P> <P> Fitzgerald credits her mother with developing the aspiring singer's musical  taste. "She listened to records all the time. Conee Boswell was one of her  favorites -- that's how I started to sing "Object of My Affection" and "Judy"  -- and so was Bessie Smith. The Mills Brothers had just become popular, and she  liked them."  </P> <P> "I love to sing and I love people and that has been what's got me through," she  says of her success. Fitzgerald's incalculable popularity has come from her  willingness to embrace a number of song styles and not just limit herself to  jazz. She constructed her most recognizable hit, "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," in 1938  from the well-known children's rhyme, with help from arranger Van Alexander.  </P> <P> "The first place we played it," she says, "was Boston, Mass., and it was an  overnight sensation, I think because people remembered the game. I never get  tired of performing that one."  </P> <P> Her audience widened considerably beginning in 1956 when producer Norman Granz  enlisted the singer to do a number of recordings with music from various  composers. The first of these, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song  Book," became an immediate sensation. Collections from Rodgers and Hart, George  and Ira Gershwin, Duke Ellington and Harold Arlen soon followed.  </P> <P> "At the time I was with (Granz's) Jazz at the Philharmonic, and he thought a  lot of the jazz clubs were closing and that it was time to do something  different. And the songbook went over so well, we just continued doing that  kind of thing. I'm very grateful to him for that because it was like opening up  a new thing for me, a new beginning. I not only had my jazz fans, I had people  who like the pretty tunes. . . .  </P> <P> "In music, it's good to try a little of everything. That way, I feel like what  I'm doing is trying to satisfy the whole audience. There's always somebody who  comes up and says, 'You didn't do my song.' So we try to do a little something  from all the composers. When I don't remember the words, I make up my own."  </P> <P> Despite health problems in the last few years -- she had quintuple heart bypass  surgery in 1986, and a severe virus caused her to cancel some of her  engagements this summer -- Fitzgerald maintains the optimism and youthful  outlook that has separated her from singers like Billie Holiday. This outlook  is reflected in her aspiration to do a video that would recall her roots as a  young dancer and singer, one that would embrace her fondness of children. "I'd  love to do that. And I would love to do something that would give inspiration  to the young ones, the little children. I'd like to do some songs like 'Muffin  Man,' 'A-Tisket, A-Tasket' and a couple of things that are popular that the  kids would like and let them dance. And I'd do a little dance."  </P> <P> She also wants to study Spanish and do an album in the language someday.  </P> <P> "When I go to the market, I sing a couple little songs in Spanish for the kids  there. They like it, so I thought I might like to do an album -- I've done one  in Portuguese. Those are the things that keep you going, when each day you're  learning something. It might sound corny, but that's what I believe."  </P> <P>  Ella Fitzgerald sings tonight at 8 at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $20 to $50. Information:  (714) 556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

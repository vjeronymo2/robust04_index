Performance-based contracting means structuring all aspects of an acquisition around the purpose of the work to be performed, as opposed to either the manner by which the work is to be performed or the use of broad and imprecise statements of work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous internal agency evaluations and investigations, General Accounting Office Reports, and congressional hearings have documented significant and systemic service contracting problems (i.e., cost overruns, performance delays, and performance problems). To correct these problems, OFPP published Policy Letter 91&hyph;2, Service Contracting ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Vol. 56, No. 72, p. 15113) on April 15, 1991, which requires the use of performance-based contracting to the maximum extent practicable when acquiring services. This approach provides the means to ensure that the appropriate quality level of performance is achieved, and that payment is made only for services that meet contract standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance-based contracting methods include: statements of work comprised of objective, measurable performance standards; quality assurance surveillance plans and objective positive and negative incentives based on the statement of work criteria; selection procedures which include publishing draft solicitations for comment and requiring quality-related evaluation factors, including cost realism and past performance; and conversion from cost reimbursement to fixed price contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To stimulate the government's conversion to performance-based service contracting, OFPP has developed a government-wide pilot project which relies on voluntary pledges by individual agencies to convert specified contracts for services to performance-based contracting methods. Agencies will be encouraged to limit their pledged contracts to recurring requirements to facilitate before and after measurement and assessment of results. Agencies will also be asked to consider breaking up large level-of-effort umbrella contracts in order to increase competition and convert to completion-type contracts where possible, thereby generating more innovation and cost effective proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency pledges are also expected to include: Endorsement of the project by the agency head; establishment of a high-level agency task force to oversee the effort; agreement to share lessons learned and best practices with other agencies; and measurement of the results of the project using predetermined project measurement criteria. The proposed project measurement criteria are: contract price; level of competition; number of contract audits; customer (project officer) satisfaction; length of procurement cycle; and small business participation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OFPP recognizes that performance-based service contracting will require cultural change and, therefore, must rely on the support and good faith efforts of both the agencies and the contracting community to be successful. Thus, to help ensure the success of this pilot project, OFPP will also ask contractors for their cooperation. Working with associations representing large numbers of service providers, OFPP is considering asking potential contractors to: endorse this project; assist OFPP in identifying requirements that are typically acquired on a cost reimbursement basis for the government but on a fixed price basis for commercial clients; identify obstacles in government service contracting that need to be overcome to implement performance-based contracting methods and/or preferred commercial contracting practices; and voluntarily refrain from bid protests and disputes related to procurements contained in the agency pledges. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> PUBLIC MEETING: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A public meeting will be held in the White House Conference Center, Eisenhower Room, 726 Jackson Place, Washington, DC 20503 at 2 p.m. on Thursday, June 16, 1994. Persons or organizations wishing to present ideas or suggestions about the pilot program or other specific actions that OFPP and other government agencies can take to increase the use of performance-based service contracting are encouraged to attend the meeting. Persons and organizations wishing to make oral statements will be given five minutes each to present their views. Persons wishing to attend and/or present statements at the public meeting should contact Ms. Margaret B. Davis at 202&hyph;395&hyph;6803 on or before June 9, 1994 in order to be placed on the agenda and to enable OFPP to adequately plan the meeting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ACTION> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and suggestions in response to this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  notice should be received at OFPP by close of business June 9, 1994.

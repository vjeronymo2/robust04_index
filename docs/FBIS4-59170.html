			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- Kurdish leaders Jalal  Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani have stressed to AL-HAYAH their  eagerness to implement the agreements between their parties, the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party,  especially an agreement they signed with the Unified Iraqi  National Congress on Sunday night/Monday morning. It stipulates  the speeding up of normalization in the areas that witnessed  clashes between fighters from the two parties in north Iraq.  The agreement also stipulates that the normalization process  should be completed in three days.    Barzani stressed the need to protect "our people's  democratic  experiment and unity and the Iraqi national opposition movement  and its future." Talabani, who will head for Kurdistan  accompanied by a number of the "National Congress," called for  "maximum efforts to restore stability and security to our  homeland."    A high-ranking official in the Congress has said that  "matters are normal and the agreement is complied with fully."  He pointed out that units belonging to the Congress are  deployed on the contact lines and at main facilities and  security barriers in the area. Kurdish administration sources  have stressed that calm has been restored in the area and that  the administration has managed to contain all the violations  that had taken place over the past two days.    In the same context the Iraqi opposition official criticized  "Iranian exaggerations" about the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan.  And officials from the two main Kurdish parties, in statements  to AL-HAYAH, accused Tehran of seeking to "foment sedition."  They denied a report attributed by AFP to the official Iranian  News Agency, namely that a "senior official" from the Kurdistan  Democratic Party said that 2,800 people have been killed in the  fighting in north Iraq.

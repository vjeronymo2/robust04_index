Lomonosov; UDC543.257.1]    [Abstract] Plasticized electrodes having a membrane  containing a neutral carrier (crown-ester, as a rule) are being  used more frequently for the potentiometric determination of  amines. These electrodes are selective and have useful  operational features. The mechanism of their functioning  includes a ``guest-host'' complex formation stage, where the  protonated amine cation becomes bound to the carrier molecule  with hydrogen bonds and ion-dipole interaction. It may be  supposed that macrocyclic polyesters are interchangeable with  ionophores having an open chain, particularly podands--compounds  in which the polyester chain has basic terminal groups  (phosphine oxides, for example) attached to it. These reagents,  similar to crown-esters, are capable of interacting with metals,  and possibly also with amines. The procedures for synthesizing  podands are more accessible than those of cyclic polyesters,  thereby facilitating structural variations in the search for the  most effective ionophore. The relative conformational lability  of non-cyclic molecules ensures satisfactory kinetic  characteristics of electrodes made from them. In the present  work podands having diphenylphosphine oxide terminal groups and  a lengthy polyester chain were synthesized and tested as  electrode-active materials. For comparison, a study was also  made of the properties of triphenylphosphine oxide, an analog of  an ``isolated terminal group'', and the classic crown-ester  dibenzo-18-crown-6. An ion selective electrode having a  plasticized membrane based on an acyclic polyester having  diphenylphosphine oxide terminal groups was developed and used  to determine octylammmonium ions in aqueous solutions. The basic  electrode characteristics were found to be a function of the  nature of the electrode active component of the membrane.  Ion-selective electrodes based on podands having three polyester  oxygen atoms had optimum properties. An electrode having an  o-nitrophenyloctyl ester as plasticizer manifested the longest  service life (about 3 months). A method was also developed for  the ionometric determination of octylammonium ions in model  solutions under stationary conditions and in a counter-current  mode.

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Entrepreneur with bottle - Nick Garnett on a manager who went solo HARRY DRNEC recently heard himself described on radio as a millionaire drinks man. 'I got a big kick out of that one. I'm broke, but happily so.' Drnec is an American, a big-company manager who turned his back on corporate life and bought his own company. His is a breed found more rarely among British executives whose entrepreneurial zeal seems to crumple in the corridors of corporate HQs. However, the route to wealth can be tortuous even for the brave. Drnec is a 46-year-old former pilot. He was European marketing director of Anheuser-Busch, the largest brewer in the US. In 1988 he fell out with the Busch family and left. 'I love London and wanted to stay here. I took a look at the jobs market. The best salary I could get was maybe Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 60,000 a year. I had been making Pounds 120,000. It's difficult to retrench. Beer was the only industry I knew.' Using borrowed money Drnec, whose family roots are Czech, paid Pounds 9m for a small drinks distributor, Maison Caurette, which already had a regional distribution agreement for Beck's and had begun distributing Sol and Michelob. Under Drnec sales have jumped from Pounds 16m to Pounds 50m. Maison Caurette makes a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3m and has a workforce of 155. But big borrowings weigh heavily on its new owners. 'I can't take a profit until there is an exit route for the other investors in the company. Maybe it will all come good in five to 10 years.' Maison Caurette is a study in company acquisition by borrowing and of running a smallish business in a fragmented industry in which, says Drnec, 'the level of jealousy is incredible.' His first piece of fortune was knowing an accountant and a solicitor prepared to work while deferring their fees for a year. The next was persuading the East End Jewish entrepreneurial owner of Maison Caurette to sell. 'It was a very difficult set of negotiations. It took between July 1988 and November 1989. He was one of the toughest negotiators you could ever meet.' Granville, a merchant bank, fed in Pounds 2.5m of equity and Security Pacific of the US provided Pounds 6.5m debt cover. 'That was the only organisation we could find operating in the UK that would look at shareholding stock as collateral.' Since the purchase, Pounds 1m of funding has been pumped in, Security Pacific has dropped out and Midland Montagu and Bank of Scotland have together committed Pounds 9.5m. Drnec chipped in just Pounds 100,000 of borrowed money and got 32 per cent of the company's shares. 'My shares were effectively given to me. The deal was that my shareholding would fall to 22 per cent if I failed to meet targets of a Pounds 1m profit in the first year to a Pounds 3m profit in the third year.' One weakness of the purchase was that Drnec went in partly blind. 'I had only been on the premises twice.' The company operated from an archway in London's Waterloo station. 'There was one door in and out through which we were shipping 3,000 cases a day and bringing in a similar number. The roof leaked when it rained heavily and you could only stack one pallet high.' The following year the company moved to a bigger, 60,000 sq ft site in Bermondsey at Pounds 6 a sq ft yearly rent. The computer system was replaced for Pounds 50,000 and credit days reduced from 90 days - 'that was horrific'  -to 62 days. Maison Caurette has tripled sales in four years. One reason is the growth of so-called premium imported lagers, sometimes called 'designer' beers, to the annoyance of the trade. Drnec has added a number of imported beers, including Miller Genuine Draught, the Finnish lager Kulta, 'that's my favourite', as well as Chilean wine. Beer accounts for 60 per cent of sales. Another source of growth was the effort to spread sales beyond the circle of the M25 motorway. 'We now sell something to every major supermarket multiple in Britain and every national cash and carry, as well as to 32 of the top 35 brewers and 197 wholesalers.' The company aims to secure distribution rights for more imported brands and make a bottom line return of 7 or 8 per cent. 'If a distributor is making more than that, he is either incredibly efficient or is taking the piss out of the consumer'. Drnec has found a few things difficult to absorb. One is his inability to establish profitable working relations with wholesalers. 'It's been almost impossible to use other wholesalers in a successful way. They are not into brand building. They are more into business breaking. We'll sell to a wholesaler in Birmingham and he'll try and sell at 35p less back to our own customers in London. These parallel sales are outrageous. It is very unpleasant. We are still stuffed on this, so we are looking now to purchase wholesalers or set up joint ventures with them, with the idea of having eight or 10 depots around the country. We have to buy distribution.' Another problem is the drinks dealers in continental Europe shipping in crates of lager outside agreed distribution channels and undercutting prices. Brewers produce a case (24 bottles) of Sol for Pounds 4 to Pounds 5. On top of that are shipping costs, import duty of 24 per cent, the Pounds 2 per case Drnec says he spends on marketing and the gross margin of about 18 per cent Maison Caurette takes. 'But then you get some guy on the Continent with just a phone and a dog and no overheads. He gets hold of a supply of Sol, maybe from an Italian wholesaler. I sell a case of Sol for Pounds 14.25. The other guy sells for Pounds 12 a case to a cash and carry and the cash and carry might sell that at Pounds 12.50 a case. Meanwhile the brewery I sell to passes it on to a wine bar for Pounds 17.50 or Pounds 18. This makes everybody look like a dickhead.' Drnec is also irritated by north American beers - like some types of Coors and Molson - brewed under licence in the UK but sold at close to import prices. 'It costs Pounds 1.10 to ship a case across the ocean and import duty adds perhaps Pounds 1.60, so where does the Pounds 2.70 go in the price? Some companies are screwing up a free lunch.' Like many American managers, Drnec is energetic, open and a little showy. He tests products on visitors (in my case, peach-flavoured iced tea). He has a simple ethos in an industry where so many take a piece of the profit. 'You should get a fair return for hard work. Never look at what the other guy gets. Are you happy with what you get? That's what you should ask yourself.' Maison Caurette, 1 Lamb Walk, London SE1 3TT. Tel: 071-403-9191</p>

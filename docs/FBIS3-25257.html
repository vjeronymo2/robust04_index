This has been stated in Cape Town at the International  Conference on Nuclear Policy by the president of the  Washington-based Institute for Science and International  Security, Mr. David Albright. The chief executive of the Atomic  Energy Corporation, Dr. Stumpf, told delegates that even the  most sophisticated instruments had not been able to detect a  nuclear explosion, and that it was clear that South Africa had  not been involved.    Mr. Roger Jardin of the ANC [African National Congress] said  information would probably emerge soon to show that South Africa  had collaborated with Israel in the alleged nuclear test.</p>

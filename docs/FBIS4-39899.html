			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Sergey </F> Feoktistov]    [Text] Istanbul June 10 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev has called on the international community to help  Russia in its peace-making on territory of the former Soviet  Union by sending observers and rendering material support at the  current session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. In  his words, Russia is carrying an increasing peace-making burden  in former Soviet republics.    Closer interaction of the council with European neutral  states, which are experienced in peace-making, would help to  increase the collective peace-making potential, said the  minister.    Kozyrev urged the need for closer cooperation of CSCE and  the  council in peace-keeping operations as it is envisaged by the  council's plan for 1994, and suggested to form a corresponding  joint working group.    The Russian concept of European partnership provides for  coordination of military, political and peace-making interaction  by the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the leading role  of CSCE, Kozyrev told the council's session. In his opinion,  the council can and must gradually transform into an independent  body to be based on equality of all participants and not on the  scheme of "NATO plus partners".    Kozyrev called for the involvement of a large number of CSCE  members in the council activities, permanent contacts between  the two organizations and the use of the council's abilities in  the implementation of the Partnership for Peace program.    Russia is striving for deepened partnership with NATO  without  mutual vetoes and "surprises", Kozyrev told the council. "The  Partnership for Peace program is starting. We plan to come to  Brussels to boost a program of deepened cooperation between  Russia and NATO, including a framework document, as soon as the  NATO headquarters finalize the preparations," said Kozyrev.</p>

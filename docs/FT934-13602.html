			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Tory MPs urge pension rise to cover fuel tax SIX TORY backbenchers yesterday signed a Commons motion calling for pensions to be raised to cover the cost of value added tax when it is imposed on domestic fuel. The move will increase pressure on ministers to devise an effective compensation package. The motion - signed by MPs from across the political spectrum - expressed concern that linking compensation to income-related benefits would not help pensioners with incomes just above the qualifying limit. It predicted that 'hundreds of thousands of pensioners' who missed out on benefits would have real difficulty meeting the extra cost of fuel once VAT was levied. Early-day motions are not normally put to a Commons vote. But this indication of the strength of backbench discontent will come as a blow to government business managers struggling with a Commons majority of only 17. The move came as pensioners staged a rally to protest against plans to charge the full rate of VAT on fuel from 1995. The six Tory signatories were Mr Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown, Mr Peter Fry (Wellingborough), Mr William Powell (Corby), Mr Tim Rathbone (Lewes), Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) and Mr Geoffrey Dickens (Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth). Mr Powell said there were now enough Tory rebels to defeat the government on the issue. The government intends to outline what help it will give those hardest hit next month, when it announces its plans on uprating benefits. Ministers have said there will be additional compensation for poorer people beyond the automatic impact of the price increase on the uprating formula. But they have had great difficulty devising a package to help those who just miss eligibility for income-related benefits without incurring unacceptable costs. This is seen as the key to making the new tax more generally acceptable. Earlier this year, the government's social security advisory committee estimated that compensating about 8m people for fuel bills carrying the full rate of VAT would cost about Pounds 720m. According to Labour, the cost for the average family of paying the tax at 17.5 per cent would be about Pounds 2 a week. An across-the-board Pounds 2 a week increase in the basic pension would cost some Pounds 1bn.</p>

The Iraqis said that the dead escort, who held the rank of  captain, came from Tikrit, Saddam's birthplace.    The Iraqi president (last summer) himself shot and killed  his  escort Mu'ayyad al-'Ayyash because he had informed an Iraqi  family of a secret place in southern Baghdad in which Saddam was  present. Al-'Ayyash, too, came from Tikrit and had family ties  with the president.    The Iraqis who spoke about the new attempt believe that it  occurred less than a month ago just outside Baghdad and that a  quick reshuffle was made immediately in the protection teams  assigned to guard the Iraqi president.    The most recent report leaked from Baghdad spoke about the  blowing up of an agricultural tractor on a road through which  the Iraqi president's motorcade passed on its way to one of his  bunkers outside the capital. At the time suspicion revolved  around the president's escorts and senior leaders, who were the  only ones who had known that the president's motorcade would use  this country road.</p>

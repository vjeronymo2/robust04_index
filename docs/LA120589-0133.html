			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L  </P> <P> Cranston should be indicted for stupidity rather than for ethics. He's being  neither better nor worse than most of those in "public" service. If he had any  brains at all, he'd have gone to Japan where he could have made a couple of  speeches telling them how great they are and touting more great deals in  California real estate. In exchange he could have received fees that would make  Charlie Keating look like a penny-pinching piker.  </P> <P> Many congressmen, who have put their own interests before those of the nation,  now want more money for services they never rendered. There are millions of men  and women who would be quite happy to serve us honorably and efficiently for  the bucks and perks these jerks find so inadequate. Isn't it time we got rid of  the deadwood? If you are as angry as I am, stop griping and vote!  </P> <P> ED WOLKENFELD  </P> <P> Panorama City  </P></p>

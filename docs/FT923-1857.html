			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Arts: Geraint Evans - Obituary The Welsh baritone Geraint Evans died in hospital at the weekend following a heart attack. He was 70. A favourite of audiences at Covent Garden for more than 35 years, he will be remembered primarily for the comic roles in which he displayed such a strong and endearing personality. Yet his career embraced a wide range of achievements that put him in the forefront of the British singers who went out to win international reputations after the war. Evans was born in Pontypridd on 16 February 1922. He began singing in amateur events and after war service in the RAF was thought sufficiently talented to pursue a singing career. In 1948 he made his debut with the Covent Garden Company as the Nightwatchman in Die Meistersinger, the beginning of a happy association that was to last until his retirement from the stage in l984. All his major roles were heard at the house. In the 1960s and 70s it was difficult to imagine a Mozart opera there without him: Figaro and Leporello both showed his natural ability for communicating with an audience, though he preferred to avoid Papageno in Die Zauberflote, whom he described with his typically down-to-earth Welsh sense of humour as a 'cheeky little chappie'. Among other comic roles he was highly regarded as Don Pasquale and Verdi's Falstaff. Although by voice alone he might not have been thought suitable for many of the leading tragic baritone roles, a strong sense of how to make a character come alive resulted in some powerful portrayals: the title role in Berg's Wozzeck, above all, though he also took part in the premieres of Britten's Billy Budd and Gloriana and Walton's Troilus and Cressida. Only the vocal demands of Rigoletto defeated him and he knew when to leave well alone. At a time when British singers were just starting to make an impact internationally, Evans led the way. From 1962 he sang regularly at the Salzburg Festival, as Figaro, Leporello and Wozzeck. In the US there were guest appearances at the Metropolitan Opera in New York from 1964 and at San Francisco, where he also tried his hand as a producer in the mid-1970s. His popularity extended beyond the usual operatic circles and he became a familiar face on television. He was knighted in 1971. Recordings exist of his major roles, including Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger under Von Karajan and Falstaff under Solti; but few are able to recapture the personality that made him so beloved of audiences when he appeared on stage.</p>

In an  operation called "Canaveral" which took place at 1330 on 18  March, the FELCN found the laboratory located 5 km in a straight  line west from Viru Viru Airport, near the Sanchez valley. The  FELCN could not, however, arrest any of those who had been  processing the drugs until a few minutes before the operation.  The laboratory had the capacity of processing some 300 kg of  cocaine per week with a degree of purity that is not common in  our country.    The FELCN had been informed that a cocaine shipment had left  the laboratory to be sent to Brazil. The FELCN agents  nevertheless found more than 500 kg of cocaine in various  processing stages at the site. According to experts, the drugs  were being processed in accordance with severe norms aimed at  obtaining an ideal substance for export. The laboratory was  inside a nearly 20 hectare farm planted mostly with sugarcane.  The La Belgica sugar mill is 15 km from this laboratory.    FELCN District Commander Colonel Hector Frias Cardozo did  not  reveal the names of those arrested because of this operation,  but it has been unofficially reported that at least four  suspects have been identified. A second stage of this operation  is still being conducted at the capital of Santa Cruz  Department, to identify the owner of the farm and those who are  involved in the illegal activity. Apparently the laboratory has  been operating at the site for at least one year. [passage  omitted]    Together with the drugs, the FELCN agents burned 90 liters  of  ammonia, 13 kg potassium permanganate, two kg caustic soda, 200  kg calcium chloride, 175 liters of sulphuric ether, 50 liters of  sulphuric acid, seven kg manitol, and 400 liters of acetone.

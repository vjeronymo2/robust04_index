Governor Zhu Senlin and the  provincial deputy party secretary addressed the meeting.    Zhu said: Government work is closely connected with united  front work. Government policies and principles are formulated  through united front work by widely soliciting the opinions of  people in various circles and all democratic parties, and  policies and principles are implemented through democratic  consultations. Therefore, leaders at all levels should pay full  attention to united front work.    Provincial Deputy Party Secretary Zhang Guoying summed up  the  meeting. She stressed: In strengthening and upholding the  united front work, three points must be ensured. The first is  to make a success of propaganda and education so as to ensure  that everyone understands its importance. All party and cadre  schools should understand the central authorities' policy on the  united front work. The second is to ensure the implementation of  policies and principles, to cope with changes in the situation,  and to raise our consciousness in implementing the party's  united front work policy. The third is [words indistinct] to  ensure the implementation of specific measures, to strengthen  the united front work contingent, and to maintain its stability.</p>

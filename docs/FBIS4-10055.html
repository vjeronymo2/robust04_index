			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Demetrio Sodi de la Tijera, member of the  Legislative Assembly for the Federal District, explains that his  departure from the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] is  because he does not agree with the way his party's new  presidential candidate was elected.    [Begin Sodi de la Tijera recording] I am leaving because of  the way the new candidate was chosen. As far as the candidate  is concerned, I have no rapport with nor do I believe he has the  experience to become president of the republic. It would not be  compatible to belong to a party and not agree with the candidate  or the aspiring candidates. This is why I decided to resign.  [end recording]    It is expected that tomorrow, Thursday [as heard], he will  make his departure from the PRI official. Meanwhile, Rene  Bejaranom, Democratic Revolutionary Party leader in Mexico City,  said his party would be willing to offer a Senate candidacy for  the Federal District to Demetrio Sodi de la Tijera.</p>

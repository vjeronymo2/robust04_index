			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Not so crazy about it either Sir, My sincere thanks to Malcolm Rutherford, who has restored my faith in drama critics. He alone was not caught by the hype surrounding the opening of Crazy for You, and gave the only honest review I have read of this lamentable show which, for some strange reason, seems to be receiving considerable backing from Radio 2. Is this really the purpose of Britain's national radio station? Peter J Timmons, Wealden House, Brightling, Robertsbridge, E Sussex TN32 5HJ</p>

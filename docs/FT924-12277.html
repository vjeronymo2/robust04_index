			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (10): The open-door policy continues - Spain is no longer cheap, nor is the future for large investments clear FOR A SMALL army of big international corporations Spain was the business location during the past decade. On the back of entry into the European Community midway through the 1980s Spain hung a 'come in, look around and buy' notice on its frontiers and there was no shortage of customers. Basing itself on 1988 figures, the economy ministry estimated last year that 50 per cent of Spain's industrial capacity was in foreign hands. The present figure is considerably higher because foreign acquisitions of domestic business climbed steeply in the past two years. The latest corporation to move into Spain has been the Mexican cement group Cemex which in summer bought two local companies and became the dominant domestic producer. Cemex singled out Spain for its investment to establish a European bridgehead. Highlights of the buy-up of Spain include British Petroleum's outright acquisition last year of the domestic refinery and distributor Petromed, a move that bought it some 10 per cent of Spain's petrol retail outlets, and the 1990 acquisition by Guinness of Cruzcampo which earned the UK drinks group around 25 per cent of Spain's brewing market. In the 1980s, General Motors opened a large manufacturing plant near Zaragoza and Volkswagen acquired the state-owned Seat group, the largest domestic car producer. In both cases the investments were geared to the export market and together they helped establish Spain as the third-ranked car producer in Europe. Such developments consolidated a foreign presence that stretches across the board. The domestic car sector is now foreign-owned and foreign companies own some 75 per cent of the large components and accessories business that has been built up around it. Foreign interests control eight of the top 10 domestic companies in the chemical sector, an industry which accounts for 12 per cent of Spain's exports and 8 per cent of its GDP, and as much as 18 per cent of the food producing business is controlled by non-Spaniards. Even the exclusive, and highly protectionist, banking sector has been penetrated, for more than 16 per cent of the total shareholding of the top six banks is estimated to be in foreign hands. The reasons for locating and investing in Spain came under three main headings. Foreign business was alternatively attracted by cheap labour costs, by the strength of the internal market and by the strategic possibilities, vis-a-vis Europe, Latin America or North Africa, that Spain represented. All such reasons require reassessment. Spain is no longer cheap, nor is it expanding and nor is the future for large cross-border strategic investments as clear as it once was. Average industrial wages in Spain stood at 62 per cent of the average of Germany, France and the UK in 1985 but had risen to 74 per cent in 1990. Those in Portugal, by comparison, changed from 21 per cent to just 22 per cent against the same average over the period. The buoyancy of the internal market has stopped short in its tracks. The growth of domestic consumption which grew at close to 6 per cent in the late 1980s was halved with the onset of the 1990s. Spain with a forecast GDP of 0.7 per cent next year is living in a pre-recessionary environment. The currency turmoil that overtook Europe in September has meanwhile made a strong impact on Spain and may leave scars that will take time to heal. A devaluation, followed by the temporary introduction of exchange controls and continued pressure on the peseta, created an alarming picture for multinational finance directors. Yet, however much the furniture may have been rearranged, Spain remains an important location for multinational business as, indeed, it could not fail to be after the massive inflow of investments in the past years. The likelihood is that the foreigners will continue coming. Long-terms players looking at Spain in the context of a global recovery take into account the following features: The domestic political stability under the leadership of prime minister Felipe Gonzalez together with the determination by the government to correct spending overshoots and restore budgetary imbalances. The large public investment in infrastructure, much of it linked to the Barcelona Olympic games and to Seville's Ezpo '92 world fair, and the existence of generous subsidies across huge swathes of Spain that are classified as underdeveloped in EC terms. The onset of wage moderation, decreasing union militancy and greater flexibility in the labour market. Foreign players who have seen the domestic market grow so strongly in the very recent past also know that whole sectors of Spanish business remain fragmented and offer interesting investment opportunities. Much of Spanish business, moreover, is at rock bottom prices.</p>

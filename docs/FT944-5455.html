			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Indonesian groups reveal swaps deficit Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia, Indonesia's two largest paper and pulp manufacturers, admitted they lost USDollars 47.5m in derivatives trading. The companies join a string of international companies, including Procter &amp; Gamble which have reported multi-million dollar losses on derivatives this year. Yesterday's announcement is a reminder that derivatives risk extends to the developing world where financial markets are often less effectively regulated. The Jakarta stock exchange said Sinar Mas, the holding company for the two companies, will absorb the losses so that reported earnings will be unaffected. Sinar Mas is Indonesia's second largest conglomerate with interests in banking, property and plantations as well as paper. The two companies suffered the losses from leveraged swaps with variable interest rates taken out before the US Federal Reserve started tightening its monetary policy in February. The statement from the Jakarta stock exchange said the companies blamed their losses on rising interest rates in the US. Tjiwi Kimia and Indah Kiat were forced to report the losses after details of the transactions were revealed in local press reports, but brokers in Jakarta said they had been aware that the two companies were trading actively in the derivatives market. The news is likely to dampen investors' enthusiasm for the stock. 'This is only one of the cases which has been reported,' said a broker at a British securities firm in Jakarta. 'My question is, if Sinar Mas wants to trade in derivatives why do they use their listed companies to do it.' Indonesia's central bank is working with its counterparts elsewhere in the south-east Asian region to get a grip on the derivatives market. However, there are no plans to introduce regulations. The Sinar Mas group is owned by the Eka Tjipta Widjaja family, one of Indonesia's wealthiest. They are a majority shareholder in Bank Internasional Indonesia, which ranks as the country's largest listed bank in terms of profits. Indah Kiat lost USDollars 35m in the derivatives market and Tjiwi Kimia lost USDollars 12.5m. Indah Kiat recently reported that its net profit for the nine months ended September 30 this year totalled Rp131.57bn (Dollars 61m), compared with Rp62.86bn, a year earlier. Tjiwi Kimia's net profit for the same period rose to Rp78.10bn from Rp57.12bn the previous year.</p>

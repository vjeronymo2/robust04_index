			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Court to rule on stalling of Maxwell probe Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the largest accountancy firm, has been granted leave to go to the courts in an effort to stall a wide-ranging professional investigation into its audit of the Maxwell business empire. If the ruling goes in the firm's favour it would be seen as a serious blow to self-regulation of professional bodies. The action follows the launch in May last year by the Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the profession's most senior regulatory body, of an investigation into pensions and related transactions within the Maxwell companies. The attempt has been triggered by a precedent-setting judgment in April which allowed Price Waterhouse to stall an investigation by the regulator of PW's audit of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The ruling - which was argued on the grounds that the BCCI case was highly unusual and complex - meant that no inquiry could take place until civil and criminal actions relating to the bank and its auditors were complete. This is unlikely until the next century. The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, which is operated by the UK's chartered and certified accountancy bodies, only investigates matters of the most serious public interest. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that it had formally requested suspension of the inquiry in February 'on the basis that any such inquiry could be prejudicial to justice'. After the regulator refused this demand in March, Coopers formally requested a review last month. It confirmed yesterday that it had been granted leave to seek judicial review by Mr Justice Latham. No date has been set for a hearing although it is expected to take place relatively soon. A number of professional firms - both in accountancy and in other sectors - have been reviewing the Price Waterhouse judgment in detail and considering attempts to use similar stalling tactics. Regulators had been expecting other firms to test the judgment more broadly, and some are believed to welcome the chance to test its limits. The regulator's case has not been helped because it has in the past delayed the launch of several investigations. In the case of Polly Peck International, it waited until this May, more than three years after the collapse of the company, before launching its investigation.</p>

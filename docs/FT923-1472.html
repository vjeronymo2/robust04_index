			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Training obligation for jobless ruled out THE GOVERNMENT has rej-ected as too costly the introduction this autumn of a US-style Workfare programme under which long-term unemployed would lose benefits unless they took up training or community service. The viability of such a policy has been investigated over the summer by the Department of Employment in response to widespread calls in the Tory party as the number of long-term jobless has continued to rise. Such a strategy is not ruled out completely but implementation in the short term is considered too difficult because of the multiplicity of schemes that would be required. Instead, to save money and focus on the problem of the long-term unemployed, the Treasury wants entry to Employment Training - the main training programme - to be more tightly restricted to people who have been unemployed for more than six months. In a confidential document sent by the Department of Employment to Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which administer training schemes, the government has detailed funding arrangements to achieve this. The Department of Employment is currently reviewing the whole area of state provision for the adult unemployed in consultation with a number of other government departments, including the Treasury, as well as the Tecs. The government is considering merging ET with Employment Action, the work experience scheme for the longer-term jobless which has had a lower-than-expected take-up. To give Tecs some discretion over how they administer the programme, Mr John Lambert, director of the operations division at the Department of Employment, wrote in the document sent to the councils: 'It is agreed that training in a merged scheme would not be mandatory.' Mr Lambert said the government wanted ET confined to those unemployed for six months or more. Such a time-limit would adversely affect women returning to the labour market after having a family, short-term unemployed, disabled people and victims of large-scale redundancies. Currently these groups are exempt from the six-month restriction and make up about 30 per cent of participants on the training programme. Tecs, in a submission to the review last week, said these groups should retain their eligibility for ET.</p>

			<p>on   Envoys' Visit to Kashmir  <H4>  Iranian Ambassador's Statement </H4>  <F P=102> 94AS0287B Madras THE HINDU in English 5 May 94 p 13 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0287B </F> <F P=104>  Madras THE HINDU </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by F.J. Khergamvala] </F>   [Text] Manama (Bahrain), May 4.    Iran's Ambassador in India has issued a statement which is  an  indictment of New Delhi for its conduct of the mission of  diplomats in New Delhi to Jammu and Kashmir [J &amp; K]. It  accuses  India of "misleading the diplomatic group" and not "fulfilling  the terms under which these envoys were taken to J &amp; K."    Radio Teheran broadcast the text of a statement issued by  the  Iranian News Agency on Monday, May 2. The Ambassador, Mr. Raza  Sheikhattar seems to have given his statement immediately after  the return to New Delhi of the 11 diplomats who had visited J  &amp;  K. After initial reluctance he had joined this mission. As would  be seen from the text, it is extremely unusual for a diplomat  stationed in another country to use such strong words publicly  against the Government to which he is accredited. In India, at  the very least the move should come as a considerable  embarrassment to policy planners and other observers who have  maintained the pretence, since the Human Rights meeting in  Geneva, that Teheran's neutrality tilts towards India and that  bilateral ties are all hunky-dory.    "The itinerary of the eight Muslim and three Latin American  countries diplomats never materialised," said the envoy. "Since  I was promised that I could meet anyone I asked and go anywhere  I desired and even hire taxis if I wanted to and in  consideration of the Indian Government's policies of clarifying  the situation in J &amp; K, I accepted the offer to go there. The  Government of India had also promised to arrange the meeting  between the delegation (of envoys) and leaders of the Hurriyat  Conference. This was written in our itinerary, unfortunately it  did not happen. The Government of India under the pretext of  security problems and despite the fact that the Hurriyat  Conference had guaranteed our security, refused to agree with  the meeting place proposed by the Hurriyat Conference," the  statement added.  <H5>  No Official Reaction </H5>   In India, actions of powers above the Ministry of External  Affairs [MEA] and some in the MEA have led Iran to believe that  Teheran being India's only rescue act in the Islamic world, New  Delhi must do its bidding. It is perhaps not too well known that  the Indian Ambassador in Teheran is being prematurely  transferred, at the behest of Teheran, for allegedly ruffling  some feathers. However, nothing that he is known to have said or  done that compares with the public censure issued by the Iranian  Ambassador in New Delhi. In terms of content, it is not known if  others in the diplomatic group share his views but it is most  unlikely they would issue public reports. Extraordinarily, in  contrast to what may have transpired if the Pakistani Ambassador  had said this, the Indian spokesman has not reacted at all to  the Iranian envoy's statement. Objectively, it seems difficult  to believe that the envoy would continue to enjoy confidence in  the MEA, especially when one reads what he said further.    His statement added: "The diplomats wanted to meet with  ordinary people but the Government officials decided that this  was not possible in circumstances of a strike called by the  Hurriyat Conference. The envoys' request to travel to Sopore and  Bijbehara (the scene of last October's massacre) was rejected on  security grounds. Although the provincial authorities had  earlier agreed to the delegation meeting with representatives of  the Srinagar people who had sustained damages, this was later  cancelled and the reason given for it was that the Srinagar  representatives were not too keen on holding the scheduled  meeting. We could not pay a visit to the Hazratbal shrine  either. When complaints were made to provincial authorities  about the fact that facilities similar to the ones provided to  the visiting delegations in the past were not being offered at  this time, the envoys were told that people had protested after  such visits and the Government was trying to avoid further  unrest. Visiting diplomats were instead taken to the Dal Lake  area and were provided binoculars to be able to see the shrine  from a distance."  <H5>  Visit Incomplete </H5>   In conclusion, the statement attributed to Mr. Sheikhattar  says "the Srinagar visit has been incomplete and the aim of  clarifying the situation in Kashmir is yet to be achieved. In  Delhi we were told that the situation in Kashmir had improved  and we had hoped to visit large areas of the State. The  situation is totally upside down. We hope the Government would  in future provide suitable facilities for diplomats and fulfil  its promises about clarification of the situation in the region."    Some may now question the whole idea of arranging diplomatic  transparency in J &amp; K, but Indian diplomats, reacting to the  Iranian view say it has been a good move and there is no need to  throw out the baby with the bathwater. As for the envoy's  intentions, one purpose would be to enhance its standing in  Islamabad and with the Hurriyat Conference, the ascendant group  in J &amp; K or with one of its factions. No doubt, such remarks  would never have been possible had it not been for India itself  making Iran feel it can play the key umpire's role. In any event  the statement issued -- and neither reported in India nor  responded to officially -- is inconsistent with the official  level pretence about the state of relations.</p>

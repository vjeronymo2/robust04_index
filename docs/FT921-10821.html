			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Management: How to bring the accounts to book Explaining accountancy to the businessman or woman without a financial background can be a thankless task. However motivated they are to make profits, few are interested in the detail of how the numbers add up. Despite the difficulty of the challenge, there appears to be no shortage of writers, not all of them accountants, keen to penetrate the mysteries of the accountancy trade for the benefit of the non-financial reader. Accounting for Non-Accountants: A Manual for Managers and Students by Graham Mott (Kogan Page, 230 pages, Pounds 8.99) takes, as its sub-title suggests, a text book approach to the subject. Mott, a retired lecturer in financial management, plunges his reader more quickly into the complexities of financial records than the beginner would wish. It is not immediately obvious why the non-accountant needs to be told about cost codes as early as page 12 when other more fundamental features of understanding accounts have yet to be tackled. Explanations are sometimes laboured with double entry bookkeeping initially described, not particularly helpfully, as having two aspects, a giving and a receiving aspect. This heaviness of style and a tendency to present unduly lengthy sets of specimen accounts make this manual more appropriate for a classroom setting than for the manager struggling at home to improve on his accounting knowledge. There are, however, helpful test questions at the end of each chapter and a comprehensive glossary. How to Master Finance: A No-Nonsense Guide to Understanding Business Accounts by Terry Gasking (Business Books, 226 pages, Pounds 9.99) adopts a brisker, more popular style. Gasking begins by drawing up a personal balance sheet before moving on to business accounts. Some readers may find this approach too simplistic; others may welcome a writer who really gets down to basics. This guide does, for the most part, live up to its claim to provide a jargon-free explanation of how profit and loss accounts and balance sheets are prepared. The chapter on cashflow management provides a clear explanation of an area of considerable importance in a recession. Understand Your Accounts: A Guide to Small Business Finance by A. St John Price (Kogan Page, 260 pages, Pounds 9.99) devotes even more space to the question of cash management alongside explanations of the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. As the title suggests, this book sets out to do more than just introduce the layman to the complexities of drawing up accounts. It takes in a broad range of financial issues relating to the management of the small business, including how to persuade customers to pay their bills more quickly and how to price products for sale. The author provides a straightforward guide to the main financial and accountancy issues that confront the small business owner, although the reader who simply wants to understand accounts might find some of its sections superfluous to his or her needs. Understanding Company Accounts by Bob Rothenberg and John Newman (Kogan Page, 162 pages, Pounds 9.99) wins no prizes for originality of presentation but works methodically through the basic principles of accounting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and funds flow statements. Where this book excels is in the clarity of its style which succeeds in opening up the conventions of the accountancy profession to the non-specialist reader. It is particularly good at explaining the implications of the numbers that appear in a business's accounts as well as the formulas by which they are calculated. Rothenberg and Newman, both accountants, manage to tread the fine line between patronising the non-accountant and assuming too much knowledge. The present recession has exposed the weakness of many companies, large and small, in financial management. Too many small firms are content to leave the details of their finances to their accountant - sometimes with disastrous results. Business owners need to understand the numbers themselves if they are to be in full control of their affairs. Even a fairly basic understanding of the basis on which accounts are prepared will serve to keep the accountant on his toes.</p>

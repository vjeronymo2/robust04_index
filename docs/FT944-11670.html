			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Peugeot sales up 14.2% after nine months Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, reported group turnover up 14.2 per cent to FFr121.7bn (Dollars 23.8bn) in the nine months to September 30, compared with the same period last year, reports Andrew Jack in Paris. The increase came in spite of a slower rise in demand for cars in western Europe during the third quarter - up 3.3 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent in the first quarter. Outside this region, there was a third-quarter increase of 6.4 per cent, or 59,750 vehicles. This was in spite of problems with finance in China and Iran, although there was progressive growth in regions such as Latin America and Asia. Total vehicle sales in the third quarter rose by 10 per cent, boosting the total figure for the first three quarters to 1.46m. In addition, the group reported a 37 per cent increase in its mechanical and servicing activities to FFr5.8bn for the first nine months.</p>

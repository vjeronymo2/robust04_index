			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARGUMENTS AGAINST COVERED RESERVOIRS  </P> <P> The resounding no at the Feb. 6 Westside hearing at Paul Revere Junior High  School, on the Department of Water and Power's plan to cover the city's 10  remaining open reservoirs, will most likely have little impact on the DWP's  commission.  </P> <P> They seem determined to spend the $500 million to $1 billion to hide the beauty  of sparkling water "lakes" in our hills and canyons, even though two years ago  a similar proposal was turned down for the same reasons.  </P> <P> The findings and tests did not prove that "bird droppings, animals drinking the  water, sunlight and air pollutants" endanger our drinking water supply.  </P> <P> What is most disturbing about this latest push to cover open reservoirs is the  all-out public relations campaign to sell the program with ads and direct  mailings. The unanswered question is how to make the DWP commission more  responsive to the public's need. We all want health safeguards and better  water. Covers for open reservoirs (are no substitute) for new water lines,  greater cleansing at filter plants, more home filters and better disposal of  waste.  </P> <P> HYMAN H. HAVES  </P> <P> chairman, Palisades Highlands Home Owners Assn.  </P></p>

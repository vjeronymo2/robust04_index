			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> Milton Kagen was tired of dogs relieving themselves in his front yard in the  Hollywood Hills while the mutts' masters watched placidly. So he posted a sign  warning that his plants are sprayed with "dioxinleucomaine." And since then, he  adds, dog owners seem "to be getting the message."  </P> <P> Hold on a minute. Dioxinleucomaine? What's that? (Our computer spell-checker  nearly burst into flames.) "I made up the word," Kagen proudly admitted.  </P> <P> On 1st Street, not far from the Kosher Burrito stand, a handwritten menu in the  window of a Japanese restaurant bears the Star of David.  </P> <P> Yes, it could be another L.A. first:  </P> <P> Kosher sushi.  </P> <P> In our eternal search for truth we came upon an edition of Whole Life Times, a  sort of New Age magazine. An editorial directed toward men begins: "Dear Male  Energy Beings . . . " It carries accounts about such feats as accomplishing  "astral travel while your physical body sleeps" (no more worrying about airline  rates!). There's also a long profile of a local realtor. That's L.A.: astral  travel and property values.  </P> <P> Didn't do motorists any good to look back over their shoulders at this freeway  obstacle:  </P> <P> CHP officers closed the right two lanes of the San Diego Freeway north of  Sunset Boulevard Wednesday afternoon after a 15-foot-tall glass mirror fell to  the pavement.  </P> <P> The surfer as artiste:  </P> <P> You may have noticed the article in Wednesday's Calendar section about the  surfboard art festival that invades Santa Monica later this month. Artists,  many of whom ride the waves themselves, are decorating the boards to be sold at  a fund-raiser.  </P> <P> But it should be noted that surfers are also sailing into other cultural  waters. Just the other day, Waveslider Productions released "In a Blue Room,"  billed as the first recording made only by surfers.  </P> <P> Let's hope it doesn't give new meaning to the term wipe-out.  </P> <P> For those who would love to experience some of the thrills of surfing without  leaving their cars, there's always the old carwash-drive-through maneuver.  </P> <P> L.A. Festival-goers who fork over $15 to the Bonus Carwash in Santa Monica on  Sept. 15 will receive a cassette of pianist Sandra Tsing Loh's "Music for the  Bonus Carwash," which they can play while their car is being bathed.  </P> <P> Loh, who once serenaded rush-hour traffic on a piano in a parking lot off the  Harbor Freeway, terms her carwash recording "exhilarating, abysmal and  baptismal."  </P> <P> Hot wax is not included.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  miscelLAny:  </P> <P> With about 175,000 players a year, the Rancho Park Municipal Golf Course in  West L.A. is the busiest in the nation.  </P></p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE TESCO, the UK's second-largest grocery retailer, will be hoping to reassure the City with a healthy rise in full-year profits tomorrow. Its shares have been under pressure amid fears that its sales growth is lagging behind that of rivals J Sainsbury and Argyll, owners of Safeway. Most forecasts are clustered around Pounds 580m, compared with Pounds 545m last year, although some go up to Pounds 585m. Full year figures today for 1992 from MB-Caradon, the building products and security printing group, are expected to be in the region of Pounds 120m to Pounds 125m, against Pounds 106.4m in 1991. Lower interest charges, and a solid performance from the managed businesses are behind the expected rise. Interest will focus on how the group will reinvest the Pounds 473m proceeds of the sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, announced last Friday. TIP Europe, the trailer rental company, is expected to announce disappointing interim results tomorrow. The company's Mobiel subsidiary, which supplies temporary buildings in continental Europe, is understood to have run into bad management and planning problems. Analysts have downgraded forecast full year forecasts from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 6m, while interim profits are likely to be about Pounds 2.4m from Pounds 3m last time. The dividend is also in danger of being cut again. Sun Alliance Group, the composite insurer, is expected on Thursday to report a loss for 1992 of around Pounds 150m, a recovery from a loss of Pounds 466m a year-earlier. It is likely to maintain the dividend, though. Mirror Group Newspapers, buffeted by board room upheavals including the recent departure of Lord Hollick, is forecast to produce today pre-tax profits of between Pounds 27m and Pounds 33m (Pounds 47.3m) for 1992. First-half pre-tax profits today from Highland Distilleries, maker of Famous Grouse, will be boosted by the company's decision to equity account its 35.4 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky blender. Analysts expect the underlying pre-tax figure, however, to reflect pressures on volume sales and prices of new and mature whisky. Forecasts suggest the outcome will be between Pounds 13.5m and Pounds 14m, 5 to 8 per cent below last year's Pounds 14.7m.

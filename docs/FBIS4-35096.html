			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 27 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- A group of 23 former  Nicaraguan "contras" today sparked a new crisis for the  government of Violeta Chamorro, after a group led by a disabled  former contra occupied the headquarters of the International  Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS [CIAV-OAS] and  another group sought asylum in the Colombian Embassy.    The 15 former Nicaraguan "contras" occupying the CIAV-OAS  are  led by Leonardo Zeledon, a paraplegic known by the alias of  "Comandante Chispero," a spokesperson for the Government  Ministry announced today. The CIAV-OAS headquarters, which was  occupied by the former "contras," is near the Government  Ministry building. The CIAV personnel, whose number was not  disclosed, continue to be held there this afternoon. CIAV  Coordinator Sergio Caramagna, who entered the building to speak  to the occupiers, is inside the building.    For their part, another group of seven former "contras"  peacefully entered the Colombian Embassy in this capital to  request political asylum because they fear for their lives. The  group that sought refuge in the Colombian Embassy is led by Luis  Arguello Montiel, alias "002," the Government Ministry source  stated.    Neither the group that occupied the CIAV headquarters nor  the  group that sought refuge in the Colombian Embassy have explained  their demands or why they fear for their lives. "Comandante  Chispero," at the insistence of newsmen, said that it will not  be until tomorrow, Wednesday, that they will publicly state  their demands to the Chamorro government.    Managua Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo told the media that  if the conflicting sides accept he would be willing to serve as  mediator to resolve the crisis.    At the beginning of June, a group of 23 disarmed former  Sandinist soldiers occupied for several hours the Venezuelan  Embassy in this capital, to demand from the Violeta Chamorro  government an indemnity payment for years of service to the  Government Ministry. Practically simultaneously, another group  of retired Sandinist military on 7 June occupied the Managua  Cathedral for the third time since the church was dedicated in  September to reinforce their struggle for indemnity payments.    Both episodes of violence in Nicaragua concluded after Vilma  Nunez, director of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center and  Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, Vicar general of the Managua  Archdiocese, served as mediators.    Several weeks ago former Sandinist soldiers occupied the  Italian Embassy in Managua and the OAS building, to draw the  government's attention to their claims.</p>

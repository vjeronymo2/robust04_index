			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's long haul THE SLOW recovery may have won Mr Clinton the presidency. But it is not the main economic problem that he will face. To his credit, Mr Clinton has recognised that it is the long-term performance of the US economy which most needs improvement. What he has not yet done is make clear to the American people how painful the choices they face will turn out to be. Under Mr Bush, the US economy grew at less than 1 per cent a year, far below the rate of growth of 3 per cent recorded during the Reagan years. As a result, real income per person stagnated between Mr Bush's election in 1998 and his rejection this week. Yet this is only a part of the sad story of Mr Bush. As Mr James Annable noted in the FT on October 19, after deducting elements of consumption that contribute little or nothing to well being, consumption per person grew by 10 per cent in the first Reagan term and by 9 per cent in the second. Under Mr Bush, by contrast, such 'feel good' consumption declined by more than 2 per cent. The irony is that poor Mr Bush bore little responsibility for the discomfort of the American people. The underlying cause of the stagnation was the way in which the Reagan years had superimposed debt-financed consumption upon a slow rate of underlying economic growth. Between mid-1973 and mid-1992 real income per head in the US rose by a little over a quarter. It has taken the US these 19 years to achieve an improvement in overall living standards previously managed in eight. Moreover, income per head has declined for a significant proportion of the population because of growing inequality. What is more, aggregate consumption grew by 30 per cent in real terms during the Reagan years, while total GDP rose by about a quarter. The difference was partly explained by a reduced investment rate, down from almost 17 per cent of GDP in 1980 to 16 per cent in 1988. It was also explained by increased borrowing from abroad, this being the consequence of the increased borrowing by both the government and of many individuals and firms. But under Mr Bush private borrowing virtually stopped, the inevitable result being a sharp decline in the overall rate of economic growth. The increased indebtedness of the 1980s was a grievous fault and grievously has Mr Bush now answered it. But it is also a story of the past. The private sector balance sheet adjustment is occurring, albeit slowly, and the US economy is also recovering. The 2.7 per cent annualised increase in GDP in the third quarter may flatter the underlying trend, but it shows the US is not in a deep recession. Mr Clinton does not need to put much of his effort into 'jump-starting' the US economy. What is far more important is the rate of growth of the economy in the long term. This depends not on fiddling with aggregate demand, but on the growth of the capital stock, both physical and human. The people of the US will get richer only if they save more and learn more. The gross savings rate in the US has declined from 17 per cent in 1980 to less than 12 per cent in the first half of 1992. Two percentage points of the decline can be explained by lower private savings. The big change, however, is an increase in the rate at which savings are being absorbed by government, from just over 1 per cent of GDP in 1980 to just under 5 per cent in 1992. No less important is the quality of US education for the bottom half of the ability range. Yet just as the 'dissaving' by government can only be remedied by a combination of cuts in spending and higher taxes, so reform in education and training demands equally painful structural reforms. Mr Clinton has rightly focused on the problem of long-term economic performance, not just on the immediate malaise. The US needs more saving, higher skills and a willingness to meet the best the international competition has to offer. What Mr Clinton has not yet shown is that he is prepared to make the tough choices. For the choices are, indeed, politically difficult and the pay-off as long term as the problems are deep-seated.</p>

The spokesman  called on the Iraqi Government to furnish Iran with further  details on the issue through diplomatic channels.    The helicopter with two crew members on board was  disappeared  three days ago. The pilot in his last contact had reported  technical failure. The spokesman said he is unable to precisely  comment on the cause of the emergency landing due to the  contradictory reports reaching here.    According to reports reaching here from the western border  city of Sanandaj a large number of helicopters conduct flights  over the region to transport relief aids and maintain security  in the border region. The authorities in Kordestan Province  had originally thought that the helicopter had crashed in the  mountains in northeast of Iran. Informed sources in Kordestan  said that reports coming from northern Iraq on the whereabouts  of the helicopter and the fate of its crew are not highly  reliable.</p>

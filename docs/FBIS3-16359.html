			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the near term the amount of TV and radio  broadcasting will not be reduced as it was on February 10,  "however, in general such an action is quite possible," Chairman  of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of  Telecommunications Workers Anatoly Nazeikin declared to INTERFAX  on Wednesday while commenting on related TV stories.    He also reported that since the beginning of this year  analogical problems appeared among telecommunications employees  who only now received payment for last year's debts for  broadcasting of state TV and radio programs. In addition,  agreements with TV and radio companies have not been concluded  yet because the quantity of broadcasting to be done is as yet  unknown.    Nazeikin underlined that the issues concerning mutual  payments between collectives of broadcasting centers and TV and  radio companies were to be solved in the course of the meeting  between representatives of telecommunications workers and Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin scheduled "for the near term."  However, this meeting has not taken place. If this continues  till the end of March, Nazeikin continued, we shall be forced to  cut back TV and radio broadcasting time for the majority of  Russia's regions. (On February 10 broadcasting was limited in 61  regions -- INTERFAX).</p>

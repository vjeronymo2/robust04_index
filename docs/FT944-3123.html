			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Bossi backs away from allies: A possible regrouping of parliamentary forces The populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi yesterday marched one further step away from its allies in Italy's rightwing coalition government. The League voted with the opposition in the chamber of deputies to approve the formation of a new parliamentary commission covering radio and television. This was against the express wishes of the League's government allies - the Forza Italia movement of premier Silvio Berlusconi, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini and the small Christian Democratic Centre (CCD). It was the first occasion during this parliament that the League has formally aligned with the opposition with the clear intention of discrediting Mr Berlusconi politically. Some opposition members immediately saw this as the beginnings of the formation of a new parliamentary majority. However, Mr Walter Veltroni, a deputy for the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and editor of the daily L'Unita, was more cautious: 'This vote does not prove the existence of a new majority, rather it expresses the degree of concern in parliament over the problems of information and the media.' The vote was only a day after Mr Berlusconi had been interrogated by Milan magistrates about corruption during the time he ran his Fininvest business empire, and came when the future of the coalition was increasingly in doubt. However, the significance of the vote lay not merely in the timing. The motion to set up the new commission was moved by Ms Irene Pivetti, the League speaker of the House. She has become a key figure in the growing political instability and has established close links with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Mr Berlusconi's supporters regard her as no longer impartial and determined to undermine the credibility of the coalition to prepare the way for a new government of national unity. Forza Italia deputies issued a note accusing Ms Pivetti: 'This is a complete expropriation of parliamentary procedure by Pivetti, creating a new commission and effectively de-legitimising the work of three existing commissions.' Government domination of these commissions had enabled Mr Berlusconi and his allies to take over management and editorial control of the Rai, the state broadcasting organisation. Such a situation in turn exacerbated the conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's role as prime minister and his ownership of three commercial television channels through Fininvest. The problem of the control of television was further complicated by a constitutional court decision ruling last week that a 1990 law granting Mr Berlusconi three national commercial channels was unconstitutional. As a result Fininvest may well have to divest one, if not two, of its channels by the end of 1996. Despite the background of genuine public interest behind the formation of the commission, Ms Pivetti's move was intended to embarrass the government, and the League's switch of support intended as a signal of its ability to change sides. It followed the tabling of a motion by Mr Bossi in effect censoring a wide swathe of government activity, including Mr Berlusconi's handling of his dispute with the judiciary. The League cannot play this spoiling role much longer without formally changing sides. Without the League, Mr Berlusconi would have no other ally to make up a working majority in parliament. Until now Mr Bossi has been content to conduct guerrilla warfare without bringing down the government. This is because he wants both to see the 1995 budget through parliament and avoid early elections. A budget, ineffectually dealing with Italy's public sector deficit, will go through parliament next week. The League's hands would then be freed to carry out Mr Bossi's long-threatened verifica - a parliamentary test of whether the coalition has any interest in, and chance of, survival - and to see what other coalition could form a government. The new alliance of the type forged yesterday is the most obvious regrouping of the forces in parliament. However, the PDS is far from united on doing a deal with Mr Bossi. For his part, the League leader is unsure that all his troops would back a centre-left alliance that would inevitably leave the PDS as the dominant parliamentary player. For this reason Mr Bossi has said a coalition could be forged solely as a government of national salvation, one that excluded the neo-fascists. Mr Berlusconi will do his best to woo away the 40-odd League deputies disenchanted with their leader's behaviour. And if the League's departure from the coalition becomes unavoidable, he will make Mr Bossi appear the person responsible for destabilising the government and the country.</p>

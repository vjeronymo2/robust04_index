			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE STUDY SAYS COURTS ARE RIFE WITH SEX BIAS;  </P> <P> JUSTICE SYSTEM: JUDICIAL COUNCIL COMMITTEE URGES DOZENS OF REFORMS TO IMPROVE  WOMEN'S STATUS.  </P> <P> A special committee of the state Judicial Council, ending a landmark three-year  inquiry, reported Friday that it had found widespread sex discrimination in the  California courts and proposed dozens of reforms aimed at improving the status  of women in the system.  </P> <P> The group urged, among other things, the adoption of new ethical codes  requiring judges to act against bias in the courtroom and barring them from  belonging to discriminatory clubs, expansion of legal protections for victims  of domestic violence, and changes in the law to enlarge child-support awards.  While not formally recommending such action, it said that appointment of more  women to the judiciary would substantially curb sex discrimination in the  judicial process.  </P> <P> The committee cited instances of "openly hostile" behavior and demeaning  remarks by judges against female lawyers, litigants, witnesses and other  participants in court proceedings.  </P> <P> The panel, while emphasizing that such incidents may occur only rarely, said it  had received complaints that unnamed judges had engaged in unwanted sexual  advances, erected pin-up pictures in chambers, told dirty jokes and read  sexually explicit magazines on the bench. One judge, it said, reportedly  described women lawyers as "menopausal dabblers" who entered the profession  only after completing the duties of motherhood.  </P> <P> The inquiry, one of the first in the nation, was launched under former Chief  Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and continued by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas,  the current chairman of the 22-member Judicial Council, the policy-making arm  of the state judiciary. At present, 29 states have undertaken similar  investigations.  </P> <P> The investigating panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Gender Bias in the  Courts, was chaired by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman and  state Sen. Diane E. Watson of Los Angeles. The 34-member committee -- made up  of judges, lawyers, legislators and court administrators -- held public  hearings throughout the state, conducted surveys of judges and attorneys and  visited jails where women are in custody.  </P> <P> Rothman stressed that sex bias did not originate in the courts, but rather was  a reflection of "society as a whole." But he noted that committee members "did  not realize the extent" of the problem throughout the state. Watson declared:  "The system is wrought with gender bias and didn't even realize it."  </P> <P> Lucas, presiding over a council meeting here Friday, welcomed the 680-page  report and its 65 recommendations as a "comprehensive review" of the issue.  </P> <P> While conceding that "there will be some who will emphasize the negatives in  the report," Lucas said he saw the wide-ranging investigation as evidence of  the "vitality and accountability" of the state judiciary. "Has any other  profession been so willing to take on this important inquiry?" he asked.  </P> <P> The exhaustively detailed report examined complaints of bias throughout the  system and offered a multitude of proposals to curb discrimination. It  concluded that sex bias "influences the decision-making and courtroom  environment" of the California justice system. The judiciary, it said, "must  respond with clear, decisive and immediate action" to ensure fairness in  decisions and practices.  </P> <P> "Across the board, we see one common thread -- and that is the lack of  credibility that women receive, whether they are lawyers or other participants  in the process," Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin, vice-chair  of the committee, told reporters. "When women are considered less credible,  that's inevitably going to affect the substance of a case."  </P> <P> The recommendations, if adopted, would require action by an array of  governmental and legal entities, including the Legislature, the State Bar, the  California Judges Assn., the state's law schools and the Judicial Council  itself. The report will undergo further study by a council subcommittee led by  state appellate Justice Ronald M. George of Los Angeles, with final action on  its findings and recommendations expected this fall.  </P> <P> Among other things, the report:  </P> <P> * Concluded that there would be "substantial amelioration" of sex bias in the  courts if more women were appointed to the bench. At present, 196 of the 1,481  judicial positions in California -- or 13% -- are occupied by women. In a  survey of the current judiciary, 64% of the women judges agreed that sex bias  was "widespread;" by contrast, 23% of the male judges saw such discrimination.  </P> <P> * Asked that judicial ethical canons be revised to provide specifically that  judges should not belong to clubs that practice "invidious discrimination" and  to impose the obligation on judges to refrain -- and prevent others -- from  exhibiting prejudice in court proceedings.  </P> <P> * Urged that time limits be expanded on emergency protective orders issued to  prevent the recurrence of domestic violence -- the victims of which are 95%  female. New rules should provide that temporary restraining orders are  available at all court hours and that law enforcement officers can issue such  orders at all other times.  </P> <P> * Found that child support awards are too low and inadequately enforced. New  legislation should be enacted to assure that children, after their parents are  divorced, share in the increased earnings of the wealthier parent. The duration  of child support should be extended to age 21.  </P> <P> The report also concluded that "stereotypes and prejudices" too often influence  the outcome in child-custody disputes. There is a tendency to "doubt the  credibility" of female parents and characterize them as "hysterical or  vindictive" when they make a claim of child abuse by their spouse.  </P> <P> * Reported that instances "abound" of biased conduct by attorneys. Female  lawyers report "they have been sexually propositioned by male attorneys, (been)  the object of their offensive jokes or sexual innuendoes, and the subject of  their discussions of sexual attributes." One woman lawyer claimed that an  unnamed prosecutor called her and said that if she agreed to go out with him,  he would dismiss charges against her client. Another female lawyer said she had  been called an obscene name by her opposing attorney, but that when she  complained, the judge said the comment was only "advocacy."  </P> <P> * Recommended that court authorities give higher priority to establishing  waiting rooms for children of court participants. The lack of child care  "limits a woman's access to court," the committee said, and represents a form  of "institutionalized gender bias."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STICKING AROUND FOR THE RECORD;  </P> <P> FUND-RAISER: GARY STEWART BOARDED HIS POGO STICK FRIDAY, HOPING TO BREAK HIS  WORLD RECORD OF 130,077 JUMPS. TWENTY HOURS LATER, HE HAD 177,737.  </P> <P> Gary Stewart of Cincinnati had a lot of ups and downs Friday and Saturday --  more than 170,000 of them.  </P> <P> Stewart, the world pogo-stick jumping champion, climbed aboard his custom-made  stick outside of a Beach Boulevard Burger King at 2:37 p.m. Friday, determined  to break his world record of 130,077 consecutive jumps. A little more than 20  hours later -- shortly before 11 a.m. Saturday -- he jumped into the Guinness  Book of World Records again with 177,737 repetitions.  </P> <P> "My ankles are extremely sore," Stewart said from his hotel room Saturday  night. "I have trouble walking -- steps kill me. But I'm happy about it."  </P> <P> Stewart, a medical student at the University of Cincinnati, set the record  during a promotional fund-raiser to introduce actor Paul Newman's salad  dressing to Burger King restaurants. Burger King pledged 10 cents for each of  Stewart's jumps to Cities in Schools Inc., a nationwide dropout-prevention  program. The pledge was matched by Newman and his company, Newman's Own Inc.  </P> <P> Stewart attributed his pogo-stick jumping success to his custom-made pogo  stick, which he said was firmer than an ordinary stick and, because it didn't  propel him too high into the air, allowed for more repetitions per minute.  </P> <P> While Stewart was happy to break the record, he said he would have quit soon  after reaching the 150,000-jump plateau -- his goal for Saturday's event -- had  it not been for the restaurant promotion.  </P> <P> "It was just a huge production," Stewart said. "It was orchestrated, and Burger  King had something planned for 10:30 (a.m.), so I had to go until 10:30. I was  dead by then. I was dying."  </P> <P> Besides the charitable aspect of the event, Stewart said he had another  motivation for attempting to break his record.  </P> <P> "The first time I did it in 1985, they put down my name (in the book) as Guy  Stewart instead of Gary," he said. "When I went to the ceremony in New York, I  talked to (Guinness Book of World Records author) Mr. (Ross) McWhirter, and he  said they'd correct it, but they never did. That was a major reason I did it  again. Being in the Guinness Book of World Records was my childhood dream."  </P> <P> Stewart said he was uncertain whether he would attempt to break the pogo-stick  jumping record again, but added that he might try for a Guinness record in  another category.  </P> <P> "The record height for having a grape dropped into your mouth is 380 feet," he  said. "Maybe I can do that."  </P></p>

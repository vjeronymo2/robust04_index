			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> Ildiko Nagy in Bratislava; date not given; Moravcik speaks in  Slovak with superimposed translation into Hungarian -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Nagy] The Democratic Union led by Jozef  Moravcik wants to establish relations with the Hungarian  Government immediately after the completion of the elections in  Hungary. [passage omitted] I interviewed the party chairman in  his capacity as prime minister soon after the results of the  first round of the Hungarian elections were disclosed. In reply  to the question of how he assessed Hungary's situation in light  of the results, Jozef Moravcik said the following:    [Moravcik] It was not a big surprise to me, but I am  reluctant to assess the result of the Hungarian elections. That  is how the voters decided, and we accept this as a fact. Of  course, I have the advantage of knowing the views of the two  parties that came out on top [the Hungarian Socialist Party and  the Alliance of Free Democrats]. Remembering the discussions I  recently held with them, I am optimistic.    [Nagy] What do you think the first steps of the future  Hungarian Government will be vis-a-vis the neighbors? And how  will the Slovak side react to what can be expected to be a  positive gesture?    [Moravcik] If both of the aforementioned party chairmen had  the opportunity to be in the government, it could be beneficial  for us to be able to continue the dialogue already under way.  Then we would have to waste less time on waiting.    [Nagy] The Slovak Government has recently made some  remarkable decisions--for example, on amending the law on the  use of names or on permitting bilingual placename signs. Have  any of your Hungarian partners taken notice of this?    [Moravcik] I consider it absolutely natural, and there is  nothing special in this. It complies with our political line  inasmuch as we promised the Council of Europe that we would  observe its recommendations. All we are doing now is fulfilling  this. In my view, we acted in a manner that is entirely  customary in a democracy when we amended these two laws in a way  that also satisfies those they concern.</p>

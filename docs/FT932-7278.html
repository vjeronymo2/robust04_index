			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / ITC set to clear Tyne Tees TV THE Independent Television Commission will today give Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television a clean bill of health on how the merged ITV region is being run. The commission launched a formal investigation after Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, complained that Tyne Tees was in effect being run by Yorkshire from Leeds and was being destroyed 'as an autonomous and independent broadcaster'. The commission, which has sought to preserve the autonomy of Tyne Tees with its own separate regional licence, is happy with both the business and programme commissioning structures now in place. But it warns that it will continue to monitor the performance and to ensure that there are no moves towards unacceptable integration at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. Ms Clwyd had argued that the destruction of Tyne Tees as an autonomous broadcaster 'demands an urgent and decisive response from the ITC'.</p>

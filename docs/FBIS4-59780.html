			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to PLO chairman,  today said Yasir 'Arafat and other PLO leaders will arrive in  the self-rule area in the Gaza Strip during the first half of  next month.    In a telephone interview from Cairo with our correspondent  Sa'id Mu'addi, Dr. Sha'th said reports received from the Gaza  Strip and Jericho show things are going very well. The same  applies to the reports he received from Major General Amnon  Shahaq, head of the Israeli negotiations team, he added.    Asked about 'Arafat's statements in Johannesburg, in which  he  called for jihad to liberate Jerusalem, Dr. Sha'th said there  are things which are sometimes interpreted in an exaggerated  manner.    Dr. Sha'th said the PLO decided to form the Palestinian  authority at this stage from those who have already been chosen  until the other members of this authority are named. He added  that negotiations on the transfer of powers to the Palestinians  in the rest of the West Bank will begin after the blessed 'Id  al-Adha.</p>

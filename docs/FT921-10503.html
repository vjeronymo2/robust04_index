			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad plan for Dollars 75bn trade boost WORLDWIDE savings of Dollars 75bn (Pounds 41.4bn) a year or more could be achieved through more efficient trade administration and practices, including computerisation of customs procedures, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) says in a report prepared for its eighth session which begins on Saturday. The calculation assumes a 25 per cent cut in transaction costs, put at roughly Dollars 300bn, or 10 per cent of world merchandise trade. But the report says potential savings cannot be fully realised because developing countries and the transition economies of eastern Europe do not have suitable information technologies. The efforts of these countries to liberalise foreign trade and integrate themselves into the global economy are thus being less well rewarded than they should be, for any given level of protectionism abroad. Unctad, which will hold the meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, has already helped countries such as Mauritius and Mauritania to computerise foreign trade procedures. For as little as Dollars 1m, the procedures have speeded customs clearance and increased revenue.</p>

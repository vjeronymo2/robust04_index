"There was immense pressure on Sinn Fein  and the IRA for an immediate response to the document last  December," said one senior activist from Andersonstown, "and yet  we have managed to turn the tables, to throw the ball back to  the British.    "The key to it all has been calling for clarification. When  we call for clarification, we are effectively calling for  negotiation. We are asking the British to give us what we want,  what they know it will take to end the war -- that is a  withdrawal.    "Yet the very complexities ambiguities of the declaration  mean that our appeal for clarification can't be totally  dismissed. It appears to be reasonable; it has been supported  by Albert Reynolds and John Hume. That will make it very hard  for the Brits to introduce a tough security package."    Although he recognised that Sinn Fein was unlikely to make  substantial electoral gains in the Republic, the speaker said  that the lifting of Section 31 had helped "humanise" republicans  for southern audiences and was important in terms of the  propaganda war.    By "spinning things out," republicans had reduced the  dramatic impact of the Major-Reynolds initiative, he argued.  The declaration wasn't "worth the paper it was written on," and  there were no plans to hold an IRA convention to vote on the  document -- "it's just a non-starter." But any private signals  from the British that they were seriously considering a  withdrawal could "move the situation on rapidly." According to  another activist in west Belfast, the short-term aim of the  republican movement is for the secret channels of communication  with the British government to be reopened. Like the first  quoted republican, this man is also a veteran Sinn Fein activist  who has spent time in jail. He insisted that the continuation  of the IRA campaign would eventually reap political rewards for  Sinn Fein.    IRA operations had been refined over recent months, with a  greater concentration on attacks against the security forces and  none, for example, on softer targets such as contractors working  for the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary]. The Provisionals were  opting for "low-key operations" -- planting incendiaries in  stores and business premises rather than bombing Protestant  towns.    The republican activist accused the SDLP [Social Democratic  and Labor Party] deputy Ieader, Mr Seamus Mallon (who has  continuously stressed the similarities between Hume-Adams and  Major-Reynolds on self-determination) of "hampering the peace  process" and deeply embarrassing his party Ieader, Mr John Hume.    The Hume-Adams agreement was between "Sinn Fein and John  Hume, not Sinn Fein and the SDLP," he said, indicating that not  everyone in the SDLP was committed to the agreement between the  two nationalist leaders. However, the source believed that Mr  Hume's high standing in the SDLP would ensure that he carried  the rest of the party with him.    The Sinn Fein activist asserted that the British government  would eventually offer republicans further concessions, but that  its reliance on unionist votes at Westminster made this unlikely  in the short term.    Sinn Fein would prefer a strong Conservative government  which  could "deliver on Ireland" to a Labour administration, despite  Labour's more sympathetic policies towards Irish unity, he said.  However, republicans are planning to target Labour MPs for  intensive lobbying on the peace process over the coming months.</p>

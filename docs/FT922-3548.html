			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Gatt plea to west on Bangladesh exports EFFORTS BY Bangladesh to liberalise its trade regime and boost exports are being handicapped by trade barriers in rich western countries, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) says in a review of the country's trade policies. Discussing the report yesterday, Gatt's governing council called for improved access to foreign markets for Bangladesh's exports, reinforced by 'adequate financial and technical assistance', to support continued trade reform. The report notes that non-traditional exports such as clothing and frozen fish have grown rapidly since the early 1980s while traditional exports such as jute, leather and tea have stagnated. But Bangladesh's export base remains narrow with these five areas accounting for over 90 per cent of export. Moreover, clothing exports to the west are now subject to quota restrictions under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and other bilateral arrangements, and other exports face a variety of tariff and non-tariff barriers. The Bangladesh government has been particularly stung by a US decision to impose anti-dumping duties of up to 42 per cent on shop towels from Bangladesh. In 1990 these imports, which are used for wiping machine parts, amounted to a princely Dollars 2.46m. With few natural resources and a tiny industrial sector, Bangladesh's export income covers only 40 per cent of import needs, leaving 60 per cent to be financed by overseas aid. Its 108m people have an average income of less than Dollars 200 a year, making Bangladesh one of the poorest of nations. The Gatt report urges 'a more sympathetic external environment' to encourage Bangladesh's export potential and underpin continued economic liberalisation. 'The elimination of barriers in key export markets' would help to reduce transitional unemployment and balance-of-payments problems, it says. Trade reforms begun in 1985 have had some success in reducing protection, encouraging exports and improving economic efficiency, the report adds. But Gatt is critical of the Bangladesh government for spending too much on propping up uncompetitive loss-making companies in both the public and private sectors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin under the rubric "Smolenskaya </F> Ploshchad": "Guided by Circumstances: More About Russia's  `Great-Power' Ambitions"]    [Text] The editors wish to remind the reader that the  articles under the rubric "Smolenskaya Ploshchad" express the  official point of view of the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.    Russia's role in today's world is the subject of continuous  debate abroad. In spite of all the current difficulties, many  believe in the democratic aims of Russian foreign policy,  Russia's commitment to the principles and standards of  international law, and its wish to join the club of civilized  states as quickly as possible. Not everyone, however, is pleased  with the course of Russian domestic reform. The suggestion that  "great-power" tendencies in Russian foreign policy are growing  stronger has been instilled in the minds of the world public  recently. References to the "Russian threat" seem to be back in  vogue. It is interesting that they were given this new lease on  life by the same politicians who used them so successfully in  the cold war years. They include former U.S. Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger, who believes that Russia intends to gain  "control over the policies of neighboring countries" and weaken  the North Atlantic alliance.    Another former U.S. secretary of state, Zbigniew Brzezinski,  has advised the creation of a new regional political group,  consisting of Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and  Hungary, to counteract all types of "encroachments" by Moscow.  Sam Nunn, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services  Committee, has also spoken of Moscow's plans to restore the  "empire."    One of the foreign political analysts' favorite ploys is the  allegation that interethnic conflicts within the geopolitical  boundaries of the former USSR are being "instigated" by the  Russian leadership. They have said that the results of the  December elections might tempt Moscow to "obscure" its weak  domestic policy with foreign policy adventurism.    Russia's natural wish to defend the rights of the  Russian-speaking population in the former Soviet republics is  also seen as a sign of its "great-power" ambitions. Moscow's  diplomatic moves are interpreted as nothing other than political  pressure and economic blackmail. Russia's desire to eliminate  discriminatory trade barriers, which we inherited from the cold  war and which are preventing the natural integration of the  Russian economy into the world market economy, has also been  called a "great-power" objective. Statements of this kind are  made more frequently just before major international economic  conferences, such as the recent Tokyo summit of the "Big Seven."    Russia's ideas about peacekeeping efforts have also been  described as "neo-imperialism." The use of these terms is  certain to undermine Russia's international image during the  resolution of conflicts within the territory of the former Union  and question its ability to act as a neutral and trustworthy  peacemaker. The efforts of Russian diplomats to give Russian  troops the status of CSCE "blue helmets" in zones of interethnic  conflict are interpreted as unconcealed attempts at new  "alterations" of the Eurasian continent. London's INDEPENDENT  even suggested that the offer of economic aid to Russia should  be conditional upon Western restrictions on the "intervention"  by Russian troops in the affairs of nearby foreign countries. It  is Russia, however, that has the necessary military, political,  and technical resources for this.    Officials in Kiev also like to talk about the "imperial  claims." When Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council for  Foreign Affairs Pavlychko was in Riga recently, for example, he  said that Russia's foreign policy theories are once again  acquiring "chauvinistic overtones, because Russia wants to turn  everyone, especially Ukraine, back into colonies or sections of  the Russian empire." Most of the lies about Russia's "imperial  inclinations" originate in the Baltic countries.    This is far from a complete list of the remarks about  Russia's "great-power chauvinism." What is the reason for these  unfounded allegations? After the dissolution of the USSR, many  Western political scientists were quick to conclude that Russia  had lost the status of a great power forever, but their  predictions were fated not to come true. Russia is a huge  country with the right to its own voice in world politics and in  the regions of its immediate concerns. After all, during periods  of crisis, the United States can call the Middle East or Latin  America a zone of U.S. strategic interests, and this arouses  virtually no public objections. Russia's actions in neighboring  countries, on the other hand, are invariably seen as  "authoritarianism and chauvinism," even though interethnic  conflicts along the perimeter of Russia's borders could have a  direct effect on Russian security interests.    The unfounded criticism of Moscow was noticeably more  vehement when centripetal tendencies took the foreground within  the Commonwealth. This was due to more than just the need to  restore severed economic ties. The unsuccessful attempts of our  neighbors to join international structures and alliances have  become increasingly apparent. There is not much reason to rely  on economic aid from the West, and this is why all eyes are  turning back to Russia. The results of the Ashgabat summit  corroborated this. When participants elected the president of  the Russian Federation to serve as CIS chairman for the next six  months, they underscored Russia's leading role, including its  leading position in the security sphere.    The goal of Russian foreign policy is the preservation of  Russia's own national interests and national identity. We must  secure strategic stability in the post-Soviet zone within the  guidelines of accepted standards and rules of behavior in the  democratic world. What does this have to do with "great-power"  ambitions?</p>

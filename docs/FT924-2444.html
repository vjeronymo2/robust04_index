			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Twin deficits in the UK THE BRITISH prime minister will not find the European summit in Edinburgh particularly enjoyable. It may not have been an annus horribilis, but it has been a horrible six months. Yet Mr Major enjoys what might seem to be a consolation. For the first time in at least three years, short-term prospects for the British economy look as good as those of most other European economies. The question for the British government is, for a change, not whether there will be a recovery of some kind, but whether it will last. What will Mr Major see when he looks round the table? Mr Mitterrand's France will be the best performing leading European economy this year and probably in 1993 as well. Nevertheless, it must suffer the high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank, while the French franc is under pressure once more. Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the switch towards the policy of rigeur. It will also mark another rise in French unemployment. Meanwhile, Mr Amato's lira has been evicted from the exchange rate mechanism quite as ignominiously as the British pound, but with less pleasurable results. So grave is Italy's fiscal crisis that the Bank of Italy, far from being able to exploit the apparent opportunity to lower interest rates, has had to keep three-month rates at the usurious level of 14 1/2 per cent. As for Mr Kohl's Germany, it is in recession. Nonetheless, the Bundesbank remains resolute. In the light of this year's monetary overshooting, the announcement that its target range for the growth of broad money next year is to be 4.5 to 6.5 per cent represents a grim warning, even though it is 1 percentage point higher than this year's target. The Bundesbank has served notice on its critics that it still wants every excuse for not cutting interest rates. British disease The fact that the Bundesbank does not want lower interest rates makes an intriguing contrast with the UK. For the first time since 1968, crowed the Treasury yesterday, the UK's underlying rate of inflation is marginally below that in Germany. Yet the Bundesbank regards German inflation of 3.7 per cent as a disaster, while one city economist reacted to the British news by saying that 'the government can afford to treat recovery as the main priority', since the inflationary flame would not be rekindled until the middle of 1993. Short-termism remains the British disease, Bundesbankers will naturally conclude. Whether or not it makes sense for governments to switch their attention from growth to inflation and back again, like a pendulum, Mr Major does have the immediate luxury of going for growth. Underlying inflation is within the chancellor's target of 1 to 4 per cent, while the latest wage settlements are also below 4 per cent, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Consumer spending Since private consumption accounts for just under two-thirds of aggregate demand, the route to any really swift economic recovery runs via the consumer's pocket. Naturally, the shopkeepers of Britain wish consumers were the spendthrifts they so recently were. So does the chancellor. Fortunately, consumers are likely to remain cautious. A modest expansion of consumer demand is desirable. But there can be too much of a good thing. In the case of the UK economy, that point might be reached rather swiftly. Nobody knows what difference the new panel of forecasters will make to the Treasury's performance. The group is engagingly heterodox, but this very diversity ensures that the Treasury will be able to lay off the blame, which may be the point of the exercise. In any case, it must cast its net more widely. Mr Bill Martin, of stockbrokers Phillips &amp; Drew and not himself a panellist, brings out why a consumer boom would be risky. He forecasts the following perfectly plausible combination for 1994: unemployment at 12 1/2 per cent of the labour force; a current account deficit at 4 per cent of gross domestic product; and a public sector borrowing requirement at 9 per cent of GDP. The UK's 'twin-deficits' would then dwarf anything seen in the US during the 1980s. If the government is seen to be taking a risk with inflation, it is almost certain to face a crisis in either the foreign exchange markets, the gilt market or both. The result would be higher interest rates once more - both long and short term - and probably an aborted recovery. There is no safe alternative to export-led growth, however uncomfortably slow it would initially be. As the government realises its predicament, any temptation to gloat over the pain elsewhere in Europe will disappear. Mr Major needs a buoyant European market, since this is where almost two-thirds of British exports are sold. The less buoyant that market, the more sterling will have to depreciate and the greater the inflationary dangers. Recovery is, indeed, likely. But the government will need pay and spending restraint at home and vigorous growth abroad if this recovery is to be more than a flash in the pan.</p>

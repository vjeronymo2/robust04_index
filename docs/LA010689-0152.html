Laffer has come  up with $2.7 million in a private stock offering to fund American Patriots  Inc., a Corona del Mar insurance holding company.  </P> <P> The firm was formed early last year and is negotiating to purchase a company  that underwrites workers compensation insurance and excess and surplus  insurance, said Joseph V.

He said the acquisition is expected to be announced soon.  </P> <P> Up to 40 institutional investors already have been lined up to provide more  than $200 million in senior debt to help finance the purchase of a company, he  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KICK-START REVS UP CHANNEL ISLANDS  </P> <P> Channel Islands High, off to a sluggish start against Westlake, needed a swift  kick when behind to get going.  </P> <P> The Raiders got just that from senior J. Rosario Pina, who booted a 51-yard  field goal to start Channel Islands on its way to a 31-15 Marmonte League  victory Friday night at Hueneme High.  </P> <P> "All week I was practicing long kicks," Pina said of his school-record field  goal. "I thought I helped the team and motivated us to play harder."  </P> <P> After his field goal, which came early in the second quarter when Channel  Islands was trailing, 7-0, Pina got some help on offense from a bruising  running game. Tailback Renard Carn rushed 17 times for 82 yards and one  touchdown. Fullback Pharoh Milner ran 14 times for 63 yards and scored two  first-half touchdowns.  </P> <P> Westlake had hoped this game would prove that its vastly improved team could  play with the big boys -- namely a Channel Islands team that had won two league  titles in a row.  </P> <P> But the Warriors' only spark came from junior quarterback Todd Preston, who  completed 21 of 38 passes for 233 yards and two touchdowns. However, Preston,  who threw two interceptions, was battered all night as he was continually  chased from the pocket or sacked.  </P> <P> "I was real happy with our defense," Channel Islands Coach Joel Gershon said.  "Our coverages were good and we were able to put pressure on the quarterback."  </P> <P> Leading, 17-7, heading into the second half, Channel Islands' offense used big  plays to put the game away. Quarterback Mark Contreras threw 62 yards to wide  receiver Shawn Young for a touchdown on the Raiders' first possession of the  third quarter.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, Channel Islands took possession at the Westlake 45 and  left the rest to Carn. The junior rushed four times in a row, the last run  going 21 yards for another touchdown to give the Raiders a 31-7 lead.  </P> <P> Westlake jumped to an early lead after Channel Islands' first possession  stalled and the Raiders punted short into a chilling wind.  </P> <P> The Warriors took over near midfield and Preston promptly completed a 23-yard  pass to Seamus Gibbons. One play later, he hit tight end Dave Monheim for a  seven-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 lead.  </P></p>

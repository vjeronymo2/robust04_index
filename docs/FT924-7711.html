			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Booker concerns increase FOOD distributor Booker tumbled for a second day as brokers continued to downgrade the group because of concern regarding Booker Fitch, its distribution subsidiary. There were also growing worries over the safety of Booker's dividend. Mr Carl Short at Nomura said: 'The shares would have fallen further but for the safety net that the confidence in the dividend provides. But any further disappointments will put it in jeopardy and with it the level of the shares.' At Smith New Court, Mr Tim Potter agreed: 'The Christmas trading period will be crucial for them in this respect.' Two directors are said to have left the division as Booker management have embarked on a rationalisation programme to combat the problems in its distribution arm. Booker bought Fitch Lovell in 1990 but has had problems integrating the two businesses. With yesterday's price fall of 27 to 345p, the shares have lost 12.5 per cent in two days. Among a welter of profit downgrades, Nomura moved from Pounds 103.5m to Pounds 90.5m, Smith New Court from Pounds 98m to Pounds 90m and BZW Pounds 99m to Pounds 94m. Royal in favour Although the chancellor's Autumn Statement was broadly good news for the insurance sector, Royal was the only stock to show an improvement on the day as a number of analysts pointed out the relative value in the stock. The group, which had previously reported a sharper cut than expected in its pre-tax loss for the first nine months, consolidated Thursday's gains with a rise of 12 to 259p. Kleinwort Benson specialists pointed out that Royal was priced at a 25 per cent discount to net assets while most others insurers were at a premium. Royal is also one of the group most heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity and the government's commitment to spend Pounds 750m on the housing market to check falling prices helped sentiment. Of its rivals, Sun Alliance, the most heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity, fell 3 to 328p, while Commercial Union, at an estimated 30 per cent premium to assets lost 5 at 563p and General Accident, at a 20 per cent premium, slipped 8 to 560p. A fall in the price of Brent crude sent oil shares lower. Lasmo closed 5 off at 160p, Shell eased 8 to 541p following a strong rally on Thursday and BP eased 5 1/2 to 232 1/2 p. A shortage of stock combined with buy recommendations helped lift BICC, the shares adding 13 to 276p. County NatWest and BZW were said to be buyers as the worries over the group's property exposure were felt to be in the shares. Smith New Court moved its figures into line with the market yesterday, lopping around Pounds 50m from this year's profit forecast to Pounds 83 1/2 m. The house remains a keen buyer. Positive consideration of BT's results lifted the shares 2 to 390p. Recovery stocks in the engineering sector were in demand. TI Group rose 10 to 295p - BZW said to be recommending it - and Glynwed jumped 8 to 210p. But GPA concerns continued to overhang Rolls-Royce, off 3 1/2 to 114p, and Smiths Industries, down 5 at 313p. Pharmaceutical stocks responded cautiously to the Autumn Statement, which hinted at restrictions on profits and sales. The return on capital employed by drug companies is restricted to around 17 to 21 per cent and at least one broker was hinting that that level of profitability might be lowered by a percentage point. Also, there is a possibility that a government 'black list' of drugs that should be sold over the counter in generic form rather than prescribed could be increased by 10 to 17. The restrictions are not expected to affect forecasts materially but would hit sentiment. There was also pressure on the international earners from a stronger pound. Glaxo fell 16 to 800p, Wellcome 11 to 973p and SmithKline Beecham 7 to 523p in the 'A's. Medeva rose 11 to 211p with Strauss Turnbull said to be recommending the stock. Engineering group Wheway slumped 5 to 7p as the company issued a warning that second-half profits will be below most forecasts. Marketmakers knocked BOC back by 9 to 680p on bear rumours ahead of full-year figures on Monday. The industrial gases and healthcare firm is expected to illustrate its resilience to recession, reporting a 10 to 11 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 340m to Pounds 345m, versus Pounds 310m last time. Widespread belief that company broker Cazenove had cut its forecast on Brent Chemicals prompted the shares to close a net 9 lower at 124p. Cazenove never comments on market speculation but was believed to have come down to Pounds 11.5m for this year from the top of the range figure of Pounds 12.7m. Speciality materials group Courtaulds, expected to post interim profits on Wednesday of Pounds 87m to Pounds 92m against Pounds 96.4m a year earlier, fell 10 to 495p. News that US food group ADM has raised its stake in Tate &amp; Lyle encouraged the shares, although analysts dismissed any talk of stake building or an imminent takeover. ADM has a history of trading investments in competitor groups and its 7.4 per cent holding in Tate's left most observers unmoved. However, enough were impressed to raise the shares 4 to 369p. Publisher Reed International held up ahead of a shareholder vote on its merger with Dutch publisher Elsevier on Tuesday. Reed was up 8 at one stage, a 12-month high, and closed 2 firmer at 603p. The shares have risen steadily since October 30 when Reed announced final terms of the planned merger. Lehman Brothers expects Reed's profits to rise to Pounds 450m by the end of 1994 against a company forecast of Pounds 224m for 1992. Also, County NatWest has moved Reed on to its list of top 30 recommended stocks. United Newspapers firmed 4 to 457p as concerns that the government might impose VAT on newspapers as part of the Autumn Statement proved unfounded. Euromoney lost 22 at 868p as profit-takers moved in following good figures on Thursday.' Most banks were weak as institutions adjusted portfolios to buy HSBC following the Pounds 480m placing of 80m new shares in HSBC Holdings on Wednesday. NatWest was the principal target with the shares falling 10 to 378p. However, HSBC slipped 14 1/2 to 542 1/2 p reflecting a sharp fall in the Hong Kong market. Yield considerations brought buyers into selected electricity stocks in late trading, among which, Eastern rose 6 1/2 to 412 1/2 p, Norweb 11 1/2 to 461 1/2 p and South West 9 to 460p. Switching was said to be taking place out of Scottish and Newcastle as nervous talk was heard ahead of its results. The shares fell 15 to 415p. In more wide-ranging assessments of the autumn economic statement, market strategists continued to express somewhat cautious views of the outlook for equities. Peter Thorne at Nikko Securities advised selling building contracter stocks should there be any sustained rally on the back of the measures disclosed. While Nikko believes that the potential value of the partially-privatised work announced in the economic statement could be worth more thn Pounds 15bn, and involve a long list of industry beneficiaries, it could prove impossible to predict the winners among the contractor companies.

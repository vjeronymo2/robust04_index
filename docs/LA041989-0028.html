			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> WHEN HART'S WEIL TAKES THE HILL, IT'S ZERO HOUR FOR THE OPPOSITION  </P> <P> Kym Weil might be the best high school softball pitcher in Southern California.  </P> <P> Just ask her father.  </P> <P> On second thought, don't ask her father. Al Weil is Kym's coach at Hart High,  and like any doting dad of an only daughter -- and coach of an ace windmill  whipper -- he is very proud, yet very humble.  </P> <P> "She's the only daughter I have," Al Weil said. "I'm very proud."  </P> <P> See?  </P> <P> For an objective opinion of Weil's pitching merits, try Don Sarno, her personal  coach.  </P> <P> Sarno, a member of the International Softball Congress Hall of Fame and  "pitching consultant" for about 20 Division I schools, insists that Weil,  though only a junior, can plan to accept a Division I scholarship next year.  </P> <P> "I think Kym's one of the top 10 pitchers in Southern California," Sarno said.  "Effectively, that means the whole country."  </P> <P> Well, Weil certainly holds her own. In her third season, she is 14-1 with 11  shutouts, including six in a row to start the season. Weil has three  no-hitters, including two perfect games.  </P> <P> Weil pitched her second perfect game Tuesday, striking out 15 as Hart blanked  San Gabriel, 4-0. She also pitched a perfect game against El Camino Real, the  defending City Section 4-A Division champion. Her only loss was to Righetti,  which scored an unearned run in the sixth inning to defeat Hart, 1-0, in the  championship game of the Righetti tournament.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Weil whipped Schurr, 5-0, pitching a no-hitter with 13 strikeouts.  Two days earlier, Weil yielded five hits in a 7-0 win over Burbank. Hart is  16-1 overall and leads the Foothill League with a 3-0 record.  </P> <P> Weil has struck out 178 of the 332 batters she has faced and walked just eight.  Most impressive, however, is Weil's earned-run average. She doesn't have one.  </P> <P> Through 100 innings, Weil has not allowed an earned run.  </P> <P> "Maybe," Weil says, trying to explain her scoreless streak, "all of us are  working together.  </P> <P> "I really don't know. It's weird. It's great."  </P> <P> It's Weil. Last season, her ERA was 0.30, her freshman year, 0.89. Weil's  career record is 49-13 with 566 strikeouts in 395 innings. This season, she  recorded four shutouts in the Hart tournament, notching 60 strikeouts in 27  innings. And, of course, zero earned runs.  </P> <P> "That streak is going to end sometime," Al Weil said. "And I've talked to Kym  about it and she knows that. But she knows if she gives up a run and we win,  that's all that's important."  </P> <P> Weil attributes her success to working with Sarno and former Hart Coach Dennis  Ford, the father of UCLA pitcher Samantha Ford, who pitched at Hart from  1982-85 and posted a 0.00 ERA and 18 shutouts in 1984.  </P> <P> "She has just developed a work ethic you wouldn't believe," Ford said. "She  does aerobics and lifts weights. She has improved so much."  </P></p>

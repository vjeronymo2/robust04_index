In his  opinion, the visit by the U.S. President is an important event  both for the United States and Russia, and for Europe and all  the republics of the former Soviet Union. "I an grateful to  Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton and also to NATO for the  attention paid to Georgia," he stressed.    Touching upon the results of the second round of the Geneva  talks on settling the conflict in Abkhazia, the head of state  noted that a feasible minimum was achieved in Geneva. "A great  deal will depend on the resolution of the UN Security Council  that, in our opinion, should envisage guarantees for  implementing the commitments," Shevardnadze said. What is  meant, in particular, is the participation of the peacekeeping  forces under the aegis of the United States, of observers, and  of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.    The Georgian leader thinks that the consistent continuation  of the UN policy in resolving the conflict will speed up the  process of establishing peace in Abkhazia, taking into account  the positive role of Russia and the interests of the United  States, France, Britain, and other countries.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : BOHEMIAN GROOVE FROM WASHINGTON SQUARES  </P> <P> Holy anachronisms, Batman! Phrases like "the upper class oppressing the lower  classes" and "with Bush in the White House, we need all the beats we can get"  (preceding a folk eulogy for Neal Cassady) actually came up over the course of  the Washington Squares' first set Saturday at the Palace Court, no sniggers  attached.  </P> <P> Since the Squares first showed on the NYC acoustic circuit a few years back,  folk truebloods have debated whether these two guys and a gal are serious about  their new bohemianism, and if so, whether maybe they shouldn't be. How, it's  asked, can the same amplified-acoustic trio that sings a way-cool pop version  of Leonard Cohen's riotously cynical "Everybody Knows" also croon apparently  guileless original lyrics like "Love and understanding covered with dust / It's  time for direction, caring and trust / Be on the lookout for a new generation"?  </P> <P> But while '80s fatalism and '60s idealism may be strange bedfellows to  consummate in the Squares' bedframe of reference, should their ingenuous  light-shining seem any harder to swallow than "Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution"?  </P> <P> On Saturday, the folk-raucous Squares -- and a loud drummer -- stretched the  jazz-oriented Palace Court's sound system well beyond its apparent capacity.  Which somehow added to the charm. They have a major Peter, Paul &amp; Mary  complex, and harmonies to make it work, but imagine PP&amp;M cranked up to 11,  rocking out on "Greenback Dollar" with an extended guitar solo. Dig.

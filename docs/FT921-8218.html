			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Ministry proposes package of measures to lure investors A COMPREHENSIVE package of measures to improve the attractiveness of Germany as an investment location, including corporate tax cuts, and plans to improve labour mobility, has been drawn up by the Economics Ministry. The package is an attempt to meet the growing chorus of complaints from German industry that high wage and tax costs, and an excessive burden of social and environmental spending, are driving German and foreign investors alike away from the market. In a special report on the issue, the ministry insists the complaints are often repetitive and exaggerated. But it also admits that they should be taken seriously, as a reflection of the real fears of German entrepreneurs. 'The warning signals should be taken seriously,' it says. 'The preservation and improvement of the quality of Germany as an investment location is a task which depends equally on the state, enterprises, wage partners and other social groups.' Above all, action is needed with the approaching completion of the European Community single market at the end of 1992. The package includes: strict control of state spending, to prevent excessive demands on the domestic capital markets, and a rising tax burden on industry further cuts in corporate taxation, to bring the marginal rate down to 46 per cent (from the current 51 per cent) registration of private job-hunting agencies, to break the monopoly of the Federal Labour Office in job placement encouragement of greater regional and sectoral variations in wages, especially between east and west Germany, and discouragement of binding national wage agreements greater flexibility of working times promotion of greater competition in infrastructure services, including telecommunications and transportation environmental controls on industry to be matched by corresponding financial relief in other areas.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / HK hopes rise China will approve airport: Beijing still fears it will be saddled with debt THE joint Sino-British committee trying to break the five-month deadlock over financing for Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport project meets today amid growing local optimism that China is preparing to settle the dispute. The meeting, between Chinese and British diplomats and senior Hong Kong officials, is the first since July. It is unlikely to lead to any immediate resolution, with the Chinese set to put forward new proposals which will have to be studied by the British team. But the Chinese decision to to return to the negotiations is seen as a hopeful sign. This is in part based on a prevalent local assumption that approval has been postponed to give the Chinese leverage ahead of an important policy speech to be given by Governor Chris Patten on October 7. Chen Zuo'er, deputy director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said on Monday that the Chinese concerns remain focused on the cost-effectiveness of the airport and whether the post-1997 government will be saddled with any debt. Mainland officials have suggested the estimated Dollars 21bn proceeds from the sale of land development rights for five sites along the airport railway should be used to provide direct government financing for the project. This is likely to form the core of the new proposals to the British side of the negotiation. Chen said he approved of the idea of diverting funds from the land sales. But he was quick to deny suggestions of official leaking, saying that the idea had emerged from the people of Hong Kong rather than Beijing. The British remain cautious in their expectations for the latest meeting. The leader of Britain's negotiating team, Mr Anthony Galsworthy, said yesterday the British group would need time to consider any new Chinese proposals, before any conclusion could be drawn and discussed at a later date. But Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, said recently he was confident an agreement would be reached shortly; and he is in a good position to know, as a member of the executive council, the governor's equivalent of a cabinet. The deadlock started in mid-April, after the Chinese were presented with the finance package for the airport and related projects, which are expected to cost Dollars HK175bn (Pounds 11.35bn). The Chinese expressed concern over a Dollars HK20bn in 'callable equity' which the government has guaranteed to cover over-runs as a result of delay or other contingencies. Another problem was escalating cost of the airport's rail-link. Chinese sources say there is no opposition to the project itself, but only to the financing. Meanwhile, work on the airport is proceeding. On November 31 the offer closes from the Nishimatsu consortium, which was awarded the Dollars 9bn airport site preparation contract.</p>

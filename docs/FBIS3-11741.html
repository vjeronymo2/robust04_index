			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] We have just received Bulletin No. 32 from the  National Defense Secretariat denying reports that a significant  mobilization of troops is taking place in the Chiapas region.  The National Defense Secretariat also confirmed its unalterable  and absolute determination to honor President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari's orders.    The bulletin also says the Mexican Army will not seek to  negatively influence the peace and reconciliation process taking  place in Chiapas for any reason whatsoever. The bulletin  proceeds to explain that the troops movement taking place in  Chiapas is mostly intended to relieve the units in Chiapas and  at the same time give the soldiers who have been stationed in  the region for a long time some rest.    In addition, the bulletin emphasizes that the land  mobilizations have mainly been to resupply the troops with food  and equipment. This, the bulletin indicates, has nothing to do  with the cease-fire or the agreement to discontinue all  hostilities during the time the negotiation period agreed on in  Altos de Chiapas is in effect.</p>

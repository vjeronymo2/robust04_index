			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Completing Brighton bypass TAYLOR WOODROW CIVIL ENGINEERING has started work on the final stage of the A27 Brighton and Hove bypass. The Pounds 19.5m contract covers the 4.3km section between Hangleton in East Sussex and Kingston, West Sussex. A substantial part of the 30-month project involves a 490 metre twin-bored tunnel beneath Southwick Hill. The contract also requires construction of an interchange to link the dual two-lane carriageway with the Shoreham bypass at Kingston. Roadworks leading to the complex will be linked with access routes to the bypass. To carry out the tunnelling work as rapidly and cost-effectively as possible, Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering will be using the New Austrian Tunnelling Method, which relies on quick-setting sprayed concrete instead of precast concrete or iron segments for initial ground support. Work will go on underground round the clock in order to complete the twin bores by next summer, when the tunnel will be used to transfer up to 400,000 cu metres of excavated chalk from the eastern side of the road job to the western side for landfill purposes before winter sets in, reducing disruption to local traffic.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Gas bills 'could be cut by 10%' HOUSEHOLDS could save 10 per cent of their gas bills, about Pounds 50 a year, if the British Gas monopoly of domestic supply was removed, Alliance Gas, a leading independent gas supplier, said yesterday. Alliance, a joint venture between British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil, says the introduction of competition to the industrial gas market has saved British industry Pounds 100m over the past three years. 'The new independents are much leaner and more cost-effective organisations than British Gas,' said Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director of Alliance. British Gas claimed on Monday that gas prices would rise 15 per cent if its business were broken up and competitors were allowed to supply households. It said customers farthest from gas terminals would pay more for their supply. Mr Maroe said: 'It would be possible to guarantee customers a general saving of around 10 per cent and, in certain areas which may be particularly cheap to supply, there could be even larger savings.' Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, called for a wholesale break-up of British Gas on Monday, and said it would result in lower prices for customers. Mr Maroe said he did not believe a full break-up of British Gas into 12 regional companies was necessary to achieve greater competition. But he has told the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that British Gas's pipelines and storage arm must be hived off to facilitate the development of competition. The MMC is reviewing the structure of the gas business in the UK and is due to make a report in April. 'If the transportation arm is not hived off, it will make a lot of competitors very reluctant to sustain long-term competition,' said Mr Maroe. Alliance supplies 6,000 industrial sites with gas and has entered into partnerships with East Midlands Electricity and Manweb through which Mr Maroe believes it could supply the whole country with gas once the market opens up.</p>

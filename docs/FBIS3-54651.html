The Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan informed  INTERFAX, however, that the calm would be temporary.    The military link this with the positive results of Afghan  President Borhanoddin Rabbani's visit to Tajikistan at the end  of 1993, with the cold and snowy weather in the mountains and  with rifts between Afganistan's various political forces.    A few days ago, two thirds of the Kazakh battalion operating  in the territory of the Khorog border-guard unit in accordance  with last year's Minsk agreement, were removed from Tajik  territory. However, no replenishments have arrived yet, all of  which may weaken this section of the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

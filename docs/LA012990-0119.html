			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> LATINOVISION: Before launching Orange County's only local Spanish-language TV  service (B1), KBUENAvision asked Latinos in Santa Ana what they'd like to see.  . . . It turns out they want what everyone else wants: More than half want  movies, nearly half want sports, about a third want telenovelas (soap operas)  and only about 10% want news. "When you survey special groups, there's almost  never a significant difference," said the cable channel's Doug Montandon. . . .  In sports, however, Latinos want soccer and boxing. Mark I.

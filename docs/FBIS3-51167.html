All this  should be accomplished using less resources.    During 1993 research in the Cuban agricultural sector was  aimed at faster implementation of production results and the  promotion of scientific projects that would replace imports and  attract foreign exchange.    The research centers carried out 79 scientific projects.  Fifty of those projects were praised for their importance, and  six received the Cuban Academy of Science's 1993 prize for the  most important research projects of the year.    At a science and agricultural workers' meeting, Carlos  Temprano, the official in charge of scientific activity in the  agricultural sector, referred to the goals of researchers for  the current year:    [Begin Temprano recording] They must help increase  production and efficiency through Agriculture Ministry programs  by promoting results and physical-technical activities. These  activities should be promoted with less effort, more  integration, and better quality in the areas of production and  service, which the various research institutions are tasked with  helping.    We must increase the scientific and technical level of  researchers, professionals, and technicians from the science and  technical units and those who work in productive organization  and technical services at all levels within the institutions.  We must attract foreign exchange and local currency to solve  the most basic needs of the institutions. We must also reduce  spending and meet financial plans. We must perfect the system  to introduce results that promote mechanisms that will adjust  this task to new conditions of production in our country's  agriculture. [end recording]    It became evident at the meeting that there is a need for a  better link between the research system and productive activity.  It also became evident that scientists must enlarge the small  work force existing in our fields. Scientists must also focus  their research on initiatives that will result in the lowest  fuel consumption possible.    Scientists who are linked to agricultural tasks agreed that,  in view of Cuba's difficult situation, their research centers  must seek their own financing by offering advice and training to  interested institutions; all this must be done taking into  consideration the high level of Cuban professionals.</p>

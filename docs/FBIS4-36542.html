			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour by Gerard </F> Nicaud; place and date not given: "Quickly Mobilize Our  Credits"]    [Text] [Nicaud] You signed an agreement with the Paris Club  on Thursday [2 June] evening. Are you satisfied?    [Benbitour] The rescheduling is based on an economic program  that was examined with the IMF. The agreement we signed with  the Paris Club reduces the foreign debt by $5 billion (out of a  total of $26 billion -- LE FIG-ECO editorial note). As we hope  that these credits will be made available quickly, the  rescheduling should make it possible for us to finance the  program.    [Nicaud] When taking the IMF, the World Bank, and the  European Union into account, how much money do you hope will be  made available?    [Benbitour] A total of $1 billion from the IMF, another $1  billion from the other institutions, and $5 billion from the  rescheduling. This does not include bilateral assistance in the  form of commodity credits.    [Nicaud] Did France make a special effort?    [Benbitour] France stated that it would maintain the level  of  the financing facilities that it has previously made available  to us (5-6 billion French francs -- LE FIG-ECO editorial note).  However, the most important thing is the quick availability of  the credits. Indeed, when launching a recovery program,  negative effects such as the rise in the price of products  following a devaluation (dinar was devalued by almost 50  percent) come immediately, whereas positive effects come later.  This difficult period for the people must be limited. It is a  question of credibility.    [Nicaud] Does this rescheduling not come too late?    [Benbitour] It comes at the right time. Over the last six  years, foreign debt has represented 75 percent of export  earnings. In 1993, it rose to 86 percent and it could have  exceeded 90 percent this year if there had been no rescheduling.    As you know, Algeria lives mainly on its exports of  hydrocarbons. In 1991, Algerian oil was worth $21 a barrel.  This year, we have planned the budget on a $15 basis. Each  dollar less per barrel represents a $500 loss in income for the  whole year. In six years, Algeria had to cut its imports by  half. Because of a lack of supplies, namely, spare parts, the  industrial sector is operating only at 50 percent of capacity.    [Nicaud] The Paris Club agreement complements a readjustment  program jointly developed with the IMF. What are the next steps?    [Benbitour] We will concentrate our efforts on reducing the  budget deficit from 9.2 percent of GDP last year to 3.2 percent  in 1994. This objective is possible due to the devaluation of  the dinar.    [Nicaud] With 2 million people out of work, unemployment  remains the number one problem in Algeria. What impact do you  expect your program to have on employment?    [Benbitour] Nearly 250,000 people enter the labor market  each  year. Up till now, the government has granted money to anyone  whose income does not exceed a certain amount. We would now  like to give compensation to those who engage in public utility  activities. This requires a complete remodeling of the system.  Besides the gas industry, we are targeting growth in those  sectors employing a large number of workers.</p>

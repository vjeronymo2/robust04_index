			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paper technology deal agreed Sulzer, the Swiss engineering group, and J. M. Voith of Germany are to merge their worldwide paper technology operations. The new company will have sales of DM2bn (Dollars 1.18bn) and employ 9,000. Voith, a family-owned company based in Heidenheim in Baden-Wurttemberg, said yesterday the move was a response to a drastic deterioration in the paper technology industry over recent years. The two companies came close to reaching a similar agreement in 1991, but the deal was abandoned after disagreements within the Voith family over the nature of the co-operation. The present deal will leave Voith as a majority shareholder with a 60 per cent holding. Voith said conditions in the paper technology industry had worsened since the merger was first mooted. This reflected the problems of paper manufacturers as well as increased competition within the sec-tor. The fusion would create economies of scale in production, distribution and marketing, Voith said, leading to a 'substantial strengthening' of their combined activities and a return to profitability. The companies are making a profit overall, but are losing money in the paper technology area. In the year to September 30 1992, paper technology accounted for around half of Voith's DM2.55bn turnover. Both sides stressed the agreement affected only the paper technology area - for example, machines for making and finishing paper - and not the groups' other activities, such as equipment for hydro-electric power stations. The merger is in line with steps taken by other machinery manufacturing companies in Germany. The sector is dominated by family-owned companies, classic 'mittelstand' enterprises which have for decades resisted the pressure to consolidate to form bigger groups.</p>

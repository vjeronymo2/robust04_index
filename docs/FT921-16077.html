			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Tbilisi starts to count cost of a little local disturbance 'PLEASE pardon the disturbance,' said a slogan pasted in white on an armoured personnel carrier on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue yesterday. To call the fighting in the streets of the city in the last two weeks a 'disturbance' is a distinctly un-Georgian understatement. Civilians had been unable to walk along the city's main street for two weeks as it was transformed into a battlefield. They had not even been able to walk through surrounding streets without frequently dashing for cover from stray bullets while machine gun fire and explosions rent the air. Yesterday they picked their way somewhat sombrely through the ruins of what was previously an elegant tree-lined avenue, with broken glass and pieces of masonry crunching underfoot. 'Our heart has been destroyed,' said Gogi, a student of international law. 'The heart of Tbilisi is our heart and it is crying out. This vandal, this dictator, caused all this but it was worth it to gain our freedom. He was a monster, I guarantee you.' Earlier, an opposition soldier perched on top of an armoured personnel carrier had sprayed his comrades with champagne, the pop of the cork followed by a deafening victory salute of machine gun fire in the air. Stubble covered cheeks brushed together as men in flak jackets kissed one another. However, the civilian population was less exuberant, displaying only a sense of relief that the shooting had stopped. There was little celebration of the opposition victory but neither were Gamsakhurdia supporters to be found shedding tears about his departure. Perhaps they were too scared. Tbilisi had paid a high price for the ousting of the man the opposition liked to call Satan. The colonnaded frontage of the government building was pockmarked with bullet holes, some of its columns almost shot through by the howitzer which was laying abandoned on the other side of the street. Thick smoke billowed from the northern wing of the building, as flames licked round the window. Opposition soldiers and early civilian arrivals seized almost anything they could move, ripping the radios out of the crumpled cars on the street, carrying television sets out of the basement and rifling through desk drawers in the offices. We followed them into the abandoned basement where only the previous day Mr Gamsakhurdia had met the media, while soldiers sat and smoked and played chess. Now much of it was in pitch darkness. There seemed to be more tables around than before - trip wires, it was suggested. We quickly left. Other buildings around the square included blackened wrecks - School Number 1 founded in 1802 and the most famous in Georgia, founded in 1802, where Mr Gamsakhurdia and Mr Tengiz Kitovani, a rebel leader, both studied. Where there had been a line of tents which housed the fervent supporters of a Mr Gamsakhurdia outside the parliament for more than three months there were piles of ashes. On a table a chess set had somehow survived the fires. One old woman tutted angrily as she surveyed the scene. 'Nothing good will come of this,' she muttered, before displaying the ambivalent attitude towards dictatorship typical of her generation. 'Stalin would never have allowed all this.'</p>

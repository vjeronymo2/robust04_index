			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Management: Change for change's sake - The perils of initiative fatigue Initiative 'fatigue' is creeping into some British companies. A study of innovation and the initiatives designed to encourage it suggests that some managers have been more concerned with change for the sake of it rather than actually achieving anything. The research is by Bob Sweeting of the School of Management at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, who has been looking at whether government-sponsored initiatives and agencies trying to change the industrial infrastructure really do work. Sweeting says initiative fatigue is characterised by a fall in morale as one innovative initiative follows another with little or no apparent benefit for the effort of making the changes. This leads to change becoming an end in itself. Worse, those in charge, or closely related to the changes, institutionalise the process to justify themselves, so that the initiatives become catalysts for empire building. This in turn leads to something even worse. 'The same people also become celebrities, much called upon by outside agencies to talk to others about the changes . . . this becomes very time-consuming,' Sweeting says. 'There was a clear feeling among managers that a balance was required between giving innovative changes credibility, visibility and support, while keeping a clear view of what the business was all about and what customers really needed and were prepared to pay for - and in sufficient quantities to ensure financial viability and achieve growth objectives for the company.' Previous research by Sweeting into new accountancy techniques demonstrated that some managers embrace novel methods in search of panaceas, rather than through understanding their problems and how - or whether - to use the new techniques to solve them. 'Innovation' seems to attract many of the same followers. The more knowing among interviewees had learned from experience that innovation in itself was no substitute for a well-rounded, grounded and robust business approach. Sweeting says: 'Some companies highlighted as exemplars of manufacturing process excellence were at the same time struggling for commercial survival.' Sweeting says the local social, cultural and business environment often plays a large part in success. Entrepreneurship is driven by a common culture, or shared attitudes. Sometimes these are based on an elitist group, or a family network, or widespread educational attainment. A modern example is Silicon Valley; an earlier one lies in north-west England during the industrial revolution. 'A dynamic period of change in recent decades has left manufacturing industry in north-west England disoriented and ill-positioned. However, one of the key findings of this study is that it is vital to prevent initiative fatigue. Constant innovative change blunts enthusiasm and reduces the chance of new initiatives working,' Sweeting warns. He says 'management socialising' can play a part in improvements as networks form and people understand better why initiatives work or fail and which might be best for them. He also thinks the government should support a guide to agencies charged with promoting innovation, to help companies shop around for the most appropriate. Too many agencies have secure funding for their first two or three years only. They begin by doing what they are supposed to for 90 per cent of the time but later spend a similar amount of time trying to secure further funding as the money runs out.</p>

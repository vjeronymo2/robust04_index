			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LURE OF LAGUNA IS SUBJECT OF SUIT;  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS ALLEGE FRAUD  </P> <P> George and Yolanda Davis always loved Laguna Beach. For 30 years, they came  down from San Mateo, Calif., each summer for a vacation on its balmy, breezy  beaches.  </P> <P> And when it came time for George to retire from his job as a restaurant supply  salesman last year, the Davises thought they had found the ideal spot: a  two-story, three-bedroom home off El Toro Road which, according to the sales  brochures, signs and documents, appeared to be in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Or so they thought.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the Laguna Audubon tract home the Davises bought for $233,900  is not in the city of Laguna Beach at all. Instead, it is in the planned  community of Aliso Viejo, across the street from an apartment and town home  complex that is in Laguna Beach. And the Davises are hopping mad.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, they and the owners of about 140 other homes filed a lawsuit in  Orange County Superior Court against the Kathryn G. Thompson Development Co.,  the general partner of Laguna Audubon, and other companies involved in the home  sales. The homeowners allege that Thompson and the other companies -- the  Saddleback Escrow Co. and Martin Advertising Agency -- fraudulently misled them  into buying houses they believed were in the city of Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Attorney Scott Karlin, who is handling the case for the Laguna Audubon  homeowners, said they are asking for $5 million in compensatory damages and  unspecified punitive damages. "We're asking for the difference between the  value of a property in Laguna Beach versus Laguna Hills," Karlin said. "The  estimates range from $30,000 to $100,000 per house."  </P> <P> The Kathryn G. Thompson Development Co. referred calls about the lawsuit to its  attorney, Angelo Palmieri, who declined comment.  </P> <P> Joe Martin of Martin Advertising, which handled the advertising for the Laguna  Audubon project, also declined to respond.  </P> <P> The Davises, and other homeowners who are suing the developers, had plenty to  say.  </P> <P> "The contract of sale says 'Laguna Beach,' " said Estella Chaidez, a neighbor  of the Davises, holding the document in question as proof. She paid $213,900  for her house on Hummingbird Lane. "If it says 'Laguna Beach,' I expect to live  in Laguna Beach."  </P> <P> The homeowners point to brochures, business cards given to them by the  development's sales agents, floor plans and billboards that appear to suggest  that Laguna Audubon is part of Laguna Beach. One billboard -- it has since been  removed -- virtually screamed at motorists that the address was "LAGUNA BEACH."  Sales brochures described the project as in "the Laguna Beach area" or in "the  coastal highlands of Laguna Beach."  </P> <P> Before the Laguna Audubon homeowners moved in, they were sent license plate  frames that said "Laguna Beach" across the top and "Laguna Audubon" at the  bottom. And just before they moved, the sales agents gave them a list of useful  phone numbers, including the numbers for Laguna Beach police and fire  departments -- neither of which serves the development.  </P> <P> "We finally found out we didn't live in Laguna Beach when a neighbor took his  dog to get registered at the city pound," said George Davis. "They told him he  didn't live in the city."  </P> <P> The development is in the 92656 ZIP code, which for about a year did have a  Laguna Beach mailing address, according to Laguna Beach postal Supt. William J.  Aspinwall. About a year ago, the Mission Viejo Co., which is the major  developer of the Aliso Viejo planned community, got Aliso Viejo recognized in  the National ZIP Code directory.  </P> <P> For Davis and other homeowners, though, the matter is more important than an  address on an envelope.  </P> <P> "Aliso Viejo -- what's that, a subdivision of Tijuana?" Davis said. "I thought  we were buying in Laguna Beach. . . . Let's face it, I wouldn't have moved here  if we had known."  </P></p>

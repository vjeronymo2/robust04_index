			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRADO'S LONG SCORING RUN EARNS EL MODENA A VICTORY  </P> <P> Quarterback Jose Prado found the opening when he needed it to lead El Modena  High's football team to a 7-0 victory over Sunny Hills in nonleague game Friday  at Buena Park High School.  </P> <P> The crowd of 1,000 saw El Modena (1-1) take possession after a Sunny Hills'  punt on the Sunny Hills 41.  </P> <P> On first down, Prado found an opening and went 41 yards down the left sideline  and scored with 2:45 remaining in the fourth quarter. Prado, who had attempted  two field goals that fell short of the goalpost, kicked the conversion.  </P> <P> "If I had to play games like this one seven days a week I would probably be 102  years old," El Modena Coach Bill Backstrom said.  </P> <P> "Our kids played above their heads and rose to the occasion. Our offense scored  when it had to and our defense played as a unit to come up with the big plays,"  Backstrom said.  </P> <P> Freddie Romo recovered two Sunny Hills fumbles and had one interception for El  Modena. Dan Biello sacked Sunny Hills' quarterback Hakeim McKenzie and  recovered a fumbled punt.  </P> <P> "They played good defense against us and we played good defense against them,"  said Sunny Hills (1-1) coach Tim Devaney, "but El Modena executed well and we  didn't."

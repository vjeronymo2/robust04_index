The PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] was skeptical  of  the magistrate's work and his being able to clarify the murder  of the Institutional Revolutionary Party presidential candidate.  The PRD has argued Montes is a friend of President Salinas and  that does not guarantee the success of his mission. [passage  omitted]</p>

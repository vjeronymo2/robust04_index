			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commodity's high status in a changing industry Sir, As someone who has spent almost 40 years in and around the plantation industry, I was greatly interested in your article about the changes which have occurred during that period ('There was some corner of a foreign field', December 30). Although I have been much involved with palm oil, and to some extent concerned in the fortunes of tea, coffee, cocoa, and coconut, my first loyalty was always to King Rubber, and it is to this fascinating commodity that I have returned in my later business years. Its status as an industrial commodity today is high, and the services performed by the world markets in ensuring its successful carriage from its tropical home to its manifold consumers are very important. So I make no apology in reminding your readers that behind any growers' association there must be an efficient means of distribution. This close connection between the agricultural and the marketing sides is, in the case of natural rubber, of long standing, and dates back to 1913, when the Rubber Growers' Association was a founder member of our predecessor, the Rubber Trade Association of London. It is therefore a source of pleasure that the Tropical Growers' Association is planning to join us once more in our offices here, and we should not want it to be felt that, on its journey from 'Dickensian offices above a Chinese restaurant' to 'cheaper premises in Barking', it is descending into a subterranean world where its presence will be inappropriate. It should perhaps be mentioned that our association's current chairman is Peter Hadsley-Chaplin, son of Edwin Hadsley-Chaplin, a former chairman of the TGA, which surely demonstrates that the bonds between ourselves and the growers remain strong. J M Hobbs, executive director, The Association of the Inter-national Rubber Trade, Wigham House, 1st Floor, 16-30 Wakering Road, Barking, IG11 8PG</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional puts London &amp; Metropolitan in the black London &amp; Metropolitan, the property developer that was forced into a second financial restructuring last year, yesterday announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10.2m for 1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 19.6m incurred in the previous year. Profits were buoyed by a Pounds 20.2m exceptional item as a result of the restructuring, primarily from the write-back of provisions. However, the company remains hampered by its sole overseas project, the Pont Royal resort in southern France. L&amp;M made a Pounds 7.7m provision against its share of the cost of the project, reflecting disappointing sales during 1993. The directors said the company was in better shape following its latest restructuring, a debt-for-equity swap. Debts were down by Pounds 54m to Pounds 73.3m, and negative shareholders funds amounted to Pounds 4.93m, against a negative Pounds 60.33m in 1992. Mr Chris Harris, chairman, said: 'We've got the company back to a position where we can now take advantage of opportunities coming out of the improvement in the UK market.' However, its problems are not over. The company was brought to the brink by its involvement in the collapsed consortium to redevelop County Hall, and its joint venture development of Pont Royal remains critical. L&amp;M is carrying Pounds 45m of floating rate debt from its exposure to the French project, and sales last year did not cover interest costs. In the UK, business was said to be looking better. L&amp;M is project manager for Value Retail, which plans a number of US-style factory outlet shopping centres. The first, in Bicester, will open in spring 1995 and Mr Harris said it was 25 per cent pre-let, with a further 50 per cent at an advanced stage of negotiation. L&amp;M has an option to take a 15 per cent stake in the company. Overall, the group's UK operations contributed operating profits of Pounds 2.5m for the year, while interest costs were were reduced from Pounds 12.46m to Pounds 4.79m.</p>

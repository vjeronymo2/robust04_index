			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, April 24 (TANJUG) -- The command of the  7th Corps of the Moslem force ordered its units which are in  close contact with forces of the Serb Republic army to open fire  on all NATO planes which fly over the line of separation, TANJUG  learned from well informed Bosnian Serb military sources. The  sources said that the 7th Corps of the Moslem force, in charge  of central Bosnia-Herzegovina, had issued this order so that the  blame for the possible downing of NATO planes, with a strong  media campaign, could be pinned on the Bosnian Serb army and  their ground positions punished. This would not be the first  time that Moslem forces down NATO aircraft. In June last year,  Moslems downed an Italian transport plane, the sources said,  adding that world media had given little coverage to the  incident although it had been proved, so that the Moslem  leadership still relied on this support.</p>

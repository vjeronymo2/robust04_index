			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shvetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Russia plans to send  2,500-3,000 peace keepers to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict to implement the agreement on ceasefire and  disengagement of forces in Abkhazia, which was signed on May 13,  Russian Deputy Defence Minister Gyorgiy Kondratyev told  journalists here on Tuesday.    The general participates in the talks between the defence  ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow.    The draft document on dispatching of Russian peace keepers  to  Abkhazia was submitted to President Boris Yeltsin for approval.    The deputy defence minister noted that the peace-keeping  force will be stationed in the security zone along the Inguri  river as well as in the Galskiy district and the Kodorskoye  Gorge to control the ceasefire and assist the return of refugees  and displaced persons.    Kondratyev claimed that differences in the Georgian  parliament will not interfere with the implementation of the  agreement signed in Moscow. "Wisdom should subdue ambitions.  The present situation in Georgia is less advantageous than that  in Abkhazia. Therefore, its leadership should make some  concessions," the general said.    According to the Moscow agreement, apart from disengagement  of the sides along the Inguri river, the Georgian side is to  withdraw its troops to places of their deployment outside  Abkhazia from the Kodorskoye Gorge under the control of a  peace-keeping force from the Commonwealth of Independent States  (CIS) and U.N. observers.    At the same time, all voluntary detachments which arrived  from outside Abkhazia, should be disbanded and withdrawn.    The sides requested the Council of the heads of CIS member  states to take a decision on the use of collective peace keepers  in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    ITAR-TASS learnt at the press service of the Georgian  Embassy  in Moscow that it is highly probable that peace keepers will  enter the conflict zone on June 1. The process of disengagement  is to be completed no longer than within ten days from the time  of its beginning.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Road ahead for Irish premier well signposted Mr John Bruton, Ireland's new premier, has a boyish candour which often makes him seem out of place in the wheeler-dealing atmosphere of Irish politics. Yet, after his more than 20 years in the Dail, there are few politicians with a more acute knowledge of the workings of parliament. At 47, and with a wealth of ministerial portfolios under his belt, the real question is whether he has the qualities of diplomacy and political toughness that Ireland needs at this watershed in its history. Ireland is entering uncharted waters. The Northern Ireland peace process is at a critical juncture as paramilitaries enter exploratory talks with UK officials and unionists await the publication of the important joint framework document which London and Dublin hope will form the basis for all-party talks on Ulster's future. Mr Bruton will enter the process at the head of an uneasy coalition of conservative and radical elements led by Fine Gael, an essentially conservative party, and including Labour, the party of modern European secular politics, and the Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA. Personality problems may resurface. Mr Bruton believes he was let down when Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Labour party, went into coalition with Fianna Fail in 1992. The two politicians also squabbled over economic policy in the last Fine Gael-Labour coalition, which fell in 1987. Today one key difference is that not only is there a shared determination to keep Fianna Fail out of office, but the economy's strength will make decisions on sensitive issues like public spending less divisive. Mr Bruton's first task is to assert control over his own party machine. A challenge in the short term is unlikely but any slip could precipitate one. The policy objectives are well signposted. On Northern Ireland, Mr Bruton's team will have to pick up where the outgoing government left off, while stamping its own character on the peace process. How he will balance the need to keep hardline republicans harnessed to the peace process, without compromising his sympathies for the northern unionists, is difficult to see. In a deliberately low-key acceptance address to the Dail last week, Mr Bruton stressed his greatest concern was to see progress sustained. If the outgoing administration secured the peace, he said, his task would be to foster the 'reconciliation' of the island's two religious traditions. In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on Friday, his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein (the IRA's political wing), provided little more than a cursory handshake. Few believe Mr Bruton can replicate the rapport Fianna Fail enjoyed with the republicans. Fine Gael, historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 which enshrined partition, is still not comfortable with Sinn Fein. But in Mr Prionsias De Rossa, Democratic Left leader, Mr Bruton will have a useful ally. A former IRA internee, Mr De Rossa provides ample evidence of the benefits that accrue to those republicans who abandon the bullet in favour of the ballot box. On social questions like divorce and abortion there is more common ground between the parties. Mr Bruton campaigned in favour of legalising divorce when it was last put to a referendum in 1986. All three parties seem agreed it may be over-ambitious to contemplate winning backing in a referendum substantive reforms legalising abortion, although there may be a good chance of passing legislation on an abortion information bill allowing women to be referred by doctors to specialists outside Ireland. Perhaps the area where there will be most strain will be on the economy. Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is the party of low taxation and tight spending. Labour and the more radical Democratic Left will want to take a more Keynesian approach, injecting spending into the economy to create jobs and reduce the burden of poverty for the lower paid and unemployed. Mr Bruton's first test is to see a new budget through parliament. Democratic Left, in charge of the big spending social welfare portfolio, is expected to push for a mildly expansionary budget in an attempt to ease unemployment. Mr Bruton's budget record is far from convincing. In 1982, when he was finance minister in Dr Garret Fitzgerald's coalition, his attempts to impose VAT on child clothing and shoes was opposed by independents. This led to the defeat of his budget, and eventually the coalition's downfall.</p>

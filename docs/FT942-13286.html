			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Hamburg 'aid' finding annulled  -European Court The European Court of Justice has annulled a European Commission decision declaring certain aids given by the city of Hamburg unlawful. The Court said the decision was flawed because it failed to state the reasons on which it was based. The case concerned money paid to companies in the Hamburg area. Under Rome treaty rules, any state aid must be notified. The Commission requested information from the German government which provided some details of the money paid. The Commission then opened a state aid procedure in respect of the grants. Once the procedure had been opened, the German authorities gave more details of the aid paid. It also sent data to the Commission under the title Stopping the Exodus of Companies. The Commission adopted a decision which found that a general programme of aid existed which was aimed at stopping the exodus of companies from Hamburg and that this programme was illegal and the aid should be reimbursed. Both the German government and one of the companies which had received some of the aid brought actions before the European Court. One of the grounds on which the parties sought the annulment of the Commission decision was that there were insufficient reasons given in the decision in support of the findings. The parties contested the existence of a general aid programme. They said the decision set out no evidence to justify the Commission's finding that there had been a programme of aid granted by the city of Hamburg aimed at stopping the exodus of companies from the locality. In its decision, the Commission stated that, apart from the cases of which it was aware, it presumed that other companies had also received aid under the programme. It admitted an aid programme particular to Hamburg did not exist, but then stated that the grants were all made by the same institution with the same aid and from the same budget The Commission therefore concluded that all the elements of an aid programme were present and that it was not necessary to investigate each grant of aid to determine whether if affected trade between member states. The Court ruled first that the Commission decision did not identify any legal act establishing an aid programme. The Court then investigated the reasons given by the Commission for treating the aids granted as part of an aid programme. One was that all the grants were made to stop companies leaving Hamburg. Even if this were so, it would not be sufficient to show that all the individual aid granted fell within the same programme. The other reasons advanced also failed to establish that the aid was part of a general programme. The Commission's final argument was that it had been entitled to reach the conclusion it did because, in default of notification and lack of full disclosure by the German government, the only evidence on which it could base its findings was fragmentary. The Court rejected this argument. In a previous case, the Court had ruled that once the Commission became aware of state aid which had been granted without prior notification, it had the power, having given the member state in question the opportunity to comment on the position, to demand in a provisional decision that the aid in question be suspended pending investigation. It could also demand to be given all information necessary to determine whether the aid was compatible with the common market. It was only when a member state failed to furnish information following such a request that the Commission had the power to close the procedure and take a final decision on the legality of the aid. In the present case, it had never formally demanded Germany supply all the relevant information. In such circumstances, it was unable to hazard a guess as to the existence of a general aid programme on the basis of the grants of which it was aware. The Commission's decision was therefore flawed and should be set aside. Joined cases C-324/90 and C-342/90: Germany and Pleuger Worthington GmbH v Commission, ECJ FC, April 13 1994.</p>

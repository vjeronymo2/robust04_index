			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui told  the National Assembly on Friday [19 May] that under no  circumstances will the Republic of China [ROC] change its name,  flag or anthem.    Several members of the National Assembly had suggested  during  the current session that Taiwan follow the example of South  Africa in adopting a new flag and anthem.    Li said, however, that the conditions under which South  Africa made the changes aren't the same as those in Taiwan.    The DPP [Democratic Progressive Party] in a statement issued  late in the afternoon said that the existing national flag and  anthem were adopted from the Kuomintang's flag and song without  the consent of people in the Taiwan area, and thus represent  neither Taiwan nor China.    It said that a nation must change its name, flag and anthem  following changes in its territory and population structure.    Li also urged the DPP, Taiwan's leading opposition party, to  "value the free and democratic system and dedicate itself to the  solidarity and construction of the island." By so doing, he  said, the DPP may win greater support than the ruling Kuomintang  from the people.    Though Friday was the fourth anniversary of Li's  inauguration, he was attending the National Assembly session as  scheduled to hear a national-affairs discussion and answer  questions raised by assembly members.    Meanwhile, according to National Assembly Secretary-General  Chen Chin-jang, Li has agreed that after the end of the session,  he will meet small groups of assembly members one or two times  each month to solicit their opinions on national affairs.    The National Assembly began its three-month special session  on May 2 in Yangmingshan to consider amendments to the  constitution and the nominations by President Li of grand  justices and the head of the Judicial Yuan.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Avon sets up Saudi venture AVON RUBBER, the UK tyre and automotive components concern, has agreed to a joint venture with a group of Middle Eastern investors to build a Dollars 200m (Pounds 141m) tyre factory in Saudi Arabia. Avon will invest Pounds 2m and will provide technology for the plant in return for a 5 per cent stake in the factory. The rest of the funding is to be provided by a group of Saudi investors. The factory is expected to come on stream in 1995, with initial production targeted at 650,000 tyres a year. It is expected that after five years the plant will produce some 1m tyres - about 20 per cent of overall Saudi demand. In December, Avon announced a 36 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.15m. The group is heavily dependent on the US market where more than 25 per cent of its business is based.</p>

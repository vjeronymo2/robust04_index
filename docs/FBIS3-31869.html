			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Janina </F> Paradowska and Jerzy Baczynski; place and date not given:  "Sometimes It Is Better Not To Say Anything"]    [Text] [POLITYKA] How has the problem inside the coalition  been solved? The communique from the talks does not say much  except that the coalition wants to sit out its full  parliamentary term. But how? What was decided?    [Pawlak] The confusion was largely the result of automatic  processes. There was no tension among the politicians, but  people on the outside thought there was a major problem. This  might be just my own private view, but I think that if less  publicity had been given to this business, the outcome might  have been different.    [POLITYKA] Might Deputy Prime Minister Borowski have kept  his job?    [Pawlak] Quite possibly. In politics one has to watch one's  actions. I am frequently accused of being too quiet and having  poor relations with the media, but I think that sometimes it is  safer to be quiet than to say one word too much. Our partners  simply do not have an easy way out. The Middle East accord  might never have happened if the talks had not taken place in  Norway, far from journalists.    [POLITYKA] But we still do not know why you fired Deputy  Minister Kawalec in such a way.    [Pawlak] We discussed this matter with the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] when the coalition was formed, so it cannot have  come as a surprise. What happened was this. I sent Deputy  Prime Minister Borowski his notice to quit. He refused to  accept it, so I delivered it personally. I fail to see what  this has to do with later events. Later, Borowski's dismissal  was given such prominent media treatment that it was difficult  to shut one's eyes and pretend nothing had happened. I decided  that the best thing to do was to explain everything and put the  whole issue behind me. The decision to dismiss Mr. Borowski was  not an easy and pleasant one either for Mr. Borowski or for me.  But that is how things are in politics. Sometimes, one is on  one side of the barricade, and sometimes on the other. The most  important thing is to have cooperation.    [POLITYKA] You did not expect Kawalec's dismissal to cause  such an avalanche?    [Pawlak] No. I think the significance of the matter has  been exaggerated. But I do not shun responsibility. I realize  it might be the result of my own actions, but I think that each  political group should ask itself whether such an end result  really had to come about.    [POLITYKA] Not just Deputy Prime Minister Borowski, but also  the SLD wanted to tidy up the rules governing cooperation with  the the coalition, the functioning of the Council of Ministers,  personnel policy, and a curb on the powers of the chief of the  Office of the Council of Ministers.    [Pawlak] I have never heard that the powers of the chief of  the Office of the Council of Ministers should be curbed.    [POLITYKA] But we have. The SLD has spoken out loudly about  it.    [Pawlak] Be that as it may, but we have never discussed this  at the coalition forum. You see what happens when people gossip  in public? Misunderstandings occur.    [POLITYKA] We understand that other postulates have been  presented to you. So what have you decided?    [Pawlak] I think the communique presents quite clearly the  compromise that was reached. Basically, we decided that  government issues would be discussed and resolved at government  level, and coalition issues at coalition level. There must be a  clear distinction between the government and the coalition. As  far as the functioning of the government is concerned, I realize  that there are many discrepancies. Soon after I became prime  minister we entered a difficult period, for we had to work out a  budget, after which the Sejm Committee debates started. This  prevented me from taking a closer look at administrative  procedures and the entire administrative system. Our  administration may function far more efficiently if it tidies  itself up. A central office or ministry, and even a provincial  office, sometimes functions according to its own principles.  Some operations are common to all administrative units, such as  book-keeping, organization, and communications, but often there  is no comparison between the way one office performs them and  the way another does. Such problems occur in every office, and  yet the administration must be functional.    [POLITYKA] But let us return to the crisis and the solving  thereof. Are we to understand that the SLD has accepted your  personnel policy, for example your changes to governor posts?  Aleksander Kwasniewski has accused you of nepotism.    [Pawlak] That is not true. There are just as many Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] governors as there are SLD governors.    [POLITYKA] No. Almost every single governor belongs to the  PSL.    [Pawlak] As fare as deputy governors are concerned, there is  a difference. Deputy goverors are appointed by the prime  minister, but at the governors' recommendation. So I have no  influence on whether a candidate for deputy governor belongs to  the PSL or SLD.    [POLITYKA] So PSL people are not hungry for posts? We  thought they were.    [Pawlak] There was a time when we never discussed posts. It  was one of the coalition partners who announced the need to  replace a few governors and deputy ministers. You did not know  that. In the United States, nobody objects when a new president  comes into office and the entire administration is replaced top  to bottom. No one talks about nepotism.    [POLITYKA] We believe that today in Poland, the policy is  to adopt any kind of system, as long as it works. Right now  everything is geared toward a certain political model.    [Pawlak] No, we are not pursuing a personnel policy that is  geared toward any political model. Some old employees have  remained, and others have left. During this time of change, it  is important not to create the impression that we are writing  off people immediately because of their party membership or  political convictions. That way, we would lose qualified  people. But there are changes, there have to be. If we want  politics to undergo at least a slight change, then we must  replace some personnel.    [POLITYKA] You said that government issues should be kept  distinct from coalition issues. But such a distinction is  impossible. The government has been formed by a specific  coalition, and the government's operation is governed by the  coalition pact. Is this pact still in force?    [Pawlak] In every coalition, key issues should be governed  by agreements. However, the members of the government should  have freedom of action. When we talk of a violation of  agreements, am I the only one who violates them? I am not going  to tell you about all the surprise moves that have taken me  unawares, because that is an internal government matter. These  matters must be set in order, there is no doubt about that.    [POLITYKA] The sequence of events was as follows: First  there was a personnel dispute, the SLD turned it into a dispute  concerning authority, and you interpreted this as a political  dispute concerning differences in the assessment of economic  policy. How differently from each other do the SLD and PSL view  economic policy?    [Pawlak] Differences occur not just between the parties that  form the coalition. They also occur within a particular party,  in the SLD and in the PSL. But the general path of reform  pursued since 1989 is not being questioned by anyone. We are  all committed to democracy and a free market. The problem is  what kind of solutions we apply, what kind of economic processes  we set in motion, and how we handle privatization. And last but  not least, the speed of these changes is also significant.    [POLITYKA] Differences between parties are rather hazy, we  find it hard to accept that there are no strong groups that  question the basic path of reforms. There is no doubt that in  the eyes of the West, Marek Borowski and the SLD have become the  main guarantors of continuing the reforms.    [Pawlak] You are thinking in socialist terms. You make it  sound as if this party is guaranteeing the chosen path of the  reforms. This reminds us of the past when, in addition, this  guarantee was enshrined in the Constitution. By the way, I  remember people saying in September and October that democracy  and the market changes might be in danger if the SLD and PSL won  the elections. But when I was in Brussels, I had the impression  that my interlocutors were not so much interested in my party  affiliation as in my policies and actions. In Brussels they  were not interested in noble declarations that we want to join  NATO as quickly as possible. They were interested in the  practical measures that we were implementing in order to reach  that objective. For the West and for out own society, effective  solutions are the best guarantees, and no single person or party  has exclusivbe rights to them. We must also be flexible and  revise our opinions from time to time. One could have taken an  easier path and drawn up a better budget, better from the point  of view of accountancy, a budget with secure income and low  expenditure. But would the economy and the population have  withstood it? If we say that there is a general and firm desire  to build a market economy and democratic system, we have to know  that there are other paths that lead to this goal.    [POLITYKA] So, along what path do you and your government  want to lead us?    [Pawlak] First, we have to establish what our main problems  are, and there is no doubt that such problems are the drop in  production and the sky-high increase in unemployment. Last year  we experienced economic growth. In order to continue it this  year, given society's present standards of living, we must on  the one hand concentrate on expanding the domestic market, and  on the other hand increase exports of our products. We have  been experiencing an increasing trade deficit in recent years.  Poland, a poor country, has become an exporter of capital.  This problem requires very precise actions, which is why from  the very beginning my government has been laying emphasis not  just on security, but on economic issues, and saying all the  time how important it is to have a trade balance. The accords  that we have concluded with the European Union contain an  imbalance in our favor, but in financial practice the situation  is quite the opposite, because various non-tariff barriers are  being applied.    We propose concrete solutions to revive the domestic market.  It is true that budget requirements necessitate an increase in  taxation, but we are increasing the tax on private incomes, and  not on the profits of firms. We have also introduced a system  of concessions for investment. I am not saying this system is  perfect and that everyone will reap benefits from it, but those  with profitable enterprises can allocate income for investment  purposes. One can also take a look at the solutions applied in  other countries. The general principle of buying Polish goods  before other goods is not recognized by our media, and yet that  would be the best way to help our economy. Of course, our  Polish products do not always match our wishes, but prosperous  countries also promote their own products. Therefore we have  undertaken concrete activity to point the economic processes in  a slightly different direction. We have not made a 180-degree  turn, there is no need to do so, but nevertheless we are clearly  altering the method of implementing the reforms.    [POLITYKA] I think most people, including opposition  politicians, will agree with what you have just said, but in  your last television interview you said that the budget must be  made more socially friendly, and people think that that means  increasing consumption.    [Pawlak] Surely investment projects and the creation of new  jobs are socially friendly activities? I repeat, one can  restrict oneself to activities that provide an easy budget. But  the point is not to have a budget that is easy for the  accountants to manage, but to have one that provides social and  economic effects.    [POLITYKA] One can have a budget that is financially easy,  and one can have a budget that is politically easy. A  financially easy budget is usually politically difficult. The  present budget has not been badly received, but people have the  impression that you and some of the parties oppose it, and that  you would prefer a politically easier budget.    [Pawlak] It is difficult for me to explain away people's  impressions. As I said, there are even differences inside each  party. But when a budget is drawn up and certain financial  proportions are proposed, the final version is never the only  correct one. The present draft budget was drawn up at the end  of December, so there are going to be adjustments to it. But  its basic financial proportions will not be touched. The Sejm  committees have indicated the possibility of changes in  spending, and it has transpired that last year's budget deficit  was less than expected. So changes are possible. Not major  ones, but important all the same.    [POLITYKA] So a socially friendly budget does not mean  greater spending on social benefits, pensions, and subsidies?    [Pawlak] Of course it does, but it means more than just  that.    [POLITYKA] Today you are facing a picket of miners outside  your offices, and a great Solidarity strike. Do you not feel  that the state should abandon its role as entrepreneur?    [Pawlak] That is our aim. We want the chairmen of  enterprise management boards to decide how their enterprises  should be managed, because these are people who concentrate on  economic matters. Some old habits have to be eliminated, such  as the habit of writing to the prime minister when there is a  problem about an enterprise's functioning, instead of solving  the problem at management level or provincial level. But  generally speaking, it is far easier to say we want a free  market and democracy than to bring these things about in  practice. One really needs a lot of ideas to dispense with old  habits. But I think there is a chance of success. For example,  in neglected areas, we can introduce modern technology  immediately. If the Poles could not get used to the industrial  age because the idea of working on an assembly line and  producing the same piece of equipment for eight hours was alien  to them, they will certainly have to do so now that we are in a  difficult situation, with a recession in Poland and the West,  and we have to seek new ideas and solutions everywhere.    Every country and society is struggling to achieve a good  position. We still have to learn how to play this game, and to  play it together with others. In Poland, the situation is still  similar to that of two farmers, one of whom has one cow, and the  other has five, and the farmer with only one cow, instead of  praying for another four cows, prays that four cows belonging to  the other farmer will drop dead. This is part of our mentality,  and it is worth pondering over this.</p>

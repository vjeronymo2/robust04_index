			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Ghost story turned parable - Fiction THE GOD-FEARER by Dan Jacobson Bloomsbury, Pounds 13.99 159 pages DAN JACOBSON'S new novel appears, at first glance, to be a simple fable, set in a re-invented European past, where the known order is reversed, and the Christians (or 'Christers', in Jacobson's deliberate blurring of historical nomenclature) are the minority in every middle-European village, their customs barely known and even less understood. Kobus the Bookbinder is nearing death and, as age fingers him (the description of the effects of age is one of the striking felicities of this most humane of books), he is visited by what appear to be gentle ghosts. Two small children, appear in his house, quietly playing. Dressed in 'Christer' garb, they continue to reappear, tormenting him with their quiet, inexorable presence, otherwise completely unthreatening. It is the realisation of who these Kindly Ones are which leads Kobus to a complete re-examination of his morally threadbare life and, at the end, to some gesture towards expiation, resolution and peace. 'Unspent possibilities, lives denied, stories never told, never taken, soul forever houseless, hopes foregone: existing only in the perpetual present of what never was and never would be'. They are the legacy, the unborn children or grandchildren of a Christer girl whom once, in his youth, Kobus failed to help, as she was on trial for witchcraft. The story of Kobus's friend Malachi, who became a religious fanatic after a period of madness which was alleged by gossip and rumour to have been caused by Sannie the Christer girl, is another strand in this novel which, starting as fable, widens to become a stern moral appraisal of prejudice, weakness, political expediency. It has particular relevance for the disintegrating certainties of today's Europe. What starts as a mere ghost story is transformed by Jacobson into a multi-layered parable: the simple outline is given the weight of legend and the breadth conferred by modern psychoanalytical knowledge. At the same time, the reader is carried along by the power of the story-telling. Jacobson is one writer who has always known that if you want get the message across, you have to have a good tale to tell, and, in this novel, he has more than one good tale: narratives which, in their simplicity, grip and focus the attention. By playing fast and loose with historical accuracy, Jacobson raises the endless, essential question, 'What if it had been us and not them . . ?' and, by raising it, calls for tolerance, understanding, courage to speak up. There are also dream sequences which have a visionary quality of such power that one is reminded of Bunyan. And at the core of the book is the crucial point at which Kobus fails to give evidence to support the poor child accused of witchcraft. He has evaded the one moment when he could have made something of his life and he has to wait futilely until the child-Furies catch up with him before realising it. Only then does he understand the relief that the Kindly Ones can bring. This novel is Jacobson at his most forthright and thought-provoking as well as at the height of his stylistic powers.</p>

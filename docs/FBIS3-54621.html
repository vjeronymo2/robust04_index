The meetings lasted  two days.    The minutes were signed for Iraq by Transport and  Communications Minister Ahmad Murtada and for Jordan by  Transport Minister Adib Halasah.    At the signing ceremony, Ahmad Murtada stressed Iraq's  eagerness to promote cooperation with fraternal Jordan,  especially in transportation.    Jordanian Transport Minister Adib Halasah asserted his  country's eagerness to enhance cooperation with Iraq, especially  at this stage during which the Iraqi people are suffering as a  result of an unjust embargo which has no legal foundations  whatsoever.    The minutes approved the company's financial and operational  report for last year, as well as the transport operations of the  company's trucks inside the two fraternal countries.    The director general of the Iraqi-Jordanian Overland  Transport Company told INA the minutes also provide for 100 more  trucks to be added to the fleet traveling between Iraq and  Jordan, thus raising its total to 520 trucks.</p>

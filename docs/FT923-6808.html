			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lec Refrigeration halved to Pounds 320,000 Pre-tax profits of Lec Refrigeration, a maker of refrigeration equipment and associated products, fell by 54 per cent to Pounds 320,00 for the six months to June 30. The deepening recession hit sales which fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 24.2m). However, actions previously taken to contain production costs ensured that the company stayed in profit. Earnings per share were cut to 3.54p (7.75p) but the interim dividend is held at 4p. The new 'turbo' larder refrigerators introduced in June had been well received, directors said, and they hoped to increase market share in the second half. However, they expected no overall improvement until there was a recovery in the housing market.</p>

Under the decree, each victim is entitled to a lump sum in  compensation money equivalent to 100 minimal wages in the first  stage. The federal government is expected to raise Rbl [rubles]  27 Bn to this end.    "Generally speaking, no indemnity can compensate the losses  sustained by the Balkarian people. The question is one of  partial compensation as an indication of full rehabilitation of  the people falling victim to purges", Zamakulov said. In his  words, any delay of the process will cause a negative response  on the ground.    Zamakulov also insists that one-time benefits be paid not  only to the victims themselves, but also to their family members  including their children born in places of resettlement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 13 SAPA -- Diverting resources from  defence to the government's Reconstruction and Development  Programme [RDP] would enhance rather than undermine South  Africans' security, military analyst Laurie Nathan said on  Monday. Mr Nathan, director of the Cape-Town based Centre for  Conflict Resolution, said a number of arguments had been  presented in recent weeks for maintaining or increasing the  defence budget.    The argument that it was necessary to maintain a credible  defence capability was correct as a general principle, but its  application depended on circumstances. South Africa was  over-armed in the regional context as none of the Southern  Africa Development Community states was capable of posing a  military threat. There was no foreseeable military threat from  outside the region.    "The potential in fact exists for a high level of political,  diplomatic and security co-operation in the post-apartheid  southern Africa," he said.    "Disarmament in South Africa would facilitate disarmament  throughout the subcontinent, releasing resources for development  and potentially leading to greater internal stability."    In South Africa the greatest threats to citizens' security  were non-military problems such as poverty, unemployment and a  lack of adequate social services.    "The bottom line is that money spent on defence could  otherwise have been used for development programmes and welfare  services," Mr Nathan said.    To argue that South Africa's foreign policy, particularly in  southern Africa, would depend heavily on a military role was  dangerously close to South Africa's regional policy under  apartheid and would undermine regional confidence.    To claims that the defence budget, at 2.6 per cent of gross  national product, was not high by international standards, Mr  Nathan said the United Nations and World Bank considered two per  cent an acceptable figure for developing countries.    "This benchmark should be regarded as a general guideline  rather than a fixed rule," he said. "It may in fact be too high  in the case of South Africa since current defence spending is  several times greater than total military expenditure in the  rest of the region."    Noting that in 1992/93 Armscor [Armaments Corporation of  South Africa] had made R110 million [rand] from domestic and  foreign sales and received a state subsidy of R10 million, he  said it was "untenable" to say ethical considerations should  play no part in the arms trade.    Weapons were not a neutral commodity and it was not "overly  pious" to ask whether South Africa wanted to boost its economy  through killings in other countries.    The defence establishment could not seek to maintain a large  budget on the grounds of international instability and  simultaneously contribute to that instability through arms  exports.    Mr Nathan said South Africa had to establish clear foreign  and national security policies and conduct a transparent  investigation of its arms industry before it could make rational  decisions about the defence budget.    It required a clear policy on arms exports and a way of  overseeing whatever criteria were laid down. Ways to cut the  defence budget should also be investigated.    All of these objectives should be open to public debate, he  said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Charlotte Ruck: "Legislation Goes Marching On"] </F>   [Text] About 50,000 derelict, polluted industrial sites  have been identified to date in eastern and western Germany.  Although the plots of ground concerned often constitute prime  inner-city sites, the local authorities usually seek investors  in vain. The risk of acquiring a plot that conceals an old dump  is much too great. The ensuing costs would be incalculable.    This dilemma is particularly great in the new federal  laender. Local authorities are under enormous pressure to  attract investors to create jobs and raise tax revenue.  However, as the derelict sites are unsalable, business areas  are springing up all over the place in green belts. As a  result, the landscape is being unnecessarily spoiled, despite  the fact that areas with full infrastructure facilities are  already available.  <H5>  Special Attention </H5>   For this reason, the derelict site issue is receiving  special  attention, particularly in the new federal laender. The local  and land-level authorities are pressing on with both the  identification and hazard assessment of likely areas and their  reclamation. For instance, Thuringia has had a law on waste  management and derelict sites since as early as 1991.    It is also expected that the law on investment incentives  and  residential building land, which came into force on 1 May 1993,  will also give a major boost. Operators of dump reclamation  facilities can hope for simpler, speedier licensing procedures.  Indeed, the last few months have seen a boom in the  establishment of new stationary soil conditioning facilities,  particularly in the new federal laender.  <H5>  Simplified Licensing </H5>   According to Hamburg-based Nordac, which examined the  consequences of the law on investment incentives at a symposium  held in November 1993, there are currently over 150 facilities  with annual capacities ranging from 3,000 to 200,000 tonnes at  the planning or licensing stage, under construction, or already  in operation.    The law on mobile polluted site conditioning plants is  making  a particularly strong impact. Although these plants were  subject to just as comprehensive a licensing procedure as the  stationary facilities before the law was amended, they are now  exempt from licensing if they are operated for less than 12  months on the same site.    The specialists hope that the simplified licensing procedure  will bring an increase in the number of reclamations completed.  At the very least, there ought to be a move away from  containment toward decontamination measures. However, fears are  being voiced in the skeptics' camp that the mobile plant market  will become increasingly crowded with suppliers whose systems  are less than state-of-the-art.    It was expected that increasing competition would lower  prices, but as high-performance systems would necessarily cost  more than, for instance, plants with a lower conditioning  capacity and/or minimum air and effluent treatment functions,  overall quality would fall. Air exhaust and effluent  conditioning systems often accounted for two-thirds of  stationary plants, explained a Nordac spokesman at the symposium.    The state of the art and the degree to which it has been  adopted vary in Germany. Soil conditioning plants, 15 of which  are currently operating throughout the Federal Republic, present  an advanced level of development, but the situation with thermal  plants is quite different: To date, there is only one trial  plant running in the whole of Germany. Other countries are  further ahead in this field, the Netherlands, for instance,  having several plants in operation. As numerous licenses for  thermal plants are currently pending, experts assume that this  technology will soon be available in Germany as well.    The state of the art for biological processes is well  defined, particularly for on-site processes, although  disillusionment is spreading as to on-site reclamation  strategies -- those not involving the removal of soil -- say  insiders. The scope for using these processes is proving  limited.  <H5>  Clearly Defined Ceilings Called For </H5>   Even more than simplified licensing procedures for  reclamation plants, clearly defined ceilings for soil  contaminants are being called for. The lack of certainty as to  how far a reclamation project has to go is a major factor in  discouraging many people from even considering a project of this  type. The regulations on soil conservation are currently  scattered over several areas of legislation (e.g. laws on water,  air, and waste disposal). In addition, some laender have their  own statutory regulations on polluted sites.    Great hopes are being vested in the soil conservation bill  currently being drafted, the purpose of which will be to  conserve the soil in its multiplicity of functions, to safeguard  it against hazardous modifications, to remedy damage that has  already been done, and to prevent such damage from affecting  mankind and the environment. A comprehensive range of  procedures for conditioning polluted sites is also envisaged.  <H5>  Basis for Technical Directive on Soil </H5>   However, the primary purpose of the law is to create the  prerequisites for incorporating soil conservation requirements  into statutory orders and administrative provisions. In  particular, the law will form the basis for the Technical  Directive on Soil, in which binding values will be laid down for  the soil, with regulations on prevention and hazard aversion to  the fore. Today's large number of lists of soil ceiling values  will thus be replaced by a single, nationwide system of rules.    An inventory of various assessment aids and recommendations  for treating contaminated soils has been commissioned by a  Laender Waste Management Association working party. It emerges  from this inventory that recommended soil values are currently  largely set with reference to the purposes for which the land is  used and the resources to be preserved.    Based on significance and function, experts from the Ruhr  District's Institute of Hygiene in Gelsenkirchen differentiate  between:    -- Background values: Generally widespread or typical  regional pollutant concentrations in soils outside actual or  suspected polluted sites;    -- Test values: Concentration values in excess of which  further investigations are required, but below which the hazard  risk may be regarded as negligible;    -- Critical values: Maximum concentrations that must not be  exceeded, as individual cases may present an intolerable level  of risk in particular circumstances; in the event of these  values being exceeded, the type and extent of salvage measures  and reclamation methods must be decided without delay;    -- Reclamation target values: Maximum concentrations for  soils to be achieved on site using salvage and reclamation  measures, and wherever possible to be further reduced;    -- Incorporation values: Quality criteria/maximum  concentrations for soils to be incorporated or reincorporated  into multiple-use areas.    In addition to drawing up the actual values, great emphasis  is placed on clearly defining the concepts and on implementing  the recommended values (specifications for sampling and analysis  procedures, for instance). There is still a considerable need  for coordination in establishing the figures for various types  of ground use.  <H5>  Far-Reaching Ideas </H5>   It emerged clearly from the "Environmental Conservation  Forum," which the Rhineland Technical Monitoring Board organized  in Cologne at the beginning of October 1993, that this is not  all that the representatives of the laender expect of the law on  soil conservation. Dr. Hans-Joachim Pietrzeniuk, representing  the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, stressed the need to create  a full range of facilities for assessing and treating polluted  soil; a soil information system, soil pollution maps, and areas  scheduled for long-term monitoring should all be considered.    The laender's main hope is that financing mechanisms will be  introduced at federal level for measures for which specific  responsibility cannot be apportioned. In view of the federal  and land governments' empty coffers, this could give rise to a  dispute that will be difficult to settle in the near future.  However, if areas are to be made rapidly available for  investors, particularly in the new federal laender, solutions  for financing the requisite reclamation work must be found at an  early date.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S BIKE PATROL PLANNED FOR FILLMORE  </P> <P> In the latest move to fight nocturnal criminals on Fillmore's streets, the  Sheriff's Department is gearing up for a bicycle patrol.  </P> <P> Deputies on the graveyard shift who tour city streets will use mountain bikes  instead of cars, said Lt. Dick Purnell, who heads the Fillmore station.  </P> <P> Fillmore will be the only sheriff's station to use bicycles on the job, other  sheriff's officials said.  </P> <P> "We have them mounted on horses but not on bicycles," Lt. Kathy Kemp said.  </P> <P> Purnell said Fillmore deputies on bicycles can patrol tight and unpaved streets  more quickly and silently than if they were in a car.  </P> <P> "It allows the guys to move quickly in the alleyways and get to their patrol  car quickly if they get a call," Purnell said. "It's a good, effective way to  watch for burglars."  </P> <P> Without the distinctive engine sound and the crackling of a police radio,  deputies are better able to steal up on unsuspecting prowlers, he said.  </P> <P> Deputies have already used mountain bikes on their midnight patrols in  Fillmore. Two months ago, deputies mounted on bicycles caught several prowlers,  Purnell said.  </P> <P> Purnell said he plans to use bikes from the lost and found department. A  bicycle patrol should be in force within a month, he said.  </P> <P> The pastoral city of Fillmore, where surrounding fruit orchards and businesses  in town have fallen victim to small-time thieves, could use a change, City  Council members said.  </P> <P> "A couple of months ago, there was some prowler activity," Mayor John Murphy  said. "I'd love to see it tried."  </P> <P> Murphy said the idea of deputies on bikes, although new to some, is not likely  to shock most city residents.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's going to be anything too novel. We've seen deputies on  horses before," Murphy said. "If it's useful I think the citizens will support  it."  </P> <P> Councilman Roger Campbell said bicycles may make easy work of a foot pursuit.  "It would be a lot quicker and more maneuverable," he said.  </P> <P> Purnell said he got the idea from other cities in Northern California where  police officers regularly use bicycles to patrol metropolitan areas.  </P> <P> Deputies will not be issued bicycles, but the bicycles will be available in the  station if they are needed. Many of the deputies already peddle bicycles to  work, Purnell said.  </P> <P> Sgt. Ken Cozzens, who works out of the Fillmore station, said bicycles may be  useful in catching unsuspecting youth gang members who congregate in the city's  northern barrio. Cozzens said bicycles are easier to use than motorcycles and  keep deputies in shape.  </P> <P> Deputies may see their health improve from cycling on the job, Purnell said.  </P> <P> "It wasn't the intent, but certainly any aerobic exercise is good for you," he  said.  </P></p>

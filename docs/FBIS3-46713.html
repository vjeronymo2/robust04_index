			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- Hong Kol-hui took a bribe  of 10 million won from Samsung Co. when he was foreign  procurement director at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), a  spokesman for the joint military-prosecution team investigating  the arms scam said Tuesday.    Hong, who is already under arrest in connection with the  fraud, was paid off by Pak Tae-chin, a former Samsung board  member. At the time, Hong was involved in the purchase of  reserve engines for the Air Force's C-130 transport planes.    The team may ask Pak to answer the suspicion that he bribed  Hong in connection with his company's tender for the purchase  contract.    The investigation, including tracing the bank accounts of  DLA  Commander Yi Su-ik and his three predecessors (Chang Hong-yol,  Yi Sang-ho and Yi Chun), will continue until Friday, two days  longer than planned, according to sources.    Plans to question Former Defense Security Commander Kim  To-yun have been dropped, they said.</p>

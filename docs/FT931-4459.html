			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Asia-Pacific consumers help Singapore turn up volume: Insatiable demand for electronics goods MR MILIVOJ von Somogy, head of Asia-Pacific operations for European electronics giant SGS-Thomson, has a problem. He cannot produce enough goods to satisfy demand. SGS-Thomson produces about 100m pieces of various computer chips each month at its plants in Singapore. Mr Somogy says the company's semiconductor sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew by 33 per cent last year. 'In the Singapore/Malaysia area our sales now exceed those of either France or Britain and are the same as those of Germany. . . it's no longer a question of orders. Instead it's a question of whether we can supply fast enough.' The SGS-Thomson experience is shared by several other companies based in Singapore and elsewhere in the region. Regional demand for a whole range of goods is soaring while in much of the rest of the world it is stagnating or declining. More and more multinationals are realising that it is vital to have a manufacturing base in the world's fastest growing region. At first foreign electronics companies invested in Singapore because of cheap labour. Times have changed. Companies that in the 1960s were assembling black and white television sets have evolved to design and manufacture a comprehensive range of final products, sub-assemblies, components and parts for both industrial and consumer electronics industries. More than 250 electronics companies in Singapore produced an estimated SDollars 31bn (Pounds 13bn) worth of goods last year, 6 per cent up on 1991. Products cover almost the entire electronics sector: Singapore now accounts for about 50 per cent of total world output of computer disk drives. At a time of serious investment shortfalls elsewhere, investment commitments in Singapore's manufacturing sector reached a record high of SDollars 3.5bn in 1992 - 21 per cent up on 1991. Of that, SDollars 1.4bn, more than 40 per cent of the total, is being invested in the electronics sector. Electronics companies invest in Singapore because of its industrial infrastructure and its well established expertise in the industry. The city state is also at the centre of an increasingly regionalised industry. SGS-Thomson has 1,500 people there producing increasingly sophisticated 'front end' products. Another 3,200 are employed in 'back end' operations in Malaysia. The island of Penang in Malaysia is becoming an important electronics manufacturing centre. Parts made there or in Thailand are shipped to Singapore for finishing. Nike, the US running shoes manufacturer, tied up its laces and moved its manufacturing operations across the Pacific some time ago. Of the 90m pairs of shoes Nike produces each year, less than 2 per cent are made outside Asia. Du Pont is one of several chemical companies making multi-million dollar investments in new plant in Singapore. One of the Du Pont plants will produce key ingredients for polyurethane used, among other things, for liners in the running shoes industry. In future, Du Pont will able to feed Nike plants in Indonesia and elsewhere in the region from its Singapore plant, rather than from the US. 'We've been selling our products in this region for many years,' says Mr Thomas Springer, managing director of Du Pont's Singapore operations. 'Now having a presence here makes sense both from a production and sales point of view. Over the next few years we see our market in the Asia Pacific growing at twice the rate of anywhere else.' Eastman Chemical of the US, which has recently opened a regional headquarters in Singapore and is looking at investments in the area, says Asia will remain the world's fastest growing consumer market for some years. 'It's here, in the Asia Pacific, that we can see our future,' says Mr Earnest Deavenport, Eastman's president. An increasingly affluent middle class is fuelling consumer spending in the region, greatly increasing demand for everything from electronic equipment to goods derived from the petrochemicals industry. Singapore's planners expect that the country's - and the region's - dependence on traditional export markets in the US and Europe will diminish as demand rises closer to home. The newly opened economies of India and China are being targeted as the main new growth areas. Companies such as SGS-Thomson see the changes reflected in sales figures. 'In terms of sales, our semiconductor market in the Asia-Pacific has caught up with Europe,' says Mr Somogy. 'China is opening up and presents a tremendous market. I don't see much change in the growth trend in this region for the next 10 to 15 years.'</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Leading Article: No U-turns on the railway THE GOVERNMENT has scarcely a friend in the world when it comes to the privatisation of British Rail. That much has long been evident. Now even its own backbenchers are in ferment, threatening to revolt against the Railways Bill in parliament this week if the government fails to accept new clauses that would protect network-wide rail-card schemes and give British Rail the right to bid for franchises. The fact that such hostility exists is hardly surprising. It is an indictment of the government's failure to provide satisfactory answers to many legitimate questions about how privatisation will work. The consequent vacuum of information has been filled by the belief that the complexities of the government's plans will far outweigh any benefits they bring, and that passengers will be left worse off than ever. This is a more than a pity, for some simple truths have been forgotten as a result. One is that few people believed Britain's railways were satisfactory before the government came up with its privatisation plans. Another is that few people thought the railways had been satisfactory at any time during their 45 years of state ownership, whatever the political complexion of the government in office. A third is that few who give much serious thought to the matter would forecast a change in this state of affairs in the next 45 years, particularly in the light of the competing demands on public expenditure which the railways must expect to face. Freedom of access It remains the case that privatisation offers the best hope of giving Britain the railways it wants. A simple sell-off would have been one way of achieving that, but the scale of British Rail's losses militated against that option, and it would simply have converted a public-sector monopoly into a private-sector one. So instead, the government has decided to create an environment for competition by separating track infrastructure from train operations and giving freedom of access to all would-be train operators. The same trend is taking hold across Europe. In fact, the first stages of this process constitute a very modest step towards privatisation. For the present, virtually all the railway's assets, including the tracks and the passenger trains, are staying in state ownership. All the private sector is being asked to do is to bid for franchises to operate passenger services on British Rail's behalf. But even this small step brings the prospect of significant benefits - worthwhile improvements in productivity, a management motivated by financial rewards, and, it is to be hoped, the beginning of private-sector investment in rolling stock. And because the chosen structure sensibly avoids a 'big bang' approach in favour of a piecemeal allocation of franchises over a period of years, there will be every opportunity to learn from experience as privatisation progresses. In short, for all the understandable concerns about the government's plans, the real danger is not that they go too far, but that they may not go far enough. Risk of concessions Clearly a government with a small majority must take heed of political reality. But the risk is that each time it wards off critics with concessions on issues such as the preservation of discounted rail-card schemes for special interest groups, it restricts the commercial freedom of would-be train operators and so diminishes the likelihood that privatisation will succeed. Worst of all would be to accept the backbench amendment suggesting that British Rail should be allowed to bid for franchises. This is a wholly unnecessary provision since it will in any case be open to British Rail's existing management to participate fully in the privatised railway through management buy-outs. The amendment could easily lead to an outcome whereby the operation of most trains remained in the public sector, so eliminating the opportunity for introducing private-sector capital and blunting the potential for private-sector management to get to work on running efficient and innovative services. Those now calling for a U-turn on railway privatisation must explain how preserving the political and managerial status quo is going to deliver the improved services everyone would like to see.</p>

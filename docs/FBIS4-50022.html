			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China's Foreign Trade  Law has provided a good start in providing a legal framework for  China's foreign trade and a very important step in connecting  China's economy with the world economy, said Wu Yi, minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, here today.    She added that China's Foreign Trade Law, which was passed  here today by the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of  the Eighth National People's Congress of China, is an  epoch-making event in China's foreign trade history.    It will be the basic law in fields related to China's  foreign  trade, outlining basic principles, policies and a  macro-management framework for China's foreign trade.    Wu said that China's foreign trade has witnessed drastic  development during the past 15 years and, with China's further  opening, China's economy will continue to join the world economy  and has to be managed in line with international practice.    As far as foreign trade is concerned, the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a set of accepted world trade  rules, she added.    She noted that China applied for the resumption of its  contracting status in GATT in 1986, at which time GATT asked for  the unification and transparency of foreign trade systems of its  contracting parties.    Wu opined that without a foreign trade law, meeting the  requirements of GATT is beyond imagination.</p>

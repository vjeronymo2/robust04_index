"We do not want to force prices down, any more than destroy  western markets," he said.    Chernomyrdin emphasised that Russia is prepared to press for  entry into the world economic community on a parity basis.    He was against discrimination of Russian commodity  producers,  who should enjoy equal opportunities with other western  exporters.    The Russian prime minister noted that reforms in the country  require immense funds, which, in his view, can be obtained by  selling Russian products in other countries.    Chernomyrdin further indicated that Russia's leadership  invites western businessmen with their merchandise to the  Russian market.    The prime minister believes that in a number of cases the  Russian market may prove more promising than the European one.</p>

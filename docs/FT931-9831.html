			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Canon to buy Next hardware CANON, the Japanese office equipment manufacturer, is set to acquire the computer hardware business of Next Computer, the innovative US computer company. It already holds a 16.7 per cent stake in Next, and was the company's first outside investor. Formed in 1985 by Mr Steven Jobs, the computer entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Computer, Next is abandoning computer manufacturing to concentrate on selling its highly-regarded computer software. The move represents a disappointment for Mr Jobs, who had hoped to repeat his achievements at Apple by creating another industry-leading computer company. It also reflects Canon's growing involvement in the computer business, where its presence so far has been restricted mainly to the manufacture of peripherals, particularly laser printers. Mr Jobs owns 46 per cent of Next while Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and former presidential candidate, owns 11 per cent. It has, however, sold only about 50,000 computers, in spite of having software that is widely praised by computer experts. In May, Next will introduce a new version of its Nextstep computer operating system for personal computers. This will place Next in competition with Microsoft, which dominates the PC operating system. However, Mr Jobs is confident that it can overcome Microsoft's near monopoly. 'We believe that we are two to three years ahead of Microsoft and Taligent,' he said. Taligent is a joint venture between Apple Computer and International Business Machines that is developing a new PC operating system. Next will close its Freemont, California, factory by the end of the month, he said. The company will cut its workforce from 530 to about 200. 'Canon has not decided what it wants to do, but there should be a decision by the end of the month,' said Mr Jobs. Just last month, he announced Next had achieved its first quarterly operating profit in the fourth quarter of 1992. He said revenues for 1992 were Dollars 127m (Pounds 88.5m), up 10 per cent from 1991. Next had been planning a public share offering. If an agreement is finalised, Canon would also gain exclusive sales rights to Next's software products in the Pacific and Asia as well as the right to use software that would enable Canon copiers and printers to run on Next software. Canon will continue to supply Next hardware and maintenance service in the Asia and Pacific areas in which it already does so. Motorola supports Next customers in the US. A Canon representative said yesterday that 'Canon has a history of diversification and it is conceivable that in future it will build a computer business' based on the Next hardware operations it is considering acquiring.</p>

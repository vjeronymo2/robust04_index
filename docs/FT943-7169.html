			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Denmark unveils tight budget In an attempt to convince the financial markets that current high rates of interest on Danish government bonds are unjustified, the government yesterday presented a tight draft budget for 1995, bringing its publication forward by a week. Central government expenditure would fall by DKr6bn (Pounds 635m) in real terms in 1995 to DKr392.5bn, said Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, who added that the budget would have a restrictive effect on the economy next year after being strongly expansive in 1994 - election year. The economic recovery has allowed the government to limit expenditure and increase revenue. The budget deficit is set to fall to DKr45.3bn in 1995, or 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product, from DKr47.3bn, or 5.1 per cent of GDP, in the current year. The total public sector financial deficit will fall to DKr30.4bn from DKr41.0bn, or from 4.4 to 3.1 per cent of GDP. The budget, which proposes no new taxation or expenditure, had no immediate effect on the financial markets.</p>

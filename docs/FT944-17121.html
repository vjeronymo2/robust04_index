			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: INA management shake-up under fire Italy's opposition parties have criticised the management shake-up at INA, the partly privatised insurance giant, accusing the government of dampening competition in the insurance business. The former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) claimed Friday's shake-up had brought in those who were too closely tied to Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank and the strongest voice behind the running of Italy's Generali insurance group. The PDS also claimed bringing in Mr Cesare Geronzi, the chief executive of Banca di Roma, reinforced INA's political links with the Christian Democrats. The changes were made by the treasury in advance of the second tranche of the nationalisation of INA, due early next spring. Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, the chief executive responsible for raising L4,900bn (Dollars 3.15bn) through the sale in June of the treasury's 51 per cent stake, was eased out. He is being replaced by a new 13-man board of which the treasury, as majority shareholder, has appointed 10 members. Minority shareholders can appoint the other three. A senior treasury spokesman said the changes had been made after close consultation with INA's new international shareholders. He insisted that for the first time professional qualifications and international experience had been key elements in the choice - two foreign board members are one from France and Mr Michael Butt, who recently left the UK's Eagle Star. Two-thirds of the June privatisation stock was acquired by North American and British investors. Bankers pointed out over the weekend that it was an unwritten rule that the management was usually maintained throughout the privatisation process. Mr Pallesi has so far declined to comment on the new management structure, which sees his former deputy, Mr Giancarlo Giannini, share the main responsibilities with Mr Roberto Pontremoli. Former Comit chairman Mr Sergio Siglienti becomes chairman.</p>

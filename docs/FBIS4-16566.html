			<p>BFN     [Text] The President of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Leonid Kuchma told newsmen in  Kiev Thursday that two ultra-radical forces had won strong  representation in the national parliament. Speaking in the wake  of the Union's fourth emergency congress, Kuchma referred to the  nationalistic forces of the country's western provinces and the  Communists and Socialists. He said Ukraine was following in the  footsteps of Russia.    Now that forty-odd legislators had joined his Inter-regional  Reform Bloc, Kuchma was confident the bloc would emerge as the  centrist faction in the new parliament.    The centrist-oriented forces in parliament must stop what  Kuchma described as a tug-of-war game between the Communists and  nationalistically-minded radicals, and insure the formation of a  new Cabinet on a professional, and not political, basis.    Even parliament must be denied the right to amend key  economic legislation, or, said Kuchma, Ukraine's international  image will be damaged beyond repair.    Pending new presidential elections the lawmakers should help  President Kravchuk safeguard civic peace.    The Crimea had been and must be part of Ukraine. In the  meantime, Kuchma said, Kiev was losing to Simferopol both  politics- and economy-wise. But, he said, the Crimea would  remain Ukrainian if the reforms and economy started working.    The policy of Ukrainization was as erroneous as that of  Russification because, Kuchma said, one action always brings a  reaction.    Unfortunately, Kuchma said, political consideratins always  prevailed over economics, which provoked social cataclysms, in  Ukraine.    According to INTERFAX-Ukraine, the top executives of a  number  of Ukrainian banks and industrial facilities are holding a  working conference in Kiev on 15 April.</p>

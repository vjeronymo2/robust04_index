			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Suffering hangovers RECENT days have witnessed a significant easing in official monetary policy in Europe, with the British, French and Italian authorities lowering short-term interest rates, writes James Blitz. But European markets appeared to be suffering a post-easing hangover yesterday, and dealers were sceptical about the prospects for more cuts in Britain, France and Germany this year. In the sterling cash market, there was a strong feeling yesterday that the latest 1 percentage point cut in base rates would be the last for 1992. UK base rates are now at their lowest levels since 1978, and the government has cut rates by 300 basis points since Black Wednesday. According to one clearing bank dealer, the market had been expecting more than a 1 percentage point cut in the Autumn Statement earlier in the week. Although it tempered that view on the eve of the chancellor's statement, there was residual disappointment afterwards with what had been offered. The December short sterling contract closed 19 basis points down on the day at 93.20, and 54 basis points down on the week. At this new level, the market is assuming that 3-month money will be at 6.8 per cent by Christmas, a level compatible with the current structure of rates. Sterling cash rates reflected a more bearish tone, with 1 year money firming from 6 1/2 per cent on the offered side to 6 5/8 per cent. One year money could stay at this level even if base rates are cut to 6 per cent. The recent caution in some of the German and French money markets over easing has turned into outright bearishness this week. Bundesbank officials have issued hawkish warnings on inflation recently, and the November consumer price inflation figure, due out in the week after next, may decide whether the Bundesbank takes another 50 basis points off the Discount rate this year. The December Euromark contract has fallen some 46 basis points in the last two weeks, to a close of 91.25. At this level, it prices 3-month D-Marks by the year's end at 8.75 percent, only 14 basis points below yesterday's average level. However, the call money price, at yesterday's 8.80 per cent, is only 5 basis points above the Bundesbank's repo rate and reflects the view that market rates could ease again.</p>

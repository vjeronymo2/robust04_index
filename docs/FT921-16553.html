			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / The usual suspect is cleared of playing Footsie CONSPIRACY theorists were alerted when the FT-SE 100 index recorded its biggest one-day rise of the year on New Year's Eve. Add in the involvement of the usual suspect in financial conspiracies - the futures market - and the evidence for some form of manipulation appears compelling. On the surface, there would seem little to cheer the UK markets. Expectations for economic growth in 1992 have been dwindling and the recent rise in German interest rates means that the next move in UK rates is more likely to be up than down. Surveys have shown that both business and consumer confidence have been adversely affected in recent months. So why did the markets move so sharply, and who might have stood to gain? There are certainly advantages for fund managers in such a rise. Fees are often based on a percentage of the funds under management at the end of the year; so the New Year's Eve boost will mean slightly higher fees for many managers. It was also good news for those managers who slanted their portfolios towards equities in 1991. According to Mr Mark Brown, equity strategist at Phillips &amp; Drew, Tuesday's 3 per cent market rise ensured that the returns on UK equities over the year (at between 21 and 22 per cent) just tipped the 20 per cent returns on bonds. However, it was hard to see evidence of market manipulation by fund managers on Tuesday. Trading volume of 306.7m shares was healthy for a half day's trading but not exceptional. Many senior fund managers were enjoying a long Christmas holiday and were not at their desks. The futures market did play a role. The expiry of the December futures contract means that investors who had sold FT-SE 100 Index futures - in effect, gambling that the market would fall - needed to buy shares to square their positions. It is always hard to pinpoint the effect of the futures market on the cash market but there was a surge in business before the expiry of the contract between 10.10am and 10.20am on Tuesday. The chief evidence against the conspiracy theory is Monday night's rise on Wall Street. It may seem odd that London still responds so sensitively to the US market's moods, given the UK economy's gradual integration into Europe. Many of the UK's leading stocks are also traded on Wall Street, however, and Mr Brown says about half of quoted companies' overseas earnings come from the US. Mr Paul Manduca of fund management group Touche Remnant says: 'The US economy is still seen as the major motor of the world and markets have been encouraged by lower US interest rates and Bush's promise to provide a further stimulus to the economy.' European markets also rose in response to the Wall Street rise, making it more difficult to point the finger at London market manipulation. History might also suggest that the UK markets were anticipating the so-called 'January effect'. The FT-A All-Share Index has risen in 22 of the last 27 Januaries with an average rise of 4.9 per cent, three times the average for all other months.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Stevie Wonder is launching an 18-month campaign to raise funds for the  construction of homeless shelters across the country and to raise awareness of  the homeless's plight in the United States. The project, "Every Heart Needs a  Home," will be launched Nov. 22 with a benefit concert at the Beacon Theater in  New York, which will be broadcast nationwide on a pay-per-view basis. Wonder's  performance will be the first in a series of live performances, public service  announcements and appearances at events such as housing project ground  breakings. Said Mitch Costanza, executive director of the American Task Force  for the Homeless, which is working on the campaign with Wonder: "Human dignity  is not a privilege, it is what every American should expect. . . . Our  organization joins hands with Stevie Wonder in his effort to accomplish this  goal." Shauna Snow  </P></p>

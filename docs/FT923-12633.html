			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Gore calls for new generation of leaders SENATOR Al Gore last night performed his first big duty as the Democratic party's vice-presidential candidate: warming up the audience of party delegates at Madison Square Garden for the man who last week picked him to be his running mate. Trading tales of hardship, Mr Gore paved the way for Governor Bill Clinton's story of growing up poor in Arkansas with the tale of his son's almost fatal car accident in Baltimore three years ago, according to a draft text of the speech he had prepared for his acceptance of his party's vice-presidential nomination. 'When you've seen your reflection in the empty stare of a boy waiting for a second breath of life, you realise that we weren't put here on earth to look out for our needs alone; we're part of something much larger than ourselves,' he said. Attacking President George Bush and Vice-President Dan Quayle for 'making excuses for deadlock and decay', Mr Gore called for 'a new generation of leadership for the United States of America to take over'. 'The American spirit isn't gone. But we vow here tonight that in November, George Bush and Dan Quayle will be,' he said. 'They've had their chance and they have failed. They have taxed the many to enrich the few. It is time for them to go.' Mr Gore hailed his running mate's achievements as governor of Arkansas in shaking up one of the worst school systems in America, undertaking to reform the welfare system and balancing 11 budgets. He called, too, for a new effort to save the earth's environment - the cause for which he has become best known during his Senate career. 'For generations we have believed we could abuse the earth because we weren't really connected to it. But now we must face the truth. the task of saving the earth's environment must and will become the central organising principle of the post-cold war world.' But he also appealed to those who have been supporting Mr Ross Perot not to give up their fight for change.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kabul, May 19 (AFP) -- At least 20 people were  killed and 30 wounded in the Afghan capital Thursday [19 May],  when a rocket hit a crowded checkpoint controlled by Prime  Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami forces, witnesses  said.    The rocket struck as scores of people gathered at the  checkpoint in the Chelsitoon area in south Kabul, waiting to  stock up with supplies in the Hezb-held part of the city, ahead  of this weekend's Moslem Eid festival.    Locals said the rocket was fired from a hill controlled by  troops loyal to Hekmatyar's rival, President Burhanuddin Rabbani.    Scores of people had rushed to the checkpoint following an  announcement on Hezb radio that a blockade of routes to the  centre of the capital had been lifted because of the religious  festivities.    "I decided to shop at Chelsitoon in the hope of getting  essentials for our family at cheaper rates and look what has  happend to me," cried a 35-year old woman, who lost one leg.    Meanwhile, fighting was reported around Maidan Shahr, a city  about 30 kilometers west of here, in the Wardak province.    The defence ministry said Wednesday that pro-Rabbani forces  had overrun the city, but the claim was denied by the  Hezb-i-Islami.    A fighter from Ittihad-i-Islami faction, which is allied to  Rabbani, said: "Our forces hold the key hills around Maidan  Shahr."    The man, who was undergoing hospital treatment here, said he  arrived from Maidan Shahr area Thursday after being wounded in  the fighting.    "We got orders to withdraw from the city, even though we had  captured the it in a very easy fight," he said.    The International Commitee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in  April that 2,500 poeple had been killed and 17,000 injured in  the fighting betwe@n the forces of Rabbani and the combined  troops of Hezb and Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam, since the  beginning of January.</p>

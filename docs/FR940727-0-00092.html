These procedures shall include the participation of the appropriate DoD criminal investigative organization in the development of the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Establish procedures to ensure that in those significant investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities when adverse impact on a DoD mission can be determined, such adverse impact is identified and documented by the centralized organization. This information is to be used by the centralized organization of the DoD Component concerned in development of the remedies plan required in paragraph E.1.f., above, and shall be furnished to prosecutors as stated in paragraph E.2.e., below. The information shall also be used by the centralized organizations in development and preparation of ``Victim Impact Statements'' for use in sentencing proceedings, as provided for P.L. 97&hyph;291 (reference (b)). Some examples of adverse impact on a DoD mission are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Endangerment of personnel or property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Monetary loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Denigration of program or personnel integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compromise of the procurement process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Reduction or loss of mission readiness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h.

Establish procedures enabling the centralized organization to ensure that safety and readiness issues are examined and appropriately dealt with for all cases in which a notice is required under paragraph E.2.i., below. The minimum procedures to be followed by the centralized organization are in enclosure 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. Ensure that appropriate command, procurement, and investigative organizations are provided sufficient information to determine if further inquiry is warranted on their part to prevent reoccurrence and detect other possible fraud within their activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Secretaries of the Military Departments  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Inspector General, Department of Defense (IG, DoD), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  or their designees, shall establish procedures that ensure that their respective criminal investigative organizations will:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Notify, in writing, the centralized organization for the affected DoD Component of the start of all significant investigations involving fraud or corruption that are related to procurement activities. Initial notification shall include the following elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Case title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Case control number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Investigative agency and office of primary responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Date opened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Predication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Suspected offense(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Notify expeditiously the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) of any investigations that develop evidence that would impact on DoD-cleared industrial facilities or personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Discuss regularly with the centralized organization such issues as the current status of significant investigations and their coordination with prosecutive authorities. If the DoD criminal investigative organization has prepared any documents summarizing the current status of the investigation, such documents shall be provided to the centralized organization. Completed reports of significant investigations also should be provided to the centralized organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Provide to the appropriate procurement officials, commanders, and suspension and debarment authorities, when needed to allow consideration of applicable remedies, any court records, documents, or other evidence of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities. Such information shall be provided in a timely manner to enable the suspension and debarment authority to initiate suspension and debarment action within 30 days of an indictment or conviction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Provide expeditiously to prosecutive authorities the information regarding any adverse impact on a DoD mission, that is gathered under paragraph E.1.g., above, for the purpose of enhancing the prosecutability of a case. Such information also should be used in preparing a victim impact statement for use in sentencing proceedings as provided for in Public Law 97&hyph;291.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

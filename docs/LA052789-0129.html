			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: HELPING FOSTER CHILDREN COPE AS INSTANT ADULTS  </P> <P> You're a teen-aged foster child, and you've long since learned that life isn't  easy. Not for you, anyway.  </P> <P> You were removed from your parents' home because the problems there were so  severe. You may have suffered physical or sexual abuse or the consequences of  your parents' drug addiction.  </P> <P> Since then, you've spent some time in shelters, been bounced from foster home  to foster home, or maybe into a group home. Each time, you've adapted as best  you could.  </P> <P> But now you're about to face the biggest challenge of your life. On your 18th  birthday, you will be legally transformed into an adult, whether you feel grown  up that day or not.  </P> <P> That means the state won't support you anymore, unless you're still finishing  high school, so you'll have to get a job -- whatever you can qualify for with  no experience and, at best, a high school education. Probably minimum wage.  </P> <P> Without the government subsidy, your foster family probably can't afford to  keep you, so you'll need a place to live. Just your luck that Orange County is  one of the nation's most-expensive housing markets. Even to get in the door,  you'll probably need to come up with 2 months' rent and a security deposit.  </P> <P> You'll need a car to get to and from your job. Don't forget car insurance --  health insurance, too. All told, you'll need a couple thousand dollars just to  get started.  </P> <P> Don't let it bother you that most of the other kids are going off to college.  If you stash away some money, you may be able to take some night classes next  year.  </P> <P> Good luck, kid. You're on your own now.  </P> <P> Oh, by the way. Happy birthday.  </P> <P> Similar scenarios are played out about 10 to 15 times a month in Orange County,  according to Mike Nissen, one of the organizers of LEAP (Life Enrichment and  Assistance Program), a private, nonprofit service set up by the county Child  Abuse Council to help foster children as they become adults.  </P> <P> "These kids are falling through the cracks," says Susan Scott, another of the  organizers. "It's a very tough situation as to what to do with them. People are  willing to help young children. But when they're over 18, they say, 'Let them  go out and get a job. They can sling hamburgers at McDonald's.'  </P> <P> "Well, some of them can, but others can't. And even if they can, they can't  afford a place to live. In Orange County a lot of people, even if they're  college-educated, still can't get an apartment on their own."  </P> <P> The problem is compounded, says Scott, by the fact that "these most generally  are not well-adjusted kids. They still have problems because of their  backgrounds."  </P> <P> "Some kids have more resources than others," says Glenda Mauer, who chairs the  Child Abuse Council. But as a group, (former foster children) are very needy."  </P> <P> Because the system stops keeping track of foster children after they become  adults, there are no statistics on what happens to them. Nissen, a Newport  Beach marriage, family and child counselor, says some end up living a nomadic  existence, camping out on friends' couches for weeks at a time.  </P> <P> "My guess is that some of them are living on the street somewhere," says Scott,  also a marriage, family and child counselor in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Since LEAP was set up over a year ago, 15 young adults 18 to 21 years old have  received some sort of assistance in setting up their lives. Some are former  foster children; others come from various kinds of dysfunctional homes.  </P> <P> Now the council hopes to expand the program to try to reach more brand-new  adults in need, Nissen says.  </P> <P> The program's goal is to help its clients become independent, says Mauer.  </P> <P> "We didn't want to carry on that dependency feeling," says Sheila Dobbs, the  council's former chairwoman. LEAP concentrates on locating resources, but "they  have to do all the follow-up and learn to see it through," she says.  </P> <P> For example, LEAP paid for a suit of job-interview clothes for one client and  helped another write and publish a classified ad seeking work. They found a  doctor willing to treat a young uninsured man for a medical problem that had to  be solved before he could get a job.  </P> <P> "We gave him the doctor's name, but he had to follow up himself. And he did,"  Dobbs says.  </P> <P> So far, LEAP hasn't been able to help any of its clients with housing, "and  that's what they need most," Scott says. "We'd like to be able to give them  their first and last months' rent, if they could show that they have a job and  are responsible. But so far we haven't had much luck finding places for them to  live."  </P> <P> The program's funding comes from the council's $17,000 Thomas F. Riley  Endowment Fund, named for the Orange County 5th District supervisor. All the  money is from private sources.  </P> <P> Each client is assigned a volunteer advocate who serves not as a parent but as  an adviser in dealing with the realities of adult life. In some cases, that can  be the former foster parent, Nissen says.  </P> <P> "Usually the (former) foster parents are trying to help," he says. "But they  just don't have the resources."  </P> <P> The program is now being revamped, Mauer says, "so that we can get the services  to young people more efficiently."  </P> <P> So far, several major obstacles have prevented LEAP from helping more clients,  Nissen says. Not only are most former foster children unaware of LEAP, but so  are many social workers. "The key is letting them know we're here," he says.  </P> <P> Some potential clients call LEAP only to be discouraged by the lengthy  application form they must fill out to receive help. "I've had phone calls from  people who say, 'I've heard about your program,' and I've sent them an  application and never got it back," Scott says. "It is a fairly extensive  questionnaire. But we can't be dispersing hundreds of dollars without knowing  the background of the person we're giving it to, or how it will be used."  </P> <P> Also, Nissen says, there's a shortage of volunteers to serve as advocates. "We  need someone who's willing to ride along with the kid for about a year or two  to help him get going."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the program's emphasis on independence lessens its appeal to  some potential volunteers, he says. "A lot of people would rather deal with  younger kids. The idea of having someone lean on you seems to appeal to people  more than helping them become independent."  </P> <P> Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.  </P></p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: Bucharest bustle - Virginia Marsh offers tips on visiting the city Bucharest's most powerful landmark is the massive white marble, gold and concrete monstrosity that the late dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, named the Palace of the People. This weekend, this monument to megalomania takes on a new role. It will house the heads of state and other dignitaries attending the Crans Montana Economic Forum - the first big international conference in Romania since Ceausescu's overthrow in 1989. The city is undergoing rapid change. Cars imported from the west choke the main boulevards, which are lined with smart new cafes, showrooms filled with foreign goods, and dozens of small boutiques and food shops. Foreign and local companies vie for the billboard space along the road from the recently modernised airport. Every morning peasants fill the city's many open air markets with their wares: round smoked cheeses encased in wax, soft white goat's cheese, cured country hams, sour cream, fresh herbs and spices. However, Bucharest remains a frustrating place to visit. The following tips should help: At the airport, the traveller must stand in two queues, one to buy a visa (Dollars 35), the other to have the freshly stamped document examined by immigration. It is probably not worth getting a visa in advance: the best tactic is to fight your way off the aircraft in order to be first in the visa queue. Book your hotel room. Bucharest's few business hotels are often full. Demand has pushed up prices to international levels despite the generally lower standards. Most of the big hotels are within easy walking distance of the main commercial district. The InterContinental, in the central university square, remains first choice. The elegant but down-at-heel Hotel Continental is popular with frequent visitors, such as World Bank or IMF officials, while the Hotel Bucuresti is useful for those with political interests - out-of-town MPs fill one-third of its rooms. Ask your hotel to send a car to collect you from the airport, for Dollars 14 to Dollars 22. Taxi drivers usually try to charge a lot more for the 15km ride. Take cash, preferably dollars; credit cards and travellers' cheques are not widely accepted. Licensed exchange houses (Casa de Schimb) often offer better rates than hotels or banks, which are crowded and open only in the morning. Avoid changing money on the street: swindlers abound. Take the right clothes: Bucharest is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. Business dress is not formal: jacket and tie for men, dress or skirt for women. Avoid running out of your favourite shampoo or toothpaste. Basic items can be hard to find. Allow enough time between appointments: punctuality is not a Romanian strong point. Meetings tend to ramble on, especially if you are using a translator, although English and French are widely spoken. The telecommunications system is terrible, so do not count on making or receiving international and domestic calls easily. If possible, make international calls early in the morning or late at night, when the lines are less busy. The system is being modernised, but this means that telephone numbers change constantly. If you have problems reaching contacts, call international directory inquiries. At this time of year, Romanians start opening their roadside Terasa (terraces), where you can recover from a day of protracted negotiations over a beer or a glass of wine or Tuica, the fiery local plum brandy. La Premiera, behind the national theatre, is one of the best. Afterwards, it's worth wandering off the main boulevards into one of the old residential areas, where you can catch a glimpse of the richness of pre-communist Bucharest. Transylvanian turrets, dripping with Belle Epoque plaster work, and wrought iron and neo-Gothic villas stand alongside eastern-looking Orthodox churches and classic 1930s apartment blocks. This architecture provides the perfect antidote to Ceausescu's palace.</p>

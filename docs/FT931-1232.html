			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sandoz sets pace in Swiss pharmaceuticals sector SANDOZ, the first of the three large Basle-based chemical and pharmaceutical groups to report 1992 results, has set a high standard for Ciba-Geigy and Roche to match. Consolidated net income rose 34 per cent to SFr1.49bn (Dollars 993m) on sales up 8 per cent to SFr14.4bn. However, about half of the profit increase was attributable to the first-time application of international accounting standards (IAS), the main effect of which was to extend depreciation schedules. On a strictly comparable basis with the previous year, net profit was up 17 per cent to SFr1.3bn. The directors showed their confidence that the sharply higher level of earnings could be maintained by recommending that the annual dividend be raised by 34 per cent to SFr47 per share or participation certificate. Cash-flow was up 19 per cent to SFr2.27bn and the net return on sales rose to 10.4 per cent from 8.3 per cent. Pharmaceuticals account for just under half of group sales, and significantly more of its profits. The group's portfolio is led by Sandimmun, a drug widely used for suppressing the body's immune system reactions to transplanted organs. Investments in fixed assets fell 6 per cent to SFr1.19bn, but spending on research and development was up 13 per cent to SFr1.49bn or 10.4 per cent of consolidated sales. Sandoz said that Mr Marc Moret, the shy but autocratic chairman who has dominated the group for more than a decade, would stand down as president of the executive board. Mr Moret, 69, will remain chairman and will still be chief executive officer 'for a certain period'. The new president of the executive board and chief operating officer will be Mr Daniel Wagniere, now chief executive of the group's US subsidiary and a Sandoz employee since 1965. Along with the executive changes, Sandoz is regrouping its businesses into two divisions; life sciences, and chemicals and environment. Mr Urs Barlocher, head of Sandoz Nutrition, will lead the life sciences division, comprising the pharmaceutical, seeds and nutrition businesses. Mr Rolf Schweizer, vice-president of the executive board, will head the chemicals and environment division.</p>

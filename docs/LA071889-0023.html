			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH REFORMS  </P> <P> I am not impressed by President Bush's campaign reform proposals. If they are  the measure of the man, he's a lightweight.  </P> <P> He says that abolishing political action committees (PACs) will reduce the  influence of money in politics (Part I, June 30). Does he believe it? I doubt  it. He is totally cynical about PACs. Not long ago, he and other Republicans  touted them for enhancing political participation. Now, they want to get rid of  them because they give too much to Democrats.  </P> <P> Bush would abolish PACs when it isn't necessary. Why not limit campaign  spending and specify that within that limit candidates can raise not more than  20% from PACs? It would reduce their influence while respecting their right to  participate. More importantly, it would keep campaign spending from spiraling  out of control, as it does when there are no limits.  </P> <P> Bush has said that he agrees with the Republican Party. There should be no  limits on spending. A candidate is justified in spending any amount in pursuit  of public office. I am appalled that he has so little vision.  </P> <P> ERIC STEEL  </P> <P> Oakland  </P></p>

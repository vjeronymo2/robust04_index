			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Passport photos 'decriminalised' People who think their passport photo makes them look like a criminal rather than a tourist will be pleased to know that Societe Francaise de Technologies (Soft), of Pleuhiden, France, has come up with a high-tech photo booth which claims to produce a far more flattering photo. To begin with the client chooses his or her 'best side' by looking at possible shots on television mini-screens. The absence of a flash means the model will not look startled. And because the photo is produced by chemical-free thermal imaging the photos emerge from the machine dry, and so do not stick together. Soft: France, 96 83 29 49.</p>

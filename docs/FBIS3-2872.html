Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, and other  delegates spoke during their respective groups' examination of  Premier Li Peng's "Govenment Work Report."    Central Military Commission's Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen said  as Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" has greatly  inspired the military, set forth clear tasks and demands  regarding the issue of strengthening the modernization  construction of national defense, the army will resolutely  implement it. Consolidating the national defense, resisting  aggression, defending the motherland, safeguarding the results  of the peaceful labor of the people, are the sacred duty and  responsibility that the constitution has entrusted upon our  Army. Under the new situation of reform and opening up, the PLA  bears a great responsibility to defend the state security and  maintain social stability. Only by building a strong and  powerful Army which is under the absolute leadership of the  party, loyal to the motherland and the people, can our country  achieve security and stability, can our country be assured of a  smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization  construction.    After reviewing the achievements in Army construction last  year, Zhang Zhen said our army is politically firm, resolutely  listens to the party, and can be trusted absolutely by the party  and the people. In the new year, our Army will, under the  guidance of Mao Zedong's military Thought and Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's Thought on building the Army in the new period, in  line with the general demands for "political qualification,  perfect operational skill, fine working style, strict  discipline, and an effective logistic guarantee" proposed by  Comrade Jiang Zemin, do a further good job in the revolution,  modernization, and regularization of Army construction, and  fulfill well the tasks entrusted by the party and the people  under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin at its core.    Zhang Zhen said to do a good job on Army construction, it is  first of all necessary to conscientiously study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and to use Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to arm the thinking of the Army's commanders.  It is necessary to increase the study of new and high  technology; raise the Army's combat capability in modern  conditions; implement a policy of strict Army management;  strictly enforce rules and regulations; manage troop units well;  foster the excellent work style of strict enforcement of orders  and prohibitions; and establish a good image for the people's  soldiers. He also expressed the hope of again giving play to the  role of militiamen and reserve forces in maintaining social  order and social stability.    Delegate Chi Haotian, who is a State Councillor and Defense  Minister, spoke at the group meeting. He said practice in  China's 15 years of reform, opening up, and economic  construction has demonstrated that reform is the strong impetus  for propelling social development. The only way out to solve  the deep-rooted contradictions and problems in the current  national economy lies in deepening reform. We should not waver  in the least to make Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics a guide and support the  state in accelerating the establishment of a socialist market  economic system. Our Army is the people's army led by the  party. In this crucial period in which the state is  accelerating the pace of reform, it is necessary to firmly keep  in mind President Jiang Zemin's instruction that "revolutionary  soldiers should hold high the banner of patriotism and  socialism"; to assume responsibility for serving the interests  of the party and the people; to serve the overall situation of  economic construction; to try our best in doing a good job in  national defense construction; and to create a safe and reliable  environment to carry out reform smoothly and develop the economy  for the state. Chi Haotian said a strong consciousness about  national defense is the inspiration for millions of people to  care for and support national defense. First of all, the notion  of "if there is no Army, there will be no security, and if there  is no Army, there will be no stability" must be firmly implanted  in the minds of cadres at all levels. We must rely on the force  of the party, the government, the military, and society, make  regular use of the means of news dissemination, publishing,  film-making, and television production to conduct national  defense education among the masses, so that the positive effects  of national defense education will take root in the minds of the  people. We should also attach great importance to the building  of a legal system for national defense and persist in giving  equal importance to legislation and enforcement of the law. It  is necessary to vigorously promote reform, enhance the building  of reserve forces, and make the building of reserve forces adapt  to the new situation.    This afternoon, delegates from the PLA showed great  enthusiasm in speaking out at group discussions. Delegate Xu  Huizi said that since the new blueprint has been mapped out and  the state's major policies and principles decided, the key lies  in their implementation. We must mobilize the initiative and  creativity of comrades of the whole party and people in the  nation to the greatest extent, gather the people's cohesive  force, rouse people to rise with force and spirit, and link our  army's construction with the state's economic construction and  with the overall situation of national reform. A strong economy  will improve the military's outlook and successful reform will  bring about a strong national defense. We must subordinate  ourselves to the overall situation, support reform, and  contribute to the establishment of a socialist market economy.  Delegate Xu Xin said all levels of party organizations should  enhance the education of party members and leading cadres, train  hundreds of thousands of upright and good communist party  members, display an exemplary role in reform, opening up, and  modernization construction. Delegates Yang Huaiqing, Mao  Bingxiang, Yang Hong, and others from the Navy also spoke at the  group discussions. They urged enhancement of the Navy's  construction and called on the Navy to genuinely assume the  heavy historical responsibility of reform, opening up,  modernization construction, and to provide a security guarantee  on the sea.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Labour woos small businesses Labour yesterday stepped up its drive to win the support of small business with the release of a comprehensive package of financing and development proposals. The launch of the proposals at Westminster reflects growing contacts between Labour and small business as the party seeks to exploit dis-illusionment with the government. It follows an initiative begun under former leader John Smith and a regional tour last year by Labour's trade and industry team led by Mr Robin Cook. Mr Derek Fatchett, industry spokesman, said the Conservatives had taken the traditional loyalty of small business for granted. He said: 'The last five years have seen over 200,000 businesses driven into bankruptcy, debt levels rise to record levels, good new ideas starved of financial support and thousands of dreams shattered. 'It is little wonder that support for the Conservatives among the small business community is lower than at any other point and has more than halved in the last 10 years.' The package of policies includes the establishment of a business development bank to provide long-term finance for small businesses, pressure on large companies and public agencies to pay debts more quickly, and a legal right to interest on late payments. The party promises a moratorium law to give financially troubled small companies a breathing space before bankruptcy action, and tax changes to encourage greater reinvestment of profits. There would be a network of regional development agencies for small companies, and public procurement policies would be reviewed to encourage the development of high-tech small and medium-size enterprises. The proposals, most of which have been aired by Labour in the past 18 months, were given a cautious welcome by Mr Ian Handford, policy unit chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. Mr Handford said small-business people were not 'natural Labour voters'. He said Labour was 'looking at a sector which they haven't looked at before'.</p>

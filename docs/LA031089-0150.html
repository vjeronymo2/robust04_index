			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASKETBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> DIVISION III BOYS;  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS TEAMS UP, TOPS LEMOORE;  </P> <P> MUSTANGS' 86-79 VICTORY PUTS THEM IN THE FINAL AGAINST MORNINGSIDE  </P> <P> Playing with an extra dose of intensity, teamwork and smarts, Trabuco Hills  High School found its groove and defeated Lemoore, 86-79, in a Southern  California Regional Division III semifinal game Thursday night at El Toro High  School.  </P> <P> The victory sends Trabuco Hills (24-6) into the Southern California Regional  final against Morningside, a 53-46 winner over Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills, which defeated San Diego Clairemont, 87-60, in Tuesday's first  round, found an even higher level of play against Lemoore.  </P> <P> "It was an exciting game and fun too," Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer Wulf said. "I  think we gave the crowd something exciting to watch tonight."  </P> <P> Rick Swanwick, who Tuesday overcame a frightful first-half shooting slump  before scoring a career-high 32 points, had another good game, scoring 22  points and grabbing 15 rebounds before being taken out midway through the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> But Trabuco Hills' biggest source of entertainment might have been its overall  teamwork. The Mustangs, guided by guards Randy Kriech (14 points), Tim Manning  (12 points) and reserve Louis Arenado (five steals, eight points), continually  frustrated Lemoore with pinpoint passing and tricky dribbling.  </P> <P> Lemoore's main weapon, 5-foot-9 guard Tommy Jones, scored a game-high 28 points  including four three-pointers and had five steals. But even he had high praise  for the Mustangs.  </P> <P> "They are hot, definitely hot," he said.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills opened up the game with a Swanwick bank shot in the key and a  three-pointer by Poulos to take a 5-0 lead. The Tigers, pressed by Trabuco  Hills' man-to-man defense, missed their first six shots.  </P> <P> From the start, it was apparent Lemoore was going to have trouble with Trabuco  Hills' well-balanced team.  </P> <P> When Lemoore tried to double-team Swanwick, Swanwick passed to the perimeter  where any of several Mustangs were ready to shoot. Kriech scored 10 points,  including two back-to-back three-pointers to give Trabuco Hills a 28-16  first-quarter lead.  </P> <P> The balance -- from Swanwick's inside game to the sharp perimeter shooting of  Kriech and Manning -- hounded Lemoore as it has many Mustang opponents this  season.  </P> <P> "It's so hard to defend this team," Lemoore Coach Jim Gordon said. "The big guy  bangs inside, and they got those outside shooters."  </P> <P> All of whom shot especially well -- 10 of 15 as a team -- in the first quarter.  Lemoore was held to 7-of-21 shooting in the same period.  </P> <P> Although Lemoore managed to find its running game in the second quarter, and  outscored Trabuco Hills, 23-17, to cut its deficit to six (45-39), the Tigers  couldn't handle Trabuco Hills' firepower late in the third quarter.  </P> <P> After two layups by Clarence Scott and a eight-foot jumper in the key by Jones,  Lemoore had cut the lead to 47-45 just 3 minutes into the third quarter.  Lemoore looked even more impressive as it held the Mustangs scoreless for 2  minutes.  </P> <P> But, with 2:39 left in the period, the Mustangs had had enough. Keyed by  Poulos, who hit two three-pointers, and reserve John Goodman (eight points from  within the key), the Mustangs broke open a 15-2 run to take a 63-47 lead into  the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

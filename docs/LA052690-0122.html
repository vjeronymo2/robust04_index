			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS FRUSTRATED BY MCCOLL SITE PLAN  </P> <P> As a new neighbor of the former McColl toxic waste dump, John Law attended his  first McColl community meeting this week and listened to residents discussing  possible solutions.  </P> <P> He left the late Thursday night meeting frustrated, he said, that both the  federal Environmental Protection Agency and the oil companies responsible for  McColl seem to have diverse agendas for dealing with it, and neither of those  agendas seems to be in the community's best interest.  </P> <P> "I'm really disturbed by this meeting," Law, 32, said after a representative of  five oil companies showed color slides demonstrating their proposed solution to  seal off the estimated 150,000 tons of waste at McColl.  </P> <P> "On one side, you have big government and on the other side you have the (oil  companies) putting on a dog-and-pony show," he said.  </P> <P> The 2 1/2-hour meeting, called by a small group of residents living just behind  the former dump site, was to allow the oil companies to show their proposal to  seal the McColl wastes beneath layers of natural and artificial materials and  monitor the site far into the future.  </P> <P> The oil companies -- Shell, Unocal, Arco, Texaco and Phillips -- have been  trying to increase community support for their plan, which the EPA calls  inadequate.  </P> <P> "EPA is mandated by Congress to come up with permanent solutions," spokesman  Terry Wilson said. "The proposal the oil companies have at this time is not a  permanent solution."  </P> <P> Although the aim of the meeting was to help residents reach a consensus, about  70 area residents left still frustrated with the oil companies and with federal  officials over the lack of a solution to clean up the World War II-era refinery  waste dump.  </P> <P> Besides residents, also attending were representatives from the oil companies,  the EPA, the city of Fullerton and representatives of local elected officials.  </P> <P> After studying McColl for several years, the EPA expects to announce its  preferred cleanup method next March. The EPA holds the oil companies as  potentially responsible for cleaning up McColl, because the toxic contamination  is from refinery wastes dumped -- legally -- during the 1940s. The oil  companies, however, have balked at paying the cleanup costs, estimated to cost  at least $117 million. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK seeks role in European defence plans Britain has invited the French and German defence ministers for a discreet meeting tomorrow to discuss European military plans in the wake of the Nato summit a fortnight ago. The unprecedented trilateral meeting, which will be hosted Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, is indicative of a shift in the British government's attitude towards European initiatives in defence. The UK is now anxious to play a central role in plans to develop the Western European Union (WEU) as the EU's defence arm, capable of deploying its own forces for peacekeeping and other duties outside the Nato area. Defence officials in Bonn described the talks, which are due to be attended by Mr Volker Ruhe for Germany and Mr Francois Leotard for France, as an 'informal working meeting'. The British government is concerned about the formation of a Franco-German axis at the heart of European defence plans, and wants to use the meeting to ensure it is not left on the sidelines. This marks a sharp change since arguments two years ago about Franco-German plans for a joint army corps. Britain saw the corps, which is now due to include units from Belgium and Spain, as threatening to undermine Nato. British and US concerns have since been allayed by arrangements ensuring that the troops could come under Nato command in a crisis. The Nato summit highlighted the Clinton administration's support for a strong 'European pillar' in the alliance, with less reliance being placed on US forces. The ministers are expected to discuss US-inspired proposals for Combined Joint Task Forces, designed to enable either Nato or the WEU to deploy troops in response to emergencies such as Bosnia. France, although it keeps its forces separate from Nato's command structure, is due to participate fully in the plans. These will involve special new headquarters arrangements at key Nato commands. Allies are also keen to ensure that Germany plays a full role, despite its present constitutional difficulties over the sending of troops overseas.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Ukraine currency crisis threatens crop-planting: Russia claims it needs no imports of grain this year Ukraine's hard currency crisis is severely restricting the spring planting of its wheat, sugar beet and vegetable crops, as its inability to import seed, fuel and fertilisers threatens to lead to severe food shortages later this year. The republic was once the Soviet Union's bread basket. The crisis comes as President Boris Yeltsin of Russia claimed his country needed to make no purchases of grain this year for the first time in nearly 40 years. 'We have grain in reserve, a good reserve to last until the next harvest,' he said yesterday. US grain markets shrugged off this claim. 'Yeltsin is trying his best to show the IMF he is keeping inflation under control, and that Russia does not need to be so dependent on foreign debt,' said Mr Joe Victor, analyst with Allendale, an agricultural consultant. 'The market still believes Russia will import grain.' Russia imported 14m tonnes of wheat last year. Two months ago Russian agricultural officials estimated the country would have to import 12m tonnes of wheat and animal feeds this year. Ukraine has secured only 10 per cent of the agricultural inputs required to sow seeds this month, said an agriculture ministry official in Kiev. A western diplomat estimated that Ukraine urgently needed Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) this year to avoid a collapse. Last week US president Bill Clinton announced Dollars 20m in additional grain credits to Ukraine. The prospect of missing spring planting is tragic in a country with a third of the world's black soil in its territory. For Ukrainians, it would be a potent reminder of the 1930s famine in which millions died under the effects of Stalin's collectivisation. With Soviet-style state orders still in place, Ukraine forbids farms to sell their product abroad, thus prohibiting farmers from earning foreign exchange to buy materials. Farms are left to barter their remnants from last year's harvest. Representatives of western companies which have exported foodstuffs to Ukraine believe the huge cuts made in purchases because of the lack of hard currency will soon be felt by a population already suffering from shortages and rising prices. Many workers throughout the country have not been paid for two months. Some say they fear social unrest in a few months time because of the looming shortages. Russia, even if it has a grain surplus, would not lightly bail out Ukraine. The two are still haggling over gas supplies, with the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom saying Kiev has produced Dollars 7m against a bill which Gazprom claims is Dollars 900m. Talks on this are due to resume today. Gazprom has cut the amount of gas it sends to Ukraine from 200m cu m a day to 50m.</p>

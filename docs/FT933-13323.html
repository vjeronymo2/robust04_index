			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taiwan must be included in trade imbalance issues Sir, I agree with your suggestion that Taiwan and others in East Asia should participate in discussions between the United States and Japan on trade imbalance issues ('Japan and the US at odds', July 6). Taiwan, for example, enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US that is roughly as large as its trade deficit with Japan. This is not a coincidence. While Taiwan bars finished Japanese cars and certain other consumer goods, it does permit the import of Japanese high-value-added parts and components, which are then assembled in Taiwan and exported in large quantities as finished products to the US and elsewhere. Factoring in the trans-shipped components, Japan's actual trade surplus with the US is probably not much smaller than was the case during the peak of the high-dollar era. Obviously this process has served as a tremendous stimulus to the economies of East Asia. Unless, however, opportunities for trade and investment become more balanced on both sides of the Pacific, the Golden Goose could lose some of its feathers, at best. Richard McCormack, US undersecretary of state for economics (1989-91), Suite 275 2550 M Street NW Washington, DC 20037-1396 US</p>

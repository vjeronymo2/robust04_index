They have been charged  with terrorist acts on the al-Balamand road on 28 June 1993,  detonating bombs in several resorts, and possessing arms.    Hulayhil has confessed that he is a member of the Islamic  Group and that he participated in detonating an explosive device  on the road to the al-Balamand Monastery. He said his role  consisted of tying the detonating wire in such a way that when  the targeted bus hit it the explosion would occur six seconds  later. Hulayhil explained that this type of denotation requires  no special expertise. He said he received bombing training in  al-Dinniyah several years ago.    Bilal al-Kasan, another suspect, said his role in that  attack  was to stand guard. He reported that the bombing was staged to  retaliate for events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to expel the  Christian clerics from al-Balamand.    All the suspects denied bombing tourist resorts.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Village planned on Ravenscraig site The site of British Steel's Ravenscraig complex at Motherwell in Lanarkshire is intended to become an urban village built around an 80-acre lake, according to a plan announced yesterday. The 1,000-acre site will be decontaminated and reclaimed at the cost of about Pounds 30m in public money. The plan envisages private-sector investment of Pounds 200m over 25 years to develop 350 acres of the site. The Ravenscraig plant was closed by British Steel in 1992.</p>

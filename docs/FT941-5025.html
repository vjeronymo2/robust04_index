			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Belgrade theatregoers find a respite from the war: Cheap tickets mean capacity audiences Huddled in scarves and overcoats, a Belgrade theatre audience intently follows the argument between a grizzled Bosnian moneylender, played by one of Serbia's leading actors, with an Austrian officer who wants to marry Gago, his maid. 'The Girl with Purple Hair', set in a period of turmoil as the Austro-Hungarian empire was collapsing, opened nearly a year ago, but tickets are still hard to get. Despite being shabby and unheated, Belgrade's theatres are playing to capacity audiences for the second successive winter. With the price of a theatre ticket still only the equivalent to buying a Coke at a Belgrade disco, theatre is one of cheapest forms of entertainment. Although Serbian actors and directors acquired a good reputation during the 1980s, it was only after the rump Yugoslavia was plunged into isolation by UN sanctions 20 months ago because of the war in Bosnia that theatres started filling up. Mr Milan Vlajicic, arts editor of the Belgrade daily Politika, says: 'Most people can't afford to frequent restaurants any more, and cheap theatre tickets make it possible to have an evening out. But there's also a new, younger audience for serious plays, just as there was during the second world war.' Few new films reach cinemas in Serbia and Montenegro. State-controlled television dutifully reflects the growing nationalist influence in daily life, showing war films during the conflict with Croatia two years ago and, more recently, domestic soap operas with a discernibly Serb nationalist slant in the dialogue and jokes. Yet only one new play, 'Dark is the Night' by Alexander Popovic, Serbia's best-known playwright, takes the war for its subject. But for people who want to forget the grimness of daily life in the Serbian capital, there are comedies, classics and musicals - Fiddler on the Roof and Some Like it Hot are this season's hits. 'The Girl with Purple Hair', inspired by a short story of Ivo Andric, the former Yugoslavia's Nobel prize-winning novelist, touches indirectly on current issues. Ms Vida Ognjenovic, who wrote and directed the piece, says: 'I wanted to write something that was relevant to our problems, there was no question about that. Even so, it had to be put in context and given some distance.' Financial constraints mean that sets are minimal and costumes modest in Serbian theatre productions. The costumes for 'Girl with Purple Hair' were made from scraps of material which were collected from a leather factory because the Belgrade municipal theatre, which staged the play, is close to bankruptcy. Concert tickets are also in short supply, although more than 150 of Belgrade's leading orchestral musicians have left the country in the past two years. While there is no official censorship, the Socialist party of President Slobodan Milosevic keeps a watchful eye on cultural activity. The National Theatre, the umbrella for the former Yugoslavia's leading theatre, ballet and opera companies, was placed under new management in 1992 after Ms Ognjenevoic, then its artistic director allowed Mr Vuk Draskovic, the democratic opposition leader, to address his supporters from its balcony in an anti-government demonstration. When the municipal theatre staged a new play about St Sava, Serbia's patron saint, which implied he had been a spoiled medieval playboy, nationalist demonstrators disrupted the opening night. The play was not performed again.</p>

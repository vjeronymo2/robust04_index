			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD moved above Dollars 340 a troy ounce on the London bullion market yesterday after Comex gold futures moved ahead in early trading in a correction to recent losses. New York analysts attributed short covering and light speculative buying on Comex to a weaker dollar in foreign exchange trading. A couple of computer-managed funds made modest purchases. A London dealer said gold needed to break above Dollars 342. 'If it does we might see it back around Dollars 348.' PLATINUM behaved similarly to gold, rising in London on the back of gains on Nymex, where the market was lifted by fears of tight nearby supplies. On the LME COPPER was underpinned by Far East interest, which helped to offset unconstructive US economic data, notably the 0.1 per cent fall in February durable goods orders. Three-month metal held above Dollars 2,230 a tonne, but still shows no sign of breaking out of the Dollars 2,220-Dollars 2,240 range. Three-month ALUMINIUM held above Dollars 1,300, supported by Tuesday's news that Dutch producer Hoogoven's is shelving expansion plans, and corrected IPAI data indicating production is static. In Chicago WHEAT prices were lower at midday on aggressive selling. Compiled from Reuters</p>

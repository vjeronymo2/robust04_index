			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / People: Arbitrator elected Lord Mayor Francis McWilliams, an international arbitrator specialising in construction-related disputes, has been elected 665th Lord Mayor of London. On November 13 he succeeds Sir Brian Jenkins for a year-long term in the largely ceremonial post at the helm of the City Corporation. Previously a civil engineer, McWilliams, 66, lived in Malaysia for 23 years where he was responsible for the creation of the industrial city of Petaling Jaya New Town in Selangor. At the age of 50, he returned to the UK to read for the Bar, and turned immediately to the settlement of disputes. The City Corporation cites his unconventional background as giving the lie 'to the common assumption that the City of London is a closed club, uninterested in the introduction of fresh blood and ideas'. Evidently, though, some clubs are more open than others. As hobbies McWilliams lists membership of eight golf clubs, and boasts of a long friendship - 'which involved many games of golf' - with the former Crown Prince of Malaya. McWilliams says his theme for the year will be 'the City and industry in partnership'. 'I would like to see the City 'user friendly'; I hope that, if there is a lack of understanding of each other's problems, this can be eliminated.'</p>

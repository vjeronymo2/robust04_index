			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Building society profits 'resilient' BUILDING SOCIETIES survived the downturn in the housing market better than expected last year and will soon announce falls in pre-tax profits averaging only 7 per cent, according to a confidential survey by stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The survey found only a slight fall in profitability in spite of a 62 per cent rise in the level of provisions for bad mortgage debts - from Pounds 1.2bn in 1991 to about Pounds 1.92bn in the year to December 1992. It appears that profits were resilient in spite of earlier fears that they would be badly affected by debt provisions. There had been concern that several societies could be forced to merge or declare losses in the coming results season. Societies are thought to have weathered high levels of provisions by widening the margins between the interest paid on savings products and that received from mortgages, as base rates fell in the second half of the year. Too strong a series of profit announcements from the societies over the next two months could, however, provoke a public backlash because they have already faced scrutiny from politicians over their widening of margins. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he could not comment on the results of the survey, but he expected the industry to show strong profitability when the results were declared. Mr Wriglesworth said the fact that many societies had largely maintained profitability in spite of the rise in provisions showed the inherent strength of the industry and the control societies exercised over margins. Although the overall rise in provisions for the industry was found to be 62 per cent, the average rise per society was 80 per cent because smaller societies have had to raise debt provisions by a greater amount. The UBS Phillips &amp; Drew survey was compiled by asking societies to predict their results on the guarantee of confidentiality. Mr Malcolm Barr, Leeds president, told its annual meeting yesterday it had cut the number of mortgage payers in arrears, helped by lower interest rates. He said long-term arrears were higher than a year before at the end of the financial year on September 30. They now stood 2.5 per cent lower than a year ago, however, and short-term arrears were 27 per cent lower. The society has already announced that pre-tax profits fell by 20 per cent after a rise in provisions to Pounds 105.3m from Pounds 44.3m in 1991.</p>

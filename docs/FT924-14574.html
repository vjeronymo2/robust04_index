			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Bush attacks Clinton over anti-war role PRESIDENT George Bush has picked up a theme previously confined to the right wing of the Republican party and accused Mr Bill Clinton of unpatriotic behaviour in his activities against the Vietnam war more than 20 years ago. Mr Clinton's campaign immediately dismissed the president's charges, aired in a television talk show appearance on Wednesday night, as 'a sad and pathetic ploy by a desperate politician'. It claimed its overnight 'tracking' polls showed Mr Clinton's lead widening in direct relation to the sharp negative turn of the Bush effort. Mr Bush went so far as to suggest that a trip Mr Clinton made, early in 1970, to the then Soviet Union was somehow linked to his part in anti-war protests while he was a student at Oxford. 'I cannot for the life of me understand demonstrating against your own country when you are in a foreign land,' the president declared. He then questioned Mr Clinton's mission to the Soviet Union. 'To go to Moscow, one year after Russia (sic) crushed Czechoslovakia, and not remember who you saw there. . . You can remember who you saw in Oslo but you can't remember who you saw in Moscow?' These allegations were first raised last week in late-night speeches in the House of Representatives by conservative Congressman Robert Dornan. These were then picked up over the weekend on late-night radio talk shows, one of whose hosts reported many calls on the subject from clearly conservative listeners. The Washington Times, a Republican propaganda conduit, has put them on the front page all week. The mainstream media, until Mr Bush's intervention late on Wednesday, had treated them with some disdain because of lack of substantiation. But the Bush-Quayle campaign had chipped in with a vengeance earlier on Wednesday. Ms Mary Matalin, its combative political director, questioned Mr Clinton's 'blithe dismissal that there is nothing odd about a noted anti-war activist visiting a country that was providing the weapons and know-how to kill American soldiers in Vietnam'. Mr Clinton's camp has drawn immediate comparisons with similar tactics used before the British election last April, a campaign closely studied by Republican strategists. Particular attention is drawn to articles in the London Sunday Times last February about visits, with implied dark motives, made by Mr Neil Kinnock, then leader of the opposition Labour party, to the Soviet embassy in London. The Democratic candidate has conceded that he took part in anti-war protests in London, though he did not lead them, and that he did meet in Oslo the Rev Richard McSorley, a prominent anti-war activist from Georgetown University in Washington, where Mr Clinton was an undergraduate. The Republicans think that there is more to be elicited and that Mr Clinton can be distracted from his main message on the parlous state of the US economy. However, all the assaults so far seem to have had minimal public impact, at least as registered by the polls. Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, did seem to score something of a public hit with his half-hour, paid-for special on the economy, broadcast on Tuesday night. Overnight ratings showed it attracted 16m viewers and, perhaps helped by a big baseball game having preceded it, was the second most-watched show in its time slot. See Feature</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["mha"-signed report: "Valuable Results of D-2 Mission"] </F>   [Excerpt] Bonn, 24 March -- Approximately 11 months after  the second German space lab mission D-2, not all results of the  experiments that were carried out during the flight have been  evaluated. However, the findings that have been obtained so far  justify a positive balance sheet, the scientific leader of the  project, Professor Sahm, stated on Thursday [24 March] in Bonn.  Members of the German Agency for Space Matters (Dara) and of the  German Research Institute for Aviation and Astronautics (DLR)  announced the major results of the 10-day mission.    Sahm reported about the surprise finding that biological  cells do not develop the usual box-shape form in a state of  weightlessness, but that they take on a roundish shape, develop  thinner cell walls, and that their energy consumption and  metabolism drop clearly. This unexpected behavior must be  investigated further.    The same applies to the measurement of so-called diffusion  coefficients, that is physical quantities that are decisive for  the mixing and separating of liquid substances. These  characteristic values are indispensable for reliable computer  simulations of such processes that make new developments  possible. Yet new findings in the sphere of human medicine,  including the discovery of a new kidney hormone, and new  insights in the functioning of the lung have also contributed to  the success of the D-2 mission.

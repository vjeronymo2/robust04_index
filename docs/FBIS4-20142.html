			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bosnia Is a Test for Russia"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 27 Apr -- The CSU [Christian-Social Union]  wants to integrate the countries of Central Europe in West  European and North Atlantic institutions "quickly and  decisively." Christian Schmidt, chairman of the foreign policy  working committee of the CSU land group in the Bundestag, said  at a CSU foreign policy congress in Bonn that the opening-out of  the WEU, NATO, and European Union [EU] is a "question of  Europe's future." There is a "unique chance" of expanding an  all-European "peaceful order" right now, he said. This chance  might disappear in a few years' time.    Referring to Serbia and Russia, both Schmidt and CSU Land  Chairman Glos pointed out that the young Central European  democracies are afraid of new wars. These countries feel that  the West is not taking their worries seriously. This applies  not just to Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Hungary;  but also, for instance, to Slovenia.    According to the CSU land group, the Central European  countries should be associated with the WEU "soon" and take part  in EU foreign policy consultations. They should be able to join  NATO "in the medium term." The decision about this rests with  the individual countries themselves and NATO. "There is no  right of confirmation whatsoever concerning countries outside  NATO," he said, with reference to Russian demands on this  subject.    Relations between Russia, CIS, and NATO should lead to a  close partnership. Glos said that the West wants to "win over"  Russia as a partner, but veto rights should not be linked to  Moscow's important role. "Certain internal political  developments in Russia" are a cause for concern, he said.  Russia's conduct in Bosnia is a "test of its credibility,"  according to Glos. "The hour of truth has come," he said.    Schmidt said that bilateral agreements between NATO and  Russia concerning strategic cooperation and joint international  peacekeeping activity are possible. However, it is  "unthinkable" for Russia to join NATO right now. Even so,  cooperation with Russia is of "decisive importance" for the  development of a European security structure. The security  partnership with the Russian Federation must include a strategic  and stabilizing partnership for Europe. In view of the internal  political differences within Russia on the subject of NATO's  "Partnership for Peace" [PfP] offer, Schmidt called upon the  German Government to explain to Moscow that PfP mainly concerns  the stability of peace. "Also in this respect, Europe is  condemned to the success of Yeltsin and the reformers," said  Schmidt.    As far as the EU is concerned, the CSU insists that the  Maastricht Treaty Review Conference scheduled for 1996 should  encourage a consolidation of West European foreign and security  policy. The EU must "involve itself more thoroughly" in Bosnia  and Croatia. Schmidt said: "The danger of a conflagration in  the European home cannot be offset by the use of half-strength  fire doors alone."</p>

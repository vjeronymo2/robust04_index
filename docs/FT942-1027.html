			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Next time round, the candidates will (probably) be. . . Viscount Etienne Davignon: Could enter the race after the Corfu stalemate. Leading EU industry commissioner in the early 1980s. Dreamt up pan-European approaches to steel crisis and high-tech research. Not quite so successful in role as head of Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian conglomerate. Great conceptual thinker and ruthless negotiator, his appointment would signal a strong European Commission. Biggest disadvantages: too old to represent New Europe. Whether he wins or loses: still more invitations to act as Commission's unofficial Brains Trust. * * * Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian PM: John Major's de facto veto seems to have wrecked Mr Dehaene's chances. The 'Carthorse' could face calls to pull out of race with dignity once Corfu dust settles. Belgian public still surprised how close he came to succeeding Jacques Delors. Can console himself that he is still young enough for a top European post. Has an important job holding together a fragile coalition government. Whether he wins or loses: fewer references to his poor table manners and more recognition that he is a top-rank politician. * * * Ruud Lubbers, outgoing Dutch prime minister: Could rejoin race if the Netherlands, the only founder member of the Euro-club never to have held the top Brussels job, conforms to Dutch reputation for obstinacy. Trouble is, he and Chancellor Kohl are almost spitting tacks at each other, so the Dutch might field another runner. Whether he wins or loses: dignified but pungent remarks at summit suggest he's not as boring as everyone makes out. After burnt bridges of Corfu, unlikely to be going back into family bridge-building business. * * * Wilfried Martens: Belgian PM 1979-92 and bete noire of Mrs Thatcher. Unabashed federalist. Irritated the UK during the Gulf crisis by holding up release of Belgian ammunition for British troops. But he is shrewd and is liked by Chancellor Kohl. Was a candidate but could not get Belgian government backing; this time he might. Three credentials: a Christian Democrat, from the Low Countries, and a former PM. But has pledged to take up his seat in new Euro-Parliament. Whether he wins or loses: proof you cannot keep Belgians away from top jobs in Brussels. * * * Peter Sutherland, Irish director general of Gatt: Consummate self-publicist with an outside chance after deadlock. Knows Brussels after admired stint as competition commissioner 1985-88. Must quickly confect anti-British credentials and be obsequious to French, whom he accused of lack of leadership during last year's Uruguay Round showdown. If Germans like him, they're not telling. Whether he wins or loses: canvassing Sutherland for top international jobs is habit-forming, so zero chance of damage to ego.</p>

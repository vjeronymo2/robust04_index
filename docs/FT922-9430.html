			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Observer: Wendt away To be sure Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, who attracted attention recently with his Pounds 1.8m remuneration package for 1991, does not need the money. But Arjo Wiggins Appleton, which made him a non-executive director 18 months ago, might reasonably have expected him to stay on its board a little longer. The paper company, the product of a 1990 merger between Wiggins Teape Appleton and Arjomari-Prioux, had hoped that his wisdom on a mega transatlantic merger would be of benefit in its Anglo-French endeavours. Now he has resigned and an Arjo spokesman says he does not know why. It goes to show the dangers of chasing trophy names to put on the company letterhead.</p>

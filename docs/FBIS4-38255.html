			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th by Moti Amir "a </F> few minutes ago;" place not given -- recorded, in English]    [Text] [Amir] Dr. Sha'th?    [Sha'th] Yes.    [Amir] You are full of surprises [Sha'th heard laughing].  You are always surprising me, always. I understand that you  just spoke with....    [Sha'th, interrupting] I told everybody he [PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat] is coming at the end of the month and then I gave up,  but he is doing it.    [Amir] So, I understand that you have just spoke with  Chairman 'Arafat.    [Sha'th] That's right.    [Amir] And, what is the message?    [Sha'th] He is coming Friday [1 July].    [Amir] Directly to Gaza?    [Sha'th] Well, through Rafah.    [Amir] And, to stay how long?    [Sha'th] Well, maybe three or four days, and before he goes  to Paris.    [Amir] So, he will visit Jericho or not?    [Sha'th] Yes, probably, most likely.    [Amir] So, it is the big day.    [Sha'th] Right.    [Amir] Are you coming with him Friday?    [Sha'th] Yes, yes.    [Amir] So you are going to attend the Romeo and Juliet play?    [Sha'th] No, I'm not.    [Amir] You will be with him?    [Sha'th] Yes, but I had apologized earlier because he was  coming to Egypt and I was to meet President Mubarak with him  tomorrow. So, I had apologized to Mrs. Aloni anyway.    [Amir] Sir, can you specify some details of the visit of  Chairman 'Arafat?    [Sha'th] Well, nothing more than that. He's coming on  Friday through Egypt, via Rafah. He is going to stay in Gaza  most of the time. He will go to Jericho and come back to Gaza,  and then he will leave out of Gaza to Egypt again.    [Amir] And then to Paris?    [Sha'th] Right.    [Amir] Thank you very much, sir.    [Sha'th] You are welcome.</p>

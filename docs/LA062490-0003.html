			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The June 3 TV Times cover on the nightmarish "Tales From the Crypt" turned into  a parent's nightmare, or should I say children's nightmare.  </P> <P> I guess I could have ripped the cover page off our TV Times or try to hide it.  </P> <P> I guess what I'm saying is I'd just wish a slightly less scarier picture had  been used so our entire family, which includes my 4-year-old son, could have  enjoyed it. I also have an 8-year-old and we often peruse TV Times together to  encourage reading.  </P> <P> Margie Simmers, Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

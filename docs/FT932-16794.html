			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Invesco MIM Mr Charles Brady is striving to clean up Invesco MIM. Yesterday's full-year figures bear the scars. The cash settlement with Drayton Consolidated, costs relating to IMRO's compliance investigation and the aborted plan to spin off the US operations are reminders of a chequered past. The write-off of development costs relating to Taurus, the Stock Exchange's now defunct settlement system, adds insult to this list of self-inflicted injuries. A possible fine by IMRO and the writ from Mirror Group pensioners have still to be resolved. In that context, Mr Brady's decision to assume the role of executive chairman rather than introduce new blood seems strange. True, three new regional boards each with a chief executive should contribute to a balance of power. But Invesco must distance itself from the past if it is to stand a fighting chance of turning the tide in UK fund management. Funds under management rose slightly in Europe last year, but only after investment gains. The investment performance may be improving, but institutions are evidently reluctant to put their faith in the accident-prone group. With 80 per cent of profits flowing from the US, the attitude of London matters less than in the past. Invesco MIM's alliance with Peregrine of Hong Kong adds promise to its prospects in Asia. On that basis, the shares might look cheap despite the reduced dividend. With a long record of misadventures to consider, though, the market is right to price in some risk.</p>

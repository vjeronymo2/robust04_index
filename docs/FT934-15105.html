			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Commerzbank to issue certificates of deposit COMMERZBANK, one of Germany's largest banks, is expanding its range of fundraising instruments with its first issue of certificates of deposit (CDs). These short-term instruments are an extremely popular source of fundraising for banks in the UK and the US, but rare in Germany. Only a handful of German credit institutions has issued CDs since they were made legal by the Bundesbank in 1986. Commerzbank said yesterday that the minimum investment will be DM5m, and the yield will be above that of comp-arable German government securities. Available immediately, they will have a maturity of at least 30 days. Commerzbank said that the secondary market for the paper would be highly liquid. The chief source of short-term finance for German banks is money left on deposit by corporate and private customers at rates which tend to be more favourable to the banks than in other countries. The issue is part of a slow trend towards 'securitisation' in German financial markets, the most obvious sign of which is the development of the commercial paper market.</p>

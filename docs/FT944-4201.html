			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: A well-conducted partnership - An eventful year for the newly-knighted Simon Rattle There are not many knights under the age of 40. When the news broke of Simon Rattle's knighthood in June this year, one of the musicians in the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra told his colleagues, 'Our Simon has been made a saint'. Typically, Sir Simon's own reaction was more down-to-earth: 'The first thought I had was 'I'm not dead yet]'' Seeing that one of its exclusive younger artists was breaking into the top league, EMI Records had already decided that 1994 would be the year of Simon Rattle. The plan was to tie in new recordings with major appearances worldwide, such as Rattle's debut with the Vienna Philharmonic last December and the CBSO's visit to Warsaw, for which journalists were flown in from around the world. EMI says it wants 'to give a sense of focus' to a highly-valued artist, but a hard-nosed businessman will recognise a marketing plan when he sees one. The major classical record companies are having to work hard to maintain profitability. As recordings from the 1960s and '70s are reissued at ever lower prices, the market is being saturated with versions of the standard symphonies and concertos. It is no surprise that some of the big companies, with their expensive conductors recording Beethoven's symphonies for the third time, are struggling to balance their books. EMI regards itself as well placed with Rattle. Unlike many of the top conductors, he has made his central interest the music of the 20th century. The bulk of his recordings are of Mahler, Stravinsky, Britten, Bartok and other modern composers, rather than the classics. Promoting living British composers - such as Mark-Anthony Turnage, who was the CBSO's composer-in-residence - is a serious responsibility in Rattle's eyes and his record company is encouraged to see it the same way. He persuaded EMI to record Nicholas Maw's Odyssey, a hugely expensive undertaking, which will not break even for years, if at all. The company denies that this was the price it had to pay to keep Rattle on board. Roger Lewis, Director of EMI's Classical Division, says that it is a 'crude simplification' to weigh up the account in that fashion. 'We want to look at our relationship in an enlightened and mature way. There is a synergy: the benefit from making that recording gets reflected throughout the rest of his catalogue'. He stresses that the company's commitment to Rattle is long-term - a phrase which means what it says in this industry. After 17 years with EMI, Rattle's recordings have only recently gone into profit. The pay-back on investment with classical musicians has to be counted not in years, but in decades. (With that in mind it will be interesting to see what EMI intends to do with Franz Welser-Most, its other exclusive young conductor, only in his 30s, but wobbling in his career at the moment.) As 1994 comes to a close, the Rattle year is being counted a success. Lewis says that the effect of the marketing blitz has been 'measurable in sales terms' with a significant uplift in the US, where Rattle conducts in Boston and Los Angeles. They would expect to adopt the same approach again. Meanwhile, for Rattle, the path ahead looks assured, not least at EMI, with whom he has signed a new contract which stretches into the next century. In Birmingham, he is unassailable. The CBSO will want to hold on to its music director as long as it can, certainly until the climax of its 'Towards the Millennium' project, which lasts until the year 2000. This year's programme exhibits every sign of confidence. The season opened with a performance of Schoenberg's massive Gurrelieder, which sounded glorious in the fine acoustics of Symphony Hall and was warmly received, despite less than ideal soloists. Then, last week, Rattle and the CBSO presented a major premiere by the Russian emigre Sofia Gubaidulina. Entitled Zeitgestalten, this is described by the composer as 'a desire to convert the vertical time of timeless imagination into a linear form'; whereas to the listener it is more a succession of very striking sounds that may, or may not, have any deeper meaning. What is impressive is that it was done at all. The orchestra it demands (including six horns, electric guitars, accordion and an array of percussion) is vast and the cost surely enormous. Abroad, Rattle is said to have enjoyed himself immensely in Boston, which rumour suggests may offer a serious ambition for the future. He is also a regular visitor to Berlin, where he offers characteristically unusual repertoire. His first recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, issued this autumn (another Rattle landmark), was Liszt's Faust Symphony and he also plants a feather in his cap as the first conductor to have put Rameau on the orchestra's music-stands. 'After the initial chaos - and it was utter chaos  -they took to it with such warmth and vitality. I was delighted, because I was as nervous as I've ever been there, and I'm never less than petrified.' The steady rise of his career is mirrored in his philosophy. 'You learn in increments. Every month I am learning some great truth and wonder how I managed without it before. But I do suspect people who say it gets easier, because every little bit of wisdom brings its complications. Almost all musicians have areas that are easy for them, but it doesn't mean those are the ones they will do the best. With some pieces of music one is fated to fail.' At so early a point in his career the knighthood raised other problems. 'My misgivings were personal. I considered very quickly what it meant for the orchestra, what it meant for my parents. The thing that convinced me was thinking of the use that Ian McKellen has made of his knighthood, turning it into extra ammunition for an extraordinary crusade. There is going to be another big fight for the arts in this country over the next 12 months. I'm amazed that people can so blithely take the existence of the orchestras in this country for granted, because extinction is close for many. I have the feeling that we'll have to use those extra three letters for whatever additional weight they may carry. It's just a shame that a knighthood can't be backward-looking. My mother would make an ace Lady Rattle.'</p>

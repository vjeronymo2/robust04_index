			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / EC steel strategy faces chaos warns Brussels THE EUROPEAN Community's steel strategy faces chaos if a deepening row over subsidies for state-owned steelmakers is not resolved by the autumn, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said yesterday. The European Commission has threatened Italy with a formal injunction to prevent the government writing off an estimated Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.09bn) of debt at Ilva, the loss-making state steel producer. The Commission has also extended an existing state aid inquiry to look into the debt cancellation. Italy has been given 15 days to comment, before the rarely used injunction powers will be activated, although Rome will still be able to finance more than Ecu80m of monthly losses at Ilva. Brussels hopes the latest action will persuade the Italians to comply with overall EC plans for capacity cuts in the ailing Community industry by September 21. That is the new date for a special meeting of EC industry ministers on subsidies, postponed from this month because of the outstanding problems. 'We have to be ready for that extraordinary council because if we are not. . . . I fear we may be heading towards chaos,' said Mr Van Miert. He and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, will press steelmakers on capacity cuts at a 'secret' meeting in Geneva on Monday. State-owned Spanish and east German steelmakers are also resisting the Commission's tough line. Unlike Rome, Madrid and Bonn have been talking to Brussels about changes. The Italians have not admitted the existence of state aid in their plans and therefore refuse to cut capacity. The signs are that the Italians will be prepared to negotiate. Earlier this year, Mr Hayao Nakamura, Ilva's managing director, attacked a similar approach - already being considered by Spain - as a surrender to unjustifiable interference in Italy's internal affairs. Events since have made it much more difficult to brazen out such a stance. For example, Rome had argued strongly that Iri, the biggest state holding company which owns Ilva, was now an independent entity ruled by market forces and poised to sell off assets. But delays in the privatisation programme have eroded that argument. Iri last night expressed 'its deep reservations' on the content and motive of the Commission's decision. However, it stressed its willingness to meet EC officials and identify 'acceptable solutions', in the context of the reorganisation of the Italian and European steel industry.

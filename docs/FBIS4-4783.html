			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition lawmakers yesterday alleged that South  Korea has bowed to U.S. pressure and has agreed to further lower  import tariff rates on 33 American farm products from the  current 40 percent to 20 percent on average. During a session of  the National Assembly agriculture committee, two Democratic  Party (DP) lawmakers said the agreement was included in the  "side letter" between the two countries with regard to  modification of the nation's final schedule of tariff  concessions in the farming sector.    Citing a report on tariffs on agreed items between Korea and  the United States submitted by the Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries Ministry to the Assembly committee, Reps. Yi Kil-chae  and Yi Kyu- taek insisted that the Seoul government made  considerable tariff concessions to the United States on major  agricultural items through the side letter.    Among the 33 items dropped in the agreement are wheat, corn  chips, sweet corn and almonds. For example, they said, tariff  rates on wheat will be lowered from the current 10 percent to 3  percent.    Rep. Yi contended that the nation's farming industry is  expected to be dealt a serious blow by an influx of American  farming goods in the wake of a sharp reduction of tariffs.    Rep. Yi urged the government to make public the full  contents  of the side letter, saying that there is a possibility that the  two countries might have made another secret agreement.    Another DP lawmaker Kim Yong-chin charged that the  government  failed to keep its promise not to revise the final country  schedule, calling for the National Assembly to immediately set  up a fact- finding team to probe into why the government  modified the schedule.    The team also should discover the truth about whether there  was any secret negotiations between Seoul and Washington to open  the domestic farming market wider, Kim claimed.    DP lawmaker Kim Chang-kon criticized the government for its  revision of the final country schedule, saying that the  government had cheated farmers and forced them to sacrifice. He  demanded that President Kim Yong-sam offer an apology to the  public and dismiss relevant ministers.    In response to lawmakers' allegations, a spokesman of the  agriculture ministry said the 33 farming products are the items  under which the two countries had already agreed to reduce  tariff rates during bilateral negotiations in December 1993.    Testifying before the committee, Kim Yang-pae, the minister  of agriculture, offered an apology to the public, saying that he  feels sorry for creating "unnecessary" misunderstanding by  failing to make public the modifications of the country  schedule. But Kim dismissed some allegation that South Korea  made further concessions through the side letter as totally  untrue. He told lawmakers that the side letter was exchanged  between ambassadors of the two countries to guarantee the  bilateral agreements and there is no secret agreement with any  country.</p>

A National Ballet spokesman reached in London by telephone  confirmed rumors that there had been problems between Schaufuss and the  company's general administrator, Richard Jarman.  </P> <P> "For sometime there has been a split there," said spokesman David Palmer. "But  we've had two recent changes in the chairman of the board, and Pamela Lady  Harlech has come in to straighten things out. Richard Jarman is still here, but  his situation has got to be reviewed by the board too." Schaufuss was to dance  in Southern California with members of the National Ballet at a March 11 AIDS  benefit at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

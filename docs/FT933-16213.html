			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Disruption feared over security cordon around City THE SECURITY cordon set up around the City of London at the weekend faces its first test today amid fears that it could cause widespread traffic congestion. The anti-terrorist scheme, which rings London's financial heart with 24-hour police checkpoints, has received broad support from business, which pressed for tighter security after the Bishopsgate bomb attack by the Provisional IRA two months ago. But with 18 roads leading into the Square Mile being closed under the scheme, police and City leaders were preparing for a barrage of complaints from frustrated motorists. The City of London Police, stressing that the scheme was experimental, appealed to commuters to leave their cars at home. 'For the first days there will be problems. It would be naive of us to expect otherwise,' the police said. The RAC, the motoring organisation, said it was unhappy about the City being treated in isolation. 'The scheme could transfer the traffic, and potentially, the terrorists to other areas,' it warned. The Corporation of London, which is funding the Pounds 200,000 scheme, expects 3,000 cars an hour will be displaced to other parts of London by the security scheme, while a further 5,000 an hour try to pass through the City during the first few days. The scheme is planned to operate for 12 months, pending a public inquiry into further security measures. Bus drivers have been issued with instructions about route diversions - although a helpline operator said many were still struggling to make sense of the new maps. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of London's policy committee, admitted that while the scheme would give better protection against the threat of car bombs, it could not guard against hand-held devices.

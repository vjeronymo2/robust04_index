			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Eni chief joins the corruption scandal list MR Gabriele Cagliari, the chairman of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals state holding company, has been arrested on charges of alleged corruption and illegal funding of political parties. Separately, Mr Franco Ciatti, chairman of Eni's Nuovo Pignone turbines and compressors subsidiary, was arrested on corruption charges. Mr Cagliari, head of Eni since 1989, was reported to have offered his resignation last night. He is the most senior businessman to be detained by Milan magistrates investigating contracts from the Enel state electricity authority since a sweep of Enel's contractors began last month. The arrests, in connection with contracts for gas turbines for Enel power stations, had an immediate impact on the Milan stock exchange. Coupled with growing uncertainty about the future of the government of Mr Giuliano Amato, the Comit equity index fell by 17.11 points to 511.02, while the lira came under heavy pressure, dropping to L965.38 against the D-Mark. The involvement of Nuovo Pignone in the corruption investigations could represent a blow to the government's ambitious privatisation programme, as the company is one of the top candidates on the list of planned disposals. Yesterday Nuovo Pignone's works council called on the government to suspend the privatisation, citing the need for maximum transparency. The arrest of Mr Cagliari could also set back plans at Eni, which hopes to float stakes in its Agip petroleum and Snam gas distribution operations, as well as sell smaller subsidiaries. Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury Minister, yesterday stressed the arrest would not affect Eni's operations. Under changes pushed through by the government last year, everyday responsibility for running the company had passed to its managing director, Mr Franco Bernabe. In a statement, Eni said its board would be meeting soon to consider the implication of Mr Cagliari's arrest. Eni had already come under judicial scrutiny earlier this year, when Mr Cagliari was informed by Rome magistrates that he could face prosecution. The list of those arrested, and mostly released, includes Mr Giampiero Pesenti, chairman of the Italmobiliare holding company which controls the Franco Tosi engineering group, Mr Roberto Fochi, chairman of Filippo Fochi, a listed engineering concern, and Mr Aldo Belleli, managing director of the big Belleli plant building and engineering group. According to leaked testimony, Mr Ciatti admitted to having paid L4bn (Pounds 1.8m) in kickbacks.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURPHY'S BUCK  </P> <P> Rick Edelstein's Dec. 9 letter on a Peter Rainer article criticizing Eddie  Murphy movies points up the need to take great care in distinguishing what is  based on racism and what is not.  </P> <P> Edelstein makes good points; but as a black who grew up in the segregated  South, I have been unhappy with Murphy's movies, especially his recent ones. He  has been willing to sell the stereotypes to simply make money.  </P> <P> The bite of youth has not been replaced by a maturity with verve. Race now is  just a slick cover to make a buck and generate status.  </P> <P> DR. PAUL H. LOGAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

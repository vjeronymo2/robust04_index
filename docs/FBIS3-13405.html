In a statement to SHIHAN, Malluh said such rumors seek to  harm Palestinian-Jordanian relations and to revive the past.  Malluh said that tendentious parties are trying to link the  bombings to the Palestinian factions in general to cast doubts  on Palestinian-Jordanian relations, which are now being  established on strong foundations.    He said Dr. Habash came to Jordan on 23 February on a  private  visit and was not searched. He was treated with all the respect  befitting a pan-Arab struggler, Malluh added.</p>

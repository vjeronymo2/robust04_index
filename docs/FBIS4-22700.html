			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Bakulina under the rubric "Politics. </F> Words and Deeds": "A Rehearsal of the Southward Charge?"]    [Text] Krasnodar-Moscow--It is hard to work with the  common voter at present. No inducements will lure him into  politics. Besides, Zhirinovskiy has set Russia on its ears, and  he still will not quit.    However, the Communists of the Kuban would not surrender.  They have traditionally called on their electorate to be active,  hoping to keep their position in the region through elections to  the local legislative assembly. However, there is no way that  they will outdo the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia].  The people will not be carried along by the mind, the honor, and  the conscience now. The school of communism is behind us, and  Zhirinovskiy's PTU [Vocational Technical School] is beginning.  In the Kuban the PTU is headed by Vladimir Serdyukov, whose  hallmarks are a quick wit and obedience. So, he appeared to have  made it to the State Duma on the LDPR ticket, and he would be  now sitting in Moscow, at the Mir hotel, eating bananas.  However, following a meeting with the leadership in Moscow he  did not covet bananas, but surrendered his seat to whoever it  was due. Well done, fine fellow, everyone should know his place.  This is the kind of cadres Vladimir Volfovich has! Communists  and democrats who man different sides of the barricades are  looking on with envy. However, this is not the only forte of the  hero of the LDPR. Working in the kray newspaper KUBANSKIY  KURYER, in the past the only powerful democratic newspaper, he  adapted it to the needs of the party. The newspaper produces the  right advertisement, gets the brains of the electorate ready for  the difficult moment of elections, and...the LDPR headquarters  has premises, too. However, it is, of course, not Serdyukov  alone that makes the Kuban of the LDPR tick. Paid emissaries  annunciate Zhirinovskiy's truth to the cities and villages day  and night, at times enticing (or perhaps fooling) 40-50 of our  citizens at one go. By now there is not a rayon seat, not even  the most inconsequential, in which an LDPR chapter has not been  created out of its supporters. Are there 50 seats in the  legislative assembly of the kray? This means that there will be  50 candidates, one in each district. Serdyukov is confident, he  has done good work with the branch; besides, there is money.  Therefore, 20-30 LDPR candidates will definitely make it to the  assembly. However, Serdyukov is modest and keeps silent about  the main actual invention, the patent for which is worthy of a  PTU. How and where did he come up with the candidates for power?  So, the Zhirinovists (or more precisely, Serdyukovists--knock on  wood, or it might go to his head) work with the second echelon  of the now active executive authorities. Young deputy leaders  with promise who have authority in the collective are the  objects of their closest attention.    A marvelous pie emerges: In some places the Communists have  made their way to the top of the bill, and the Zhirinovists are  second. The former think that they are in in earnest and for a  long time to come once again, and they even put portraits of the  beloved Ilich back in their old places. The latter yawn  apathetically--power is almost within their grasp, and suddenly  look back convulsively to see whether the first ones have not  joined up with the third ones.    Since time immemorial the agro-industrial complex has been  the third political force in the Kuban. It is very powerful.  However much Dyakonov, former governor of the kray, tried to  convert to owner-operated farming and to organize strong peasant  farms (17,000 peasant farms were created under him in 15  months), he was "made to go" long ago. This statistic has not  increased; on the contrary, it is about to slip sharply. The new  governor Yegorov is convinced that only kolkhozes can feed  Russia. This is precisely what the agrarians named the block in  which they united: "Rich Kuban--Rich Russia." The block does not  intend to engage in doing the old material over. Its membership  is respectable: In addition to the leading kolkhoz members, the  corps of directors and the leaders of the largest organizations  of Krasnodar Kray belong to it. Besides, the task set by the  powers that be is respectable, too. The supreme echelons of  power have resolved to flex their muscles and play Russia's card  by creating the Azov-Black Sea Republic. Given this, one sees  the name of the bloc as ambiguous.    In theory this maneuver should get Mr. Shakhray interested.  We will set out further into the boundless political expanse of  the Kuban, this time looking for democrats. Where are they? Will  we hear their voice from the Kuban?    Valeriy Fisyun, chairman of the executive committee of the  Congress of Democratic Patriotic Forces of the Kuban, informed  us with a hint of sadness: "Indeed, very little room is left for  the democrats; the political niche has been virtually filled.  Finding 50 candidates in order to win the elections to the  legislative assembly is a very difficult task."    What kind of organization is this one that stands ready to  pick an unequal fight with the local colossi?    "The Congress was formed in October of last year. Virtually  all democratic parties of the region, the Cossacks--the  so-called White Cossack host of the Kuban, the Cossack  association of Russia, the farmers--AKKOR [Association of  Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], and  various creative arts and scientific unions joined the Congress.  In the region, most of the parties are small and cannot  influence the political situation on their own. This is why the  idea of an association developed, all the more so that an  election to the Federal Assembly was forthcoming, during which  we got our first 'baptism by fire.' Along with the Congress,  which adopted programmatic resolutions On Power, On Grain, On  Land, and On Privatization, a party was created--the Kuban  Revival Union. The democrats stated that at present there is no  democratic power in the Kuban; this means that it should be  fought for, and it should be explained to the population that  the democrats were not the ones to bring about decay in the  Kuban, the perversion of privatization, and other troubles. They  have never had anything to do with this. The party has got  itself a newspaper now; its first issue is being prepared for  publication under the title KRAY KUBANSKIY. Much is being  concealed from the population. It will wake up once and learn  that nothing belongs to it anymore, that land, means of  production, and everything else have owners. We must tell the  population the truth. Very soon people will learn the documented  truth. We are preparing, and will soon hold the second congress  on the topic 'Corruption of Power.' It is a pity that Kazannik  has quit as prosecutor general."    "What would you have told him about?"    "We would have told him about the political underpinnings of  the affair involving the merger of the city of Anapa with  Anapskiy Rayon and plans for the creation of the resort region  of Anapa, in keeping with which the liquidation of the city  executive authorities is planned, as well as the removal from  his duties of the mayor of Anapa, Korolev, who (in keeping with  a directive of the government) has for two years been preparing  documents on granting Anapa the status of a federal city and the  all-Russian family-type children's resort for recreation for  parents with children.    "We would have told him about a gas terminal which they  intend to build on the Taman; this may influence the ecological  situation in the area of Anapa adversely. However, this private,  joint Russo-American enterprise has close ties to Chernomyrdin's  son.    "We would like to tell many things. We have enough documents  in which the personal interests of supreme officials in the  Kuban are traced."    As you can see, the democrats have things to say; the  agrarians have things to dream about; the Communists know how to  restore order, whereas the Zhirinovists will take power in the  Kuban by creeping into the legislative assembly without any  unnecessary noise.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Boeing down 15% as orders sag Lower orders from the world's beleaguered airline industry caused Boeing, the US aircraft maker, to report a 15 per cent fall in net fourth quarter profits to Dollars 304m (Pounds 205m) yesterday. The company said the number of commercial aircraft delivered during the quarter slumped from 102 the previous year to 61, and warned that it expected no reversal of the downward trend until deliveries of its new 777 aircraft began in the middle of next year. On Friday Boeing confirmed it was shedding 3,000 fewer jobs than the 28,000 it had expected to cut a year ago, partly because of the early phases of work on a new derivative of the 737 family known as the 737-700. Yesterday, however, the company emphasised that recovery remained a long way off. Commercial jet deliveries were expected to fall to between 250 and 260 this year, from 330, and sales were forecast to shrink by about 20 per cent to Dollars 20bn-Dollars 21bn. Fourth quarter turnover dropped from Dollars 7.5bn to Dollars 5.7bn, and earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.05 to 89 cents. For the year as a whole, turnover slid from Dollars 30.2bn to Dollars 25.4bn, while net profits fell from Dollars 1.56bn to Dollars 1.24bn and earnings per share dropped from Dollars 4.57 to Dollars 3.66. Analysts are forecasting another sharp decline in profits for the current year. Boeing said airline operating performance remained mixed, reflecting varying economic conditions around the world. Overall, increases in passenger traffic and revenues had contributed to better net revenue yields last year, it said, but not all markets had improved. 'The company remains optimistic about the longer term global market and Boeing's ability to maintain a favourable market share,' it said. Assembly of the 777 twin-jet was continuing on schedule, Boeing said, with roll-out of the first aircraft due in April and flight-testing beginning in the summer. Announced orders for the aircraft from 16 customers world-wide totalled 147. Boeing said defence and space orders were 20 per cent lower than last year, but it had improved operating margins in these businesses with the help of 'excellent' cost management.

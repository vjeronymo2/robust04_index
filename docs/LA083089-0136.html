			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JETLINER MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING  </P> <P> An American Airlines MD-80 jet made an emergency landing at an airport today  after one of its three hydraulic systems failed, an airline spokesman said.  </P> <P> Flight 891, carrying 66 passengers and a crew of six from Oklahoma City to  Dallas, returned to Will Rogers World Airport 11 minutes after taking off, said  American spokesman Jim Brown. He said that even the loss of all three of the  hydraulic systems would not result in the pilot losing control of the airplane  as happened with a DC-10 that crashed at Sioux City, Iowa. Brown said a cable  system would pilot the aircraft in the event of complete hydraulic failure.  </P></p>

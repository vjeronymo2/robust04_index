			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mediobanca advances to L262bn MEDIOBANCA, Italy's leading merchant bank, recorded a 20 per cent increase in net profits to L262.1bn (Dollars 244m) in the year ended June 30, from L220.4bn the previous year. The bank is proposing the annual meeting on October 28 approve an unchanged dividend of L200 per share on its 340m shares in circulation. It is also proposing to set aside L193bn to reserves. The profits came after a L153.1bn provision to cover loans at risk and write-downs in the bank's share portfolio, compared with a total of L213.4bn in the year 1990-91. Write-downs in the share portfolio accounted for L83bn against L148.8bn last time. Although the portfolio adjustment was considerably less than 1990-91, this only covered stock market movements up to the end of June. Until then the Milan bourse had fallen only 10 per cent; but since then it has fallen sharply and by the weekend was down 30 per cent on the year. Mediobanca shares have reflected this decline, being quoted below L9,000 against a February high of over L15,000. Apart from investor nervousness, this has reflected the arrest and imprisonment on charges of alleged corruption in connection with the Milan municipal scandal of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, a Mediobanca board member and a leading construction entrepreneur. The board decided on Friday to retain Mr Ligresti in his position, who is also a shareholder, even though he has been in prison for two months, and other changes were made. New members co-opted on to the board were Mr Giuseppe Bruno, chief executive of Credito Italiano, Mr Eugenio Coppola di Canzano, president of Generali, Mr Pietro Marzotto, head of the family textile conglomerate of the same name, and Mr Giampiero Pesenti, president of Italmobiliare, reflecting a careful balance of Mediobanca's institutional and private shareholders. Among those leaving the board were Mr Piero Barucci, formerly head of Credito and now treasury minister, and Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the head of Olivetti.</p>

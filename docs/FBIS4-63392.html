			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is not working on  any amendments to the Constitution concerning the division of  powers, Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov told INTERFAX.  (Recently, there have been rumors about the intention of the  president to submit to the State Duma a number of amendments to  further delineate the powers of top state bodies -- IF).    Filatov emphasized that the Civic Accord Pact had not been  clear enough on which provisions of the Constitution may be  amended. He recognized that development of society would make  it necessary to amend the Constitution. "However, introduction  of any amendments will be carried out jointly by all power  structures," he stressed.    Filatov did not agree with the point of view of some  influential politicians who prognosticate a kind of revenge by  the Soviet system, primarily at the local level and later at the  federal one. Namely, Chairman of the Russian Movement for  Democratic Reforms Gavriil Popov shares this concern.    Filatov reassured that the principle of division of powers  was working both in the center and at the level of the  federation's constituent members. He sees no threat of  restoration of the Soviet system at the regional level.    Filatov believes that the tendency of local representative  bodies influencing the executive power is not dominant.  However, he admitted that such attempts took place, "especially  at the level of the republics." Filatov cited Mordovia as an  example. A surveying commission composed of legal experts from  the government and the president's administration, has lately  come back from Mordovia. The commission concluded that most of  the recent decisions adopted by the Mordovan Supreme Soviet  contradicted the Russian Constitution, Filatov pointed out.    He made it clear that the Russian president had no intention  to solve this problem by force. Filatov said that after the  conversation which had been held with the chairman of the  Mordovan parliament, it was now possible to hope that the  parliament's decision on restoration of the Soviet system at the  regional level would be reviewed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes </F> in Prague; date not given: "European Integration Is Not Just a  Matter of Institutions"]    [Text] [Danes] What was the most important thing you  brought back from the World Economic Forum held in Davos last  weekend?    [Klaus] Two things: On the one hand, the feeling that  people know about the Czech Republic and that what they know  about it are positive things. And, on the other, the  observation that puts my previous statement into the correct  context: that we are not at the center of the world, that there  are a great many extraordinarily interesting and stimulating  things going on in the world, and that it is necessary to listen  carefully to other people.    [Danes] In your speech in Davos, you emphasized the  differences between the individual countries in Europe before  their current integration. According to some observers,  including those in the West, by placing such an emphasis on the  differences, you are damaging our republic's starting position  for its gradual incorporation into the European Union. Are they  not right?    [Klaus] First of all, I do not know if the formulation of  your question--"emphasized the differences"--is correct. I  emphasized something else. I said that, if we analyze Europe's  current development--when I say "Europe," I do not mean the  abstract continent but the flesh-and-blood people who live in  it--we have to be careful that we adjoin its success or failure  to factors that really gain recognition for it and that, on the  contrary, we do not adjoin factors to it that do not gain  recognition for it. I said that the fundamental reason for West  Europe's success in recent decades has been the social system in  these countries and not this or that supranational institution  that lumps Europe together. I cited the example that our  tragedy was not CEMA but the communist regime. This is also  valid symmetrically vice versa.    [Danes] This is valid symmetrically vice versa for what?    [Klaus] Even in West Europe, the dominant factor was not the  influence of the European integrative process but maintaining a  free system based economically on private ownership and so on.  This conclusion applies to the past, the present, and certainly  the future--that is, I was not reproaching anyone in my speech.  It was merely an attempt to analyze the factors that influence  the current situation in Europe. We can then discuss what  percentage share this additional influence--that is, the  establishment of external integration--has had, apart from the  aforementioned dominant influence, in Europe's success.    [Danes] Nevertheless, our state certainly desires  integration with the European Union....    [Klaus] Our state, in any case, wants to integrate with  Europe and merge with Europe in all possible structures.  Undoubtedly, to achieve this, it is necessary to enter into  European institutions and organizations. However, I can  integrate myself institutionally and noninstitutionally. For  example, I can do so economically by abolishing customs barriers  and all sorts of obstacles to trade. Another possibility is that  I will integrate myself on an organizationally institutional  sphere, but this is only one method.    [Danes] According to press reports, in Switzerland you also  admitted to the possibility of our budget policy's transition  from a neutral to an active one. In your opinion, when should a  change of this order take place? Is it intended to take the  wind from Milos Zeman's sails before he had even gathered it?    [Klaus] No, I must disappoint you. I never said anything of  the kind. This was merely a figment of the imagination of some  editor or commentator concerning my speech to Swiss bankers on  Monday [31 January] evening in Wolfsberg. Perhaps this editor  got hold of the German text of my speech. It contained a  written addendum, which I did not refer to in my speech. This  was a theoretical analysis of the kind of economic situation in  which budget policy has to be restrictive, neutral, and  expansive. It says there that no East European country has yet  reached the stage at which it could transfer to an expansive  policy, regardless of whether this makes any sense at all. It  is still my opinion that an expansive budget policy does not  make any sense.    [Danes] As chairman of the Civic Democratic Party, are you  worried about competition from the right? I am referring to the  newly evolving party, whose ranks include, among others, the  publisher of CESKY DENIK, Josef Kudlacek.    [Klaus] I am really not worried about this competition.  These people are not interested in integrating the right wing,  as they falsely dub their political venture. They are merely  interested in making a name for themselves and in asserting  their very extreme view of our current situation. If they  succeed for a while in uniting a couple of people from various  political parties, people who in our already maturing political  spectrum have always remained ostentatiously in lilliputian  parties of absolutely negligible significance, let them do so.  I have absolutely nothing to add to this.    [Danes] Do you think they have any hope of getting into  parliament?    [Klaus] In my opinion, certainly not.</p>

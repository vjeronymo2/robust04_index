The issue to me was a divided  government.  </P> <P> A Republican in as governor with a Democratic Legislature. Since that has  happened, Wilson is going to find that many of his campaign promises are going  to be derailed in the Legislature.  </P> <P> For an example, cock an eye toward Washington. Checks and balances ain't what  they used to be.  </P> <P> BILL LYNDE  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

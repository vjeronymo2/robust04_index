			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Councils 'fail to win hearts' Market research by the Local Government Commission for England in the next 13 counties for which it must make proposals for council reorganisation has found a confused picture. It reveals a strong preference for devolved government to small local areas  -beyond the scope of the current review - but little enthusiasm for either the present districts or counties. Overall, most people identify most strongly with their immediate local community. Only about half feel strong local identity with their district councils - about the same proportion who identify strongly with their counties. A majority of residents in virtually all the counties surveyed favoured the general principle of unitary authorities - that all services should be provided by one council rather than being split between counties and districts - although nowhere was there an overwhelming majority. MORI, the research company, has completed its polling for the commission in Bedfordshire, Cheshire, Devon, Dorset, Essex, Hereford &amp; Worcester, Kent, Norfolk, Northumberland, Suffolk, Surrey, Warwickshire, and Wiltshire. Submissions from councils in these areas are due within the next month, with proposals from the commission following by the end of August. Humberside County Council is applying for judicial review of the commission's proposal that it should be abolished. Avon, Cleveland, Derbyshire and Somerset have already challenged similar plans to replace them with unitary authorities.</p>

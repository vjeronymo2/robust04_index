			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> DISTRICT WITHDRAWS REVISIONS ON HIRING  </P> <P> Board members of the Moorpark Unified School District have joined a persistent  NAACP critic of the district's equal opportunity employment policy, forcing  administrators to withdraw proposed revisions.  </P> <P> The substance of the policy was criticized at a meeting Tuesday, as well as its  implementation by district officials. Board members questioned whether  administrators were doing enough to recruit minority workers to balance the  current overwhelming majority of non-minority district employees.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy. This doesn't make me comfortable in terms of where we are right  now," said board member Pamela Castro.  </P> <P> Of the 213 teachers in the district, 184 are white, 20 are Latinos, seven are  Asian and two are black. Out of other workers, 138 are white, 65 Latino, four  Asian, one American Indian and one black.  </P> <P> Management is made up of 30 whites and five Latinos, according to data  presented at the meeting.  </P> <P> After listening to the board debate, Supt. Thomas Duffy withdrew the proposed  revisions, which had earlier drawn the ire of a black leader.  </P> <P> "I think it's an insult to all decent human beings," said Theodore Green Sr., a  member of the Ventura chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of  Colored People and the parent of a Moorpark High School student.  </P> <P> District administrators contended that the revision was needed to conform to  recent court decisions, eliminate unnecessary language "and still do the same  thing" as the current policy, said Chuck Smith, assistant superintendent of  curriculum and instructional services.  </P> <P> But several board members suggested that the new policy would have placed less  emphasis on the need to recruit minority employees.  </P> <P> Some of the board suggested the district should show a preference for hiring  minority candidates with lesser qualifications who could act as role models for  the students.  </P> <P> Board member Sam Nainoa noted there are no Latino counselors at Moorpark High  School. Latinos make up 28% of the district's 4,800-student population,  according to Assistant Supt. Charles Smith.  </P> <P> But board member Patty Waters said the district would have to pay higher  salaries to compete for well-qualified minority candidates. Demand is high and  the pool is small, according to Waters. ADAM MOSS  </P></p>

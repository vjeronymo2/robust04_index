			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The government has  set up an inter-ministerial commission to deal with Acquired  Immunity Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), the deadly disease which is  also on the rise in Indonesia, it was announced here Tuesday.    Secretary of the Office of the Coordinating Minister of  People's Welfare Suyono Yahya said the commission -- created by  a presidential decree, bore the task of fighting the spread and  "not the victims" of the incurable disease.    The commission would launch programmes to fight AIDS not  only  at national and provincial levels but at district level as well,  Yahya said.    He said the commission's programmes would emphasize efforts  at preventing people from contracting HIV, the virus that leads  to AIDS.    The commission would also disseminate information on AIDS  designed to let the public have the right knowledge and  understanding of the disease. This was necessary to prevent the  public from unduly becoming restive when encountering or having  to live with actual AIDS cases.    Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Azwar Anas is  chairman of the commission while four other cabinet ministers,  namely Health Minister Suyudi, Religious Affairs Minister  Tarmizi Taher, Social Affairs Minister Inten Suweno and State  Minister for Population Affairs Haryono Suyono will be members.    The following cabinet ministers are also involved in the  commission: Information Minister Harmoko, Tourism, Post and  Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave, Home Affairs Minister Yogi  S. Memed and Youth and Sports Minister Hayono Isman.</p>

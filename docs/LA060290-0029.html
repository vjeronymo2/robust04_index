			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ONE FAN WON'T FORGET COMMENTS BY PAGLIARULO  </P> <P> If in fact the criticism was aimed at Tony Gwynn, I think Mike Pagliarulo has a  lot of audacity.  </P> <P> Tony Gwynn is the Padres. He comes to play every game. The same cannot be said  of his teammates. If they would follow his example of fighting for batting cage  time and not going out for drinks after games instead of criticizing him, this  team would stand a chance of achieving its potential.  </P> <P> If it's true that the Yankees have asked one of their players to give up the  No. 13, perhaps Jack McKeon would agree to let Pagliarulo go back to New York  and reclaim it.  </P> <P> LINDA ADAMS, Leucadia  </P></p>

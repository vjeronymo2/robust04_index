			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead WITH the financial crisis at Queens Moat Houses still not fully explained, the rest of the hotel sector is being closely watched. Forte reports full year results next Thursday, with the City expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 70m, compared with Pounds 73m last time. Some expect the group to cut its 9.91p a share dividend. If it does, criticism is likely to be muted, with many regarding a cut as evidence of financial sobriety. The group is likely to be pressed on whether it would be interesed in any of Queens Moat's Continental properties, should these become available. Blue Circle Industries and RMC Group will bring more news on Thursday about the building materials sector. The former, with about half the UK cement market, is expected to report pre-tax profits for 1992 of about Pounds 85m, down sharply from Pounds 124.2m a year earlier. There is some question hanging over its 10.9p a share dividend. RMC, benefitting from its extensive German operations, is likely to report profits down only slightly from 1991's Pounds 167.4m. Laura Ashley, the international fashion and furnishings group, is set to report a return to the black on Thursday after three years of losses. It may also pay a final dividend. A revitalised performance in the UK and continued growth on the continent should enable the group to report a Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m pre-tax profit for the year to January.</p>

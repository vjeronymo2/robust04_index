			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 18 (AFP) -- Syria and Israel are still  far apart over moves towards peace after US Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's latest Middle East mission, Syrian  presidential spokesman Jubran Kuriyah said Wednesday [18 May].    "The results of Mr. Christopher's talks in Israel show that  there are still wide differences because of the Israeli position  on the principles of peace," he said.    Christopher left for Egypt on Wednesday after a second round  of talks with President Hafiz al-Asad, when he briefed the  Syrian leader on his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.  Israel has offered a withdrawal from the strategic Golan heights  over several years in return for total peace, but the Syrian  official press on Wednesday rejected any phased handover. The  Golan has been the main stumbling block between Israel and Syria  since the launch of Middle East peace talks in October 1991.    Negotiations between Syria and Israel have been suspended  since the Hebron massacre on February 25 when a Jewish settler  killed 30 Arab worshipers.</p>

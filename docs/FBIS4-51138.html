			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kenneth Ko] </F>   [Text] The capital of Heilongjiang province, Harbin, has  mapped out a plan to privatise the city's 5,000 or so small to  medium-sized state enterprises. Zhu Sheng-wen, the deputy  mayor, said Harbin was attempting to restructure these  enterprises by way of sale or lease to foreign investors, or  transform them into shareholding companies.    He said the city intended to privatise half of these  enterprises by the end of this year, and privatise all of them  by the end of next year. The restructuring programme had the  approval of the central government. For large state  enterprises, the privatisation will be through the issue of H  shares, B shares or joint ventures with foreign partners, he  said.    Mr Zhu is leading a Harbin trade delegation to Hong Kong.  The  delegation is offering foreign participation in about 200  projects, including textiles, machinery, electronics, chemicals  and light industry. Seventy-five small to medium-sized Harbin  state enterprises are on sale to foreign investors.    New China Hong Kong Group, headed by businessman Tsui  Tsin-tong, yesterday entered into deals for the restructuring of  the Harbin Brewery Plant and an electrical machinery factory.  The brewery joint venture will involve investment of about 580  million yuan (about HK$516.2 million). New China Hong Kong  holds a 54 percent stake in the project, according to Harbin  officials. The electrical machinery project will cost U.S.$30  million, and will expand and upgrade production. New China Hong  Kong has a 45 percent interest in the venture.    Mr Zhu said about 40 percent of Harbin state enterprises  were  loss-making and restructuring was needed. There were about  1,380 foreign-funded enterprises in Harbin, involving investment  of $2.2 billion. A total of 652 such enterprises were funded by  Hong Kong capital, worth a total of U.S.$560 million, he said.    In the first four months of this year, a total of 98  foreign-funded enterprises were approved, involving a total  foreign investment of U.S.$110 million from foreign partners, he  said.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CLASS STUGGLES OF THE UPPER STRATA IN 'METROPOLITAN'  </P> <P> Cozying up to "Metropolitan" (Cineplex Beverly Center, AMC Century 14) becomes  a real test of toleration: how compassionate are you about the very rich and  rather dim? Not at all? Then this romantic comedy of manners, set during a  single New York Christmas season of debutante balls and after-parties, may set  your teeth grinding.  </P> <P> However, if you bear in mind that its debuting writer-director-producer, Whit  Stillman intended "Metropolitan" as very gentle irony, you're already ahead.  After all, he can't be too stuffy; he subtitled his slice-of-high-life "Doomed.  Bourgeois. In Love." And as it turns out, Stillman's gift for quiet, scrupulous  observation grows on you.  </P> <P> "Metropolitan" is set sometime in the recent past and it is unabashedly  autobiographical; roughly 15 years ago Stillman was his outsider-protagonist  Tom Townsend locked priggishly in a love-hate relationship with the UHB. UHB?  Ah, that's the title one of the group drawlingly confers on his "doomed" peers:  the Urban Haute Bourgeoisie; "More sociologically precise than preppie."  </P> <P> Tom (Edward Clements), in from Princeton for Christmas vacation, thinks himself  in moral opposition to every UHB born. He announces, frequently, that he  follows Charles Fourier, the 19th-Century social reformer whose theories were  tried out by Brooke Farm. It's envy, of course. Tom's an insider tossed outside  by the two dreaded words "divorce" and "stepmother."  </P> <P> The art directors of "Metropolitan," who seem to have gotten everything exactly  right, have the Townsend's apartment down pat: comfortable, faintly shabby,  brave; a few "good" pieces from the divorce, probably his mother's before the  marriage. It reeks of reduced circumstances and it -- and his mother, who no  longer has her son's illusions about when his father is going to call them --  is terribly touching.  </P> <P> Red-headed Tom is swept into the Sally Fowler Rat Pack by the simple accident  of sharing a cab with this inner circle of debs and their escorts. Since he  seems to be one of them, they invite him up to Sally's for a ritual of  post-party gossip and deeply earnest conversation about art ("the Surrealists  were just a bunch of social climbers") or the bleak future of their class. And  in a ball season where there is a severe shortage of acceptable escorts, Tom is  suddenly penciled in as Available. It will become the erosion of his every  principle.  </P> <P> It takes a while to sort the Pack out, but shiny-haired Audrey Rouget (the  delightful Carolyn Farina) is clearly its overlooked treasure. Director  Stillman performs a deadpan introduction to Audrey, in tears over a crack her  (unseen) little brother has made about an (unnamed) part of her anatomy. Audrey  reads, she thinks, she feels -- acutely. It does rather set her apart from most  of Sally's set. Tom reads too, but reviews, not the books themselves. Not even  an admission like that dims Audrey's growing love for him.  </P> <P> The caustic Nick Smith (Christopher Eigerman), is the Pack's leader. If he's  more understanding than the rest about Tom's peculiarities -- public  transportation, a light raincoat instead of a warm topcoat, a rented tux -- it  may come from their shared experience as kids with divorced, remarried fathers.  Charlie Black (Taylor Nichols), with his wire glasses and impacted admiration  of Audrey, is the group's moralist; Cynthia McLean (Isabel Gillies) is its  sexual adventurer and the somnolent Fred Neff (Bryan Leder) seems to have  mastered middle-age before he's turned 24.  </P> <P> Outside the Pack but crucial to it and the story are the season's glamour girl,  Serena Slocum (Elizabeth Thompson), to whom Tom wrote impassioned letters in  boarding school and international jet-setter Rick von Sloneker (Will Kempe),  who finds using his title "baron" an unnecessary bore. (Unfortunately, in a  role that needs blase Eurostyle charisma, Kempe manages only the blase.)  </P> <P> Filmmaker Stillman is a pointillist, working in the tiniest, most meticulous  degrees. If he seems at times as controlled and distanced as his own UHBs, his  impulsive, romantic ending betrays him. Stillman understands caste, class and  deportment as perfectly as Audrey's idol, Jane Austen and by the time he's  through, so do we.  </P> <P> 'METROPOLITAN'  </P> <P> A New Line Cinema release of a Westerly Films presentation.

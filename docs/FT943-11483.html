			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed fortunes for German, Swiss drugs groups Claims and counterclaims by the pharmaceuticals companies were a feature of European trading yesterday. In Germany, Schering dived DM54, or 5.5 per cent, to DM926, and to DM920 in the after market, on reports that rival companies had made progress on research into a drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It was thought that an alternative medicine would have a significant impact on Schering's earnings. In the opposite direction, Ares-Serono, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, picked up SFr99, or 16.5 per cent, to SFr700: Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS in Zurich explained that Ares held the patent for the production process for beta interferon which Biogen, the American drugs company, had claimed was superior to Schering's Betaseron anti-multiple sclerosis drug. FRANKFURT weakened slightly in the official session but made up some of this lost ground after hours, helped by strength on Wall Street. The Dax closed off 17.63 at 2,122.81 and in the Ibis moved to 2,134.12. Turnover amounted to DM6.1bn. Commerzbank disappointed some investors with its first-half results, although there was general agreement that it would match 1993 results for the full year. The shares ended DM9 off at DM335. Among other banks, Deutsche fell DM6.00 to DM728.50 and Dresdner DM5.50 to DM386.00. Elsewhere in the financial sector, Allianz was down DM42 at DM2,425. James Capel has reiterated its buy recommendation on Deutsche, following its recent results: 'Given that some further modest reduction in interest rates is to be expected, and that statistics for German industry's orders, output and confidence levels are getting better and better, and that hopefully, disasters on the scale of Metalgesellschaft and Schneider are things of the past, there is good reason to be optimistic.' ZURICH was firmer in deriv-atives-driven trade, and the SMI index, in negative territory for much of the session, picked up towards the close to finish 14.4 ahead at 2,559.3. Trading volumes were low. Roche certificates, marked down to their low for the year of SFr5,160 at one stage, finished SFr10 down on the day at SFr5,290. A SFr100 decline in EMS to SFr4,000 was attributed to investors reducing the weighting of the stock in their portfolios. Nestle posted a SFr11 gain at SFr1,160, pushed up by a technical rebound following Wednesday's decline. CS Holding rose SFr6 to SFr565 ahead of first-half results from Credit Suisse which could come today. PARIS shrugged off the cut by the Bank of France in the repo rate - which had been long expected - and the CAC-40 closed a day of only moderate trading activity 2.26 softer at 2,053.04. Most of the corporate news was announced after the close of trading. Elf Aquitaine, off 80 centimes at FFr411.10, said it was to sell an asset portfolio worth FFr1.1bn to BNP, FFr1 firmer at FFr259, in exchange for new shares which would lift its stake in the bank to above 4 per cent, from 1.86 per cent at present. Roussel Uclaf also reported after hours that first-half net income had gained 44 per cent, the shares slipping FFr2 to FFr571 during the day; while Peugeot, which said that first-half turnover was up nearly 15 per cent, lost FFr1 to FFr829. MILAN staged a technical recovery after the 4.3 per cent fall over the previous two sessions, but trading remained thin and the mood uncertain as investors awaited fresh developments on the political front. The Comit index rose 1.0 to 696.03. Against the trend, Olivetti was heavily traded for the second consecutive session, prompting speculation of some shifting of shareholdings between investors. The shares gained L27 at L2,364 in volume of almost 14m. Pirelli led the industrials higher, rising L99 to L2,811, with investors said to be reassessing recent cables contracts. Fiat ordinary shares rose L110 to L6,790, while the recently neglected preferred shares caught up with recent rises elsewhere, adding L80 at L4,070. AMSTERDAM made forward progress although turnover remained low, as has been the trend in recent sessions. The Aex index rose 0.91 to 405.22. Among the day's movers, IHC Caland put on Fl 1.30 at Fl 40.20 as the engineering and dredging group said it had won an order to provide equipment for the Suez canal. MADRID was easier but off its lows, helped by the better tone in other European bourses and in the futures market. The general index gave up 1.64 at 309.54. BCH shed Pta10 to Pta2,570 after announcing a 26.9 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits. Argentaria , which posted a 10.1 per cent increase in first-half net profits, lost Pta60 at Pta5,670. A Pta110, or 2.2 per cent, fall to Pta4,990 in Banco Santander was attributed to a decision to allow 47.3m new shares to trade in Madrid from today. BRUSSELS finished mixed after recovering from early losses and the Bel-20 index firmed 0.92 to 1,451.44. Solvay was the star performer, adding BFr475, or 3.2 per cent, at BFr15,350 in response to Wednesday's better than expected first-half results.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jul 28                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1364.34     1363.73      1365.15      1364.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1403.24     1402.85      1404.57      1404.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00        15.00        Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1365.52     1364.13      1369.75      1372.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1404.94     1401.96      1407.07      1410.54  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Jul 27     Jul 26    Jul 25    Jul 22   Jul 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1370.08   1391.70   1384.93   1387.40   1371.54 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1406.86   1424.29   1421.38   1424.29   1407.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 -  1373.14 ; 200 -  1411.12 Low/day: 100 -  1362.91  200 -  1400.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

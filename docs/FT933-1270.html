			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Adsteam reduces deficit to ADollars 440m before tax ADSTEAM, the Australian investment holding company which takes in the David Jones department stores group, yesterday posted a ADollars 440.5m (USDollars 293.7m) loss before tax and extraordinary items for the year ended June. This compared with a ADollars 722.3m deficit in the previous 12 months. Adsteam said that at an operating level its businesses made profits of ADollars 388.9m, up from ADollars 336.4m. However, total finance charges, including lease finance charges, consumed ADollars 516.8m, slightly less than last time's ADollars 638m. Abnormal losses sucked up a further ADollars 312.6m, against ADollars 420.6m. The abnormals reflected a ADollars 290.9m writedown of property assets, a reduction in investments, closure costs, and costs relating to the recent Woolworths flotation. The flotation came after the year-end, and profits on the share sale - which have helped to slash Adsteam's debt - are not included in the 1992-93 figures.</p>

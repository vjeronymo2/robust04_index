			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Matchmaker misses the mark - Thornton Wilder at Chichester AS THE song goes, 'Who cares if banks fail in Yonkers? As long as you've got a kiss that conquers.' Love and money have long been travelling companions, but they rarely meet in Yonkers, save in Thornton Wilder's The Matchmaker (1954), the rewrite of The Merchant of Yonkers (1938) and the blueprint for Hello Dolly] (1964). The show at the Chichester Festival Theatre is a disappointing production which gives full scope to Wilder's weaknesses and adds a few of its own. Wilder (1897-1975) indulges a quiet look at life's absurdities and pretensions, half serious but usually entertaining, the mark of a novelist as well as playwright. The plays themselves are fragile tempered and easily upset. The Matchmaker amounts to gentle social and matrimonial farce set in New York, 1900. The plot shatters into connubial shards at the end, but remains in the hands of Dolly - the matchmaker - who brings the wealthy merchant widower Vandergelder from Yonkers to New York and marries him, while marrying off his chief clerk to Irene, her principle rival, and his heiress daughter to an impecunious artist. Patrick Mason's direction allows the scenes to hang around too long, like a lingering dinner guest. This makes Wilder's meticulous farce look less than ordinary, limping along between bons mots which seem to issue from a quotation book rather than from the action itself. Vandergelder unleashes his views on marriage - 'a bribe to make a housekeeper think she's a householder' - while Dolly sums up New York: 'I want New York to be more like Vienna and less like a collection of nervous and tired ants.' Freud did make a difference. The sets (Joe Vanek) are standard, fine Chichester fare. First the Vandergelder store, an anxious green accumulation of officeware; then a wonderful hat store belonging to Irene, one of Vandergelder's putative wives; and then a splendid New York balcony and drawing room backed by canyons of lit skyscrapers. However, the principals, Prunella Scales as Dolly and Frank Lazarus as Vandergelder, look uncomfortable in their roles. The gestures are not yet integrated, their speech not yet consistent. Mason leaves them with too much dead space around them and too little to do, so they are forever fiddling and meandering around the stage. Scales has so far developed an off-hand bossiness; she introduces herself as 'the woman who arranges things', manipulates others by confiding, and wants Vandergelder's wealth redistributed to 'circulate like rainwater', her own pennies from heaven. In contrast, the excellent Isla Blair as Irene fashions a fine character by trimming a hat or turning her head to flirt. The play's best scenes involve her with two penniless naives down from Yonkers. First, there is high farce in cupboards and under tables; yet this finishes with a quiet civil war song faithful to Wilder's stage directions. And then the evening puts the two ingenues in Irene's professional charge at an expensive restaurant. These scenes show that Wilder should not be played too much for laughs. The the principal characters have short soliloquies to explain themselves and their roles, like Eliot's knights in Murder in The Cathedral. The best of these is a journeyman employee, Malachi (well crafted by John Rogan) who advises against mixing the vices. Elsewhere, there are highlights, like the coachman who responds to 'Do you want to earn five dollars?' with 'I dunno, I've never tried' and the girl who longs for home: 'I wish I was back in Yonkers where nothing happens.'

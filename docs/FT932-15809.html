			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Solvay sees another difficult year SOLVAY, the Belgian chemicals group, yesterday warned that its earnings would slump again this year as the European economy continues to deteriorate. The group proposed holding its net dividend at BFr500 per share, the same as in 1990 and 1991. Solvay said net consolidated profits fell 16.5 per cent in 1992, to BFr9.76bn (Dollars 293m) from BFr11.7bn in 1991. Stripping out extraordinary gains, profits fell to BFr8.41bn from BFr9.79bn, a drop of 14 per cent, as announced in January amid preliminary 1992 figures. 'The first half of this year should . . . prove to be particularly difficult,' the company said. Baron Daniel Janssen, Solvay's chairman, warned the group would have to cut further jobs in 1993, in addition to the 1,700 lost last year, mainly through early retirement. Mr Janssen underlined that the group was continuing its investment programme to reinforce its fundamental strengths. Competition in Europe took its toll on alkalis and plastics. Earnings before interest, taxes and charges slipped to BFr5.6bn from BFr6.13bn in alkalis, and to BFr90m from BFr1.7bn in plastics. Earnings from peroxygens rose to BFr3.06bn from BFr2.75bn, health products to BFr2.97bn from BFr2.24bn, while earnings in the processing sector slipped to BFr2.18bn from BFr2.29bn. Overall sales were steady at BFr254bn and net earnings slipped to BFr1,177 per share from BFr1,410. Tractebel, the Belgian utilities group, pushed up net consolidated profits to BFr27bn from BFr25.7bn. The group has proposed a 3.1 per cent increase in net dividends to BFr330 (BFr320) per share. Tractebel's principal subsidiary is Electrabel, Belgium's largest company by market capitalisation. Some 41 per cent of Tractebel is in turn owned by Societe Generale de Belgique, which announces its 1992 results today.</p>

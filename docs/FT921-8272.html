			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Strong sales lift Canon 3.9% before tax CANON, the Japanese precision instrument-maker, yesterday announced a 3.9 per cent rise in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y76.1bn (Dollars 618.7m) for the year ended last December, thanks to continued strong sales of its computer printers using new bubble jet and laser technology, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The announcement comes at a time when profits at Japanese high-technology companies are being squeezed by sluggish exports and lower profit margins. Sales rose 15.3 per cent to Y1,073.4bn from Y931.30bn. Canon said sales of its office automation machinery, including its computer printers, which rose 13 per cent to Y793bn, helped sustain profits. Camera sales rose 25 per cent to Y220.7bn. Exports rose 18 per cent to Y812.7bn, while domestic sales rose 7 per cent to Y260.6bn. Canon suffered exchange rate losses due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar, but interest on deposits rose 18.4 per cent to Y25.7bn on higher interest rates and a rise in short-term funds due to warrant-bond issues worth Y100bn.</p>

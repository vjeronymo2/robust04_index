			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Zhang Lei (1728 7191): "Say Goodbye to </F> the `Lead and Fire' History; Usher in the `Light and  Electricity' Era; XIZANG RIBAO Typeset by Laser; XIZANG RIBAO  Yesterday Held Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony; Regional Leaders Basang,  Danzim, Lieque, Puqung, Laba Pingcuo, and Ga Gin, Deputy  Political Commissar of the Tibet Regional People's Armed Police  Corps; and Wang Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Beida and  Fangzheng Groups, Attended"]    [Text] Amid crackling firecrackers, Basang, deputy  chairman of the Xizang Regional Party Committee and vice  chairman of the regional committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference; Laba Pingcuo, vice chairman  of the regional people's government; and Wang Yuchuan, vice  chairman of the Bada and Fangzheng Groups and general manager of  the Chengdu Fangzheng Corp. Ltd., took up their scissors. Soon,  three red flowers dropped onto a platter. After 38 years of  unremitting efforts, XIZANG RIBAO, while marking its founding  anniversary on 22 April, also said goodbye to its "lead and  fire" history and ushered in a "light and electricity" era.  From now on, both the Chinese and Tibetan editions of the  XIZANG RIBAO will be typeset by laser, and the paper, like all  other provincial-level papers in the country, has upgraded its  typesetting with new technology.    Danzim, a veteran XIZANG RIBAO newsman and deputy secretary  of the regional party committee, expressed what was in the  hearts of the entire XIZANG RIBAO staff. He said: "With the  use of laser typesetting technology, the long-cherished dream of  veteran newsmen has been realized, and the frontier areas'  journalistic development has made one step forward."  Representing the regional party committee and the regional  people's government, Danzim warmly congratulated the entire  XIZANG RIBAO staff and thanked the Beida and Fangzheng Groups  for their unselfish assistance and energetic support.    Lie Que, member of the regional party committee standing  committee and secretary of the Lhasa Municipal Party Committee;  Pucung, vice chairman of the regional people's congress standing  committee; and Ga Jin, deputy political commissar of the Tibet  Regional People's Armed Police Corps; as well as persons in  charge of relevant departments, bureaus, committees, and offices  in Tibet, leaders in charge of propaganda in various  prefectures; and journalists of various news units in Lhasa,  also came to XIZANG RIBAO to extend their congratulations.    Gao Yanxiang, XIZANG RIBAO editor-in-chief, said excitedly:  Although XIZANG RIBAO is the last newspaper in the country to  begin using laser typesetting technology, the use of this  technology has great significance. It represents a leap forward  and a revolution in Tibet's newspaper publishing history. He  added: The regional party committee and government set strict  requirements for the laser typesetting project and always  expressed interests in its progress. Despite financial  restraints, planning, financial, banking, designing, and  construction departments made sure that special funds for the  project were available and the project was meticulously designed  and installed. Postal, telecommunications, and power  departments made positive efforts in coordinating our paper's  normal publishing and distribution; civil air transport and the  Lhasa Air Command [kong zhi 4500 2172] airlifted the machinery  to Lhasa safely and in the quickest way possible; and newspapers  and publishing units of central authorities and all provinces  and municipalities gave us their warm encouragement and support.  All this reflected the great importance which people of all  walks of life inside and outside Tibet attached to XIZANG  RIBAO's news reporting and propaganda; reflected the spirit of  unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance; and reflected the  warmth of our Motherland as a big family and the fraternal ties  among people of all nationalities. Speaking on behalf of the  entire XIZANG RIBAO staff, Gao Yanxiang pledged that the entire  XIZANG RIBAO staff would continue to carry forward the spirit of  waging arduous struggle, being ready to dedicate themselves, and  working hard in unity in operating the newspaper. He said the  XIZANG RIBAO staff will continue to emancipate their minds,  press forward, and bring forth new ideas to create a good and  stable environment for Xizang's spiritual and material  construction.    At yesterday's ribbon-cutting ceremony, Du Tai, deputy head  of the regional party committee propaganda department; and Wang  Yuchuan, vice chairman of the Beida and Fangzheng Groups and  president of the Chengdu Fangzheng Electronics Corp. Ltd., also  gave warm speeches.    Following the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the leaders and  visitors toured the laser typesetting room with great interest.</p>

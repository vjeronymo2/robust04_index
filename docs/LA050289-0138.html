Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW DRINKING WATER STANDARDS SET  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans today to regulate 38  contaminants in drinking water on grounds that they pose a health hazard.  </P> <P> Monitoring to detect pollutant levels in the water system is likely to cost  every household nationwide up to an extra $10 a year. The EPA estimated that it  will cost 2,500 mostly small public water systems about $360 million to install  equipment to lower the amount of pollutants.  </P> <P> The 38 pollutants added to EPA's list brought to 55 the number of contaminants  for which the agency has set standards.  </P> <P> Among those named today were asbestos, barium, styrene, mercury, chromium,  selenium, aldicarb, chlordane and PCBs. Michael Cook, director of the EPA  Office of Drinking Water, told a press conference that 2 million people will be  affected by the new list, largely in the Southeast and upper Midwest and in  farming areas where pesticide use is highest.  </P></p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Inchcape motoring to strong performance - A look at the progress of the group since the acquisition of TKM INCHCAPE, the international motor and business services group, is today expected to report sharply increased profits and earnings, thereby maintaining its strong performance in spite of recession. Reporting good results will also be a significant landmark for Mr Charles Mackay, who took over at the end of 1991 from Sir George Turnbull, the group's forceful chairman and chief executive. Mr Mackay had already been chosen to work as chief executive alongside Sir George, but the chairman's sudden illness meant the succession had to be brought forward at very short notice. Sir George, who died in December, helped transform the former colonial trading house into a premium-rated FTSE-100 stock, which currently has a market value of more than Pounds 3bn. When Sir George became ill, Mr Mackay, who had led the Far Eastern operation, was in London negotiating the Pounds 382m acquisition of Tozer Kemsley Millbourn, the motors and retailing concern. The purchase, from Brierley Investments of New Zealand, was funded by a 1-for-3 rights issue, Inchcape's first since it was floated in 1958. Mr Mackay said there was no time for any handover: 'We were right in the middle of the TKM deal, so one could hardly have asked for a more inauspicious start. It worked very well because the TKM deal galvanised the whole company, pulling everyone together - it was very exciting. The rights was well received in the City and it gave all of us a sense of pride. 'The more fundamental thing was George's legacy - it didn't all collapse when George himself suddenly disappeared. Inchcape under George was remarkably free of company politics. That team spirit he fostered just rode on; the momentum was unstoppable. People also closed ranks and did it as a sort of tribute for George.' Sir David Orr, who was chairman of the group between 1983-86, stepped in to fill that role again until September, when Sir David Plastow arrived. Sir David, 60, is another motors veteran, having just retired as chairman from Vickers, the engineering group that includes Rolls-Royce Motors. The group has appointed three executive directors to the board and two non-executives in the last year. Mr Mackay said: 'The people who had been brought in by George in their mid-forties woke up one day and found they were in their fifties. It crept up on us and it was felt necessary that we get the right age profile for our board.' Mr Mackay talks enthusiastically about the TKM acquisition as a 'quantum leap' for Inchcape. 'It broadened the range of people we were involved with and heightened our already very strong image with motor manufacturers. We've taken on eight motor franchises in the last year - more than we did in the past 10.' A joint venture with Peugeot, to import the French maker's cars into Japan, had caused a lot of excitement. 'We have had approaches from other manufacturers, to see what we could do for them - to which our response is 'hang on guys, we've just started this one - let's not run before we've learned to walk.' In spite of Inchcape's recent success, some observers expressed unease that the TKM deal increased the exposure to motors, lifting the proportion of sales and profits from 50 to 60 per cent. Mr Mackay said: 'One reason people are concerned is that there is a general perception that motors is a cyclical business. If you look at Inchcape and our track record, you will find that is not actually the case. We're not a Ford, and we're not a Tom Cowie (the UK motor distributor). We're a relatively unique, as an import/distribution specialist. 'When a downturn comes, our spread of business across 26 countries means that we've managed to keep going through all recessions. The UK may be going through a tough time, but Hong Kong has just had a boom year - and so has Greece. There's not another motors group of which that is true. 'The big mistake people make is in assuming that size of market determines profitability - whereas almost the reverse is true.' The chief executive also expressed satisfaction with the progress of 'global streaming,' that is dividing the group's activities by business - motors, marketing and services such as shipping and insurance - rather than by location. Mr Mackay said this process had undoubtedly started to produce benefits, although more remained to be done. 'One thing we have not yet got to grips with is the transfer of best practice. It's amazing how much resistance there is - just sheer inertia.' In spite of the success of the TKM deal, Mr Mackay sounds a cautionary note: 'Acquisitions hit the headlines - and there's a danger there, both internally and externally, that everyone starts thinking that is what it's all about. 'To put it in perspective: if you go back to 1982, our motors business made operating profits of about Pounds 10-12m. By 1991 (pre-TKM acquisition) we'd got it up to about Pounds 120m. Nearly all of that came from organic growth, doing better, selling more cars, getting more efficient.' He believes 75 per cent of growth in the motors business should come from organic growth - defined as including bolt-on acquisitions, and only about 25 per cent from larger acquisitions. 'We have made it absolutely clear that does not mean we have to get that quarter - if we find the right acquisitions, we will - if we don't, we won't'</p>

The program sets the party's stance on the development of  economy, education, culture, science and human rights but still  lacks paragraphs on environmental protection and sports, said  party Chairman Juris Bojars.    The party endorses a 10-year residence qualification as  essential for naturalization until Russia completes the  withdrawal of its troops from Latvia and the demographic  situation stabilizes. When the two conditions are fulfilled,  the residence qualification could be reduced to five years.    In economy, the party warns of excessive trading of Latvia's  property and industrial potential to foreign entrepreneurs. In  foreign politics, it will seek partners among the world's  leftist parties.</p>

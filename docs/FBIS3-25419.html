			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson  Mandela has hinted that more concessions could be made in an  effort to secure the participation of the Freedom Alliance in  the April election.    Mr. Mandela, currently on a visit to The Hague in the  Netherlands, reacted to the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party]  response that Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi rejected the  series of far- reaching concessions to the alliance, by saying  that it was still too early to assume that Chief Minister  Buthelezi has turned his back on the proposals. He added that  it appeared the IFP had left the door open for participation in  the election.    Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg says  he  hopes to have full details of the proposals by later today. He  described the ANC's reference to self-determination as vague and  said that the CP demanded complete self-determination for the  Afrikaner in his own territory.    The Democratic Party [DP] has welcomed the proposals as a  meaningful step towards federalism. DP leader Dr. Zach de Beer  said during his election tour of the Little Karoo that his party  would support the proposed changes to the interim constitution  and the Electoral Act. He said he regarded the double ballot  system as a fundamental right and welcomed the proposed  increased powers for provinces.    Bophuthatswana said that the proposals were very interesting  and that a full statement would be issued later.</p>

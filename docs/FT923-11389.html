			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cash flow troubles Carolco CAROLCO, the embattled Hollywood studio whose hit films, including Terminator 2, have not been enough to keep it from the brink of bankruptcy, said it had severe liquidity problems because of its continuing inability to draw under its bank credit facilities, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The company's wholly-owned television subsidiary also confirmed it was discussing the sale of some US television rights to its film library with Spelling Entertainment for about Dollars 69m. The terms of the deal with Spelling would be similar to an earlier agreement, which expired this summer without completion. Spelling would buy some US distribution rights to more than 150 films, including the recently-released Basic Instinct and Terminator 2.</p>

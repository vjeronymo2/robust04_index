			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Bossi opens new wounds in coalition Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's populist Northern League, yesterday reopened a damaging split in the Italian government by accusing Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, of trying to cut the League out of the governing coalition. An agitated Mr Bossi, interviewed on television as he returned from holiday in Sardinia, also claimed that Mr Berlusconi had asked President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro for permission to hold new elections. The claim was immediately dismissed by the prime minister and the president. 'I won't waste time denying nonsense,' Mr Berlusconi was reported as saying. 'I'll have to propose a tax on chatter.' The president's press office issued a statement saying Mr Bossi's claim was 'absolutely without foundation'. Mr Bossi's comments demonstrate, however, that three weeks' holiday has not healed the rift between the League leader and his coalition allies. 'It's not possible to offload the League,' Mr Bossi said, pointing out that it was the principal parliamentary party. 'At this point perhaps we ought to give Berlusconi an abacus, if he goes on fooling himself that it's possible to throw out the League before we've passed an anti-trust law or a new constitution.' Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the third main coalition partner, the far-right National Alliance, said in a television interview that Mr Bossi's behaviour was 'puerile'. At the beginning of August, Mr Berlusconi and Mr Bossi held all-night discussions to patch up their differences. The next day they appeared on television together in an attempt to demonstrate to nervous financial markets and the Italian people that there were no hard feelings between them, in spite of Mr Bossi's persistent criticism of Mr Berlusconi. Since then, Mr Bossi has kept up an informal commentary on League policy from the beach in Sardinia, but has refrained from attacking Mr Berlusconi. Mr Bossi's intervention could upset financial markets, just as they seemed to have recovered their poise following the turbulence caused by political uncertainty and the consequent rise in Italian interest rates last month. Yesterday, before Mr Bossi's comments were broadcast, the lira strengthened against the D-Mark and was trading at less than L1,000 for the first time since August 8. In recent days, Mr Bossi has been incensed by press reports that he claimed to have prevented an armed rebellion by League supporters in 1986-87. He has blamed 'anti-democratic' journalists for misreporting his comments, and has threatened legal action against television and newspapers for spreading 'disinformation'. Observer, Page 23</p>

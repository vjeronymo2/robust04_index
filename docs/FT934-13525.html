			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Observer: High-wire double act? It has been a good week for North American executives who supposedly lost out in the John Akers/Lou Gerstner succession at IBM. First John Sculley, one of those tipped for the top at Big Blue earlier this year, jumped from Apple Computer to Spectrum. Though others think it a loss-making minnow, he claims not to have been so excited by anything in a decade. Now Paul Stern, an ex-IBM man who seemingly made himself available for the job at his former stable by resigning as chief executive of Northern Telecom two days after Akers went, has pitched up at Forstmann Little &amp; Co. A leading management buy-out specialist, the outfit seems to be in vogue with high-wire telecoms types refocusing their careers. Welcomed aboard as a special limited partner, he joins Daniel Akerson, 44, who made it straight to general partner in August when he resigned as MCI's president after less than a year on the job. A 54-year-old Czech-born American, who has never denied an 'obsession' with getting to the top, Stern left the Canadian telephone equipment supplier miffed that his fellow directors had gone over his head in appointing Jean Monty as president. Akerson, meanwhile, maintained he had been lured by the opportunity to lead General Instrument, controlled by Forstmann since 1989, into the world of interactive media. Others reckoned that he had seen his path to the top blocked by Bert Roberts, MCI's 51-year-old chief. Let's hope Forstmann's Dollars 2bn war chest is big enough for both men to make their mark without stepping on each other's toes.</p>

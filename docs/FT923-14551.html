			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Small investors 'not confident' SMALL investors are showing a lack of confidence in the market, according to a survey commissioned by ProShare, the government-funded organisation set up to promote wider share ownership. The survey was conducted by Mori which found that 43 per cent of private shareholders think it is a bad time to invest in stocks and shares, and only 37 per cent think it is a good time. Sectors favoured for investment are food and drink, followed by chemicals, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas. Those in which the least confidence was shown are construction, motor vehicles, metals and mining.</p>

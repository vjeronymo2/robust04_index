			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (19): The ground feels more stable - Germany / The economy's high-cost base is under attack THE WORST of the German recession may be past, but no one is cheering. After four consecutive quarters of nil or negative growth, gross domestic product in the west showed a 0.5 per cent increase in the second quarter of this year, compared with the first three months. However, aggregate output was still 2 per cent below year-earlier figures, and industry especially reported that there was a long way to go before the peaks registered in 1991 and early 1992 could be matched. On a wider front, the economy is emerging from the trough with its key structural problems unresolved. Inflation, at an annual 4.2 per cent rate, is virtually the same as when the recession hit. In the east, chronic unemployment remains to be tackled. No one expects either a rapid recovery or a speedy solution, but there is growing confidence that at least the ground underfoot is stabilising, allowing long-standing problems to be tackled in a calmer atmosphere. 'We are in neither a dramatic nor a traumatic situation. . . We are in a difficult recession which came very quickly and went very deep,' according to Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank. Apart from GDP figures, there is ample evidence that the tide has turned. The west German business confidence index of the respected Ifo economics institute in Munich has been climbing, with some hesitation, since January. In the east, meanwhile, little has changed. Most industrial companies are running losses, while services, skilled trades and construction are expanding, as they have since unification in October 1990. But they are still growing mainly on the back of demand from the public sector, funded mostly by transfers from the west, estimated this year at DM170bn. Total GDP in the east is expected to grow 6.5 per cent this year and 6 per cent next, although, as Ifo points out: 'This cannot be called a self-sustained upswing.' Such optimism as can be found for the immediate future of the overall German economy stems from general perceptions rather than hard and fast trends. Conditions in export markets are not at their best, but at least they are no longer deteriorating, says a recent report from Paribas Capital Markets, for example. It also notes that despite fears of a rapid appreciation of the D-Mark - and damage to German products' international competitiveness - as a consequence of the effective suspension of the European exchange rate mechanism, the German currency, on a trade-weighted basis, is no stronger now than it was six months ago. Ifo, on the other hand, says there is cause for concern in the fact that improvements in foreign demand are not coming from Germany's traditional west European markets, but from hitherto neglected niche areas such as south-east Asia where trade relationships are less stable. This, coupled with expected average economic growth of 1 per cent next year in Germany's nearby trading partners - compared with a forecast 5 per cent expansion in world trade - suggests a less telling contribution to export-led recovery from recession than in past downturns, the institute says. The return to normal is also expected to be slowed by falling private demand within Germany. After dropping by an estimated 1 per cent this year, the trend is expected to continue into 1994. Although the new year's wage round has yet to start, there is an air of resignation about early suggestions from leading trade unions, which say they are prepared to accept pay rises for the new year equal to inflation plus productivity gains. Civil servants, meanwhile, can expect no increase - equivalent to a real 3 per cent decline. Whatever the outcome of free-market pay negotiations, consumers' pockets are likely to be severely squeezed by the federal government's budget consolidation programme. The budget will reduce disposable incomes by DM40bn next year alone. Ifo suggests average disposable incomes will fall by a real 2 per cent as inflation of 3 per cent sweeps away nominal gains of just 1 per cent. The government's consolidation measures represent one side of a concerted effort to attack Germany's high-costs base, which is widely acknowledged as the overall economy's main and most debilitating weakness. Industry, too, has set about the job of cutting costs with an unaccustomed vigour. In the 12 months to the end of June this year, manufacturing shed 7 per cent of its total workforce, and there is no sign of the trend relaxing, least of all in the automotive and engineering sectors, the country's main export industries. The need for further savings was underlined in the government's second-quarter GDP report, which showed overall productivity still falling and unit labour costs still rising. Industry's attack on its inflated costs base is as bold as it is wide. Just as the government is chipping away at the welfare state, companies are also slicing into time-honoured employee benefits. That Daimler-Benz should risk confrontation with its unions over cuts in perks such as Christmas bonuses, spa cures and first-communion clothes for employees' children, demonstrates the intensity of the search for economies. But the main target is the workforce. More jobs have been lost in western industry since mid-1991 than were created in the post-unification period. Unemployment will continue to rise next year as the search for higher productivity continues. Even though GDP is expected to grow by 0.5 per cent, the proportion of the workforce unemployed is widely forecast to hit new records, above the 8 per cent peak recorded in 1985. Little improvement is expected in the east, where the rate is expected to continue hovering just under 16 per cent. Longer term, worse is to be expected if industry fails to press ahead with the process now under way, and current pay and conditions agreements in the east remain unchanged. A projection from Goldman Sachs suggests no relief from high unemployment in the west for the next three years, while the rate in the east charges upwards to peak in 1996 at a staggering 37 per cent.</p>

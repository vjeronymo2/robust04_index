			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>   [Text] Amman--Gloom, shock and anger hung over Amman  Saturday as flags flew at half mast, many schoolchidren staged  sporadic protest marches and a two-hour closure to mourn the  victims of Friday's Hebron massacre.    Jordanians of all backgrounds showed their outrage by taking  to the streets in one of the most spontaneous public outbursts  of anger since the Gulf war. In Irbid, al-Salt, al-Baq'ah and  all over Amman, men, women and children took to the streets  waving black and green as well as Palestinian flags, shouting  Islamic slogans and calling for an end to "negotiations with the  enemy."    "No need to speak with those who murder us. Speak their  language, the language of jihad," said a speaker at the  al-Husayn Mosque during noon prayers Saturday.    Speaking to a crowd of some 2,500 people gathered in the  downtown square in front of the mosque after marching from  different districts of Amman, the speakers urged Muslims to  "return to your faith and become defenders of the faith in  Palestine as in Bosnia."    "The trio that betrayed you," (Israel Prime Minister  Yitzhaq)  Rabin, (U.S. President Bill) Clinton and (Palestine leader  Yasir) 'Arafat must not be allowed to pave the way of our  future," said one speaker from inside the mosque whose address  was broadcast through loudspeakers.    Police sealed off much of downtown and traffic came to a  halt  while the speakers addressed the crowd.    A heavy police presence was visible all over the city.  Embassies, foreign banks and many other international  organisations, fearing emotional reprisal owing to their foreign  affiliations, reported a security alert. The day passed without  incident, however.    Numerous Amman groceries, many of them owned by natives of  Hebron, closed for the entire day to mark the first day after  the killings.    All shops downtown were closed and black flags flew from the  shutters of many.    The crowd at the al-Hashimiyah Square in downtown continued  their march and converged at the Roman amphitheatre at around  1:30 p.m. and dispersed soon afterwards. The demonstrations  were organised by the Islamic Action Front and a group of  pan-Arab leftist parties.    Schoolchidren who were let out of school at 12:00 p.m. began  demonstrations in their local neighbourhoods. Students at the  University of Jordan also staged a protest.    Groups of 40 to 60 schoolchildren could be seen Saturday in  various parts of al=Shumaysani, downtown, Jabal al-Taj and  al-Jawfah, Garden Street and Bayadir Wadi al-Sir as well as the  al-Baq'ah and al-Wahdat camps raising the Palestinian flag and  shouting slogans to protest Friday's killings.    A group of some 60 students with green arm bands shouting  "there is no god but God," converged on the closed American  embassy in 'Abdun ini the morning hours but were turned back by  American embassy guards and police. It was the first reported  group of protestors to converge on the embassy, built two years  ago. The group left no statement and did not identify  themselves, according to embassy staff.    Jordanian papers ran eight column headlines of Friday's  killing with explicit pictures of the victims. Akhir Khabar, a  liberal Jordanian daily, ran one of the most stunning headlines  --"shalom"-- acroos its frontpage along with a blown-up picture  of a dead man with his mouth open and blood running out.    The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Saturday vowed to  step up the armed struggle against Israel and carry out revenge  attacks for Friday's killings.    "Yes to the revolution of the knives," Hamas spokesman  Muhammad Nazzal told a press conference.    The movement called on the Palestine Liberation Organisation  to immediately withdraw from the negotiations with Israel.    "We call on 'Arafat to withdraw and for the negotiators to  withdraw immediately," said one head of Hamas in Jordan, Ibrahim  Ghawshah. "The Palestinian people know who they are and where  they are," he said of negotiators living in the West Bank and  Amman. It is clear that the negotiation option is not the  option of the Palestinian people but a people-less leadership in  Tunis.    "It is a shame that 'Arafat is planning to go to Washington  with 30 people before the blood of the martyrs has even had the  chance to dry. It shows his disrepect for the suffering of his  people," Mr. Ghawshah added.    "Rabin is responsible for security and occupation. So this  is his domain," concluded Mr. Ghawshah. "But the blood of the  Palestinian people will be avenged."</p>

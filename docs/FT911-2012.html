			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Administrator expected for Adsteam AUSTRALIA'S troubled Adelaide Steamship group was teetering last night after its three main group companies abandoned a merger plan and confirmed that there was 'little or no value for shareholders'. The group's bankers are expected to go to the courts shortly to appoint an administrator to oversee a bank-imposed reconstruction of the debt-plagued group, which could take several years. Mr David Crawford of audit group KPMG Peat Marwick, who has chaired the bank committee negotiating with the group, is the likely appointment. Adsteam has been trying to persuade its 110 banks owed over ADollars 6bn (Dollars 4.6bn) for nearly five months to suspend interest and principal debt payments until the end of 1991, pending the reconstruction. All but one of the banks, a French bank owed about ADollars 7m by an associate company, retailer David Jones, had agreed to the debt moratorium. The banks face losses conservatively estimated at between ADollars 1bn and ADollars 2bn should Adsteam be forced into liquidation. Australia's banks are already under pressure following a spate of corporate collapses over the past 18 months. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the audit group, had been conducting a valuation of the group in preparation for the planned mergers, but this has been called off, too. The group and its advisers had planned to merge its holding company, Adsteam, with David Jones and the Tooth brewing group to bring together their respective 33 per cent shares in Industrial Equity, which controls the profitable retailer, Woolworth's. IEL has been subject to strict bank lending covenants since it was acquired by Adsteam in a ADollars 1.7bn takeover by the three companies in a joint venture in 1989. The loan agreements prevented any cash flowing from IEL to its parent companies. In separate announcements yesterday, Adsteam and David Jones said they planned to float or sell their operating businesses, the main asset being the upmarket David Jones retail chain. The fate of Woolworth's was not known last night, but its managing director, Mr Paul Simons, has been urging group banks and the boards of the three companies controlling IEL to refloat the retailer on the stock exchange. Adsteam's surprise statements yesterday came a month after the group companies revealed losses totalling ADollars 3.7bn for the six months to December 31, primarily due to write-downs in the values of complex group cross-holdings. At the time of the release of the interim results, the Adsteam board announced the 'termination' of Mr John Spalvins, managing director, who built the group into a feared corporate raider before falling foul of last year's steep rise in interest rates. Adsteam's last takeover was of Camford Engineering, the UK motor parts producer, which was completed just as Adsteam began to experience cash-flow difficulties.</p>

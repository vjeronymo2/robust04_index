			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Pacific island revises bid for Compass Airlines NAURU, the tiny but rich Pacific island nation, yesterday lodged a revised ADollars 55m (USDollars 42.3m) takeover bid for Australia's failed Compass Airlines, after the carrier's provisional liquidator rejected an earlier offer, Reuter reports from Sydney. Mr Kinza Clodumar, Nauru finance minister, met in Sydney with Nauru's joint venture partner, Austfin, a private merchant bank, before taking the offer to the airline's liquidator. Under the bid, the Nauru government would own 75 per cent of Compass and Austfin the rest. The ADollars 55m bid seeks mostly the popular budget-priced domestic carrier's good name. It will leave spare parts and other assets for Compass shareholders to dispose of in the liquidation process. 'We believe people will flock back to Compass,' said Mr Duke Minks, Austfin managing director. 'There are a lot of costs in setting up an airline and we estimate our offer is one-quarter of the cost of establishing a new airline.' Compass plunged into provisional liquidation in December, leaving 125,000 travellers with worthless tickets. It has since sought capital injections of between ADollars 30m and ADollars 60m. Last week the liquidators said they would sell Compass to Southern Cross Airlines, a carrier claiming strong financial backing but with no aircraft in the air. Nauru said its bid would give creditors 28 cents for every ADollars 1, compared with Southern Cross' offer of 9 cents per ADollars 1.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After OSHA adopted the ANSI pulpwood logging standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade associations with interests in the logging of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forest products, such as sawlogs and veneer bolts, joined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with ANSI to revise the pulpwood logging standard to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all logging operations within the United States. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded ANSI standard was approved May 19, 1977 (ANSI 03.1&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1978, Safety Requirements for Logging) (hereafter ``1978 ANSI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging standard'') (Ex. 2&hyph;14). That standard adopted most of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety practices contained in the earlier standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying them to all logging operations throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1978 ANSI logging standard, however, was withdrawn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by ANSI in 1984 because no final action was taken to revise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or reaffirm it. Since ANSI procedures require that action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be taken to reaffirm, revise, or withdraw a standard no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later than five years after the date of its publication, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1978 ANSI logging standard was withdrawn by default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently there is no national consensus standard covering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July 1976, the National Institute for Occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety and Health (NIOSH), published a criteria document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendations For An Occupational Standard For Logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From Felling To First Haul that was applicable to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging operations (Ex. 4&hyph;3). The NIOSH document addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazards and safe work practices involved in felling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bucking, limbing, yarding and loading operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIOSH criteria document differed from OSHA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulpwood logging standard in several ways:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The criteria document included all logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations such as those relating to sawlogs, veneer bolts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poles and pilings rather than being limited only to pulpwood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) It included training requirements for employees;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) It did not include provisions dealing with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment protective devices, personnel transport,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-highway truck transport, chipping operations, or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction and maintenance of roads, trails, and bridges;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) It recommended pre-placement and periodic medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final standard for logging operations, as did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA's proposed rule, adopts many of the recommendations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NIOSH criteria document, including expansion of coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all logging operations, emphasis on safe work practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and training, and elimination of provisions not unique to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging operations, such as that involving construction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roads and bridges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six states have promulgated standards covering logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations under the OSH Act State plan procedure set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. &sect;667) and in OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (29 CFR Part 1902), which requires State plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to adopt standards which are at least as effective as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those promulgated under section 6 of the OSH Act. 29 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1902.03(c). These States, Alaska (Ex. 2&hyph;17), California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 2&hyph;18), Hawaii (Ex. 2&hyph;19), Michigan (Ex. 2&hyph;20), Oregon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 2&hyph;21) and Washington (Ex. 2&hyph;22), have adopted standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provide more protection than OSHA's pulpwood logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard by covering all logging operations within their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. The standards of the five western states also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain a much higher level of detail and specification than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the 1978 ANSI logging standard or OSHA's pulpwood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging standard. OSHA used these standards as source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents during development of this final standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 2, 1989, OSHA published a notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking (NPRM) to amend OSHA's pulpwood logging standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29 CFR 1910.266, to include requirements for all logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations (54 FR 18798). Thereafter, on May 11, 1990, OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published a notice of hearing in which 10 issues were raised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for additional comment (55 FR 19745). There were 92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments submitted in response to the proposed rule and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Informal public hearings were held on July 24&hyph;25, 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Washington, D.C., and on August 21&hyph;23, 1990, in Portland,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OR, to allow interested persons who had objections to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule to have an opportunity to state those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objections. There were 23 companies, organizations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations and individuals who participated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Russian works attract little interest: Saleroom A SMALL and select group of Russian works of art was assembled by Christie's to auction in London yesterday. However, the market has been scared away from Russian antiques and the sale made just Pounds 201,355 with more than 40 per cent bought in. Pictures suffered particularly badly and important works - a study of a general by the leading Russian 19th-century artist Repin, and a decorative portrait, 'The lace maker', credited to the circle of the peasant artist Tropinin but perhaps in his own hand - went very cheaply, at Pounds 7,200 and Pounds 3,850 respectively. Top price was the Pounds 13,200 which was paid for a Georgian scene by the 20th-century artist Sudeikin. Works of art did better and a Revolutionary porcelain propaganda dish 'The bellringer. Long live the 8th Congress of the Soviets' almost doubled its estimate, selling at Pounds 13,200. Sotheby's had an easier time, disposing of jewels in New York and the collection of the late Thora Ronalds McElroy, daughter of a family of coal and railroad magnates, made almost Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.5m) with every one of the 56 lots finding a buyer. A 19th-century sapphire and diamond necklace, a family heirloom with 23 sapphires and 20 diamonds, sold for Dollars 2.47m (Pounds 1.4m). In London, Sotheby's offered Asian art. A Ghandara grey schist figure of Buddha, dated to around 200 AD and 31.5 in high, sold just below its estimate for Pounds 39,600 and a bronze 7th-century figure of the Bodhisattva Maitreya was on target at Pounds 35,200. Among the carpets an Agra carpet, a type made by prisoners in Indian jails in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sold well for Pounds 22,000, but the top price, also way above forecast, was the Pounds 68,200 which secured a French Savonnerie carpet. The auction of Scottish pictures at Sotheby's in Scotland was something of a disaster, being almost 43 per cent unsold. 'Playing in the surf' painted in 1895 by William McTaggart, did best, making Pounds 39,600, above its high estimate.</p>

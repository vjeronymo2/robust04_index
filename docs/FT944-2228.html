			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Deal over RAF cargo aircraft averts cabinet split The UK government yesterday averted a damaging split between two cabinet ministers with a compromise deal on new transport aircraft for the Royal Air Force. The Ministry of Defence ended months of speculation by announcing an order for 25 Hercules aircraft from Lockheed of the US. But in a victory for Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, the MoD also said Britain would rejoin the European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) programme, which the government left in 1989. The compromise deal, announced by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, resolved his apparent disagreement with the trade secretary over whether to buy from Europe or the US. Tory MPs had feared the dispute had similarities with the Westland affair, which led to Mr Heseltine's resignation from the cabinet in 1986. Mr Rifkind welcomed the purchase of the updated Hercules, in a contract worth Pounds 1bn. It would ensure the MoD met its operational requirements 'in the most cost-effective way'. But the new commitment to the European programme - which contains a tentative offer to buy up to 50 FLA - met Mr Heseltine's concern that British companies should be encouraged to play a role in the latter's design and development. British Aerospace, the aeronautical manufacturer, which has a contract to build the FLA's wings, had feared losing its leadership in wing technology to Germany had the UK failed to rejoin the European programme. Such a failure might also have compromised the company's position in the European Airbus programme, which provides the umbrella under which FLA is being developed. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said yesterday: 'This is extremely welcome news for British Aerospace, the UK aerospace industry and for jobs in this vital high-technology industry.' He said a share of the FLA programme equal to that of Britain's partners would be worth well over Pounds 5bn to the UK. Mr Rifkind also pointed out that British industry would benefit from the Hercules purchase under an offset deal that commits Lockheed to placing contracts worth Pounds 1bn with British companies. Mr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, condemned the deal as 'a half-baked compromise which clearly shows the extent of the government's division and indecision'.

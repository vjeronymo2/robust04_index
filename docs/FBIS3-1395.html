When journalists arrived on the scene at least three of the  wounded were being treated at the side of the road after the  dead had been removed by police. A tense situation developed  outside the building where members of the police's Internal  Stability Division and SA [South African] Defence Force cordoned  off the area. Initial reports said ANC guards shot dead at least  five Zulu marchers and wounded eight as they tried to attack the  ANC head office.    ANC Spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA there had been  "attempts  by armed men to enter the building". "There have also been  reports of people shooting at the ANC headquarters from  buildings across the road. Security guards at Shell House fired  warning shots in the air but were forced to open fire in self  defence," Mr Niehaus added.</p>

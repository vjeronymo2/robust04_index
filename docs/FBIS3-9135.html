Calling  it a "big violation", Major Simon MacDowell, spokesman for the  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the Canadians had found the  arms late Sunday [20 March] in the area where six 120 mm  howitzers had been found on March 4. He said: "They determined  that there are a considerable number of weapons there more than  the six." These included four tanks, three anti-aircraft guns,  one 405 mm howitzer and 18 mortars.    Although the weapons were on the outer edge of the exclusion  zone, near Cisluk 19 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of  Sarajevo, they were very near the Sarajevo-Visoko road, which is  supposed to be opened to civilian travel on Wednesday [23  March]. "At the local level, Canadians and the Serb commanders  are in contact," MacDowell said. "The local level has not  achieved any results in getting the weapons moved out or put  under UNPROFOR control."    The spokesman said the UN tried to arrange a high-level  meeting between Bosnian Serb leader radivan Karadzic and top  UNPROFOR officials at Serb headquarters in Pale later Monday to  resolve the situation. "The Serbs cannot withdraw straight back  out since they've backed up right to HVO (Croat) [Croatian  Defense Council] lines," MacDowell said. "We don't know where  the weapons came from. It's a big violation," he added, making  clear however that "these guns are not capable of engaging  Sarajevo. We have them now under observation." The spokesman  added: "But these weapons are where we say they shouldn't be.  The situation is not satisfactory from our position. Absolutely  not."</p>

According to statistics from  the provincial Border Trade Bureau, last year Yunnan registered  a total of 2.873 billion yuan in imports and exports through  border trade, an increase of 26.55 percent over the previous  year. Last year border trade departments focused their work on  adjusting the product mix. The imports and exports of bulk  commodities through border trade developed well. Of commodities  imported through border trade, 28 categories each exceeded 1  million yuan, while 16 categories of exported commodities each  exceeded 10 million yuan, including cigarettes, electrical  machinery, building materials, and textile products. The  quality of commodities imported and exported through border  trade improved as a result of cooperation between the relevant  management and supervisory departments on both sides.    In addition, eight border prefectures have scored marked  achievements in carrying out economic and technological  cooperation with Burma, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. By the end  of 1993 they had signed 46 contracts, worth a total of more than  $100 million. So far contracts worth almost $50 million have  been completed, 50 percent of the total amount of the province's  economic and technological cooperation with foreign countries.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Reflex back in black REFLEX GROUP, the Dublin-based computer services and software combine, returned to profit in the first half following two years of pre-tax losses. The group, which has been switching from computer leasing to provision of applications software and persuaded Mr Tony Kilduff to come in as chairman last year, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 316,000 (Pounds 293,000) in the six months to June 30. In the previous eight months to December 31 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of IPounds 4.53m, including IPounds 3.07m of provisions for discontinued operations, other exceptional costs and goodwill on discontinued operations previously written off to reserves. Turnover from continuing operations increased by 23 per cent to IPounds 4.28m against IPounds 3.45m when discontinued operations added another IPounds 2.13m. The group incurred a IPounds 1.45m operating loss including IPounds 470,000 on discontinued operations. Mr Kilduff attributed the turnround to continued tight control of costs and the withdrawal from the lossmaking hardware sales activity in the UK, coupled with a successful performance of the UK computer services businesses. Earnings per share were 2.01p in the first half, compared with a loss on continuing operations of 7.98p in the previous eight months and total losses of 26.85p.</p>

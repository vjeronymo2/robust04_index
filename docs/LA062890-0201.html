			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> LEAF BLOWERS LEAVE RESIDENT 'TRAPPED'  </P> <P> Ellen Margetich dreads Saturday mornings. She used to look forward to spending  the day gardening in her back yard or relaxing at the pool, but not anymore.  </P> <P> "Basically you are trapped in your home by leaf blowers," Margetich said in an  appearance before the City Council this week. "The fumes and noise are  unbearable."  </P> <P> Margetich, who lives on Culebra Street, told the council that a virtual army of  gardeners toting leaf blowers descends on her block about 9 a.m. and leaves  behind a trail of fumes, dust and noise. "My whole house fills up with dust and  fumes," she said.  </P> <P> To keep the effects of the blowers out of her back yard, Margetich asked the  council to follow in the footsteps of several other Orange County cities and  place some type of restrictions on the gardening equipment. "I have a right to  use my own yard," she said.  </P> <P> In response to her request, the council agreed to hold a public hearing next  month to gather information from other residents.  </P> <P> "They are loud and noisy," Councilman John Kanel said at this week's meeting.  Citing the controls other cities have placed on the blowers, Kanel sympathized  with Margetich. "I do think it is something to look at in order to give people  relief."  </P> <P> About 60 California cities -- including Newport Beach, Costa Mesa and Laguna  Beach -- have laws restricting hours that leaf blowers may be used.  </P> <P> In May, Irvine allocated $70,000 to hire an inspector to certify blowers used  by landscaping and gardening firms. Earlier this year, Irvine became the second  city in the nation to require that the machines meet acceptable decibel  standards and that mufflers and motors be in proper working order.  </P> <P> Although no action was taken, Cypress officials talked about both banning the  blowers and placing restrictions on them. Councilwoman Margaret M. Arnold  expressed concern about passing an ordinance, saying it could add to drought  problems. "People could start watering their sidewalks," she said.  </P> <P> The hearing has been scheduled for July 23.LINDA NATALI  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent in Brussels] </F>   [Text] Belgium today signalled its formal approval of the  European voting rights compromise--the only member state apart  from Britain which might have refused to accept the terms. There  had been fears that the pro-federal Belgians would consider the  deal on offer to Britain too favourable, but the current EU  [European Union] Greek presidency announced in Brussels that  assent had been received.    As the formal backing of the other member states was  awaited,  arrangement were going on for a formal enlargement ceremony in  Brussels tomorrow between the 12 existing governments and the  four newcomers--Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who has commuted between  Brussels and London for weeks battling to avoid giving ground on  voting rights, will not be returning to Brussels for the final  act: the Government will be represented by its ambassador to the  EU Sir John Kerr, the man responsible for overseeing the  Government's European policy. The ceremony will be carried out  amid relief, particularly in the four accession countries, that  enlargement is still on course for the start of next year.    But two more crucial hurdles remain. The European Parliament  must now endorse the accession terms in the first week of May if  the timetable is to be maintained. And finally, all four  applicant countries will be holding national referendums--and  the outcome of Norway's at least, is in serious doubt. A  majority of Norwegians are opposed to EU membership, and the  British-led row over voting has not improved the mood.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jun Kimura and Takashi Oguri] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Today's large-scale-integration (LSI) devices must possess  higher performance than ever before. As a result, the number of  transistors per chip and the chip surface areas are steadily  increasing. The larger chip surface areas require long lines  with large capacities, and lines to which numerous capacity  loads are connected. Since this kind of large capacity load must  be driven at high speed, high-speed, high-performance LSIs are  better off using bipolar transistors, with their powerful  current driving capabilities and large transconductance, rather  than metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors  (MOSFETs). Therefore, chips designed for high-speed and  high-performance are employing a bipolar complementary  metal-oxide semiconductor (BiCMOS) process that combines the  high integration levels and low power consumption of MOSFETs  with the high-speed operability of bipolar transistors  (hereafter abbreviated BJT).    Also, as LSIs are made to handle higher levels of  integration  and to operate at higher speeds, the power consumption per chip  continues to increase. To lower the power consumed by chips  while ensuring reliability in line with the shortening of MOSFET  gate lengths, all manufacturers are experimenting with processes  for reducing chip supply voltage. As these processes advance,  supply voltages will almost certainly drop from 3.3V to 2.5V,  and then down to 2.0V.    However, the operating speed of BiCMOS circuits rapidly  deteriorates as supply voltage is lowered, making it impossible  to maintain their superior speed capabilities vis-a-vis CMOS  circuits. As further advances are made in shortening MOSFET gate  lengths while reducing supply voltage, it is quite likely that  future BiCMOS circuits and the BiCMOS process will lose their  significance.    This report was put together on the premise that we are  entering the age of quarter micron MOSFET gate lengths and  supply voltages of less than 2V, and introduces a new BiCMOS  gate that employs circuitry schemes to reduce the degradation of  characteristics at low-voltage operation prevalent with  conventional BiCMOS gates, and which is expected to become a  basic element in high-speed LSI system  configurations.[.sup]1)[/]  <H5>  Operation of Conventional BiCMOS Circuits </H5>   Figure 1 provides a diagram of a BiCMOS circuit (in the  narrow sense of the technology) that has been used for some time  now, and Figure 2 shows a BiNMOS circuit.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-06B>      EQUATION </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-07A>      Figure 1. BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-07B>      Figure 2. BiNMOS Circuit </FIG>    The basic operation of a BiCMOS circuit consists of the CMOS  inverter receiving the input signal, that output is then input  to the base of the BJT, and then using the high current drive  capabilities of the BJT, the circuit charges/discharges at high  speed the load connected to the output. This operation is  illustrated in Figure 3.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-07C>      Figure 3. Basic Operation of a BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>    From Figure 3, the delay time (t[.sub]pd[/]) of  the BiCMOS circuit can be expressed using two formulas:    t[.sub]pd[/] = C[.sub]B[/] x  V[.sub]F[/]/I[.sub]D[/] +  C[.sub]L[/] x  V[.sub]CC[/]/2/I[.sub]C[/] (1)    I[.sub]D[/] = g[.sub]m[/] x  _D_V = g[.sub]m[/] x  V[.sub]sg[/] (2)    C[.sub]B[/] here is the sum of parasitic load  viewed from the BJT base terminal, V[.sub]F[/] is  BJT flatband voltage, I[.sub]D[/] is the MOSFET  drain current, C[.sub]L[/] is external load  capacity, V[.sub]CC[/] is supply voltage,  I[.sub]C[/] is the BJT collector current,  g[.sub]m[/] is the MOSFET mutual conductance,  _D_V is logic swing and V[.sub]sg[/] is  the MOSFET source-drain voltage. Part one of Formula (1)  expresses the internal delay time generated by driving the  BiCMOS circuit BJT, and part two of the formula expresses the  delay time involved in driving the external load. When external  load is small, internal delay time dominates, and the operating  speed of the BiCMOS circuit is slower than that of a CMOS  circuit. Conversely, when external load is large, part two of  Formula (1) becomes larger than part one and the impact of the  internal delay time portion of t[.sub]pd[/]  becomes nominal. Therefore, when external load capacity is  large, part two of Formula (1) dominates, and since the current  (I[.sub]C[/]) that charges/discharges external  load becomes h[.sub]FE[/] (- 100) times larger  than CMOS drain current (I[.sub]D[/]), the BiCMOS  circuit operates faster than a CMOS circuit. The load capacity  (crossover capacity) at this time is said to ordinarily be  around F/O-3, C[.sub]L[/]-0.3pF.  <H5>  Low Voltage Operation of BiCMOS Circuits </H5>   Reducing the supply voltage simultaneously decreases logic  swing. The reduction of logic swing (_D_V) brings  about a decrease of MOSFET source-drain voltage  (V[.sub]sg[/]). If we adhere to scaling rules, the  thinking is that shortening the gate length (L) will  increase g[.sub]m[/], enabling the reduction of  I[.sub]D[/] to be prevented. But in actuality, it  is thought that the existence of properties not affected by  scaling (such as source resistance (R[.sub]S[/]))  tend to saturate g[.sub]m[/] growth even if we  shorten L to the sub-quarter micron regime.  Therefore, as indicated in Formula (2), in future it is felt  that reducing supply voltage will depend on reducing drain  current (I[.sub]D[/]).    The reduction of I[.sub]D[/] will lead to a  drastic increase of part one of Formula (1) in BiCMOS circuits.  This will increase the internal delay of the BiCMOS gates, and  reducing supply voltage will make the extent of deterioration of  high-speed characteristics greater than that of CMOS circuits.  This will result in crossover capacity moving further toward the  high load side. This situation is illustrated in Figure 4.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-07D>      Figure 4. Relationship Between Delay Time and Crossover </FIG>    This is how the reduction of V[.sub]cc[/] in  BiCMOS circuits manifests itself in an extremely pronounced  increase of t[.sub]pd[/].    From the above it is clear how the internal delay time  peculiar to BiCMOS circuits increases as a result of the  reduction of V[.sub]cc[/], making it impossible  for the BiCMOS to maintain its superior high-speed operation  vis-a-vis CMOS circuits. As is clear from Formula (1), the only  thing that can be done to avoid this situation is to decrease  either C[.sub]B[/] or V[.sub]F[/].  V[.sub]F[/] is pretty much determined by the band  gap of the silicon material used to fabricate the BJT, and the  amount of this energy basically cannot be changed. It is also  possible to decrease C[.sub]EB[/] and reduce  C[.sub]B[/] by decreasing the size of the BJT  emitter, but this will simultaneously reduce the emitter current  value (I[.sub]E[/]) and/or the collector current  value (I[.sub]C[/]). As pointed out above, we  don't want a design that sacrifices the BJT's greatest merit,  its powerful drive current.  <H5>  New BiCMOS Circuit </H5> <H5>  1. V </H5>[.sub]F[/] Reduction Viewed from the  Current Level    Figure 5 illustrates the principle behind reducing BJT  V[.sub]F[/] at the current level in a  newly-proposed BiCMOS circuit. Circuit-wise, this approach  ensures that the BJT base potential (V[.sub]B[/])  doesn't drop below the ground level.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08A>      Figure 5. Principle Behind Reducing BJT V[.sub]F[/] in BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>    With this circuit, the BJT base node potential  (V[.sub]B[/]) shown in Figure 5 does not drop  below the nMOSFET threshold value (V[.sub]tn[/]).  At this time, the delay time of the BiCMOS circuit  (t[.sub]pd[/]) is expressed by the following  formula:    t[.sub]pd[/] = C[.sub]EB[/] x  (V[.sub]F[/]  -V[.sub]tn[/])/I[.sub]D[/] +  C[.sub]L[/] x  V[.sub]cc[/]/2/I[.sub]c[/] (3)    And V[.sub]F[/] is reduced to  V[.sub]a[/], which is expressed as follows:    V[.sub]a[/] = V[.sub]F[/]  -V[.sub]tn[/] (4)    Since in an ordinary process V[.sub]F[/] is  approximately 0.8V and V[.sub]tn[/] is  approximately 0.6V, V[.sub]a[/] works out to  approximately 0.2V. Taking this kind of configuration will  increase BJT OFF current (I[.sub]off[/]), and the  degree of increase can be readily estimated vis-a-vis ON current  (I[.sub]on[/]) using the formula:   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08B>      EQUATION </FIG>    This increase in OFF current is an extremely small 1/2200,  and can practically be ignored from the standpoint of high-speed  operation. As used here, q is amount of unit charge,  k is Boltzmann's constant,  V[.sub]EB[/](off) = 0.6V,  V[.sub]EB[/](on) = 0.8V and T = 300K.  Figure 6, 7 and 8 give examples of BiCMOS circuits designed  based on this principle. The circuits shown in Figures 6 and 7  operate at V[.sub]cc[/] -V[.sub]F[/]  at high level output, and at GND + V[.sub]F[/] at  low level output. With the circuit shown in Figure 8, output low  potential is lowered to ground level by operating the load  discharge side of the BJT until the saturation region.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08C>      EQUATION </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08D>      Figure 6. Example 1 of New BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-09A>      Figure 7. Example 2 of New BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-09B>      Figure 8. Example 3 of New BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>     The circuits shown in Figures 6 and 7 lower the amount of  charge needed for BJT ON and OFF, and even if the MOSFET  I[.sub]D[/] is reduced, BJT ON and OFF can be  operated at high speed. However, the minimum operating voltage  for these circuits is 2 V[.sub]F[/] +  _D_V, so that with V[.sub]F[/] is  approximately 0.8V, _D_V is approximately 0.8V (in  this report, we make logic swing the same value as ECL100K, or  0.8V), V[.sub]cc[/]min is approximately 2.4V.  Therefore, a BiCMOS circuit that uses BJT for load  charge-discharge, and operates the BJT in the active region has  a minimum operating voltage of 2.4V. Operating the load  discharge BJT of the circuit shown in Figure 8 until the  saturation region enables the minimum operating voltage of the  BiCMOS circuit to be reduced to V[.sub]F[/] +  _D_V is approximately 1.6V. We talk about the  operational problems encountered by operating the BJT until the  saturation region later in the report.  <H5>  2. V </H5>[.sub]F[/] Reduction Viewed from the  Voltage Level    Using only the mechanism discussed above, the most operating  speed can be improved at low voltage operation is 20-30%.  This  is caused by the fact that when an ordinary (enhancement-type)  nMOSFET is used to turn ON the load discharge BJT as shown in  Figure 9 (a), the BJT does not operate to the point where the  input signal potential reaches V[.sub]F[/] +  Vt (&gt;  0). When considering a supply  voltage of less than 2V, the input threshold value in this case  would simply be too large (V[.sub]F[/] +  V[.sub]t[/] is approximately 1.4V, at  V[.sub]t[/] is approximately 0. 6V). Therefore, we  put together a proposal advocating the use of a depletion-type  MOSFET to turn ON the load discharge BJT (See Figure 9 (b)). In  this case, the input threshold value for load discharge would be  V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]t[/] &lt;  V[.sub]F[/], making possible high-speed load  discharge.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-09C>      Figure 9. Operating Speed at Low-voltage Operation (The thick lines indicate the range of the voltage that the BJT </FIG>  <H5>  3. Proposal for a LV-BiFET </H5>   Figure 10 is a graphic illustration of a circuit that  incorporates the mechanisms discussed in the previous two  sections. This circuit is felt to be the simplest form of  achieving the mechanisms discussed in sections 1 and 2 above.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-10A>      Figure 10. LV-BiFET Circuit </FIG>    We have called the circuit indicated in Figure 10 a  low-voltage operational bipolar field-effect transistor or  LV-BiFET. This LV-BiFET is comprised of two npn-type BJT with  one pMOSFET each and a depletion-type nMOSFET (D-nMOSFET).  Although we use a D-nMOSFET, its source is connected to the base  of the BJT, and DC current does not run through the D-nMOSFET  part.  <H5>  LV-BiFET Operation </H5>   We will use Figure 11 to explain the operation of the  LV-BiFET. Q1, Q2 turn ON voltage is 0.8V, the pMOSFET (M1)  threshold value (V[.sub]tp[/]) equals 0.65V and  the D-nMOSFET (M2) threshold value (V[.sub]tn[/])  is -0.65V. As a result, the input threshold value of the BiFET  is GND (0V) + V[.sub]F[/] +  V[.sub]tn[/] + (substrate effect) or is  approximately 0.2V on the low level side, and  V[.sub]cc[/] -V[.sub]tp[/] or  V[.sub]cc[/] is approximately 0.65V on the high  level side. Low level output is GND +  V[.sub]offset[/] (V[.sub]offset[/]  is the Q2 emitter-collector offset voltage) or 0.05V, and high  level output is V[.sub]cc[/] -  V[.sub]F[/] or V[.sub]cc[/] is  approximately 0.8V.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-10B>      Figure 11. LV-BiFET Basic Operation </FIG>    Low level input (Figure 11 (a)) turns the pMOSFET (M1) ON,  turns the D-nMOSFET (M2) OFF, turns the output pull-up BJT (Q1)  ON and turns the output pull-down BJT (Q2) OFF, thereby  resulting in high level output (V[.sub]cc[/] -  V[.sub]F[/]). And high level input (Figure 11 (b))  turns M1 OFF, M2 ON, and as a result of M2 conducting the base  potential, this base potential becomes the same for both Q1 and  Q2. At this time, Q2 emitter potential is at GND level, and Q1  emitter potential is transiting from V[.sub]cc[/]  - V[.sub]F[/] to GND +  V[.sub]offset[/]. Thus, the voltage between the  emitter bases (V[.sub]EB[/]) is larger at Q2 than  at Q1, and output is low level (GND +  V[.sub]offset[/]).    Figure 12 illustrates an output holding operation. At  low-level input (Figure 12 (a)), M2 sub-threshold current  (I[.sub]leak[/]) is considerably smaller than M1  I[.sub]D[/], putting Q1 base potential at the  V[.sub]cc[/] level and maintaining output at high  level. When this happens, Q2 base potential is maintained at  V[.sub]F[/] - V[.sub]a[/]. As used  here, V[.sub]a[/] represents a minute voltage. At  high-level input (Figure 12 (b)), M1 turns OFF and M2 turns ON,  but because the high-level input is V[.sub]cc[/] -  V[.sub]F[/] and M1 V[.sub]tp[/] is  set at |V[.sub]tp[/]| &lt;  |V[.sub]F[/]|, M1 does not turn completely OFF,  resulting in a minute drain current  (minute-I[.sub]D[/]). The Q1 and Q2 bases are also  the same potential at this time. The relationship between this  minute I[.sub]D[/] and the amount of the Q2 base  current leak determines the low potential side of the DC base  potential of Q1 and Q2.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-11A>      Figure 12. LV-BiFET Output Holding Operation Principle </FIG>    At this point, we carried out simulations based on  Simulation  Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) parameters of a  0.55m BiCMOS process (All simulations discussed hereafter  use  the same parameters.). And calculation of load capacity and load  resistance, including source and drain capacity, conformed to a  4M BiCMOS SRAM design using this process.[.sup]2)[/] In this  situation, an internal node capacity (BJT base node capacity) of  F/O approximately 4 is too large, and external load capacity  pull-down ends before the internal node charge at output  pull-down decreases sufficiently (before the internal node  potential drops to V[.sub]F[/] -  V[.sub]a[/]), resulting in the generation of an  unnecessary through-current in the BJT. As shown in Figure 13,  we used an additional element (one BJT and one condensor) to  evaluate the characteristics of the broad-range F/O on the same  circuit.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-11B>      Figure 13. Characteristics Evaluation Circuit </FIG>    The BJT equipped with the additional element was for  extracting the internal node charge at higher speeds. This BJT  can be eliminated once the proper relationship has been  established between the internal node capacity and the output  load capacity. And the condensor (C) is for carrying out Q2 ON  and OFF operations in active pull-up and pull-down modes by  coupling with the input.    Figure 14 illustrates the voltage waveform when the LV-BiFET  supply voltage is 1.6V and F/O is 4, and Figure 15 shows the  current waveform. As can be seen from Figure 14, the low-level  potential of node-A is approximately 0.7V, and the low-level  potential of node-B is approximately 0.6V, and the effective BJT  turn-ON voltage (V[.sub]a[/]) is roughly 0.2V. And  as can be discerned from Figure 15, the DC through-current is so  small that it can practically be ignored.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-11C>      Figure 14. Voltage Waveform When Supply Voltage is 1.6V and F/O is 4 </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-12A>      Figure 15. Current Waveform When Supply Voltage is 1.6V </FIG>  <H5>  Comparison With Conventional Circuits </H5>   Next, let's compare the operating speed and power  consumption  of the LV-BiFET circuit with conventional circuits. The types of  conventional circuits targeted for comparison purposes were  CMOS, BiNMOS, BiCMOS and NTL circuits. Figure 16 indicates the  circuit constants of the circuits compared. For the sake of  convenience, we made these comparisons using a one input - one  output inverter. With the exception of the NTL circuit, the  input signals to all the other conventional circuits entered  through the MOS gates and input capacity  (C[.sub]in[/]) was made a uniform 0.1pF  (Naturally, the C on the input side of the BiFET also included  C[.sub]in[/].). Because input to the NTL circuit  entered through the base of the BJT, C[.sub]in[/]  was smaller than 0.1pF.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-12B>      Figure 16. Comparison of BiFET Circuit With Conventional Circuits </FIG>    Figure 17 shows the operating waveforms for all of the  circuits when supply voltage was 1.6V. The reason supply voltage  was set at 1.6V was to make the logic swing of the BiFET and  BiNMOS ECL100K convertible (_D_V = 0.8V), i. e.  (V[.sub]cc[/] = V[.sub]F[/] +  _D_V = 0.8V + 0.8V = 1.6V). With  V[.sub]cc[/] equal to 1.6V, the logic swing of the  LV-BiFET, CMOS and BiNMOS circuits was 0.8V, 1.6V and 0.8V,  respectively. Since the NTL circuit could not operate at 1.6V,  the diagram in Figure 17 shows a waveform for a supply voltage  of 1.9V and a logic swing of 0.4V. The figure does not show the  waveform for the BiCMOS circuit compared because the lowest  supply voltage that a BiCMOS circuit can operate at is 2.4V (2  V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]D[/] = 2 x 0.8V  + 0.8V = 2.4V).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13A>      Figure 17. Operating Waveforms For All Circuits Operated at 1.6V </FIG>    Figure 18 shows the supply voltage  (|V[.sub]cc[/]-GND|) dependence of delay time  when F/O is equal to 4. The operating speed of the LV-BiFET was  second only to that of the NTL circuit when supply voltage was  under 3V. The reason the NTL circuit operating speed improved as  supply voltage was reduced is because its logic swing decreased  together with the supply voltage as a result of calculating the  delay time by fixing the resistance value used in the circuit.  Just as with the CMOS, BiCMOS and BiNMOS circuits, the delay  time of the LV-BiFET increased in line with the reduction of  supply voltage, but this increase in delay time was smaller than  that recorded for the CMOS, BiCMOS and BiNMOS circuits due to  the effects of artificially lowering the BJT turn ON voltage.  Also, since the LV-BiFET was designed for optimum operation at  1.6V, it exhibited about the same delay time as the BiNMOS at  supply voltages of 3V or more, and the effect of lowering the  BJT turn ON voltage was not very pronounced. The LV-BiFET can  also be designed for high-speed operation by optimizing it to  operate at around 3V.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13B>      Figure 18. Supply Voltage Dependence of Delay Time at F/O = 4 </FIG>    Figure 19 graphically depicts power consumption as a  function  of supply voltage when F/O is 4 and operating frequency is  100MHz. The LV-BiFET exhibited the lowest power consumption of  all the circuits compared at supply voltages ranging between  1.6-3.5V. This can be accounted for by the fact that the  LV-BiFET's logic swing had a smaller V[.sub]F[/]  (= 0.8V) than the CMOS circuit, by the fact that the LV-BiFET  transistors operated at high speed at the output stage, and the  LV-BiFET employed BJT with greater drive capabilities for both  output pull-up and pull-down, and by the fact that the LV-BiFET  exhibited a smaller through-current at the output stage than the  BiNMOS circuit.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13C>      Figure 19. Power Consumption as a Function of Supply Voltage At F/O = 4 and 100MHz </FIG>    The LV-BiFET exhibited extremely superior operating  characteristics at 1.6V compared to those of both the CMOS and  BiNMOS circuits, recording 1.7-times the operating speed and  45% less power consumption than the CMOS circuit, and  1.7-times  the operating speed and 35% less power consumption than  the  BiNMOS circuit.    Figures 20 and 21 depict LV-BiFET delay time and power  consumption at 100MHz as a function of fanout when operating at  1.6V. The LV-BiFET exhibited extremely small dependence on  fanout due to the fact that it charges/discharges external  additional load using BJTs with large load drive capacities.  Also, as was already shown earlier, because the LV-BiFET reduces  the characteristic self-delay time of the BiCMOS (the time  expressed in part one of Formula (3)), its delay time crossover  point with the CMOS circuit is less than fanout 1, making it  faster than CMOS circuits at all fanouts ordinarily considered.  The delay time for the LV-BiFET came in second only to that for  the NTL circuit, and for the reasons stipulated in the previous  section on supply voltage dependence, the LV-BiFET exhibited the  lowest power consumption for all fanouts.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13D>      Figure 20. Delay Time as a Function of Fanout at 1.6V </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-14A>      Figure 21. Power Consumption as a Function of Fanout at 100MHz </FIG>    Figure 22 shows the relationship between power consumption  and delay time. At 1.6V of supply voltage, the LV-BiFET  exhibited a 70% smaller power-delay product than the CMOS  circuit, a 60% smaller power-delay product than the BiNMOS  circuit and a 55% smaller power-delay product than the NTL  circuit.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-14B>      Figure 22. Power Consumption-Delay Time Relationship (at F/O = 4, 100MHz) </FIG>    Table 1 lists up the characteristics of all the circuits  compared. The LV-BiFET used for simulation purposes exhibited  the smallest power-delay product of all the circuits compared,  recording at 1. 6V of operating power a 70%, 60%  and 55%  smaller power-delay product than the CMOS, BiNMOS and NTL  circuits, respectively. At present, the one drawback of the  LV-BiFET is its large surface area overhead resulting from its  use of two BJT. And as shown in Figure 13, when an additional  circuit is attached to the LV-BiFET, its surface area equals  that of a BiCMOS. However, the merits of being able to achieve  high-speed operation and low power consumption at the low supply  voltage of 1.6V are considerable.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Based on the  circuit depicted in Figure 16 (a), we used SPICE simulation  processing to predict changes in the pMOSFET and nMOSFET  V[.sub]t[/]. At 1.6V, when the respective  V[.sub]t[/] fluctuated between +0. 1V and -0.1V,  delay time only deteriorated around 3%, but power  consumption  increased a maximum of two-fold. This occurred when  |V[.sub]tp[/]| decreased. The increase in the  minute drain current of the pMOSFET shown in Figure 12 (b) was  caused by delaying the pull-up BJT Q1 turn OFF and created a  through-current between Q1 and Q2. Therefore, in order to make  the most of LV-BiFET characteristics, you must pay adequate  attention to the increase in the pMOSFET threshold voltage  (V[.sub]t[/]) (the decrease in the  |V[.sub]tp[/]|).    To operate the LV-BiFET at less than 2V, operate the output  pull-down BJT until it reaches the saturation region. In our  SPICE simulations, we employed a T[.sub]F[/] of  approximately 20ps and a T[.sub]R[/] of  approximately 2ns. There are considerable problems concerning  the time required to draw out the excess carriers in a base, but  with the LV-BiFET, even when we increased the  T[.sub]R[/] value to 10ns and carried out  simulation, there was very little impact on the operating  characteristics of the circuit. This is because the BJT used in  the LV-BiFET are only operated in the small base voltage range  (However, if the T[.sub]R[/] value is increased  more than a single digit, normal operation ceases to be  possible.). And since it will be possible in the age of LSIs  that operate on 2V or less supply voltage to design BJT with low  voltage resistance, designers will have much more freedom in  their design of bases and collectors. Thus, we feel it is easy  to design BJTs themselves so that they exhibit relatively low  T[.sub]R[/] values.    The drawbacks to LV-BiFETs are their large layout surface  areas, the fact that their pMOSFET threshold voltage  (V[.sub]t[/]) increases  (|V[.sub]tp[/]| decreases) and power consumption  increases. But as progress is made in scaling down MOSFETs,  LV-BiFETs should prove very useful from the standpoint that they  will furnish the same advantages as BiCMOS circuits even at  supply voltages of under 2V. Also, if a process can be developed  for integrating the MOSFET source-drain region and BJT base  regions, then it should be possible to eliminate the use of  additional circuits even when F/O is small. What is more, the  BJT we used in simulation processing this time were BiCMOS  process transistors based primarily on f[.sub]T[/]  is approximately 10GHz CMOS. However, if we utilize faster BJT,  we should be able to achieve LV-BiFET with even more superior  characteristics vis-a-vis CMOS and BiNMOS circuits.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   This report has served as an introduction of a new  high-speed  BiCMOS (LV-BiFET) circuit that operates at 1.6V and has a 0.8V  logic swing. The LV-BiFET is comprised of two npn bipolar  transistors, one pMOSFET and one depletion-type nMOSFET, and  achieves high-speed operation at low voltage by using circuitry  schemes to artificially reduce the turn ON voltage of the  bipolar transistors. The results of SPICE simulations made it  possible to estimate that with an F/O of 4, a supply voltage of  1.6V and an operating frequency of 100MHz, the LV-BiFET is  1.7-times faster and consumes 45% less power than a  conventional CMOS circuit, and is 1.7-times faster and consumes  35% less power than a BiNMOS circuit. The LV-BiFET is even  faster and consumes less power than a conventional CMOS circuit  when in a low load state of F/O = 1.    Although there are a number of drawbacks to LV-BiFET, such  as  their large layout surface area and the need to pay close  attention to circuit design, we believe that in the age of low,  2V or less supply voltage, the LV-BiFET points out one direction  for achieving high-speed, high-performance LSI (BiCMOS LSI).  <H5>  Acknowledgments </H5>   We would like to express our gratitude to Director Watanabe  and Assistant Director Okada of the NEC Microelectronics  Research Laboratories, and Director Takada of the System ULSI  Research Laboratories for providing us with the opportunity to  conduct the above-described research.

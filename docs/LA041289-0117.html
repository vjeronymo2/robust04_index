			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT ALLEGES COUNCIL ILLEGALLY SEATED COSGROVE  </P> <P> Alleging that Cameron Cosgrove obtained his seat on the Irvine City Council  illegally, two residents have filled suit seeking to unseat the councilman and  to have a special election held in November.  </P> <P> Howard Klein and Cristina Bustos-Thomas, the plaintiffs, allege that Cosgrove  violated a city measure when he was sworn in 9 months ago. They are supported  by Irvine Pride, a community action group.  </P> <P> In June, Irvine voters approved Measure D, which stated that if a council  member is elected mayor, the top unseated vote-getter for the council will  succeed to the vacant seat. The measure, however, also stated that if a  petition is filed by July 15 with the signatures of 7% of the voters, the city  must hold a special election to fill that seat.  </P> <P> Petitions were filed within the deadline and before Cosgrove was sworn in, but  the City Council said Measure D was not yet in effect.  </P> <P> Whether Measure D pertained to the June, 1988, election or just to subsequent  elections is the main question in the case, Klein said.  </P> <P> Another question, according to Cosgrove, is whether the petitions were legal,  because signatures were gathered before Measure D was certified by California's  secretary of state.  </P> <P> If the suit is decided in favor of Klein and Bustos-Thomas within the next few  months, a special election will be held in November.  </P> <P> Cosgrove said that if the suit succeeds, he will run in that election. He said  he already plans to run for reelection in June, 1990.  </P></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: HunterPrint shares dip 5p on warning SHARES IN HunterPrint fell 5p to 45p yesterday as the specialist printer warned that, although the results for the year to September 1993 would 'reflect a marked improvement over the previous year', the group was unlikely to climb back into the black. The announcement constituted an update of the trading position described in the interim statement. This followed the revelation last week that talks with a possible bidder had ended inconclusively, prompting a 17p tumble in the share price to 50p. At the interim stage HunterPrint said that market conditions were difficult. Now, the group has said that sales will fall below expectations - mostly because start dates on new contracts recently won have been postponed and because pagination and circulation on existing contracts have been at lower levels. As a result, the group said its revenues in the second half would be more reliant than previously expected on 'a spot market that remains depressed'. Also, the group has a number of surplus freehold properties and it is likely to provide, as it did in 1990, for 'the continuing obligations of these properties'. This could further depress the current year's results. In the six months to March 31, HunterPrint engineered a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.85m to profits of Pounds 330,000. In December HunterPrint pushed through its second refinancing in two years. This included a Pounds 20m placing and offer.</p>

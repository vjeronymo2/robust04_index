Superior Court Judge Michael Huff allowed Tanabe to remain free on $250,000  bail pending sentencing July 20.  </P> <P> Tanabe, a member of the Police Department's elite Metro Division, demanded to  be let into the girl's Hollywood home on Jan. 29, 1989, falsely claiming that  he wanted to investigate a scream he heard, prosecutors said. After he was  allowed in by the girl's parents, Tanabe went to the girl's bedroom, where he  fondled her while pretending to search her, prosecutors said.  </P></p>

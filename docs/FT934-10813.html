			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (1): Mercantile capital of the Gulf - Dubai's oil and business acumen have made it the second wealthiest state in the United Arab Emirates. However, as the economic climate becomes more complex, it is seeking new strategies to maintain its prosperity, as described in this survey written by Robin Allen TO all appearances, Dubai is continuing to re-inforce its position as the mercantile capital of the Gulf. Second richest of the seven states which form the United Arab Emirates, over the years Dubai has earned for itself the sobriquet Dubai Inc. by virtue of its business acumen and the shrewd instinct, not only of its former celebrated ruler, Sheikh Rashid, but also of the merchant community as a whole. It has also benefited - and continues to benefit - from a healthy surplus of capital from oil revenues, which has enabled the government, the ruling Al Maktoum family, to build the best infrastructure that money can buy. Under Sheikh Rashid, Dubai has also equipped itself with industrial facilities on a par with the best in the world, a tradition continued by his sons with the creation of a Free Zone Authority and industrial area at Jebel Ali and the establishment on a commercial basis of Dubai's own airline. The combination of capital wealth, personal commitment, and sheer hard work have helped to provide Dubai with a freedom to make its own decisions within the federation in its formative years, and have subsequently enabled it to keep going through two regional wars and the collapse of oil prices in the mid-eighties. These conditions, not least the availability of continuing reserves of capital, are changing, however. To compensate, the government is trying to enlarge and improve on developments that have already taken place. The government's Economic Department, set up in July 1992, but only really in operation since June this year, has the job of overseeing the management of some of the government's onshore industries, of representing Dubai at federal meetings where legislation is drafted, and, of most immediate importance to the business community and potential investors, of streamlining the trade licence registration process, a source of considerable ambiguity and frustration in recent years. In addition, the government has been spending a lot of money to improve the road network and other infrastructure; and its commerce and tourism promotion board is waging an effective campaign to attract more investors and tourists, the overall aim being to create an economy based on self-sustaining tourist and regional services industries, for an era when the cushion of wealth from oil revenues is no longer there. On the investment front, it is intended that the Economic Department should develop into a one-stop shop where it will be possible to establish a limited liability company. Many businessmen still complain, however, about the amount of time-consuming paperwork, and the cost - Arabic translations at Dh100 (Dollars 27) a page - when it comes to the enactment of a coherent legal code. Taken together, these measures should ensure that Dubai retains its prominence, if not its pre-eminence, as the mercantile capital of the Gulf. But there are several conditions to be fulfilled and a number of potential weaknesses which may make it more difficult to keep the strategy on course. These include: continued regional political stability; the Economic Department's ability to live up to the demands made on it; the progressive implementation of a coherent and effective business legal framework; the peaceful development of the federation and of Dubai's role within it, a guarantee of continuing abundant sources of energy at affordable prices. The successful resolution of the 1990-91 Gulf crisis removed doubts in investors' minds over whether the west would intervene in a crisis, and instilled a degree of confidence about the Gulf which had been previously lacking. Iran's occupation of, and claims on, three UAE islands near the strait of Hormuz, has not so far led to anything more than curt exchanges of diplomatic notes, and resolutions from foreign ministers of the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council. Iran's apparent decision to invest in expensive weaponry at a time when it is thought least able to afford it, and for motives which are not clear, has certainly caused concern - but so far nothing more. These problems are so sensitive that in Dubai senior officials refuse to discuss them. This is partly in deference to Abu Dhabi and the federation. Foreign affairs comes within the jurisdiction of the presidency, that is to say, Sheikh Zayed in Abu Dhabi, where it is reported there is a real fear of Iran trying to extend its physical control over other Arab Gulf islands. Dubai is thought to share this apprehension, but not to the same degree. The trading links between Dubai and Iran are historically very strong, and the relationship deeper and more subtle than that between Abu Dhabi and Iran. Other matters of foreign policy, including the US policy of 'dual containment' of Iraq and Iran, are not ones which Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid, the defence minister, is prepared to discuss. But it is known that as a result of the Gulf war, he is a leading proponent of a much greater depth of co-operation between member countries of the GCC, and continuing links with the US and the west. The UAE and particularly its president Sheikh Zayed, was one of the staunchest supporters of the US-led coalition. The outline peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation falls into the same category. Critics of the modern form of tribal leadership, of which there are a few in Dubai, contend that the system of government by word-of-mouth and by telephone, is inadequate for the administration of a modern state. There is no legislative assembly or consultative council within Dubai - where the majlis, or open session held by the sheikhs, acts as an alternative forum for discussion, and for petitions to be presented. To be present at one such majlis is to see tribal democracy in action at its most basic level. On the other hand even critics acknowledge that in a state as small as Dubai, there is enough delegation of authority to individuals and institutions for the state to function sufficiently well. By contrast with some of its neighbours, Dubai's public administration is smooth and efficient, and better than some European countries. Where tribal leadership falls short - and Dubai is only one small example in the whole of Arabia - is in its inability to decentralise authority, and to make the most of existing opportunities. Industries such as Dubal, a state-owned competitor on world markets; Dubai Drydocks, a successful and apparently profitable alternative to Singapore's ship-repair facilities; and Emirates Air, a fast-growing airline, are all in need of capital that public shareholders could provide, but have never even published a balance sheet. They should have been partly privatised long ago. The UAE as a whole does not yet have a formal stock exchange. Private capital, and not least that belonging to the ruling families themselves, could be harnessed to gel with Dubai's sizeable and hugely wealthy business community to create a state of shareholders. There is indeed scope for the for the UAE - which last year saw such an outflow of private capital that it ran a balance of payments deficit for the first time since federation - to work with the GCC countries as a whole, to create a GCC-wide capital markets. For day-to-day government, Dubai's ruling family is more than adequate. It is respected and the rulers have their their ear to the ground. There are no Islamic pressures of any significance, at least for the time being. And when it comes to relations with Abu Dhabi and the federal authorities, natural evolution suggests that Dubai's autonomy will continue to lessen by degree. The key long-term challenge for the leadership may be to instill in today's youth the drive and commitment that has characterised the emirate for the past 30 years. Several statements from anxious federal officials suggest that the next generation is not being sufficiently prepared for the day when the Dubai government will not be able to support so many subsidies, or create so many opportunities by a simple expenditure of capital.</p>

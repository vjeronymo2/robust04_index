			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Just the job for the future: UK employment is increasingly part-time, and based in the expanding service sector Three years ago, Barbara gave up her full-time teaching job and left London for the south coast where she now juggles three part-time jobs, one with a charity and two in further education. Harry lost his job as finance director of a medium-sized company when it was taken over 18 months ago and now has a semi-permanent consultancy job and a small business. Barbara and Harry represent the future of employment: part-time, service-sector and knowledge-based work. By the year 2000, 1.2m mainly full-time jobs in UK manufacturing and utilities are expected to go. Over the same period nearly 2m jobs in services will be created, but more than half of them will be part-time - a trend underlined by yesterday's announcement from the Burton Group that 1,000 full-time jobs were being converted into 3,000 part-time ones. Barbara and Harry may also represent the coming of age of the 'portfolio' job - two or three smaller jobs, or projects, which together make up the hours and pay of one 'normal' job. Until now the portfolio job has been the preserve of writers and artists at one end of the scale and the fate of low-income, working mothers at the other. But as white-collar and executive unemployment rises and companies continue to contract out all but their essential 'core' jobs, the portfolio is likely to become unavoidable for many and may even be chosen by a minority. 'The portfolio job is not going to become the norm, but it will become a growing necessity for people who cannot return to traditional employment and may even appeal to some people with sought-after skills,' says Professor Robert Lindley of the Institute for Employment Research. Currently about 1m people in the UK have more than one job. Even the majority, who continue in traditional full-time jobs will, if they are ambitious, have 'multiple careers', spanning an increasing number of employers. 'Until recently it was deemed essential to have at least three significant career changes in one's lifetime in order to secure jobs with good pay, quality training and promotion prospects. Now the threshold has risen to four, with every likelihood of a further increase in this decade,' says jobs consultant Professor Amin Rajan of the City University Business School. Where will the ambitious, and the less ambitious, find jobs in the next few years? The main source of new part-time jobs will be in the services required by a growing number of elderly people and the continued growth of the leisure industry, while most of the new full-time jobs will be in business services. The Institute of Employment Research has calculated that during the 1990s public services, primarily healthcare, will create 676,000 jobs; miscellaneous services, covering sports, theatres and personal services such as childcare will create 650,000; business services, including banking, law, accountancy, software and consultancy, will create 416,000 jobs; and hotels and catering 243,000. Some occupations, such as software experts, will grow even in sectors that are contracting, like manufacturing, and others will contract even in growing service sectors. According to the latest report of the Institute of Careers Guidance on jobs in the 1990s, about 65 per cent of the routine tasks performed in fast-growing professions such as accountancy, law, medicine, risk assessment and fund management could be automated. So in those sectors there will be growing demand for information technology experts, who will be installing and maintaining computer equipment, and fewer opportunities for secretaries or clerks, who risk being automated out of existence. In a breakdown of changes in occupational employment between 1990 and 2000 the institute expects three main groups to shrink and six to grow. The biggest drop, of 14 per cent, is expected in blue-collar, shop-floor jobs. The biggest rise, of 21 per cent, is found in professional occupations including scientists, health and education professionals, finance specialists, lawyers, tax experts and marketing specialists. But an 11 per cent rise is also predicted for personal and protective services including childcare, security, travel and catering. The overall conclusion is that white-collar, service jobs will continue to replace blue-collar, manufacturing jobs. But the new white-collar jobs will be split into two types. On the one hand will be the high value-added jobs in areas such as finance, law, medicine and technology, taken by 'knowledge workers' - defined as highly qualified individuals skilled at problem-solving and able to shoulder varied responsibilities. They are now one in three of the workforce, according to Prof Rajan, and by 2000 he expects them to account for two out of every five jobs. On the other hand are the low value-added, low-skilled jobs in services such as hotels, personal services and dry-cleaning. Overall, those low-skilled jobs will represent a declining proportion of an increasingly skilled workforce. But the growing number of older people will require an increase in both the high and low-skill service jobs - from surgeons to cleaners. Other trends, such as environmentalism, will stimulate demand for particular specialists, for example in waste management. But where jobs are created also depends on the relative success of different sectors and companies over the next few years. In the short-term Prof Rajan expects a net loss of 130,000 UK jobs as a result of the cost-cutting prompted by the European Community's single market, but believes that several industries will buck that trend: manufacturing - in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical plant, telecommunications equipment and brewing; and services - in air transport, data processing, banking, insurance, law, accountancy and management consultancy. In the very short term many sectors set for employment expansion are likely to see some recession-induced cuts. The Manpower Survey of Employment Prospects for the first quarter of 1993 found a net 36 per cent of banking employers expecting to cut staff, worse than any other sector apart from local government. In hotel and catering a net 32 per cent expected staff losses, in community services 20 per cent and in healthcare 9 per cent. Unemployment, which will soon touch 3m, should start to decline by the mid-1990s. By then the population of working age in the UK will have stopped growing but, owing to an increase in female participation from 65 per cent to 70 per cent, the number of people actually working, or seeking work, will continue rising slightly. The workforce of the future, therefore, will not only be more part-time, service-sector based, knowledge-driven and elderly, but also be more female, meaning a much faster drop in female unemployment compared with male. According to the institute, women will take almost all of the jobs created between now and 2000, although many will suffer 'downward occupational mobility' when they return to work after child-rearing. Women are also expected to break into higher-status full-time jobs in much larger numbers than now, further stimulating demand for childcare and other forms of personal service. In the legal profession women currently account for 50 per cent of new entrants and in accountancy the figure is 30 per cent. Almost all observers predict strong growth in self-employment (now about 15 per cent) and in the number of employees working in small and medium-sized companies. More dramatically, Sir John Harvey-Jones, former ICI boss and now company doctor, believes that nearly half of all factories in western Europe will close by 2000 as a result of competitive rationalisation in the wake of the EC's single market and freer world trade. If that is true, the model worker of the late 1990s will be a part-time, female insolvency lawyer.</p>

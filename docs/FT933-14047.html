			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Japanese slowdown fuels trade surplus JAPAN'S trade surplus for the first half of the year rose 17.6 per cent to Dollars 57.3bn (Pounds 38.7bn) from a year earlier, as the yen's appreciation pushed export prices higher and the domestic economic slowdown blunted import demand. There are signs the yen's rapid appreciation has begun to influence trade patterns. The volume of exports rose only 1.2 per cent in June, although the value of the trade surplus for the month rose 11.3 per cent compared with last year, to Dollars 9.97bn. The politically sensitive bilateral surplus with the US is still rising. For the first half, exports to the US were 10.6 per cent higher at Dollars 49.5bn, while imports rose 5.9 per cent to Dollars 27.9bn. Japanese motorcycle exports to the US increased 36 per cent, and semiconductor exports were 28 per cent higher, reflecting growth in demand from the US computer industry. Exports to the US in June rose 10.5 per cent to Dollars 8.4bn, while imports were 13.1 per cent higher at Dollars 5.0bn. During the first half, Japan's exports to the EC fell 8 per cent, while imports slipped 5.1 per cent. There was a 51.2 per cent increase in exports to China during the period; China is now Japan's second largest trading partner, surpassing South Korea and Taiwan. Exports during June rose 8.4 per cent to Dollars 28.1bn, while imports during the month were 7 per cent higher at Dollars 19.2bn. The seasonally adjusted surplus for the month was Dollars 8.69bn, down from Dollars 10.09bn in May. Electric machinery exports rose 14.5 per cent during June and ordinary machinery by 11.1 per cent. Imports of foodstuffs climbed by 9.2 per cent and those of materials by 12.6 per cent. Machinery imports rose 11.8 per cent. Japan's reliance on Asian markets is continuing to grow. Mr Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia, said the Asian share of Japan's exports rose from 22 per cent in 1985 to 40 per cent this year and is likely to be close to 45 per cent by 1995. Trade with South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore during the half totalled Dollars 51.6bn, while that with the EC was Dollars 44.3bn. Exports and imports to the UK were down 4.4 and 2.7 per cent respectively. Fluctuations in Japan's trade with most of its partners are dwarfed by those with an overheated China. Exports of cars to China rose six times during the half, television camera exports increased more than fourfold, steel exports doubled, as did those of communic-ations equipment, motor-cycles, and construction materials.</p>

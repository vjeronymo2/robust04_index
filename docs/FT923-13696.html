			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Belgian constitution talks fail BELGIAN constitutional reform talks involving seven government and opposition political parties broke up in failure yesterday, leaving a question mark over the future of the ruling centre-left coalition, Reuter reports from Brussels. The coalition set reform as a high priority when it was formed in March. Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said the government would now have to work out how to prepare the 1993 budget in the absence of a financial accord between the Flemish and French-speaking communities. Belgium should consider cutting back its generous unemployment benefits, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels.</p>

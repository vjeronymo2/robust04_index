			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OF:;  </P> <P> THE CHANGING FAMILY  </P> <P> Not only are families becoming smaller in the world's developed countries --  the traditional "nuclear family," with husband, wife and children forming the  typical household, is changing. Scandinavian countries are the pacesetters in  adopting non-traditional forms of households, especially with their relatively  high numbers of births outside of wedlock and cohabitation outside of legal  marriage. Japan is the most traditional. But the United States has the highest  incidence of divorce and single-parent households.  </P> <P> In the Face of Declining Birth Rates...Births to Unmarried Women on the Rise  </P> <P> Birth rates throughout the industrialized world have trended steadily downward.  But births to unmarried women are on the rise. In the U.S. and Britain, about  one-third of such births are to teen-agers, while in Sweden half are to women  aged 25-34.  </P> <P> Births to Unmarried Women as a Percent of all Live Births  </P> <P> Britain  </P> <P> 1960: 5.2  </P> <P> 1970: 8.0  </P> <P> 1980: 11.5  </P> <P> 1986: 21.0  </P> <P> Canada  </P> <P> 1960: 4.3  </P> <P> 1970: 9.6  </P> <P> 1980: 11.3  </P> <P> 1986: 16.9  </P> <P> France  </P> <P> 1960: 6.1  </P> <P> 1970: 6.8  </P> <P> 1980: 11.4  </P> <P> 1986: 21.9  </P> <P> Japan  </P> <P> 1960: 1.2  </P> <P> 1970: 0.9  </P> <P> 1980: 0.8  </P> <P> 1986: 1.0  </P> <P> Netherlands  </P> <P> 1960: 1.3  </P> <P> 1970: 2.1  </P> <P> 1980: 4.1  </P> <P> 1986: 8.8  </P> <P> Sweden  </P> <P> 1960: 11.3  </P> <P> 1970: 19.4  </P> <P> 1980: 39.7  </P> <P> 1986: 48.4  </P> <P> West Germany  </P> <P> 1960: 6.3  </P> <P> 1970: 5.5  </P> <P> 1980: 7.6  </P> <P> 1986: 9.6  </P> <P> United States  </P> <P> 1960: 5.3  </P> <P> 1970: 10.7  </P> <P> 1980: 18.4  </P> <P> 1986: 23.4  </P> <P> In the Face of Fewer Marriages, More Divorces  </P> <P> The U.S. traditionally has one of the highest marriage -- and divorce -- rates  in the world. Now liberalized divorce laws are bringing a divorce boom in much  of Europe.  </P> <P> Divorce Rates per 1,000 Married Women  </P> <P> Britain  </P> <P> 1960: 2.0  </P> <P> 1970: 4.7  </P> <P> 1980: 12.0  </P> <P> 1986: 12.9  </P> <P> Canada  </P> <P> 1960: 1.8  </P> <P> 1970: 6.3  </P> <P> 1980: 10.9  </P> <P> 1986: 12.9  </P> <P> France  </P> <P> 1960: 2.9  </P> <P> 1970: 3.3  </P> <P> 1980: 6.3  </P> <P> 1986: 8.5  </P> <P> Japan  </P> <P> 1960: 3.6  </P> <P> 1970: 3.9  </P> <P> 1980: 4.5  </P> <P> 1986: 5.4  </P> <P> Netherlands  </P> <P> 1960: 2.2  </P> <P> 1970: 3.3  </P> <P> 1980: 7.5  </P> <P> 1986: 8.7  </P> <P> Sweden  </P> <P> 1960: 5.0  </P> <P> 1970: 6.8  </P> <P> 1980: 11.4  </P> <P> 1986: 11.7  </P> <P> West Germany  </P> <P> 1960: 3.6  </P> <P> 1970: 5.1  </P> <P> 1980: 6.1  </P> <P> 1986: 8.3  </P> <P> United States  </P> <P> 1960: 9.2  </P> <P> 1970: 14.9  </P> <P> 1980: 22.6  </P> <P> 1986: 21.2  </P> <P> What Makes a Household? The Rules are Changing  </P> <P> Households consisting of a married couple, with or without children, still  predominate. But their share of the total is in steady decline everywhere  except Japan.  </P> <P> * The one-person household has become the fastest growing household type except  in Japan, where nearly two-thirds of the elderly still live with their  children.  </P> <P> * Unmarried couples living together as a percentage of all couples living  together grew in the United States from 1.2% in 1970 to nearly 5% by 1988.  </P> <P> * So-called "consensual unions" of unmarried couples are higher in Canada and  most of Europe than in the U.S., and in Sweden and Denmark they represent about  20% of all cohabiting couples  </P> <P> * Sweden has the oldest population among 10 industrialized nations studied,  with 17.7% aged 65 years and over; the United States has the youngest  population, with 21.8% under age 14.  </P> <P> SOURCE: MONTHLY LABOR REVIEW, U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS  </P></p>

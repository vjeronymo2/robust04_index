			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 23 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese diplomat said  here today that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's  coming visit to China, like other visits paid by leaders of the  two countries, will further promote the development of bilateral  economic and trade ties.    Economic and trade cooperation between China and Russia has  its geographical superiority and is economically complementary,  Hu Chusheng, minister-level economic and commercial counsellor  at the Chinese Embassy in Russia, told XINHUA and ITAR-TASS  reporters on the eve of Chernomyrdin's trip to Beijing.    Sino-Russian trade, developed on the basis of Sino-Soviet  trade, is growing rapidly with a great potential, Hu said.    According to the counsellor, the volume of Sino-Russian  trade  was 7.68 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, compared with 5.6 billion  dollars in 1992.    The Sino-Soviet trade turnover in 1991 was only 3.8 billion  dollars.    Hu attributed the thriving bilateral trade to the  stimulative  policies adopted by the two governments, especially to the  preferences granted to each other regarding trade.    On the geographical superiority, the counsellor said that  there is little difference between the CIF [cost, insurance, and  freight] and FOB [free on board] prices because the two  countries are so close to each other.    As a result, an average of 30 dollars is saved for one ton  of  freight, he said.    On the complementary nature of Sino-Russian trade, Hu said  Russia's heavy industrial products such as automobiles and  planes are welcomed in China while Chinese light industrial  goods sell well in Russia.    The counsellor was optimistic over the future development of  bilateral trade, saying that he agreed to the prediction made by  Russian businessmen that the annual volume of trade between  China and Russia will surpass 10 billion dollars.    It is very hard to achieve the goal this year as the volume  of delivery dropped by more than 50 percent in the first two  months this year over the same period last year, he stressed.    Hu attributed the fall to the delay in signing some inter-  governmental trade protocols, higher import taxes imposed by  Russia and its new arrangement in granting visas.    He believed that all these issues can be resolved through  consultations.    He expressed the hope that Chinese and Russian businessmen  will deepen their mutual understanding and trust as bilateral  economic and trade cooperation grows.</p>

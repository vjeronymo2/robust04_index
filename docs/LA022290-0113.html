			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMMONS TO OFFER HIS OWN SLATE FOR LOCKHEED'S BOARD  </P> <P> Harold C. Simmons, the Texas financier who has been challenging the management  of Lockheed Corp., disclosed plans Wednesday to nominate his own slate of  candidates for the aerospace firm's board of directors.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simmons said he will  submit a rival slate of candidates at Lockheed's annual shareholder meeting  March 29. Simmons, who controls about 18.9% of Lockheed, said he will ask  Lockheed shareholders to reject the 15-member slate endorsed by Lockheed  management in favor of a rival group that he plans to name. To comply with  Lockheed's corporate bylaws, Simmons must identify his candidates by Monday.  </P> <P> Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed had no comment on Simmons' filing, said Ron  Meder, a company spokesman. However, Meder said Lockheed recently prepared for  such a board challenge by retaining Kekst &amp; Co., a New York-based  communications consultant. "In the event there is proxy contest at the meeting,  (Kekst &amp; Co.'s) expertise would be beneficial to us," Meder said.  </P> <P> Lockheed stock closed Thursday at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.25.  </P> <P> The Simmons announcement is the latest in a series of maneuvers and  confrontations involving Lockheed and Simmons, chairman of the Dallas-based  Valhi Inc., a holding company with subsidiaries involved in the production of  chemicals, petroleum and forest products. At stake is control of the nation's  eighth largest defense contractor.  </P> <P> The dispute erupted shortly after a Jan. 31 meeting between Simmons and  Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep. Simmons demanded six seats on Lockheed's  board, which consists of 15 directors, and asked the company's management to  eliminate a "poison pill" takeover defense that was erected after Simmons began  buying shares last year. Tellep refused to promise Simmons the seats and  rejected proposals for eliminating the anti-takeover measures.  </P> <P> Three days later, Simmons said he might seek control of Lockheed's board of  directors by mounting a challenge at the company's annual meeting. Lockheed  responded last week, surprising much of the financial world by scheduling the  annual meeting for March 29. In recent years, Lockheed has held its annual  meeting in May.  </P> <P> The scheduling forced Simmons' hand because Lockheed shareholders are required  to make any board nominations within 10 days of the public announcement of a  meeting date.  </P> <P> Instead of methodically planning a board slate and a strategy for winning  shareholder support in May, Simmons will now have to scramble to prepare for a  March meeting, industry analysts said.  </P> <P> "Lockheed moved up the date to force Simmons to act immediately," said Howard  Mager, an analyst at New York-based Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "They  forced him (Simmons) to move."  </P> <P> However, Michael Snetzer, president of Simmons-controlled Valhi, said Simmons  would select a board slate within the required time. A subsidiary of Valhi  holds the 18.9% stake, the largest single block of Lockheed shares. Snetzer  said Simmons decided to field a slate because he could not get a voice on the  Lockheed board.  </P> <P> "We own almost 20% of the stock in (Lockheed) and we think its appropriate to  have representation," he said. "We're unhappy with the fact that we've been  denied representation."  </P> <P> Lockheed spokesman Meder repeated a statement that Lockheed Chairman Tellep  made Feb. 2 after Simmons indicated that he might launch a proxy fight for  shareholders' votes to oust board members.  </P> <P> Tellep's statement said in part that Simmons offered no plans or proposals for  Lockheed and "provided no basis whatsoever for us to determine his intentions  with respect to the company or whether his interests would be consistent with  those of Lockheed and its other shareholders."  </P> <P> In recent months, Simmons steadily has increased his holdings in Lockheed,  developer of the Stealth fighter plane, from 6.25% last fall to 18.9% two weeks  ago.  </P> <P> Lockheed produces some of the nation's most advanced weapons systems. However,  like all arms makers, it is trying to deal with declining sales and tougher  contracting terms imposed by the Pentagon. Some analysts say investors will be  searching for a new vision for financial growth from Simmons and Lockheed  executives in the wake of declining East-West tensions and the prospect of  smaller defense budgets.  </P> <P> "I want to hear what Simmons has to say," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at C.  J. Lawrence. "If he wants credibility, he will have to come to the street and  preach his gospel. It's incumbent on both sides to articulate strategy and a  fallback strategy as to how Lockheed can become a better company over the next  two to five years."  </P></p>

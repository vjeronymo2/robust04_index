			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (9): A different drought threatens - Farmers don't shout back like they used to, Philip Gawith is told THE residents of Pretoria, South Africa's capital city, woke one morning this January to find their city paralysed. An estimated 5,000 white farmers had brought the city to a standstill by parking an assortment of agricultural vehicles in city centre intersections. The farmers were protesting their financial plight and the alleged uncaring attitude of the government. Mr Kraai van Niekerk, minister of agriculture, says the protest illustrates the powerlessness farmers feel about their future. On top of the perennial climatic variable, particularly hostile in recent years, farmers are having to deal with enormous political and economic changes, none of which they feel they have any control over. For a conservative community, this adds up to a most unsettling package. As Mr van Niekerk noted: 'Farming in South Africa finds itself in the midst of a profound crisis that has all the elements of personal tragedy, community disruption and an uncertainty common to the state of mind which prevailed during the Great Depression (during the Thirties).' The chief concern of South Africa's roughly 65,000 farmers is financial. Most of the 80s were drought years, and the past summer saw rains falling so late in some areas that many farmers were left without crops. The farmers have aggravated this adversity with some rank financial folly of their own. The industry, which contributed R10.8bn (4.6 per cent) to gross domestic product in 1990, 8 per cent down on 1989, has debts of R16bn. The debt ratio (debt in relation to assets) deteriorated from 12.8 per cent in 1979 to 27.9 per cent in 1985. It has since improved to 23.2 per cent in 1990 as growth in the value of farm assets has outstripped growth of the debt burden. Nevertheless, with real interest rates of above 5 per cent for more than two years now, anybody with large borrowings has been hurt. Coupled with this, the farmers' terms of trade (ratio of producer prices to farm input prices) continue to deteriorate - from 0.87 to 0.82 during 1990. Field crops and animal husbandry went backwards, but horticultural terms of trade improved. The price of farming requisites rose by about 12 per cent, while producer prices of agricultural products rose by 5.4 per cent. Consumer food prices increased by 16 per cent. On top of economic hardship comes political insecurity. The government's decision to abolish the Land Acts, which prevented blacks from owning land in roughly 87 per cent of the country, has unleashed fears in the white farming community that they face redistribution of farmland to landless blacks. These fears have been manipulated by the Conservative Party (CP). CP criticism of government, however, falls on fallow ground. For reasons both political (most of the farmers now support the Conservative Party) and economic (the state is seeking to lessen its role in the economy), agriculture is no longer the recipient of generous state largesse. Spending on agriculture in the current budget, R253.7m, forms only 0.3 per cent of state spending compared to 3.7 per cent as recently as 1987/8. And whereas R583.4m was spent on subsidies and rebates granted in 1988, this figure was down to R198m last year. Farmers, understandably, are unhappy. They were outraged recently when Mr van Niekerk had the temerity to suggest that as much as R5bn of their debt was non-agricultural - cars, holiday homes, townhouses and playing the horses were mentioned. Part of their debt was also the product of bad decisions - cultivating marginal land, paying too much for land, financing long-term projects with short-term capital, and so on. Such straight talking from an agricultural minister is unprecedented, a clear symptom of the changing times. Mr van Niekerk believes one way of improving the financial position of farmers is via a more market-oriented approach to agriculture. This process is already well under way with reductions in State aid and producer subsidies, removal of import controls and deregulation of the excessive state role in areas like marketing, pricing and hygiene. The days of merely producing, without worrying about signals from the market is over. Another big issue, which the government claims to be attending to on an ongoing basis, is the role played by the country's 22 agricultural control boards, which regulate the marketing of about 80 per cent of the country's agricultural products. Although many farmers, especially weaker ones, favour the boards, the trend is towards diluting their influence. Some query whether they should exist at all. Mr Frans Venter, agricultural adviser to First National Bank comments: 'Not one of the boards is really adding value to the product.' The other way to improve farmers' positions, says Mr van Niekerk, is by increasing the purchasing power of the consumer. A combination of low growth and a high population growth rate has seen per capita incomes in the country recede. The key here lies in the extent to which the government can assist in getting economic growth started again. Is the government succeeding in getting the message that the short term offers no solution, and that the farmers' salvation lies in structural readjustment, both within agriculture and the wider economy? Mr van Niekerk thinks so. 'They don't shout back as hard as they used to,' he says.</p>

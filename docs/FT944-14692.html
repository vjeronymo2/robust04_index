			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Stet sale reopens advisers debate The Italian government is in the final stages of choosing advisers and global co-ordinators for the long-awaited privatisation of Stet, the state-controlled telecommunications holding company. The importance of the decision - this will be one of the biggest Italian sell-offs - has reignited a simmering debate about the dominance of non-Italian investment banks, which have picked up most of the advisory work since the Italian privatisation programme got under way last year. IRI, the state holding company which owns 65 per cent of Stet, has sent its recommendations on advisers to the Italian Treasury's special privatisation committee, which is completing its analysis of the report. A final decision will be made, probably before the end of this month, by the Treasury, budget and industry ministers. The Italian press has identified Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, as the front runner to lead the sale. Morgan Stanley, which has declined to comment on the rumour, was Stet's choice when the previous Italian government was looking for advisers last year. It is not yet clear whether the bank wants to be financial adviser on the sale or global co-ordinator, which involves taking greater financial responsibility for the success of the offer in Italy and abroad. On Wednesday, one of the ministers responsible for the offer - Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, who holds the budget dossier - said he hoped Italian merchant banks would be given part of the mandate for the Stet sale, which should take place in the first half of next year. 'We have to give more visibility to small Italian merchant banks, and there are many of them,' he added. 'We need to encourage the growth of 10 or more Mediobancas.' Mediobanca, which specialises in long-term corporate lending, has been the dominant, indeed almost the only force in Italian merchant banking since the war, a position it has built up by cultivating close links with Italy's largest companies, such as Fiat and Pirelli. But Mediobanca has been awarded only one mandate: it will act as joint global co-ordinator with Merrill Lynch, for the forthcoming privatisation of Enel, the state-owned electricity company. IRI and the last Italian government, headed by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, avoided giving Mediobanca the mandate for any of the other state sales, in particular because of fears that it would be unhealthy if Mediobanca increased its influence over Credito Italiano, IMI, and Banca Commerciale Italiana, the state-controlled banks. By contrast, IMI, the nearest Italy has to a rival home-grown merchant bank, has acted as joint global co-ordinator on two issues - its own privatisation in January, and that of Ina, the state-owned insurer. Certain members of the six-month-old centre-right government have given this debate a dubious political tone by implying that it is unpatriotic to select mainly big foreign banks for high-prestige privatisation work. The difficulty is that few other Italian banks rival Mediobanca or the international investment banks for competence, capital backing and sheer political clout. However, smaller Italian investment houses say there is room to give them certain mandates. For example, although there are normally two global co-ordinators for a big issue - one foreign and one Italian - foreign banks have been given the roles of valuer and financial adviser in all the big public privatisation offers so far. Mr Alberto Albertini, managing director of the Milan-based investment house of the same name, said yesterday: 'For the valuation part it isn't size that counts but professionalism.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ITALY'S PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company             Date      Global co-ordinators  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Credito Italiano    Dec 93    Credito Italiano &amp; Goldman Sachs IMI                 Jan 94    IMI &amp; SG Warburg Banca Comm.

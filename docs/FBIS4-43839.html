			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Businessmen Want Finland To Join </F> Union"]    [Text] [no place-name as published] HS-STT -- The Finnish  Businessmen's Association (SYKL) feels that it is absolutely  necessary for Finland to join the European Union [EU]. The SYKL  executive committee justifies its stand on the grounds that  without membership Finland will not have enough opportunities to  participate in making decisions involving common European  markets.    In the SYKL's opinion, Finnish firms will only be able to  acquire equal competitive status with EU country firms through  membership. The SYKL believes that membership in the EU would  also create stability and have a positive effect on Finland's  image and the country's image on world markets.    "The advantages for business activities produced by  membership will clearly be greater than the disadvantages.  Staying out of the EU would substantially weaken Finland's  chances of safely developing its national economy in step with  the national economies of the EU countries," they say in the  position paper approved on Tuesday [7 June].    The SYKL also published the results of a poll of member  company managers' views on the EU. According to the poll, 87  percent of the SYKL's regional and business sector organization  and local association chairmen are in favor of Finland's joining  the EU. Five hundred chairmen were asked the question: "Should  Finland join or not join the EU on the basis of the results of  the negotiations between Finland and the EU?" Thirteen percent  of the respondents took a negative view of membership.    Those chairmen who took a positive view of joining argued  mainly that membership would secure Finland's position in  western Europe and promote internationalization.</p>

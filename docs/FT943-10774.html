			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Observer: Off colour The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has finally got its act together with new regulations designed to tighten up on valuations. The new guidelines are a merger of the existing two guides, the so-called 'Red Book' and the 'White Book'. But one vital question remains unanswered - what's to be the colour of the new rule book? The smart money is on the final version turning red, although some are suggesting it may turn purple, the institution's own colour. Officials have ruled out the logical combination of the two colours into pink. Instead, yesterday's draft was printed in partly red and partly white  -typical fence-sitting behaviour.</p>

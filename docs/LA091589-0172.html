			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENATE TRIMS BUSH MILITARY BUDGET  </P> <P> The Senate today overwhelmingly approved a $7.7-billion fiscal 1990 spending  bill that makes wholesale cuts in President Bush's budget request for military  construction in the Philippines and South Korea.  </P> <P> By a vote of 93 to 1 that came after less than an hour of debate, the Senate  adopted a spending bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that is $1.3  billion less than this year's level and about $300 million less than Bush's  proposal.  </P> <P> Specifically, the legislation eliminates the $40.8 million Bush requested for  the Philippines and cuts $85.5 million from the $86.3 million for South Korea.  </P> <P> "The best way to make our defense dollar go further is to secure a more  equitable burden sharing from our allies," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.),  chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction.  </P></p>

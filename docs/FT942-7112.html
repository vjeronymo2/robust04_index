			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Universal Ceramic to float valued at Pounds 20m A small ceramic materials company is hoping to defy the market's recent aversion to new issues with a flotation this summer expected to value the group at up to Pounds 20m. Universal Ceramic Materials is aiming to come to the market through a placing which is likely to raise about Pounds 10m. Mr Bill Hughes, chief executive, was confident the float would succeed. 'We are a small company and have never made a loss,' he said. Also the amount of cash we are looking for is relatively small.' UCM intends to use the proceeds to invest in equipment and increase capacity. The company has changed hands four times since 1980. In 1993 Mr Hughes led a Pounds 10.6m management buy-out. Profits for 1993 rose 40 per cent to Pounds 1.7m on sales of about Pounds 26m. Mr Hughes said he expected profits to improve further in 1994. UCM, which manufactures products used in refractories and heating elements, operates in several mature markets in the UK, US and continental Europe.</p>

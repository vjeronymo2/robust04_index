			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Rate-cut boost for house sales THE revival in house sales is continuing with the help of low interest rates and low house prices, estate agents and builders said yesterday. A survey of more than 100 English and Welsh estate agents published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported that the improvement in sales seen over Christmas and the new year had been sustained. It said that the revival had spread to even previously worst affected markets such as the east Midlands, East Anglia and south-east England. The survey warned, however, that it was too early to talk of a long-lasting recovery while potential house buyers continued to worry about the possibility of losing their jobs. Some 65 per cent of estate agents said that prices had remained static during the three months to the end of January, while one third said that prices were still falling. Wimpey, Britain's second largest housebuilder, said yesterday that last weekend was the best for sales for several years. Agreed sales were running at more than a fifth higher than during the corresponding period last year. Housebuilder Bellway said that agreed sales had risen by 50 per cent since the new year compared with 12 months earlier. More consumers are repaying credit, indicating that they may have more disposable income, according to a report by Infolink, a consultancy which supplies information about consumer loans. It says that in the final quarter of last year 91.2 per cent of consumers with credit accounts were up to date with their repayment installments. That compared with 89.6 per cent in the equivalent period in 1991. Bellway Pounds 33m cash call, Page 23; Lex, Page 22. Wimpey building plots' switch, Page 25</p>

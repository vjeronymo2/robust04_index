			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Management: Priestess of the black art - Ellen Hancock, the most senior female executive at IBM Do not be lulled by the open, pleasant manner and quiet tone of voice. Nobody reaches the upper echelons of management within International Business Machines without both talent and determination and Ellen Hancock, IBM's most senior woman executive seems to have both. She listens to questions with intense concentration and replies with short bursts of information, reminiscent of the data communications systems in which she is an expert. She has a technician's attention to detail. She laughs easily but without frivolity; her staff have a healthy respect for the acid side of her tongue: 'A confrontation with Ellen on a bad day is like running into a bandsaw', a former colleague winced. Hancock, still on the right side of 50, is now a corporate vice-president and general manager of IBM's networking systems division, an area which remains a black art to outsiders - even to those in the computer business. But it is a position that puts her, theoretically at least, within reach of the top job in the corporation. That makes her one of most senior women in world business, perhaps the most senior. How much higher can she go? These days, the question is given added pique by the commercial pressures with which IBM is struggling. All IBM's top managers have been warned by chairman John Akers that their progress depends on the performance of their divisions. Hancock's progress through IBM's multi-layered, overweight bureaucracy of the 1970s and 1980s was swift by any measure. She has both technical ability  -unusual among IBM's top executives, most of whom are promoted from the sales side - coupled with sound managerial ability. She has had powerful sponsors throughout her career, including Jack Kuehler, IBM president and the company's most senior technical specialist. Michael Killen, author of a controversial book on IBM's software strategy concludes that Hancock is 'no paper-pushing, know-nothing administrator. On the contrary, she is a technical giant in what is still a highly technical, male world. Whether she can reach the pinnacle of management achievement at IBM, chairmanship of the Dollars 69bn (Pounds 38.5bn) revenues, 350,000 people company, depends on a complex set of factors which go beyond compecommon to success in most companies, but also age. IBM's top brass retires by convention at 60; potential chairmen have to be in pole position by their early 50s. Is it a pinnacle to which, in any case, she aspires? 'That is a job I have an ambition to do. Whether or not that is a reasonable ambition is a different discussion,' she says lightly. If realised, it would score two remarkable firsts - she would be the first technologist to lead IBM and the first woman head of a leading multinational corporation. To be realistic, there are other candidates among IBM's top managers whose claims to succeed John Akers are as good and better than Ellen Hancock's; but as one observer pointed out, if any large company were to appoint a woman chairman, it would be IBM in pursuit of its commitment to equal opportunities. Hancock pays tribute to IBM's endeavours on behalf of its women employees: 'For years IBM very deliberately worked to make sure that women can get ahead in the business and have encouraged it. As I moved through my career, there were times when I felt I was ready for the next move and other times when the company said 'Why don't we push her a bit'. The company worked very hard to get several of us into that position. Now there are women first and second line managers and divisional presidents and vice-presidents ready to move into senior'. Ellen Hancock joined IBM in 1966 with a master's degree in mathematics, but no computer knowledge, and learned programming in the company's Armonk, New York, headquarters. Unconventionally, for somebody destined for the fast track, she spent the next decade in a variety of technically-orientated jobs, including systems engineer looking after customers in the brokerage industry. She felt at the time that she was not ready for management and was happier with technical issues. In 1977, however, Hancock accepted a job as a first line manager - the lowest form of managerial life within IBM - in the company's Kingston, New York offices. She moved swiftly to third line manager in Charlotte, North Carolina, to extend her experience of IBM's financial hardware. A series of increasingly senior appointments followed and she became a corporate vice-president in 1985; from first line manager to vice-president in eight years more than compensated for her slow start. She was named general manager, communications systems, in 1988, the first woman to head an IBM 'line of business (LOB)' - LOB is IBM-speak for a product division covering everything from product design to manufacturing. In another first, the LOB was relocated from New York to Staines, just outside London, in the middle of last year, the first time a product division has been run from outside the US. One aim is to bring IBM and its networking customers in closer contact, but location does not actually matter all that much because Hancock travels and works incessantly. Her staff are used to receiving electronic mail messages at all hours from wherever she happens to have laid hands on a computer terminal. She accepts that her technical expertise lies in a little understood area - but argues that executives should understand the importance of networking to their business. 'If they have a business, the odds are their business needs some form of networking - most businesses need to communicate in some way with other businesses and with their employees. 'I would not expect a business executive to be interested in some of the things I like working on - like the question of TCP/IP versus OSI. But I would expect, if they intend to keep their company in a leadership position, that they should understand how they are utilising networking to get information, to keep their employees up to speed and to understand what is happening in the market'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Jose Mendes] </F>   [Text] It's raining Russians in Rio. They come from cities  like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nijni Novgorod--among others.  Their passports say Vladimir, Ilia, Igor, Irina, and Olga. The  Russians are coming to town in an invasion as sweet as their  Slavic accents. The wave is swelling to such a point as to  constitute a new tourist boom, far from the prejudices of the  Cold War. But the invasion has not only sent tourists; it has  brought more than 30 scientists and high-tech researchers,  first-rate "brains" from the former Soviet Union, now settled  down and teaching at institutions like Rio de Janeiro State  University (UERJ) and the State University of Northern Rio de  Janeiro [UENF] in Campos.    "For us in Rio, this is an occasion as important as the  arrival of 40 of Europe's brightest at the University of Sao  Paulo (USP) during the Second World War. It was that importation  of `brains' that gave USP the influence it has today," said  Senator Darcy Ribeiro.  <H5>  Competition </H5>   As chancellor of UENF, Ribeiro has already sent three  delegations to Russia to compete--mainly with Israel, Germany,  the United States, and Japan--for the chance to transfer to  Brazil "22 of the best and the brightest," who were orphaned by  the dismantling of Soviet scientific institutions. Not wanting  to be left behind in the seduction of Russian "brains," UERJ  Rector Hesio Cordeiro has now brought five scientists to his  campus.    When it comes to tourism, it is also "the Russians' turn"  now, said Olga Dalamarczuk, assigned by Hotur (Association of  Tourist Hotels of Rio) to take care of the visitors from that  country. In general, these are people from the middle class who  have benefited from the economic reforms begun in 1992. An  Aeroflot flight brings groups of 50 every week. That has led  Riotur and Hotur to invest in promoting Rio in the Russian  capital.  <H5>  Salary Makes Move Worthwhile </H5>   "They say that if you go to Salvador, you'd better not drop  anything on the floor because if it makes a noise the Bahians  will think it is a new rhythm and will start dancing." The joke,  which conveys a feeling of intimacy with things Brazilian, is  told by Irina Potapenko, a Russian physicist and mathematician  who has been here for three months. Along with her colleagues  Arthur Elfimov, Vladimir Tsypin, Nicolay Grishanov, and Fedor  Nekrasov--all theoreticians in plasma physics (a scientific  field concerned with such things as making better use of solar  energy)--she works at the Department of Quantum Electronics at  the UERJ School of Physics.    Like her colleagues, Irina likes Rio, "a city that combines  modern buildings, the sea, unusual mountain shapes, and  hospitable people," as she puts it. The Russian scientists earn  $1,000 (CR$700,000) a month at UERJ. In their own country,  researchers would earn only $80.00 (CR$56,000) a month. "Russia  has no means of investing in science. But since scientific  knowledge is universal, it is better to do the work here than  sit idle back there. Later, we can take the results back home,"  said Elfimov.  <H5>  Supply </H5>   The researchers recall that their country now has 1.5  million  researchers at the doctorate level, plus 200,000 scientists who  have attained the highest level of education--all of them  susceptible to becoming part of the "brain drain." Another  physicist, Sergei Ivanov, came to Rio to develop "x-ray  equipment to measure tension inside metals." He lives with his  wife Nina and daughter Maria in Leblon. "Russia pays specialists  low wages. Some day I'll go back. Although my 9-year-old  daughter, who attends Saint Patrick School in Leblon, wants to  stay in Rio. You say there are criminals here? Well, there are  criminals in Russia, too," observed Ivanov.    At the State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro [UENF] in  Campos, says its president, Gilca Wainstein, an elaborate  process of transfer and absorption of technology is under way.  "We sent delegations to the Russian Academy of Sciences and  reviewed more than 80 resumes from each scientific field. The  idea is that even if the Russians go back to their own country,  they will leave the technology here," said the university  president. At UENF, 22 Russian researchers are earning about  $3,000 (CR$2.1 million) each. They work in sophisticated  specialty fields of biotechnology, diamond technology, fracture  and corrosion engineering, and oil and gas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Aleksey Agureyev, </F> UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Petrunya]    [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Beginning May 30, 1994 Ukraine  will no longer be a target for American strategic missiles,  according to the agreements signed by the United States, Russia  and Britain, ITAR-TASS and UKRINFORM learnt from well informed  sources.    The sources said that this topic was discussed at the  meeting  between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and visiting U.S.  Secretary of Defence William Perry which was held behind the  closed doors. The major leitmotif of the talks was the  implementation of the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement signed in  Moscow in January 1994, as well as the agreements reached during  the recent U.S.- Ukrainian summit meeting in Washington. They  call for Ukraine's "denucliarisation" and providing it with  compensations and security guarantees.    The second most important issue is cooperation between  Ukraine and the United States within the programmes of economic  cooperation and defence conversion. The U.S. will provide  financial assistance to Ukraine to finance the conversion of its  defence industry and build housing for the demobilised military.    Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine is unswervingly observing its  obligations under the three-party agreement -- it has sent the  second train full of nuclear warheads to Russia.    Perry stressed that relations between Ukraine and the United  States are strategically important. He and Ukrainian Defence  Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who also attended the talks signed an  agreement under which Ukraine will be granted 50 million dollars  in addition to 135 million it is to receive under the Strategic  Arms Reduction Treaty. The means will be used to finance the  dismantlement of SS-24 missiles.    Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement as a  "historic move and a way-out of the nuclear deadlock." "This  step and the ratification by Ukraine of the START-1 Treaty and  the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free state virtually removes  all juridical and other barriers for Ukraine's joining the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," he said.    At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of  obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process."  He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out  disarmament and solving social problems facing the military.    "We have also reached full understanding on issues  concerning  the Partnership for Peace programme. We understand that  Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures,"  Radetskyy said.    The sides also discussed cooperation in space exploration.  The talks were attended by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William  Miller.</p>

Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Chinese Premier  Li  Peng will attend the signing ceremony at the weekend.    Lee said that the prospects of the Suzhou project are  "good",  "a well planned township in Suzhou will proceed at a slower pace  than Shenzhen, but the long-term results will be better."    His remarks were contained in an written interview with  XINHUA here today.    Asked why Singapore chose Suzhou as the venue of the joint  government project, Lee said because it is in the Chang Jiang  delta and close to Shanghai, the dragon's head of the Chang  Jiang valley. "It is a medium-size township, smaller than  Singapore, and therefore its scale of work is what Singapore  officials have handled before."    He underlined that the main feature of the project "will be  on long term planning which takes into account the environment,  aesthetics, the convenience of the residents who will live and  work in it, and of the commercial and financial services that  will cater to the industries and the residents."    In the Singapore-Suzhou industrial township, he said that  industrial, residential and commercial facilities would be  planned, implemented and administered as one integrated whole,  as in Jurong town in Singapore.    Lee Kuan Yew is the initiator of the Suzhou project, which  has been supported by the Chinese Government. Singapore will  develop a industrial town with an area of 70 sq kilometres in  Suzhou in the next 10-15 years and will transfer Singapore  economic development and management experiences to Suzhou.    On "software", he said the hardware is the "tangibles", what  people can see and feel in buildings, roads and physical  infrastructure. But the software is "intangibles", which  includes: drawing up and implementation of the plans, management  of the township as well as creation of conditions which are  attractive to investors and favorable to residents.    He also saw some difficulties in the procedures. "The  difficulties lie in transferring the methods developed in  Singapore into Suzhou, because these methods have to be adapted  to fit into the system in China. Therefore Suzhou, Jiangsu and  Beijing officials have to encourage creative adjustments and  adaptations."    "It is like bud-grafting Singapore methods of urban and  social organization on to a Chinese tree with roots in Chinese  soil," he said.    Lee will leave here on February 24 to visit Beijing and  Tianjin.</p>

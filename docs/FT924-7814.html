			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Mobile 'Measure' - Theatre MEASURE for Measure has increased its popularity since it opened in 1604. Coleridge was first to recognise its strengths, finding here 'the permanent politics of human nature.' Twentieth-century theatre has called it a problem play and set about finding solutions. Ian Forrest's production of Measure for Measure at the Chester Gateway succeeds in making it new, adding portable phones and personal stereos. He delivers an inventive rendering of an intractable play: illuminating, instructive, but rarely fascinating. The production's greatest asset is the set (Juliet Watkinson), a compact between Dante and Hieronymus Bosch, all stairs and levels in brutal grey. Below, institutional fluorescent light shines up from Claudio's prison; above, soft stained glass represents Isabella cloistered world. Angelo's court slides between them. Each scene moves towards a debate: justice against law, loyalty against virtue, reason against emotion. The difficulty with Forrest's direction lies in leaving the actors to reinvent themselves with every speech: within them, the scenes lack momentum, and between them, cohesion. The action turns on two encounters. Isabella's pleadings to Angelo for her brother's life, and then her forgiveness of him in the final scene. Peter Brook used to make Isabella pause before kneeling for Angelo, stopping the play for as long as two minutes. This production finds no hesitation. Angelo (Mark Spalding) starts out buttoned-up and brilliantined, hiding behind his desk, pretending to work. Opposite him, Isabella (Ruth Gemmell) is uncertain in her petition but resolute against compromise: 'Isabel, live chaste, and brother, die: More than our brother is our chastity.' But Gemmell finds frailty in a gesture, making her excess understandable. Around them, the Duke (Stephen Ley) has all the authority of a man running late to a meeting; he makes an improbable lunge to reveal Isabella's brother, and bound across the stage to propose marriage. His second, Escalus (Geoffrey Banks) has all the authority of Ross Perot's running mate. Old-style liberality cedes to new-style rigour tempered with clemency. The low lifers gain most from being transplanted forward 400 years. Pompey (Nicholas Murche) uses his mobile to call out from prison, making a dull monologue come alive as a telephone conversation. His friend Lucio (James Duke) is a delight. Their adversary, Constable Elbow (Peter Rylands) is the 1990s' model stage police officer: a violent, shiftless, opportunist. Measure too often presents itself as a war between liberty and restraint - lust on the one hand and anti-sex legislation on the other. Here, Forrest hints at a discussion about two kinds of government; one has 'dark deeds darkly answered'; the other operates in the light of legal process and open information. Both have drawbacks. The US election last week was a step from one to the other. Gateway Theatre, Chester (0244-340392) until 28</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Global offer planned for China Steel shares The Taiwan government is planning to sell up to 450m of its shares in state-run China Steel Corp, the country's largest steelmaker, through an offering of global depository receipts as early as September. The shares represent about 6 per cent of the company's equity. The government is also planning to sell another 198m common shares to domestic investors late this month as part of the company's phased privatisation, said an official in the economics ministry's commission of national corporations. Some of the shares will be distributed though private placement and the remainder offered to the public. Lead underwriter China Development Corp said the shares would be priced between NTDollars 21.71 (81 US cents) - the fixed price in a March share issue - and NTDollars 22. CSC shares traded on the Taiwan stock exchange closed down NT30 cents at NTDollars 27.3 yesterday. The March issue came at a time of waning market sentiment and was not regarded as a success.</p>

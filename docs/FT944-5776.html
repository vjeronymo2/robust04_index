			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Russia warns Nato on rapid move eastwards: Moscow holds back launch of military co-operation programme Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, last night warned Nato not to draw new dividing lines in Europe by expanding eastwards too rapidly. In protest at the expansion plans, Russia unexpectedly refused to hand over a document which would have launched a military co-operation programme with Nato. The move shocked western officials, who had seen the agreement as a symbol of improving relations between Moscow and the west. Mr Kozyrev still hoped to launch the co-operation programme, which includes military information-sharing and joint exercises, but insisted it would only happen when Russia had answers to its fears about the rapid expansion of Nato. Mr Kozyrev's comments came after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, which had broadly accepted a US proposal to speed up enlargement to include ex-communist countries in central and eastern Europe. The foreign ministers' meeting took place in the shadow of a bitter transatlantic row over Bosnia, a dispute highlighted yesterday by a leak to the German press of a telegram from Baron Hermann von Richthofen, the country's ambassador to Nato. The telegram, intended for the German foreign ministry, was written last week, just before the latest row between the US and its European allies. It warned that the possible lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo, sought by the US Congress, would 'bring the cohesion of the alliance to its limits'. It also emerged yesterday that Nato's military command had asked Germany if it could provide Tornado fighters to help police the skies over Bosnia. German officials said the request, controversial because of the Nazi record in the Balkans, would have to be considered cautiously. In an attempt to revive the Bosnian peace process, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, will go to Belgrade on Sunday to meet President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. After snubbing Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, on Wednesday, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, is scheduled today to meet Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, in Pale, the Serb-held stronghold above Sarajevo. Today, foreign ministers from Britain, France, Germany, the US and Russia - making up the contact group on Bosnia - will meet in Brussels to relaunch the peace initiative begun in the summer. Despite the intense diplomatic efforts, UN officials privately fear prospects for peace are slim. The Nato ministers agreed that existing members would agree procedures for incorporating newcomers, and present conclusions to candidate members next year. Russian officials have repeatedly warned against the incorporation of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - widely seen as the prime candidates for Nato membership - if Russia is excluded.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nicolae Chirtoaca, chairman of the Liberal </F> Convention of Moldova: "OBSERVATORUL Juggles the Facts"]    [Text] The protracted current crisis in the country, the  decline in the population's standard of living, the  contradictory nature of measures being taken by the executive  power in the attempts to stabilize the economic situation, the  sound-bite populism and declarativeness with which our political  life is replete create the background of human fatigue and  nostalgic moods against which the elections to the supreme  legislative organ of the country will take place.    Under these conditions, the responsibility of political  parties and movements of truly democratic, reformist orientation  is high. By pulling together they can still restore the  influence and role of common democratic movement, which have  begun all the transformations that have occurred in the Republic  of Moldova between 1987 and today, mobilize the creative  potential of the society, and develop and implement concrete  effective programs for stabilizing the situation and proceeding  to a new qualitative level of social and economic development.    The complexity of tasks facing the democratic movement in  the  country at this important stage demands a constructive approach  on the part of political parties and public movements united by  common ideals and goals. For this we need, first and foremost,  to get rid of narrow group interests, corporate ambitions, and  the desire to establish oneself at the expense of discrediting  and diminishing political opponents and the organizations they  represent.    In this context, a graphic example of confrontational style  in thinking and approach to political reality are some articles  about the LCM [Liberal Convention of Moldova] that appeared in  the OBSERVATORUL newspaper. By juggling and distorting the  facts, the authors of these materials, in particular V. Butnaru,  try to portray me as a dissident, who has challenged all the  president's men and jumped into the vortex of political struggle  with the purpose of exposing and denouncing others. Fortunately,  I have not had the fortune of earning a general's rank in the  national army in order to afford myself the luxury of taking the  stance of an exposer. Moreover, I consider such actions  destructive and useless unless they are followed by concrete  proposals on how to improve the situation and concrete efforts  aimed at overcoming the shortcomings. The main reason for my  voluntary resignation from the job of state adviser on military  issues was the realization of the need to consolidate the forces  of centrist, reformist orientation in Moldova, to unite the  people who are concerned with the future of the country and see  the way out of the crisis situation by working out an integrated  and concrete concept on the basis of values of modern liberalism  and creative rethinking of the experience of developed  democratic countries. When others placed their trust in me by  electing me the chairman of the Liberal Convention of Moldova, I  made a decision to completely concentrate on political  activities, seeing it as the most important of all on the  difficult road to a new democratic state of the society.    I believe that the president of Moldova, Mr. Mircea Snegur,  has taken upon himself the burden of one of the most difficult  tasks of the transition period--to ensure a gradual reform of  the economy, democratization of the society, prevention of  extremes, and resolution of conflict situations from the  position of common sense and taking into account the current  realities. Being a guarantor of these transformations, a  middleman in the competition of new political parties, the  president of the country frequently becomes a target of  criticism on the part of radical and extremist forces, of those  groups that are against territorial integrity and independence  of Moldova.    The Liberal Convention has proclaimed its support for those  forces that aid in the implementation of real reforms while  preserving stability in the society. Guided first and foremost  by its program planks, the LCM will strive to implement concrete  comprehensive plans developed on the basis of the liberal idea,  and is ready to constructively cooperate with all political and  public organizations that share these principles.</p>

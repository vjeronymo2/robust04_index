			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Ukraine refuses to sign CIS defence pact SIX republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) yesterday signed a defence pact, but Ukraine, its second largest member, was among five others that refused to join, Reuter reports from Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The collective defence agreement was trumpeted as a showpiece of the CIS's fourth summit since it was set up last December on the ruins of the Soviet Union. But in reality, it exposed the fragility and divisions within the 11-member grouping. Russia, Armenia and four Central Asian republics signed the accord, which commits signatories to come to the assistance of any member subjected to an attack. Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan declined to sign. President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, one of the CIS's strongest advocates, said the pact established a formal base for the independent republics' security. All members of the commonwealth agreed in principle to implement the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, which calls for deep cuts in conventional weapons. Russian President Boris Yeltsin said the high number of refusals in signing the defence pact was a 'cause for regret and even a degree of misunderstanding. We are talking here about collective security. The entire world is moving towards this,' he said. Mr Vitold Fokin, Ukraine's prime minister, said the pact was incompatible with other commonwealth agreements, which had anyway failed to halt ethnic conflicts.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accelerate airport and aircraft programs. EPA could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accelerate programs designed to reduce emissions from commercial,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, and military aircraft and associated activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accelerate turnover of recreational boat engines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from recreational boat engines will eventually be reduced through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adoption of national standards for new engines and subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fleet turnover. It is possible to achieve an accelerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turnover similar to that required for heavy equipment either by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricting operation of boats which use engines that do not meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new national standards, or by imposing a fee on the excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from such boats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the requirements for stationary source categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section III.C.3 and the statewide area sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section III.C.4 are scheduled for implementation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996. EPA expects, in fact, that all stationary source emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions projected under the 2005 attainment demonstration will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be achieved by 2000 except for those required by the cap rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in section III.C.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed cap programs require most stationary sources in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura to reduce VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions by at least 4% and 6% per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year respectively for each year from 2001 through 2005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Theoretically, EPA could require 20% or greater VOC reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (and 30% or greater NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions) by 2000. While this might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accelerate attainment, EPA cannot conclude that accelerating such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions would be practicable, and believes it could well be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counterproductive in practice. Specifically, such a dramatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near-term reduction requirement might result in massive non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance that would overwhelm EPA's enforcement abilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail to achieve real air quality improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has estimated the effects of an onroad heavy duty truck  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure, nonroad growth cap, accelerated shipping fee system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accelerated airport and aircraft programs, accelerated turnover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of recreational boat engines, and accelerated stationary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cap on the overall Ventura emission inventory. After accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these controls, EPA projects an emission reduction shortfall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of approximately 10 tons/day of VOC and 5 tons/day of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Note  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contribution by stationary sources in Ventura is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially greater than in the Sacramento area. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mobile source measures do not produce the same effect as they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did in Sacramento.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to address the remaining emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shortfall, EPA could impose activity restrictions using a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of regulatory approaches. For example, broad-based reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from many stationary and almost all mobile source categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be obtained with such blunt measures as fuel surcharges or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas rationing. More focused reductions could be made by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targeting motor vehicle activity through fees on vehicle-miles- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traveled (VMT) or no-drive days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes such potentially severe measures should only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected after substantial public participation and debate. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faced with an attainment shortfall in the 1990 proposed FIP for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast Basin (55 FR 36458), EPA did propose to limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile source activity with a no-drive day program for onroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicles. In the 1990 South Coast case, however, EPA was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> struggling to find enough reductions to attain by the latest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legally acceptable date. In Ventura, the issue is whether there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are practical measures to attain prior to the statutory deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to achieve the remaining emission reductions necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Ventura to attain by 2000, EPA estimates that two no-drive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days or equivalent alternative activity reductions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed. That is, each highway vehicle registered in Ventura  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be prohibited from being driven on two of the five workdays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in each week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obviously, this and other measures needed to accelerate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment in Ventura would have dramatic negative socioeconomic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts in the area. EPA does not consider them legally required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as practical measures or good policy. For that reason, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot conclude that such measures would be practicable and EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not, therefore, proposing to attain the standard before 2005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. South Coast Ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reduction requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Anthropogenic emissions in the South Coast in 1990 totaled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 1913 tons per day of VOC and 1273 tons per day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for an average summer weekday. The air pollution control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations now in effect in the South Coast are, with few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions, the most stringent in the Country. In addition, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the CARB or SCAQMD adopted regulations prescribe future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance requirements that are still more stringent, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing CARB standards on new engines and equipment will deliver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing reductions each year as a result of fleet turnover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections II.B and III.H. of this NPRM discuss the adopted CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and SCAQMD rules which are assigned credit as part of the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even after allowing credit for reductions from these State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and local measures, continued growth in the area's population and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity levels will erode much of the future benefits of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently adopted controls. Consequently, in the absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further SIP or FIP measures, emissions in the South Coast will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not decline appreciably. The 2010 emissions levels are projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be 1390 tons/day VOC and 1142 tons/day NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for an average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summer weekday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Extensive urban airshed modeling of three episodes in 1985  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1987 provided the basis for the SCAQMD's 1991 Air Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Plan, which concluded that ozone attainment could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved if basin-wide emissions were reduced to approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 187 tons per day of VOC and 399 tons per day of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (episode- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific emissions). Based on the current baseline emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory, and prior to the completion of extensive new modeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses that are underway, EPA is using reduction targets of 90  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent for VOC and 69 percent for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from the 1990 base-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions levels. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  Assuming these reduction targets, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of SIP and FIP controls must achieve, by 2010, total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions of 1726 tons per day of VOC and 874 tons per day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from 1990 emissions, or 1203 tons per day of VOC and 743 tons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per day of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from 2010 baseline emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Other combinations of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions may be evaluated in preparation of the 1994 ozone SIP. To the extent possible, EPA will attempt to conform the final FIP (and any subsequent amendments to the FIP) to the State's chosen mix of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions used in the 1994 ozone SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with Sacramento and Ventura, EPA's control strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis for the South Coast began with a comparison of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable existing South Coast rules to the rules currently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect in other areas. Although the SCAQMD generally has among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the most advanced regulations in the Country, EPA was able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify stationary and area source categories for which new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced technology-based rules could be promulgated immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to yield additional emission reductions. Section III.C.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discusses those new or improved category-specific stationary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area source rules which EPA is able to propose at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After credit for emissions reductions from this initial set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of FIP measures, a massive shortfall in necessary emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions still remains. The FIP mobile source core measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are identified in section III.B.2. and III.D.1.b. These measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute substantial further reductions (approximately 205 tons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per day VOC and 181 tons per day NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), leaving roughly 1000 tons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per day VOC and 562 tons per day NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to be achieved by added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stationary and area source controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to achieve the remaining target reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a combination of the emission cap rules set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section III.C.5., additional mobile source controls discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section III.D, and the ``new technology'' commitments discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section III.B.5.d. below and in section III.G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

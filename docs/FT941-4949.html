			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Caborn concerned at Independent bid The chairman of the trade and industry committee, Labour MP Mr Richard Caborn, has called for firm conditions to be imposed if the takeover bid for The Independent is not referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Caborn says no one member of the bidding consortium should be allowed outright control without referring to the DTI for clearance.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Developing country competition and unskilled jobs FEW ECONOMISTS doubt that trade is the route to economic growth for developing countries. Most also believe that free trade is in the interests of consumers in developed countries too. But the rise of trade barriers in industrial countries over the last decade, and their unwillingness to complete the Uruguay Round, suggest that politicians are not convinced by the merits of lower trade barriers. The popular view that competition from low-cost producers in developing countries pose a growing threat to jobs and incomes in industrial countries is, instead, gaining ground. Both Ross Perot, the former US presidential candidate, and senior Democrats in congress have latched on to this fear. The proposed North American free trade area, signed last week, may yet flounder over the next few weeks in the face of congressional opposition. Developing country exports have certainly grown rapidly over the past three decades, and exports from the east Asian economies have grown even faster: by an average 9.2 per cent between 1965 and 1980 and 10.2 per cent a year between 1980 and 1990. The share of developing country goods in total developed country consumption of manufactures has more than tripled in the last 25 years. Yet conventional wisdom among economists says that developing country trade is too small to have significant negative effects on wages and employment in developed countries. The penetration of developing country imports into developed country markets may be growing, but it remains low. Developing country exports account for less than a 10th of the manufacturing imports of developed countries and only 3.1 per cent of total manufacturing consumption, as the chart shows. Even if every developing countries had posted South Korean style export growth in the 1980s, this share would have been a mere 0.6 percentage points higher. The impact of trade on labour-intensive manufacturing industry in developed countries has been more pronounced. The share of developing country trade in industrial country imports of these goods has grown from 9.8 per cent in 1965 to 18.7 per cent in 1989 and developing country clothing producers now account for 22.1 per cent of total clothing consumption in industrial countries. Professor Adrian Wood of the Institute of development Studies at Sussex University has estimated the cumulative effects of developing country trade on manufacturing employment in industrial countries over the last 30 years. Skilled employment increases very slightly - the extra jobs created by higher exports out-weighed the jobs displaced by imports. But for unskilled employees, the losses swamp the gains. By 1990, total manufacturing employment was a net 9m jobs lower, as a result. Still, estimates of the manufacturing employment cost of developing country trade are not large compared to the actual decline in manufacturing employment that has occurred. The decline in the share of manufacturing in total employment in industrial countries, from 29 per cent in the mid 1960s to 22 per cent in the mid 1980s, implies a loss of 30m jobs. Yet estimates of lost employment and import penetration ratios ignore the effect of trade on investment and technical progress. Research in the US suggests that trade is overwhelmed by domestic factors in explaining the shift in demand for labour from unskilled to skilled. But companies may respond to the threat of competition by introducing more advanced production methods which use less labour. The timing of the acceleration in manufacturing productivity growth over the last three decades matches the rise of developing country trade. Productivity growth is largely to blame for the fall in manufacturing employment in developed countries, accompanied by rising unemployment and falling relative wages among uneducated workers, whether or not it can be traced to domestic or external factors; and for the nervousness of politicians.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: BETWEEN HARD ROCK CAFE AND A PRETTY PLACE  </P> <P> We flew up to San Francisco with our friends Rita and Morry Pynoos for our  anniversary weekend.  </P> <P> My wife and I had spent a night or two in San Francisco during the war, but  that was before credit cards, and we were very parsimonious.  </P> <P> Like almost every other outbound serviceman, I did take my wife to the Top of  the Mark for a final drink before I sailed for the South Pacific. The Top of  the Mark was the true jumping off place for the Pacific war.  </P> <P> This time we stayed at the Mark Hopkins, looking down on the glorious view  which, though much has changed for the worse since the war, is still one of the  world's prettiest.  </P> <P> As Robert A. Jones noted in his column the other day, there is no longer any  contest between San Francisco and Los Angeles. San Francisco is a victim of its  own narcissism. San Francisco turned to the past and ignored the future. Now  that future belongs to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> All the same, it's a nice place to visit. From our room we looked down on that  imposing brownstone anachronism, the Pacific Union Club. Nothing has changed  about it in 50 years, that I know of, except that the entrance is covered by  more vines. It supposedly has a membership of 300 of San Francisco's richest  men -- the heirs of Crocker, Stanford, Huntington and Hopkins -- but I have  never seen anyone enter or leave it. I have never seen a face in a window.  </P> <P> Below it lay a pretty little windswept park with stoic women lying about in  bikinis, and a block beyond that the gray Gothic facade of Grace Cathedral. Out  on the gray-green bay, half hidden by one of the new towers, lay Alcatraz  Island with its bone-white prison ruins. One red tower of the Golden Gate  Bridge arose, only partly blocked, in graceful strength. One wonders why anyone  would ever have tried to escape a place with the view that Alcatraz must have  had. Below us the pretty colored banners hanging from the facade of the  Fairmont snapped in the wind.  </P> <P> For lunch we took a cab to the Hard Rock Cafe, at Van Ness and Sacramento.  "Hard Rock Cafe?" the taxi driver said with disgust. "Forty airports go out  ahead of me and I get the Hard Rock Cafe."  </P> <P> Morry commiserated that maybe his next fare would be to the airport. "No way,"  the driver said. "I get back, 40 more airports will go ahead of me. I'll get  another Hard Rock Cafe."  </P> <P> He said it wasn't all bad, though. "I've been to Sacramento. I've been to the  Oregon border. I pick up this little lady, she wants me to run her here, there.  I do her a few favors, run a few errands. She likes me. She says she's going  out of town. She says she wants me to stay in her condominium. She has this $1  million condo. She gives me the key. She says, 'I want you to drive my BMW  while I'm gone.' Listen, you think this is some rich old lady? Right? Look at  this."  </P> <P> He whipped out a photograph of a good-looking young blonde. She looked  familiar. The photograph was a standard 8x10 studio glossy. Oh, well, San  Francisco is a city of fantasies.  </P> <P> Like its namesake in Beverly Hills, the Hard Rock had a long line of young  people waiting to buy souvenirs at its doorway store. We had reservations and  were soon seated. Being somewhat over 20, I don't know the reason for the Hard  Rock cafes' success. They are always packed. The decor is early Elvis. The  sound is hard rock. The noise level probably deafens employees in one or two  years. But there is a sense of excitement about the place, and the food is  excellent. Unless you are just out of high school, almost everyone in the cafe  will be of another generation.  </P> <P> I couldn't get a fix on San Francisco because I imagine most of the customers  were from someplace else -- probably Los Angeles. T-shirts. Jeans. Shorts.  Miniskirts. Sweat shirts. Reeboks. In the daytime in the tourist areas you are  not likely to encounter any true San Franciscans. They have simply abandoned  the city to the tourists.  </P> <P> Going back, our cab driver was Nigerian. He wasn't talkative. We asked him how  Nigeria was different from San Francisco. He thought a moment.  </P> <P> "Warmer," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures closed above the 3,000 level for the first time in nearly a month as favourable figures on inflation triggered buying by European and US institutions, writes Joel Kibazo. At the close, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 stood at 3,015, up 45 on its previous close, at a strong premium to cash and some 7 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume was an Average 15,610 lots. Earlier, the contract had opened firmly at 2,985 which was the first sign that a positive session lay ahead. The UK figures on inflation and unemployment encouraged buying by the large institutions. Dealers suggested that one of Tuesday's main US sellers had turned a big buyer. September reached its peak of 3,030 over lunch before a bout of nervous selling, ahead of Wall Street's opening brought a brief retreat. This proved short lived and buyers for September were seen once again. The contract maintained a strong premium to cash through out the session which at the day's best stretched to 20 points. In traded options, most of the sector's activity was centred on the index options. Total volume was 31,343 of which the FT-SE 100 option traded 12,012 and the Euro FT-SE option 10,096. Argyll Group was the busiest stock option at 1,097 lots.</p>

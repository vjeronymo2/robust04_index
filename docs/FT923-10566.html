			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The BCCI Indictments: Dollars 105m fine unlikely to be a burden THE US plea-bargaining with Saudi former intelligence chief Sheikh Kamal Adham, who admitted violating banking laws and agreed to pay a Dollars 105m fine, was settled after long negotiations understood to have involved some political manoeuvres because of his past importance to US administrations. The fine is unlikely to trouble Mr Adham, who has acquired considerable wealth through prominent Middle East deals. His biggest coup is believed to have been a Dollars 400m commission 20 years ago, agreed by a group of Japanese oil companies seeking a foothold in Saudi Arabia. 'The BCCI charges might have appeared to many Americans to have involved big money, but it would have been the equivalent to taking the paper clips for Adham,' said an Arab former banking official yesterday. In the UK, where Mr Adham is regarded as an old friend of British intelligence interests, he agreed this year to act as a witness in cases being compiled by the Serious Fraud Office. The 61-year-old Mr Adham is viewed as something of an eminence grise in Egyptian society. Like many other prominent Arabs, he is an old boy of Victoria College, Alexandria, and many of his business connections relating to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International stem from old school acquaintances. Mr Adham, with Dr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi businessman, and Mr Roger Tamraz, a banker who recently turned out to be the champion of an alternative BCCI liquidation plan, emerged as the purchasers in 1975 of the Detroit-based Bank of Commonwealth. Two years later, Mr Adham headed a new takeover for the bank that would become known as First American. He made a brief and unprofitable foray into British banking in 1975 when First Arabian Corporation bought a 25 per cent stake in the troubled Edward Bates Bank, which was caught up in the UK's secondary banking crisis. Mr Adham and his partners were persuaded to supply a letter of comfort that needed to be drawn upon almost immediately. Some Pounds 70m is thought to have been ploughed into the bank by Arab interests. The bank was later taken over by an Arab consortium, joined by a 20 per cent stake from Barclays Bank, and renamed Allied Arab Bank. The key to Mr Adham's standing in the west, however, is his long and distinguished pedigree in Middle East intelligence operations. He was trained by the CIA. A half-brother of Iffat, favourite wife of the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Mr Adham became one of the few advisers to win the king's complete trust. Mr Adham was never so close to King Khalid, Faisal's successor, who dismissed him in 1979 when he discovered that Mr Adham had been a mediator in bringing Egypt and Israel together in the Camp David peace accord.</p>

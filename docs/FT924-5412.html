			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Technology: Closing the gates on shoplifters - Worth Watching Clothing stores have long used tagging systems to prevent shoplifting, but supermarkets have found it almost impossible to prevent the theft of beans, light bulbs or even caviare. With this in mind, Knogo, of Long Island, has developed undetectable tags for small items. The fine electromagnetic metal strips, encased in a clear material, are stuck on randomly selected foods, disguised as part of the label or bar code. When the honest customer puts the tagged item on the conveyor belt, plates in the check-out system break down the electro-magnetic force in the strip. But if an item is slipped through surreptitiously, twin gates positioned at each check-out detect the stolen item. Knogo: US, 516 232 2100; Belgium, 65 642101; UK, 0628 486414.</p>

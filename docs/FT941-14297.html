			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / 'Granny' bond draws a mixed response An interest rate of 7 per cent gross fixed for five years was offered to people of 65 and over by the government yesterday with the launch of the new Pensioners' Guaranteed Income Bond from National Savings. The bond, which goes on sale from today, will require a minimum deposit of Pounds 500 and has a maximum of Pounds 20,000. Interest will be paid monthly. Though it is a five-year investment, investors will be able to withdraw their money before then, provided that they give two months' notice and suffer the loss of two months' interest. Building societies yesterday expressed a mixture of relief and reservations at the details of the bond, which has concerned them since Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced it in the November Budget. Banks and societies' five-year fixed rate bonds giving monthly interest offer a variety of rates depending on conditions and deposit size, with many in the 5 to 6 per cent gross range. Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said: 'This will definitely be tough competition for societies. There are a lot of outstanding balances at risk.' But most societies are unlikely to rush into revising their products until the scale of the movement of deposits becomes clearer. Halifax said the interest rate was not as attractive as it had expected, but the maximum investment was higher than anticipated. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, said the bond forced pensioners to take a view on interest rate movements.</p>

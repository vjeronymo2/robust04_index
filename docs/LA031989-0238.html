			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: BUILDING LIMIT DELAYED  </P> <P> Santa Monica's City Council has delayed action for at least two months on a  proposal by Mayor Dennis Zane that would limit the amount of construction  permitted annually and would allow city officials to select projects based on  their benefit to the city.  </P> <P> The delay represents a small victory for Santa Moncia business and neighborhood  groups who oppose the plan, called the Commercial Allotment Program (CAP). The  program is the latest effort to rein in what many see as runaway growth in the  city.  </P> <P> The CAP would set an annual limit on commercial development -- office, hospital  and industrial projects larger than 20,000 square feet -- at 200,000 square  feet.  </P> <P> Zane said he welcomes public discussion of the slow-growth measure but remains  committed to setting an annual limit on development and establishing a ranking  system for evaluating projects.

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Revenue may invite competitive tenders for confidential tax work The Inland Revenue is planning to allow private companies to compete with its own staff for vital work involving the collating of sensitive financial information on individuals and companies. The data are provided by banks and other financial institutions and are used to verify information given in tax returns. The controversial proposal concerns one of several core activities the Revenue plans to put out to competitive tender over the next 12 months. The move was denounced by the tax officers' union last night. Breaches of confidentiality might arise if delicate areas of tax operations were run by private companies, it said. Mr Clive Brook, general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, said: 'Taxpayers will be up in arms at what is being proposed. It raises an issue of public concern.' The Revenue has told staff it plans to make its Cardiff-based taxpayer information distribution office (Tido) compete for its work with private contractors. The 107 staff collate information provided by banks, building societies, insurance companies and stockbrokers. This includes the interest income earned on bank accounts as well as details of entertainment allowances and other benefits received by individuals and companies in the UK. It also involves data on the transfer of properties. The information is matched against the tax disclosures provided to the Revenue by individuals and companies, and can be sent to local Revenue offices if discrepancies are found. The material is stored on disks in Cardiff. 'It is disgraceful that such material could find its way to third parties like private companies that might use it for other business purposes,' said Mr Brook last night. The Revenue confirmed last night it intended to market-test the Cardiff centre as part of the government's wider programme to introduce competitive tendering across the civil service. But it denied the union's accusation that this might threaten confidentiality. In a letter to his staff, Mr Geoffrey Bush, the Revenue's director-general, said other key areas of work to be opened up to bidding include: The departmental security unit that advises on security matters at tax offices; The specific security operations of head office; The Kew tax sorting centre and the new Nottingham-based facilities management unit. Mr Bush said the Inland Revenue had agreed in principle to market test these areas after discussions with the Treasury and the government's efficiency unit. The director-general sought - in a letter on September 29 - to reassure staff that while he understands market testing is a 'major area of concern' for them, they were 'very difficult to beat' where an 'in-house bid can be mounted'. He warned staff that in 'the present climate it is unfortunately impossible to say there will be no compulsory redundancies'. Market testing would 'almost certainly involve some job reductions'.

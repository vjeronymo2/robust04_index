			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGUE COUNTRIES  </P> <P> Henry Kissinger, in his article "Joining Germanys" (Opinion, April 15), states  that "a system of collective security has historically proved useless against  the biggest threat to peace -- a major rogue country." He then asks, "How could  such a system avoid all the frustrations of the United Nations and the League  of Nations?"  </P> <P> Kissinger overlooks the reasons for the frustrations of the United Nations.  Former Secretary General U Thant once said: "The ultimate crisis before the  United Nations is the crisis of authority, and nations are reluctant to give to  the United Nations the authority it needs."  </P> <P> Possible first steps to restructure the U.N. with the authority it needs would  be (1) to create an international verification system (as proposed by the Six  Nation Initiative) to verify compliance with arms- reduction agreements; (2) to  establish a U.N. peacekeeping reserve of earmarked national contingents (as  proposed by President Carter), and (3) to create an international criminal  court (as proposed by 14 Caribbean nations) to try individuals accused of  transnational drug trafficking.  </P> <P> Mikhail Gorbachev, to his credit, appears to be open to or supportive of all  three initiatives. Kissinger, instead of bewailing the "frustrations" of the  U.N., should urge President Bush to support these steps.  </P> <P> Historically, balance of power politics as advocated by Kissinger has never  achieved a lasting peace. Nor can a weak U.N. Only a world federation, able to  enforce world laws on individuals as well as major rogue countries, can do  that.  </P> <P> WALTER HOFFMANN  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> World Federalist Assn.  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUGLAS KOS TYSON IN TITLE FIGHT UPSET  </P> <P> James (Buster) Douglas knocked out heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in the 10th  round at the Tokyo Dome today in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.  </P> <P> Douglas, 29, the fourth-ranked contender, felled the previously unbeaten  champion with a five-punch combination to the head at 1:23 of the round.  </P> <P> Tyson rolled over at the count of five and reached for his mouthpiece. He was  on his hands and knees when the referee counted him out.  </P> <P> Tyson, who was 37-0 with 33 knockouts going into the fight, was such a  prohibitive favorite that Las Vegas refused to put up a betting line. Douglas  now is 30-4-1.  </P> <P> Breaking down in tears while draped with the title belts that have belonged to  Tyson since 1986, Douglas said the reason he won was "my mother," referring to  the recent death of Lula Pearl Douglas.  </P> <P> Full coverage in Sports.  </P></p>

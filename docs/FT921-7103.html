			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Throwing the book at directors - Why failure to file accounts can lead to a criminal conviction In 1987, when Judy Dean and her husband Peter set up a company and made Judy a director, they had no idea that four years later she would end up with a criminal record. Yet last December, Judy Dean (not her real name) was convicted under the Companies Act of failing to file annual returns or accounts on time. In an average month, Companies House prosecutes about 160 company directors. In 1991 alone, 3,356 directors of 2,208 companies were prosecuted for failing to file annual returns and 1,864 directors from 1,284 companies were prosecuted for failing to file annual accounts. If convicted, they get a criminal record. The duty to submit 'certain basic information about a company's structure and finances' is the quid pro quo for being able to incorporate a limited company and is the personal responsibility of the company's directors. Private limited companies have to submit the information within 10 months of the end of the financial year; plcs have seven months in which to do it. But it is not the personal responsibility which worries owners of small businesses and those, like Dean, who fall foul of the system. They are concerned that the government appears determined to make their mistakes a criminal offence. 'There seems to be a move among civil servants to criminalise these offences,' says Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses, which has published a report* on the penalties facing company directors. 'Everyone recognises that fraud is wrong, but even negligent, honest mistakes are now seen as serious misdeeds.' Alambritis says the FSB has been warning its members for some time that Companies House was taking a tougher stance towards people who file accounts late. 'Companies House is no longer the lax organisation it was in the 1970s. It's now a government agency and is computerised and very aggressive.' Dean was well aware of her responsibilities as a company director, but says that in her case, the company for which she was fined did not even trade for a full year. It was set up to enable her to work flexible hours so she could also care for her sick husband. But as he became seriously ill, she was forced to give up work to look after him. But as he started to recover, Dean found a full-time job in July 1988 . She thought no more about the now-defunct company until she received a black bill, followed by a red one, for Pounds 1,000, for failing to file her annual return and accounts. She admits that, preoccupied with her husband, working full-time and running a home, she did not get round to sorting out the bill. She says she telephoned Companies House to explain her circumstances and was told this would be taken into consideration. Dean maintains she did not know her case was to be heard by Cardiff magistrates last December, or that she could have attended to give her side of the story. Officials at Companies House are convinced that late filers receive enough warning. 'We write to them before the accounts are due, reminding them, and then after that, we have a set procedure. I can't reveal it because it's like paying your gas bill. If you thought you could get away with it until the last minute you would,' said one official. Prosecution was 'a last resort'. At present, convicted directors can be fined up to Pounds 2,000 for each late document, but a new scale of penalties is being introduced. From July 1, directors filing late accounts will receive an automatic fine of up to Pounds 5,000 for a public company and Pounds 1,000 for a private company. They will also get a criminal record if convicted. Says Stephen Alambritis: 'There's a balance to be struck between encouraging good commercial activity and clamping down on fraudsters. Companies House seems to be sending out a wide net that catches a number of people, but discourages some from trading altogether.' * The penalties of being in business, published December 1990 by FSB.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Seita sees 28% rise in net profit for 1994 Seita, the French state-owned tobacco group, yesterday forecast that net profit for 1994 would rise 28 per cent to FFr670m (Dollars 123.6m) from FFr585m last year. The decision to give such a definitive profit prediction appears to pave the way for the privatisation of the group early next year. On Monday, the National Assembly passed legislation removing the civil service status of the group's 6,200 French employees. They will be offered 5 per cent of the shares on preferential terms, with a further 2.5 per cent going to the country's 36,000 tobacconists. The state is to keep a 10 per cent stake and sell around 35 per cent to a core of institutional investors, from which rival foreign tobacco manufacturers will be excluded. The remainder will be sold on the open market. Seita said yesterday it had nearly doubled its operating profits to an estimated FFr1.03bn this year from FFr538m in 1993, but its profit from financial operations was considerably down this year because of positions the group took on the dollar and because of investments in bonds. In a pre-privatisation exercise to clean the slate, the company said that it was making provisions to cover financial losses of FFr380m for the first nine months of this year, and added that it was putting in place a better reporting system to keep track of financial investments. With an improvement in the last quarter of the year, Seita said it expected to finish this year with its financial operation showing a FFr50m profit. Seita has a unique financial advantage in that it has up to 50 days before it has to hand over to the French state the tax it collects on cigarettes sold in France. Seita has a 45 per cent share of the French cigarette market, and distributes the products of its commercial rivals to tobacconists.</p>

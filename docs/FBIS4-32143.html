			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 20 Jun (TANJUG) -- "The Federal Ministry  of Foreign Affairs notes with concern an escalation of  accusations by The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]  against the Yugoslav Army because of alleged violations of its  border and actions provoking border incidents. Along the same  lines are accusations that the Yugoslav Army is massing its  forces in the border area with the FYROM and that `the Serb  army' has occupied the Straza observer post on Cupino Brdo," the  statement issued by the ministry says.    ``The Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs deems all the  accusations unacceptable and unjustified, and rejects them  entirely.    ``The Yugoslav Army was deployed along the border as early  as  June 1992 and from then on it has been securing Yugoslav  territory, along the border with the FYROM, up to the  administrative borders of the municipalities belonging to the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At that time and for a long  period thereafter the FYROM had no objections to the situation  on the ground. The Yugoslav Army units deployed along the border  with the FYROM fully respect their code of service, performing  their duties strictly in the territory of the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia. The FYROM's accusations of alleged border  violations became frequent when foreign military observers  arrived on the Macedonian side of the border.    ``The Federal Foreign Ministry believes that the aim of the  frequent accusations by the FYROM authorities is to substantiate  the theory of the alleged `threat from the north' launched by  certain non-Balkan and non-European players for their own  interests. Such accusations should at the same time justify the  involvement and strengthening of the deployment of foreign  military factors on the territory of the FYROM, as part of the  campaign of stepping up pressures on the FRY [Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia].    ``The FRY's policy toward all neighbors, including the  former  Yugoslav republics, is well known, and the attempts to portray  it in a false light, such as those from the FYROM, are contrary  to the mutual interests for the development of good neighborly  cooperation, peace, and stability in the Balkans. The FRY's  policy is based on mutual respect of territorial integrity and  sovereignty and, in relation to the FYROM, also on the interest  in normalizing relations and reestablishing broken ties and  cooperation. The FRY will fully adhere to the principles of the  inviolability of territory and non- use of violence in solving  open issues.    ``Again describing the Macedonian accusations as illogical,  unfounded, and unacceptable the Yugoslav side expects the FYROM  Government to stop fabricating such accusations and, in the  interest of peace, security, and good relations to put its  actions in line with internationally recognized norms and  documents,'' it is said at the end of the statement by the  Federal Foreign Ministry.</p>

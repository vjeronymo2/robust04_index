			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: The OECD reaches a crossroads For the next couple of days, a nondescript office building in Paris's fashionable 16th arrondissement will become a mecca for finance, trade and foreign ministers from the world's 24 leading industrial countries. The event - the annual ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - is an established staging post on the way to the world economic summit of the Group of Seven nations which takes place this year in Munich from July 6 to July 8. As always, the ministers will have a full agenda, embracing issues from rising unemployment in the OECD area, through world growth or the lack of it, the failure to complete the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, to how best to help the ex-communist states of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe integrate with the industrial world's market economies. But it would be a pity if they did not this year stop to think about the future of the organisation hosting the meeting. The OECD is at a crossroads. It is not a global body like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank which have most of the developing and former communist countries among their members. It has no cash to disburse in return for good economic behaviour. It is also difficult to escape the conclusion that its members are taking it less seriously. Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, and Mrs Carla Hills, the US special trade representative, decided at short notice not to attend this year's ministerial meeting. Mr Don Mazankowski, the Canadian finance minister, cancelled his attendance last Friday. Britain, too, is adopting a low-key approach to this week's talks, unlike last year when three cabinet ministers attended. Mr Michael Portillo, the new chief secretary to the treasury, will deputise for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor and be accompanied by junior ministers. And yet countries other than the 24 members of the club are clamouring to join or be associated with the OECD. The collapse of communism and the adoption by more countries of market-based economic systems and democratic government have meant many nations either have, or aspire to have, the style of life characteristic of the industrialised and pluralist societies of the OECD during its 30 years. These countries seeks expertise. The OECD plays a unique role in the exchange and dissemination of knowledge. Its secretariat provides non-partisan analysis on a growing number of issues, ranging from macro-economics to trade, the environment, health and the impact of technological change on society. Perhaps more important, it is one of the few places where officials of member countries can exchange views without the risk of committing themselves or their governments in negotiations. These two facets of the organisation's activities mean it can act as a clearing house for ideas. In OECD committees, away from the public eye, some of the more stupid national preoccupations that would otherwise snag international negotiations can be discussed and amended or allowed to die a natural death. But how should the OECD respond to requests for co-operation and even membership from interested countries in east Asia, eastern Europe, Latin America and the former Soviet Union? With 24 members from Europe, North America and the Pacific rim, it is already unwieldy. The budgetary constraints of its member governments have also ensured it does not have the cash for grandiose projects. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general, has responded cautiously to the sudden popularity with non-members. He sees three concentric circles around the nucleus of member countries. an inner circle of countries which take part in the work of OECD committees. These would include Mexico, which sits in the steel committee, South Korea, a member of the working party on shipbuilding, and Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, the 'partners in transition'. fast-developing countries such as the Asian 'tigers'. Dialogue between the OECD and countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia would not take part in formal committees but through workshops or conferences. less developed countries. The OECD would have only limited contact with these. Such a structure would be flexible because countries could graduate from one group to another, even to full membership. It would also recognise the growing tendency for the world to develop in regional economic groups. Building on this idea, Mr Paye has suggested the OECD could become the main forum for dialogue between the industrialised world and other groups such as the newly industrialising Asean countries of Asia or Latin American nations moving towards greater economic co-operation. The organisation could also help relations between the European Community, North America and Japan, as the EC and the members of the planned North American Free Trade Area develop into more cohesive economic areas. If the OECD is to develop as a meeting point between the industrialised world and other country groups it will have to know more about the countries outside its 24-nation area. But it also faces a more serious challenge. In recent years, members have fallen behind traditionally protectionist countries such as Chile, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Mexico in the promotion of free trade and open markets. This development, if allowed to continue, bodes ill for an organisation pledged to fostering a healthy world economy based on a multilateral and non-discriminatory trading system. Unless the organisation's members start taking these obligations under OECD convention more seriously, the OECD could become a forum for dispute among regional groups rather than the 'pre-eminent forum for dialogue' that Mr Paye envisages.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The top U.S.  Official to the United Nations revealed today the contents of a  draft resolution on sanctions against the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) amid the current nuclear dispute.    Madeline Albright, the U.S. permanent representative to the  United Nations, read to reporters the elements of the  U.S.-drafted resolution.    "Phase one will impose significant sanctions and will impose  heavy price in terms of diplomatic isolation on North Korea,"  she said.    "And these sanctions will take into effect after a  relatively  short period of time which is normal in our sanctions  resolutions," she added.    Generally speaking, the sanctions fall into five categories,  she said. The five categories are as follows:    First is stopping technical and scientific cooperation, that  can be contributed to DPRK nuclear knowledge.    The second is terminating all economic assistance through  the  United Nations or its subsidiaries.    The third is reducing the size and scope of diplomatic  activities with the DPRK both bilaterally and through  international organizations.    The fourth will be curtailing cultural, technical,  scientific, commercial and educational exchanges with the DPRK  both in that country and elsewhere.    And finally, prohibiting the DPRK from exporting and  importing any weapons or components, and that is mandatory.    "If there is further backsliding by North Korea in terms of  safeguarding present and future nuclear material, we will  tighten the sanctions by cutting all financial transaction with  Pyongyang," she warned.    But she said this would not be a sanction by tomorrow or the  day after tomorrow. She said that it was a complex problem,  that the U.S. would be working with all members of the Security  Council, as well as the Republic of Korea and Japan, in this  particular issue.    The DPRK officially notified the U.S. On Tuesday that it was  withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>

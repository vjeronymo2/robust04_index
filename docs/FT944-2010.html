			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Doubts cast on plans to safeguard pension funds Occupational pensions in Britain are to be regulated for the first time under a sweeping new bill introduced in the House of Lords yesterday. But lack of detail in controversial areas has led to criticism from pensions experts and some Labour MPs. The legislation comes three years after the country was shocked by revelations that more than Pounds 440m had gone missing from pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The legislation is intended to improve the security of each worker's pension, raise the age at which women are allowed to draw state pension benefits, and restructure the tax incentives offered to those who take out personal pensions. The main elements of the bill include the creation of a pensions regulator, a minimum solvency requirement for occupational defined-benefit schemes, and a compensation scheme for benefits lost through fraud. It also gives scheme members the right to elect some of the trustees who administer the scheme. However, on some of the most contentious issues, the bill has scant detail, raising questions about whether it has sufficient scope and strength to protect workers. In particular, the bill fails to specify the circumstances under which employers may avoid allowing members of occupational pension schemes to appoint their own representatives as trustees. Neither does it spell out how the minimum solvency requirement - the level of assets a scheme must hold in relation to its liabilities - is to be calculated, nor the time alloted to an employer to make good a shortfall. At the moment, there is no minimum solvency requirement for schemes. The Department of Social Security said it intended to address any legislative gaps through subsidiary regulations. These could not be amended during the bill's passage and would probably not be debated in parliament. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, said yesterday that the bill was not detailed enough. 'In many important areas, the bill is no more than a legislative skeleton and Labour's job will be to flesh out the detail during its progress,' he said. 'Government by regulation has become a disease.' The government can therefore expect protracted challenges from the opposition and from within the pensions industry over several elements of the bill. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, the professional body for those who must provide certificates of scheme solvency under the new law, has been among the first to attack the proposals. Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said: 'We think this bill will provide the illusion of security for pension scheme members.' Employers have argued that alternative solvency requirements would cost them more than the Pounds 5bn over 12 years envisaged in the bill, and discourage them from providing pensions.

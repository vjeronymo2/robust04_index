			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, 4 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In the five  years and more since Hainan Province was established, the press  and publishing in the province have developed rapidly and at  present have become a rising new industry in the large Hainan  Special Economic Zone. This was disclosed by Chen Keqin,  director of the Press and Publication Bureau of the province, at  the provincial culture and sports work meeting a few days ago.    Chen Keqin said that the press and publishing in Hainan  Province had developed without the government's financial  investment. When the province was established in April 1988,  there were only one publishing house for books (the Hainan  People's Publishing House), one newspaper (HAINAN RIBAO), and  one magazine (TIANYA) [THE END OF THE WORLD -- 1131 1509;  reference to Hainan's geographical location]. At present, there  are four publishing houses (companies) for books, one  audio-video publishing house, 17 newspapers, 37 magazines, more  than 30 bookstores, over 30 printing presses, and 139 newspapers  and magazines for restricted circulation. Last year, the  province published more than 7 million copies of 518 book  titles, more than 100 million copies of 14 newspapers, 3.58  million copies of 31 kinds of magazines, and more than 35  million copies (cassettes) of over 30,000 kinds of audio- video  products.    Chen Keqing said that the press and publishing had made  great  contributions to the flourishing of the economy and culture in  Hainan, and Hainan would adopt effective measures to promote the  continuous and healthy development of the press and publishing.</p>

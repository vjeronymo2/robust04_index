			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Advocacy plan rejected: Talks deadlocked over proposed limitation on many solicitors MORE THAN two years after the government legislated to end the barristers' 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts, talks about the terms on which solicitors would gain wider advocacy rights remain deadlocked. Yesterday the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee rejected the Law Society's latest application for extended advocacy rights on the grounds that additional safeguards are needed before solicitors employed in commerce and industry, government and the Crown Prosecution Service can be allowed in the higher courts. The committee, chaired by Lord Griffiths, a law lord, has advised Lord Mackay that there are no objections to solicitors in private practice being allowed to appear in the higher courts. But changes are needed to the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act before lawyers working for the CPS and the Government Legal Service are given wider audience rights. The committee said there needed to be a statutory limit on the amount of advocacy work CPS lawyers were allowed to do in the Crown Court. The Law Society's current application would allow the CPS and the GLS to do all their higher court advocacy in-house. The committee said that was unacceptable. The rejection of the society's application represents another victory for the barristers' lobby. Since the 1990 act came into force they have been fighting a strong rearguard action to prevent both solicitors and barristers in the CPS from having the right to conduct Crown Court trials. The Bar fears that if the CPS is allowed to prosecute in the Crown Court it will lose an important training ground for barristers, which could threaten the viability of the independent Bar. The Law Society said yesterday that a division between the rights of employed solicitors and solicitors in private practice was unacceptable and that it would urge the Lord Chancellor to accept its application in its current form. Mr Mark Sheldon, the society's president, said: 'This is a depressing day for the profession and the public. Unrealistic concerns about the CPS are evidently more important to the committee than wider client choice.'</p>

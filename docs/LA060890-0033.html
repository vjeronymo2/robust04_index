			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> $109-MILLION LIBRARY BOND ISSUE PROPOSED  </P> <P> Arguing that the city can no longer afford to ignore its dismal municipal  library system, Councilwoman Judy McCarty on Thursday urged the City Council to  place a $109-million library construction bond issue on the Nov. 6 ballot.  </P> <P> The proposed bond issue would include $87 million for a new central library and  $22 million for branch expansions and replacements.  </P> <P> McCarty said the proposed ballot issue has "a very good chance" of winning in  November, partly because it will be supported by the "Friends of the Library,"  a powerful group that includes more than 5,000 library patrons.  </P> <P> McCarty also pointed to the positive statewide response on Tuesday by voters  who approved local and state issues that earmarked funds for specific areas.  </P> <P> Patrons of the city's library have willingly "stepped aside" in recent years as  the cash-strapped council used its available revenue to fund parks, jails,  roads and other capital improvements, McCarty said. While those projects have  been funded, "we are no closer to a new central library than we were in 1985,"  McCarty said.  </P> <P> "People use the library. Let's put it on the ballot and see if they're willing  to pay for it," McCarty said. "Now is the time to plan the library and put it  to a vote of the people."  </P> <P> McCarty has asked Mayor Maureen O'Connor to place the proposed bond issue on  the council agenda.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor probably would agree to place the bond issue on the  November ballot because "it's the kind of thing that the mayor has said should  go before the public for a vote," O'Connor  </P> <P> spokesman Paul Downey said Thursday.  </P> <P> But Downey declined to comment on whether O'Connor will support the bond issue  if it appears on the ballot.  </P> <P> During a budget workshop Thursday, council members agreed to maintain park and  recreation services at their existing levels, pushing the budget shortfall for  the upcoming fiscal year to at least $35 million. Individual council members  also indicated that they wanted to consider increasing money for the Fire  Department and social services.  </P> <P> But, as in past budget meetings, the council once again delayed discussion on  where added revenue will come from to balance the proposed general fund budget,  which in recent weeks has grown to more than $455 million.  </P> <P> While the council delayed discussion of new revenue for at least a week,  Councilman Wes Pratt on Thursday advised his colleagues that "we're going to  have to raise revenues. . . . It's definitely coming."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OK, OK . . . MAYBE GREEN CAN HELP NOLL OUT AFTER ALL  </P> <P> was a little more than a month ago that Eric Green picked up the morning  newspaper and read that Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll told him it was a  waste of everyone's time for him to even show up this season.  </P> <P> Green, the No. 1 draft pick who held out of the entire camp during of contract  negotiations, read that it was too late for him to help the Steelers.  </P> <P> He wasn't going to do anyone any good by signing now.  </P> <P> "I remember all that," Green said Sunday in the aftermath of the Steelers'  36-14 victory over the Chargers. "I wonder what he's thinking now."  </P> <P> Said Joe Walton, the Steeler offensive coordinator: "I can tell you exactly  what Chuck's thinking, because we both know that we have a very good player on  our hands. Eric's got the ability to make big plays, as you saw today, and he's  going to give teams a whole lot of trouble."  </P> <P> Green, who played in his first game a week ago after signing Sept. 10, had his  first three receptions of the season, and two happened to be for touchdowns.  </P> <P> "I'm going to enjoy this one as much as I can," said Green, only the fourth  player to be drafted out of Liberty College. "This is everything I've always  hoped it would be. I walked up to Burt Grossman (the Charger defensive lineman  from Pitt) after the game and just said, 'Liberty, baby, Liberty.'  </P> <P> "He looked at me funny and just laughed, saying, 'Nice game.' "  </P> <P> Grossman had made fun of the size of Green's alma mater in comments earlier in  the week. BOB NIGHTENGALE  </P></p>

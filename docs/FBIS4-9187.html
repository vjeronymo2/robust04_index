			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cajnice, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Muslim military  and civil leadership from Gorazde has rejected the Serbian  side's offer whereby all combat activities would be halted and  the warring parties would be separated by a demarcation line  running along the Drina, TANJUG reporters have learned from  Serbian military sources. The Serbian side's proposition was  rejected late last night. Heavy fire from all weaponry was  opened on Serbian positions shortly afterward. Fighting resumed  this morning along the demarcation lines on the left and the  right banks of the Drina, the Herzegovina Corps [of the Bosnian  Serb army] reports. It adds that one Serbian fighter was killed  and several were wounded in last night's clashes. [passage  omitted]</p>

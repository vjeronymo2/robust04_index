Heavy shooting could  still be heard this morning from the districts of Kamenge,  Kinama, and Cibitoke (where most of the inhabitants are Hutus),  according to the AFP correspondent in Bujumbura. People have  started fleeing from these areas to Zaire. The Burundian radio  made several appeals for calm this morning.    The UN special representative in Burundi, Ahmedu Ould  Abdallah, said between 60 and 80 deaths were recorded last  night. In a statement to AFP, Ould Abdallah pointed out that  the dead included members of both ethnic groups as well members  of the Armed Forces which lost at least five men. He described  as "extremely exaggerated" the reports given by Rwandan radio  last night stating that at least 1,000 persons were killed in  Bujumbura over the weekend. "It is in the interest of some  politicians to make people believe that things are not going  well. There is no general insecurity in Burundi," he added.</p>

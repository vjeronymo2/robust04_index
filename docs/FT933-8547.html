			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Cash gift to daughter I AM RETIRED and get a small pension. I have lived in the same house for the past 15 years. Originally, the house was in the joint names of myself and my daughter; but when she came to live with me six years ago, she paid me half the then current value for my share. Now, she is emigrating and is allowing me to continue to live in the house for as long as I wish. I plan to make her a gift of all my cash, which includes the original money for my share of the house and interest earned. The sum is about Pounds 100,000 and represents virtually all my assets. I am aware of the effects of gifts in relation to inheritance tax, notwithstanding my assets are presently within the current threshold. However, I have recently been told that such a gift would also be liable to capital gains tax as it would represent a disposal. Is this true? And what proportion would be so taxed? Were my daughter prepared to sell me the house at current value (approx Pounds 95,000), would this course of action be more appropriate? There is no capital gains tax on gifts of sterling. You might like to ask your tax office for the free introductory pamphlet to capital gains tax, CGT14. If your daughter sells the house to you, this could assist her in establishing that she has ceased to be ordinarily resident in the UK (and might assist her in establishing that she has acquired a domicile of choice in the country to which she is emigrating). On the bare facts outlined, it looks as though she would be exempt from capital gains tax on the sale, by virtue of section 226 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (Private residence occupied by dependent relative before 6th April 1988). This, however, is something which she should talk over with the solicitor who will be acting for her in negotiating the sale. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

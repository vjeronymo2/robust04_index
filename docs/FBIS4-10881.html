			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish  on 10 April carried a 1,200-word interview on page 8a with  Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate for the Colombian  Conservative Party, by El TIEMPO editor Jorge Gonzalez,  conducted on the slopes of Sierra Nevada, in the area between  Santa Marta and Cienega. Commenting on the results of a poll  taken by EL TIEMPO in which Liberal Party, PL, presidential  candidate Ernesto Samper is leading, Pastrana feels that was to  be expected right after the PL convention and notes the  situation will change in the days to come because the  presidential campaign has gotten under way.    When Gonzalez notes that the selection of his running mate  may have hurt his campaign, Pastrana begins by saying he had  asked current Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to accept the  nomination, but she declined. "People are beginning to  realize," he adds, that Luis Fernando Ramirez is a good choice  "because he embodies the results of the struggle of the people  from rural areas."    Gonzalez mentions the possibility of Samper reaching an  understanding with Antonio Navarro Wolff of the April 19  Movement, but in Pastrana's opinion the M-19 has clear  ideological differences with Samper. Pastrana then adds he has  received the endorsement of Gustavo Rojas, son of Gustavo Rojas  Pinilla and "true representative of the Anepo [National Popular  Alliance] interests." "What we have sought from the PL is the  everyday citizens, the civic and business leaders, the new man.  That also applies to independent conservatives. The specific  strength of a candidacy can hardly be gauged by the number of  endorsements," he remarks.    When asked if there was no coincidence that he set himself  apart from the conservative congressional candidates, Pastrana  replies: "What I wanted was to maintain total independence with  regard to past elections. I want to act in line with my  supraparty candidacy. I did not endorse those liberals who were  elected to the Congress and are now supporting my candidacy."  He adds the situation changed after the elections. "That is  why I created a multiparty political committee, representing the  PL, Conservative Party, and National Salvation Movement, which  will be tasked with a large part of the political organization,  together with the National Conservative Directorate."    In answering a question as to whether he has gone from a  multiparty candidate to the candidate of one party, Pastrana  states that those who have tried to label him a conservative  have failed "because my actions are those of an open-minded,  democratic, multiparty man." "There is room for liberals,  conservatives, and independents in a national government," he  adds.</p>

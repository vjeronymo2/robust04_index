The instructions require all PLA units to guide themselves with  Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's concept of  army building in the new period, to keep to the correct  orientation of military training, and to further increase the  intensity and depth of training reform so as to improve the  fighting capabilities of the armed forces as a whole.    The General Staff Department calls on leaders at all levels  in the armed forces to focus their attention on changes in the  objective situation, the characteristics of modern warfare, the  actual conditions of our army building, and the new situations  and characteristics of army building and combat in the new  period; to conscientiously implement the series instructions  issued by Jiang Zemin and other leaders of the Central Military  Commission; and to give more macro-guidance for training.  Keeping reality and development in mind, all PLA units,  academies, and schools should quicken their pace of progress,  deepen their reforms, and strive to explore new ways of  training. In connection with cadres' in-service training, they  should conduct training in high technology, suiting such  training to different trainees at various levels. All military  academies and schools should focus their attention on the  developing students' intelligence and improving their abilities.  They should do a good job of overall planning for optimizing  the knowledge and ability of cadres at various levels.    The General Staff Department stresses: In training  management, it is necessary to improve training mechanisms,  rules, and regulations; to formulate policies and measures to  link actual training achievements with the immediate interests  of officers and men; to increase the degree of difficulty and  intensity in training; to improve the basic quality of all PLA  units and their fighting capabilities; and to explore ways to  vanquish the enemy with existing weapons and equipment. Efforts  should be made to step up the coordinated training of the Army,  Navy, and Air Force and to keep improving their fighting  capabilities. It is essential to pay attention to both army  building and management, to raise the efficiency of training,  and to strengthen and improve ideological and political work in  this regard to arouse the enthusiasm of officers and men for  military training.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 1 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian Foreign  Ministry welcomes the accords signed as a result of talks  between the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation  Organisation, according to the statement received by ITAR-TASS  today.    The negotiations, which centered around security in Hebron,  ended with the decision to send international observers to this  city.    "Russia as a co-sponsor of the peace process is firmly  convinced that these accords must be followed by new steps, and  first of all by the signing of an agreement on Gaza and Jericho  and its implementation in accordance with the schedule indicated  in the declaration of principles. This would enable not only an  easing of tension on occupied territories but also open up a  path towards the advancement of the entire negotiating process  aimed at establishing a fair and durable peace in the Middle  East," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.    The Russian ministry expressed the hope that the accords  reached in the course of the negotiations would be fulfilled to  provide reliable protection to the Palestinian population and  normalise the situation on the occupied territories.</p>

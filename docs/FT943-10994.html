			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: OFT consistently misses point on monopolies in food retailing sector Sir, You report ('Sainsbury takes on Tesco in bid for Wm Low', July 29) that, according to Sainsbury, its acquisition of William Low would raise the company's Scottish market share from 3 per cent to 10 per cent, and from 11.4 per cent to 12 per cent at a UK level. If these figures are true (and calculations of market share for the big food retailers are notoriously variable, according to their source), a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission seems most unlikely. This would also be consistent with the periodic findings of the Office of Fair Trading that there is no conclusive case against the big UK food retailers on the grounds of monopolistic or anti-competitive practices. In our view, the OFT has consistently missed the point. Food retailing, by its nature, is not comparable with steel production or motor manufacturing. Food shopping is a local activity, since food is both perishable and essential to every consumer. Though distances travelled to shop have gone up, shopping trips are still overwhelmingly under five miles in length. It is, therefore, at a local level that the impact of retail concentration will be - and is being - felt. In parts of the UK, the big three food retailers have almost half the sales space, and combined market share approaching two-thirds. It is precious little solace to the consumer facing such concentrated markets to know that, nationally, market shares are too low to justify a reference to the MMC. The current takeover speculation prompts us to ask over what area market share should be calculated. At the moment it is at the UK level. As Brussels gains competence and member-state economies are integrated, presumably this will shift to the EU level. Ultimately, post-General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world market share will no doubt be considered. The march of Sainsbury and Tesco into Scotland means the question is far from academic. Perhaps the OFT could answer it before Low is swallowed by the jostling leviathans.

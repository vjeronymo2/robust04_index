In a statement released here today, the spokesman said: `The  Vietnamese Government and people felt moved and strongly  condemned this cruel crime. While negotiation on the Middle East  problem is nearing a solution. This act of the Israeli ultra  rightists created a tense atmosphere, thus causing negative  effects to the present talks between Israel and the Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO) aimed at implementing the  agreements on the transfer of autonomous rights to the  Palestinian people in Gaza Strip and Jericho City'.    The spokesman continued: `The Israeli authority should take  effective measures to prevent the recurrence of similar acts and  ensure the safety of live and property of the Palestinian people  in the occupied areas'.    `The Vietnamese Government and people have resolutely and  persistently supported the Palestinian people's just struggle  under the leadership of the PLO for their sacred national  rights', the spokesman stressed in conclusion.</p>

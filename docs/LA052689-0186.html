			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BBC HIT BY FOURTH ONE-DAY STRIKE  </P> <P> Journalists and technicians at the British Broadcasting Corp. staged the fourth  in a series of 24-hour strikes over wages today, disrupting radio and  television programs.  </P> <P> National Union of Journalists spokesman Don Brind said more than 10,000  employees were on strike, but BBC spokesmen said it was too early to say how  many of the corporation's 28,000 employees joined the action because many work  in shifts.  </P> <P> Brind said three unions representing 20,000 workers went on strike after the  BBC refused to reopen talks or increase its 7% wage offer. The unions want a  16% increase.  </P></p>

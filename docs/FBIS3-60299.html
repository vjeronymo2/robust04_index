			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Dec -- The situation regarding the  Pacific's Fleet's storage of liquid radioactive waste is  catastrophic. Storage facilities are full to overflowing, and if  the problem is not solved over the next few weeks, they can  rupture and radioactive waste will be discharged into the ocean  in the Far East. This was stated by Viktor Kutsenko, head of  the chief directorate of ecological safety of the Russian  Ministry of Environment Protection, who was attending today's  roundtable meeting on the problems of the burial of nuclear  waste held at the Peace to Oceans international committee.    Captain First Rank Yevgeniy Romanov, representing the  Russian  Navy and head of section at the Navy's chief technical  directorate, who was present at the meeting, also expressed  fears that if urgent measures are not taken, an ecological  disaster is possible in the Far East. He added that the  merchant fleet vessel TNT-27 was full of radiocative waste. The  TNT-5 vessel also holds 400 cubic meters of radioactive waste.  These vessels are old and unfit to carry a large quantity of  liquid radioactive waste, and no one can guarantee that they  will not sink at the quay, said the Navy's representative.    Measures to utilize radioactive waste, under consideration  at  the Environment Protection Ministry, with the participation of  Navy experts, are thought to take a year to implement, while  these vessels are in no position to wait a year, said Romanov.  He noted that in view of the extreme situation, the Navy  intends to ask the Russian Government for permission to carry  out a controlled discharge of liquid radioactive waste in  Russia's territorial waters in the Far East.    In October 1993 a merchant vessel carried out a partial  discharge of low toxic waste in the Pacific Ocean and this made  Japan very indignant. Kutsenko said that this waste posed no  danger. Its radioactivity was so low that it did not have to be  classified as radioactive at all. The scientist also noted that  the Pacific Fleet would need 10 billion rubles or several  hundred million dollars to utilize liquid radioactive waste.  Japan's promise to assist Russia in setting up liquid  radioactive waste reprocessing facilities so far remains only a  promise. At the same time, the Japanese are themselves  discharging similar waste in the Pacific.    According to an international convention, signed in 1972,  the  discharge of radioactive waste is banned in international waters  throughout the world, while any state is free to do as it sees  fit within its own territorial waters.</p>

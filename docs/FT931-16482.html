			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firm dollar helps to lift continental bourses A HIGHER dollar helped to lift several bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's buyers found empty books and small-lot buyers of blue chips like Allianz, up DM39 to DM2,004, faced exaggerated share price mark-ups which left the DAX index 25.09, or 1.6 per cent higher at 1,556.42. Turnover rose from DM2.3bn to DM4.1bn. Most of the big rises came in carmakers, retailers and steels, which had fallen on depressing news before Christmas. Volkswagen rose DM9.40 to DM251.90, Kaufhof by DM11 to DM423 and Thyssen by DM6 to DM164.50. Some analysts were worried by the renewed interest rate speculation, since a forced interest rate cut by the Bundesbank might well be accompanied by a realignment of the franc to the further disadvantage of German industry. PARIS shrugged off early weakness, caused by a sharp rise in overnight rates to protect the franc. The CAC-40 index hit an early low of 1,831.07 but recovered to close up 7.70 at 1,850.78, just off the day's high of 1,853.26, in good turnover of FFr1.9bn. Rhone-Poulenc CI's jumped FFr23 or 4.4 per cent to FFr541 after the finance minister Mr Michel Sapin was reported as saying that shares in the state-owned chemicals company would not be sold off cheaply in the forthcoming partial privatisation. Peugeot was another gainer, up FFr15 to FFr593, on news that its new car sales in France rose 25.7 per cent in December from the same month in 1991 and on better-than-expected car matriculation data for 1992. MILAN rose in surprisingly active trading before today's holiday. Traders were excited by the news that the interministerial price committee had recommended the convertibility of savings shares into ordinary shares in public companies earmarked for privatisation, although the proposed ratio was not known. The Comit index rose 0.86 to 453.72 in turnover estimated at L150bn-L180bn after Monday's L143.7bn. Credito Italiano, which is expected to be sold off soon, saw its savings shares fixed L222 or 12.7 per cent higher at L1,970. By contrast, its ordinary shares fell L89 to L3,180. Fiat was active on renewed talk of an accord with a Japanese carmaker. The stock gained L5 to L4,130 but then rose to L4,280 after hours. AMSTERDAM was boosted by a stronger financial sector while Ahold stood out with a gain of Fl 1.40 to Fl 91.30 on positive results from its wholesaling division. The CBS Tendency index closed 1.0 firmer at 96.5. VNU put on Fl 1.40 to Fl 89.40 on good 1992 net profit figures while Elsevier firmed Fl 1.10 to Fl 121.90. ZURICH saw CS Holding fall SFr70 to SFr2,100 amid speculation that Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank and CS Holding's main asset, could take over Swiss Volksbank. Volksbank has been suspended at its own request pending an announcement today. Other stocks rose on lower interest rates and a firm dollar, Nestle bearers putting on SFr15 to SFr1,165. The SMI index closed 10.8 higher at 2,128.5. MADRID advanced on the prospect of lower German interest rates and the general index closed 4.93 higher at 220.53. Turnover was strong at Pta13bn. Endesa gained Pta215 or 5.7 per cent to Pta3,990. STOCKHOLM rose in an active but shortened session ahead of today's holiday. The Affarsvarlden general index added 21.5 to 951.5 in turnover of SKr494m. Volvo's B shares climbed another SKr15 to SKr373, aided by the firm dollar and figures which indicated that its US sales rose 50 per cent in December. Astra A shares advanced SKr13 to SKr765, an all-time high. The dollar contributed to the 4.9 per cent rise in the forestry sector. OSLO soared 3 per cent, helped by the dollar and hopes of lower interest rates. The all-share index climbed 11.43 to 390.81 in turnover of NKr306.8m. HELSINKI extended its 1993 gains to 7.1 per cent, the Hex index closing 37.5 or 4.4 per cent higher at 887.6. BRUSSELS was lifted by positive sentiment elsewhere and the Bel-20 index finished up 13.07 or 1.2 per cent at 1,138.53. VIENNA regained some of Monday's losses, encouraged by neighbouring markets. The ATX index rose 13.31 to 736.33 with OMV up Sch25 to Sch615.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 5                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes*            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1086.84     1087.43     1087.60     1089.79 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1177.46     1177.01     1178.79     1182.31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes*           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1090.41     1090.79     1090.05     1090.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1184.46     1182.76     1179.63     1180.16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jan 4    Dec 31    Dec 30    Dec 29    Dec 24 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1083.42   1083.35   1084.02   1086.47   1078.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1174.71   1169.11   1166.76   1167.59   1160.29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1091.31; 200 - 1184.87 Low/day: 100 - 1086.49  200 - 1176.59.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN secretary general, who left Madrid barely  half an hour ago, has expressed his optimism about finding a  solution in order to stop the fighting in Gorazde. Hector  Arenas was able to speak to him just before he boarded his  aircraft. Good afternoon.    [Arenas] Good afternoon. As he was boarding the aircraft,  which is now taking him back to New York, UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali agreed to the request from Radio 1 of Radio  Nacional de Espana to make a statement about the situation in  former Yugoslavia and Gorazde. Before that, the UN secretary  general expressed his gratitude to the Spanish people and  government for the warm welcome that, he said, they had given  him during his visit to Madrid and Barcelona, highlighting  Spain's participation, with over 1,000 soldiers, in peace  operations.    Regarding the situation in Bosnia, Butrus-Ghali said that in  the last few hours he has talked with Yasushi Akashi, his  representative in Yugoslavia, and with NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner, with whom he discussed, he said, what possible  measures could be taken to bring peace to that region.    The UN secretary general said that when he arrives in New  York he will hold further consultations with his advisers,  although I can tell you, he said, that, given that I am by  definition an optimist, I believe that we will be able to find  peaceful solutions in this dramatic case.    Concerning the situation in Rwanda, Butrus-Ghali said that  he  had been in touch by telephone with the UN commander in the  region who told him that the situation remains confused.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Futures markets hit peak trading levels Continued volatility in the financial markets ensured another month of heavy trading volume on the world's futures exchanges. The total volume of contracts traded on Liffe in the first quarter of 1994 grew 115 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year, while volume on the Matif increased by 83 per cent. In Chicago, the US's two largest futures exchanges had their best month ever during March, with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) trading 22.5m contracts and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) 22.2m. The CME this year has begun counting expiring options, options exercises and mutual offset trades with Singapore as volume, inflating its turnover data. In the first quarter, the CBOT's volume was 57.9m contracts, up 38.9m from the first quarter of 1993. The CME's first-quarter volume was 54.7m contracts. Due to its new counting methods, accurate year-ago comparisons for the CME are not available. The Matif, the Paris futures exchange, recorded its highest monthly volume in March, for the second month in a row; it traded 11.8m contracts, 90 per cent up on March 1993, and 10 per cent up on February 1994, the previous record month. The Notionnel (French government bond) contract traded almost 7m contracts, up 96 per cent on March 1993. At the end of its first year as a member of Globex, the after-hours electronic futures dealing system, the Matif has accounted for 78 per cent of the total volume. Liffe had its second busiest month to date, trading 17m contracts in March, a 104 per cent increase over March 1993.</p>

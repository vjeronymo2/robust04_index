			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS WRITERS LOOK AT STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH A WARY SYSTEM;  </P> <P> WRITERS: DIFFERENT APPROACHES ARE NECESSARY FOR TV, FILM AND THEATER, WRITERS  AND DRAMATISTS GUILD MEMBERS REPORT.  </P> <P> Mount a panel discussion titled "Writing About AIDS," match a playwright with  movie and TV writers, and the results aren't necessarily what one would expect.  </P> <P> Held Monday at the Writers' Guild West headquarters and sponsored by the  Writers Guild and the Dramatists Guild (and moderated by the guild's president,  David LeVine), the seminar might have led some to expect a how-to discussion on  writing the ideal AIDS drama. What they heard instead was how writers tackle a  socially controversial subject, write their script, run them through very  different media gauntlets -- and find how some media are more accepting of  sensitive material than others.  </P> <P> "Dealing with stories about AIDS is really about dealing with a system," said  Carl Sautter, who scripted an episode of "Trapper John M.D." that addressed  aspects of the disease. "The key for writers is to know how to work within the  system that exists. There's always someone meddling with the script. It's not  that the system won't deal with AIDS. It's wary of any tough subject."  </P> <P> Sautter was actually referring to two systems: television and the networks,  pincered by the dual censors of sponsors and the ubiquitous standards and  practices overseers; and movies and the studios, where a relative lack of  censorship is mitigated by financial concerns brought about by big budgets and  bigger career risks.  </P> <P> There is a third system, the theater, represented on the panel by William  Hoffman, author of one of the first AIDS-themed plays, "As Is."  </P> <P> Sautter, "Midnight Caller" supervising producer Stephen Zito and Ron Cowen and  Daniel Lipman, co-scenarists of the Emmy-winning AIDS drama, "An Early Frost,"  related the obstacles to getting their stories on the air -- ranging from  network skittishness over suggestions that elderly female characters could like  the gay characters, to pressures from AIDS advocacy groups that their concerns  not be left on the cutting room floor.  </P> <P> Hoffman told a different story.  </P> <P> "I wrote 'As Is' out of a despair that no one was talking about how my friends  were dying," he said, "and the writing literally stopped any suicidal  tendencies I felt. I wanted to hit people below the belt with this, so I  expected trouble from (producers and theater management). But there was none --  just the opposite. I hated writing it, and the only reason I finished it was  hearing the supportive reactions from workshop and preview audiences. They  would say, 'You're kicking us in the guts, but keep doing it.' "  </P> <P> That's how theater works, when it's working well. "The TV writer," Cowen said,  "is writing for Wichita, not off-Broadway New York. It was too important to get  the message out about this disease, so if we inserted an early scene with two  men in bed together, you would hear the channels clicking across America.  </P> <P> "Dan (Lipman) and I were terrified of AIDS when we started our research. We  were so ignorant, and so were the patients we interviewed. One guy was positive  that he got the disease from a dirty glass in a bar. So we couldn't assume that  an audience knew about AIDS."  </P> <P> Contradicting the notion that theater audiences are aware of AIDS-related  issues, Hoffman added that he, too, wrote his play "for people who didn't know  about the disease."  </P> <P> LeVine and his guests, recognizing the mass media's responsibility to expand  public awareness of the epidemic, lamented the lack of TV and movie dramas  addressing the issue. "Instead of dealing with gay men," Cowen said bitterly,  "they put out dozens of stories about hemophiliac kids, who make up a tragic  but very small number of AIDS cases. I think these programs and the people who  do them are disgusting, since they send out two wrong messages: that gays are  responsible for AIDS, and that it's not safe to get blood."  </P> <P> As for the next big AIDS drama, Hoffman suggested the stories of AIDS  activists. "They're one of the most exciting movements in the U.S. A few,  committed people have actually changed government policy (on drug research to  curb AIDS). It's a great story of our time, and it's under-reported."  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: F9  </P></p>

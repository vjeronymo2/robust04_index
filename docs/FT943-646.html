			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd's agency launches Pounds 30m fund - Further evidence of shift in character of the market's capital base Wellington Underwriting Agencies, the largest managing agency at the Lloyd's insurance market, yesterday announced plans to launch a Pounds 30m listed investment company which will supply exclusive support for its seven syndicates. The announcement provides further evidence of the shift in the character of the market's capital base, traditionally supplied by individual Names, trading with unlimited liability for their losses. Earlier this week, Hiscox Group, another Lloyd's agency, said it intended to float Hiscox Dedicated Insurance Fund, and other Lloyd's agencies, including RJ Kiln, are expected to announce similar plans in the next few weeks. Unlike the Lloyd's investment trusts floated after Lloyd's raised some Pounds 800m in corporate capital last year, the new single agency or 'dedicated' vehicles, only support the syndicates of a single agency, allowing a closer relationship between the investor and the agency's insurance business. The new company, Wellington Underwriting, will come to the market by way of a placing of 30m shares at Pounds 1 each. Wellington intends to raise about half the money from overseas and is offering US institutions the opportunity to invest through ADRs. Other overseas funds could come from Australia, Germany and Switzerland. The company will supply about Pounds 55m in capacity to Wellington syndicates, less than 10 per cent of the capacity managed by the agency. Sponsors to the company are Noble &amp; Company, while the brokers are Greig Middleton &amp; Company, both of which advised the launch of Premium Trust and Premium Underwriting at the end of last year. Alex Brown &amp; Sons are acting as US adviser to the company. Impact Day is scheduled for the end of October. Investors must make a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000. The Wellington group itself is buying a Pounds 5m stake. Mr Anthony Cooper, chief executive of Wellington Underwriting, said that the pre-emption rights of existing Names would be honoured and that the development would benefit Names by giving 'additional stability and secur-ity to the existing capital base'. Mr Cooper said that Wellington had no plans to create an insurance company, but the launch of the new fund created a series of long-term options for the group's development. Mr Julian Avery, chairman of Wellington Members Agency, added that 'it will offer (Names) an opportunity to invest directly, and on a limited liability basis, in Wellington managed syndicates. It could also lead, at some future date, to a means for traditional unlimited liability Names to transfer their underwriting to a limited liability basis.' Hiscox, which announced its flotation plans on Monday, is also planning a rights issue to raise Pounds 26m in extra capital for the fund, launched last year after an offer for subscription raised Pounds 11.2m.</p>

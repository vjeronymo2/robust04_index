			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The time has come for the  Seoul government to make a historic decision that will affect  the North Korean nuclear negotiations and inter-Korean relations  in a way no one can predict. As soon as Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu returns from his consultations with U.S. and Japanese  officials Monday evening, the core policy-makers on diplomatic  and inter-Korean dialogue will huddle and chart a future course  in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. The question  they face is one nobody dared ask before -- should Seoul  withdraw its demand for inter-Korean dialogue and let Pyongyang  and Washington talk by themselves?    Now is the time if Seoul wants to renovate its North Korea  policy. Seoul and Washington, impatient on the brink of the  mid-May deadline when the U.N. Security Council may decide to  impose sanctions on Pyongyang, are more than eager to bring  Pyongyang back to the negotiating table. North Korea has hinted  at a willingness to negotiate with the United States over IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections but still  refuses to engage in inter-Korean dialogue.    Ironically, North Korean officials' blatant reference to war  last month, threatening to turn the South Korean capital into a  "sea of fire," provided Seoul with an excuse to pull back on its  inter-Korean dialogue demand. The mood on the Korean peninsula  could not be chillier after the war threat, and this may well  give Seoul officials a reason to once and for all suspend talks  with their Pyongyang counterparts.    As things now stand, Seoul insists on exchanging  inter-Korean  special envoys before Washington holds the next round of  high-level dialogue with Pyongyang. "We felt that we better  elevate inter-Korean dialogue to a certain level while we had a  chance. We believed that was the way, the only way to ensure  that inter-Korean relations would progress in parallel with  North Korea-U.S. ties," said a Foreign Ministry official,  looking back to when Seoul decided to attach this precondition.  But North Korea's insistence on negotiating only with the United  States and keeping South Korea out of the picture has frustrated  Seoul's hopes.    Criticism from the liberal wing holds that Seoul's obstinacy  on inter-Korean dialogue has only blocked successful  negotiations on the nuclear problem. Vice Foreign Minister Hong  Sun-yong openly suggested Sunday that the government snip any  connection between inter-Korean dialogue and nuclear  negotiations, a remark widely interpreted as a trial balloon.  But to do as Hong suggested requires much more than the courage  to take a chance: It means giving up having a say in North  Korean-U.S. talks, watching their relations progress more  meaningfully and quickly than inter-Korean ties.    But more fearful than this for the government is public  opinion. No matter what the reason, the government will be  accused of caving in to North Korean tactics and letting itself  be excluded from the whole negotiating process. This would  constitute nothing short of swallowing its own words repeated  for years that "the road to the United States goes through  Seoul."    Foregoing the demand for inter-Korean talks in itself could  motivate North Korea to come to the negotiating table, but the  price for Seoul is not small.</p>

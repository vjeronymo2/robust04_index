			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 January </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] On 27 January, with three days to go before the  Diet session adjourns, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa made a  very risky gamble. At an emergency general meeting of the  Political Reform Promotion Council (also known as the Private  Sector Seiji Rincho) on that day, the prime minister said that  if political reform was not realized, he would not hesitate to  resign. This was like burning his bridges behind him in a  "desperate counteroffensive" to preempt moves inside both the  ruling and opposition parties to scrap the reform bills, and to  effect a breakthrough in the stalemate through a call to Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono to join him for a  top meeting. Hosokawa, backed by a high popularity rating,  tried to win public support by appealing to the people directly  in an attempt to turn the unwholesome tide. Now the talks at  the joint council of both Diet houses have ended in failure, the  prime minister is likely to stake the survival of his  administration on his top-level meeting with Kono.    As deliberations on the political reform bills entered the  final stages, the prime minister and his aides drew up a  strategy to implement this "threat." While a news conference  had also been considered, the Private Sector Seiji Rincho  meeting was considered a better venue because the prime minister  could appeal to the people directly without having to answer  questions about how he would take responsibility for the failure  of political reform.    The prime minister once used a Private Sector Seiji Rincho  meeting effectively in November 1993, just before the House of  Representatives passed the political reform bills. At that  time, he gave the impression that he was much more dedicated to  political reform than Kono, and this contributed to the passage  of the bills in the lower house.    In his speech on 27 January, the prime minister emphasized  the seriousness of the present crisis. He said that if the  political reform bills were scrapped, "what will happen to  Japanese politics, which would remain what it always has been,  and the Japanese economy and the people's livelihood, which are  suffering from a severe recession during this period of  transition?" He rejected a plan suggested by some members of  the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that a  consultative body be created under the auspices of the upper  house president and the lower house speaker, after which the  Diet session would be closed.    Hosokawa reiterated his commitment to political reform, and  appealed for the ideological and sentimental support of the  people, saying "political reform is a question which belongs in  a different realm from the maneuverings and power struggles  between political parties and factions." Some U.S. newspapers  even expressed support for the prime minister as a reformist,  seeing the affair as similar to the "reformists versus  conservatives" paradigm in Russia with President Boris Yeltsin.  The prime minister, who prides himself on being the champion of  "responsible change," seems to be also trying to enlist  international support.    At a news conference on the evening of 27 January, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said, "While we may need  the north wind sometimes, ultimately, the important thing is to  reach agreement with the warmth of the sun, or mutual trust. I  think that is the decisive factor in the success or failure (of  political reform)."    Perhaps the fact that the prime minister called for a top  meeting with Kono in a Private Sector Seiji Rincho speech showed  his desperation to finalize everything through mutual agreement  after pushing political reform all the way using the "numerical  strength" of the majority.    "I do not know. I do not know." "In any case, right now, I  do not know." These were the only replies he gave to questions  from reporters after the joint council of the two Diet houses  ended in failure in the early hours of 28 January.    After his speech at the Private Sector Seiji Rincho, he said  "(What I said about not clinging to my position) was merely  stating the obvious. This does not mean dissolution of the Diet  or resignation as prime minister," meaning his remark did not  signify the scrapping of the bills would immediately call his  political responsibility into question. Nevertheless, a remark  like this at such a delicate time in political reform process  cannot be taken lightly.    A ruling party Diet member, expressing his expectation,  predicted that "if both the prime minister and President Kono go  to the top-level meeting prepared to resign [if they fail],  discussions will certainly be successful."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The Unreasonable Act That </F> Revealed the True Antidialogue and Antireunification Nature"]    [Text] As was already reported, a joint conference of the  republic's government, political parties, and social  organizations was held in Pyongyang on 11 April to reunify the  fatherland through unity of the whole nation by highly upholding  the banner of great national unity. The issue of promoting the  country's independent and peaceful reunification by thoroughly  fulfilling the 10-point program of great unity of the whole  nation for the fatherland's reunification put forth by Comrade  Kim Il-song, the great leader of our people, was discussed at  the joint conference.    It was initiated at the joint conference that by putting the  nation's interest in the forefront, all the people of the North,  South, and overseas must most of all convene a historical  national conference in either Pyongyang or Seoul to provide a  measure for great national unity at around 15 August which is  one year before the 50th anniversary of the fatherland's  liberation, to open the doors for the country's independent and  peaceful reunification by uniting as one. We decided to send a  letter courteously putting forth such a proposal to the South  Korean authorities, as well as to political parties,  organizations, individual figures, and fellow countrymen  overseas.    However, since the South side said that it could not receive  such a letter, giving unreasonable excuses, it was necessary for  us to broadcast the letter. Such a measure by the South Korean  authorities is indeed an act of betrayal, throwing a wet blanket  over the will and demand of all the Korean people's consistent  desire for the country's reunification.    There is no greater responsibility and important matter of  concern than realizing the country's reunification in the  nineties for its 70 million people. Whether in the North,  South, or overseas, our people today are saying that we can no  longer live separated. They thus cry out for the country's  reunification.    Amid this kind of trend of the times, conscientious  politicians and figures from all walks of life in South Korea  have recently begun openly expressing their will to visit  Pyongyang for the nation's reconciliation and reunification. If  the letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties,  organizations, individual figures, and overseas fellow  countrymen is delivered to such parties and the joint conference  of the republic's government, political parties, and social  organizations, and the representatives meet at one place, it is  clear that this itself will be a historical opportunity to  provide a great turning point in the nation's reconciliation and  unity.    However, the South Korean authorities object even to  receiving our letter, which is filled with the patriotic will  for reunification. Where can a greater antinational and  antireunification act as this be found?    The South Korean authorities' unreasonable act leaves much  room to prove that traitor Kim Yong-sam's promise that priority  must be given to the nation and that he will whole-heartedly  concentrate on the nation's reconciliation and reunification, is  filled with falsehood and hypocrisy.    The new operation 5027, a plan to attack our republic, which  has been kept a secret by the South Korean puppets, has now been  made public, and they are showing moves to drag in much  murderous equipment, such as Patriot missiles from the United  States, and resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise.  This means that our nation must achieve great unity at this  time more than at any other time to prevent the danger of a  nuclear war.    In this kind of situation, our people must solve problems  facing the nation under the banner of great national unity and  from the principle of national independence. If this is to be  achieved, the will and demands of the 70 million people must all  focus on the great cause for the fatherland's reunification, and  private-level dialogue must be activated so that it can spread  to a pannational level.    Nevertheless, like the examples of preceding dictators, the  South Korean Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is insisting on a single  channel of dialogue as usual, is monopolizing reunification  dialogue, and is preventing the broad masses from participating  in the reunification dialogue from various aspects. Such  antidialogue and antireunification maneuvers by the South Korean  puppets will by no means be tolerated.    The South Korean puppets once again rejected our just  proposal. This once again clearly shows that they are in reality  the ones who have no interest in dialogue and reunification and  that they are splittists pursuing only confrontation and war.  Such an act betraying the nation by the South Korean  authorities can no longer be tolerated.    If the South Korean authorities continue to move toward the  road of antidialogue and antireunification while rejecting all  the Korean people's desire and will consistently demanding the  country's reunification, they will receive the people's severe  judgment without fail.</p>

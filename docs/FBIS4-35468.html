			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 May (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf, the head of Iraq's delegation to the  Non-Aligned conference met with Norodom Sira, the foreign  minister of Vietnam [name and title as received] here today.    Mr. al-Sahhaf indicated to the Vietnamese minister a shift  favoring Iraq in the UN Security Council. He also noted that  more permanent and nonpermanent members of the council, as well  as the international community, are demanding an end to the  sanctions. Al-Sahhaf further noted that Iraq was complying with  the obligations stipulated in Security Council resolutions.    Al-Sahhaf impressed on the Vietnamese minister the need for  the Council to honor its obligations to Iraq. He hoped that  when the council next reviews Iraq's compliance with the  Security Council resolutions, it will take a fair and clear-cut  stand leading to the lifting of the sanctions. The two  ministers also talked about relations between Iraq and Vietnam.    The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Cairo reports that  the  Vietnamese minister renewed his country's support for removing  the sanctions as a matter of urgency. The Vietnamese Government  and people, he said, view Iraq's performance under more than  three years of the sanctions with pride and admiration.    The two ministers also reviewed the agenda of the  Non-Aligned  conference, which opens tomorrow, both agreeing on the need for  the movement to be strengthened and its principles upheld.    Iraq's permanent Arab League delegate attended the session.</p>

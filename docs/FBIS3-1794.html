At a joint press conference at the White House, they said  the  two sides were committed to continuing to work for a resolution  of the 22-month ethnic war in the former Yugoslav republic.    Besides Bosnia, Clinton and Major also discussed the issues  concerning Russia, world trade, Northern Ireland and Hong Kong.    They agreed to bring forward to January 1, 1995, the start  date for implementation of the GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) agreement.    "We'll need to consult with other people to see if that's  practicable," Major said.    On Japan, they agreed to pressure Tokyo to further open its  markets to U.S. and European goods and services.    Northern Ireland had been a sticking point in U.S.-British  relations, the latest incident being Washington's issuance of  visa to leader of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, a  move angered London.    Major, however, stressed today he would rather look forward  and see how "we produce a solution to the Northern Ireland  problem."    "I'm not interested in looking back," Major said.    For his part, Clinton criticized as a great mistake to  "overstate the occasional disagreement and understate the  incredible depth and breadth of our shared interest and our  shared values."    The two leaders also discussed the Middle East peace process  and developments in South Africa.</p>

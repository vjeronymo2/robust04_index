			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WILMINGTON, HARBOR CITY PLAN WILL BE REVISED AGAIN;  </P> <P> L.A. PLANNERS DELAY ACTION AFTER HEARING  </P> <P> After listening for two hours to a wide range of complaints and comments, the  Los Angeles Planning Commission Thursday once again delayed action on a plan  that will shape the growth of Wilmington and Harbor City into the next century.  </P> <P> Instead, commissioners instructed the city planning staff to examine the issues  raised during Thursday's hearing and make further revisions in the proposed  Wilmington-Harbor City Community Plan.  </P> <P> The plan, with the new revisions, is scheduled to come back before the  commission for the third time on Aug. 24. Commission President William Luddy  said he hopes the commission will be able to adopt the plan at that time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Update 1970 Plan  </P> <P> The revised plan will update one that was written in the late 1960s and adopted  in 1970. The old plan left the two communities -- but Wilmington in particular  -- subject to a patchwork of development that has allowed factories and heavy  industry to crop up alongside single-family homes.  </P> <P> The new plan, which is designed to govern growth until the year 2010, tries to  correct that. But the clash between residents and industry was evident Thursday  in the comments of several dozen community leaders, property owners and  business people.  </P> <P> For example:  </P> <P> The plan proposes zoning designations that will create a buffer between auto  dismantling yards and nearby residential neighborhoods. Those dismantling yards  that fall within the buffer zone would be designated "nonconforming," meaning  they could continue to operate but would have to get special permission to  expand. The affected businesses are fighting the nonconforming designation.  </P> <P> A lawyer for Exxon pressed the commission to permit the Wilmington Oil Field to  remain classified as "non-urbanized." The new plan proposes that by Jan. 1,  2000, the oil field be designated "urbanized" -- a stricter classification  that, lawyer Gail Gordon said, would severely hamper Exxon's oil extraction  activities by forcing the company to cap some wells. "We think it's unrealistic  to recognize the viability of an oil field and then cut us down," she said.  </P> <P> Wilmington community leaders asked that a parcel at the foot of Avalon  Boulevard, where they are planning a waterfront development, be designated  solely for commercial uses. Under the proposed plan, only a small part of the  parcel would be zoned for commercial development. The remainder of the  property, which houses a tank farm belonging to the city Department of Water  and Power, would be zoned for heavy industry.  </P> <P> Residents want the tank farm eliminated eventually. "Everything in Wilmington  is industrial," community leader Gertrude Schwab complained at Thursday's  hearing. "Wilmington has always been, and still is, the poor stepchild of Los  Angeles."  </P> <P> In addition to striking a balance between residential and industrial uses, the  revised plan is intended to promote revitalization of Wilmington's downtown  business district, preserve open space, curb truck traffic and protect the  single-family character of Wilmington's neighborhoods.  </P> <P> On that last score, some residents have contended the plan does not go far  enough. Community activist JoAnn Wysocki, for example, recommended Thursday  that east Wilmington, which she said consists primarily of single-family homes,  be zoned R1, which allows single-family development only. The proposed plan  calls for the area to be zoned R2, allowing duplexes.  </P> <P> "We are asking, we are pleading, we are literally throwing ourselves on your  mercy to encourage, enhance and preserve the single-family nature of this  area," she told the commission.  </P> <P> It will now be up to the Planning Department staff to evaluate these  suggestions and respond to them, either by arguing against them or by altering  the plan to conform to them.  </P> <P> The lengthy plan -- which includes maps, population estimates, housing data and  zoning designations for every piece of property in the two harbor-area  communities -- has been inching its way through the city bureaucracy for the  past six years. Those familiar with it agree that most of the work is done and  that the upcoming revisions involve fine-tuning.  </P> <P> Despite the delays -- and despite predictions by some city officials that it  may be yet another year before the plan is adopted by the City Council and put  into place -- residents seemed pleased with the progress.  </P> <P> "I'm not frustrated," said Wysocki, "because every time we come to one of these  hearings we get a little bit more, and the city commissioners understand us a  little bit more."  </P></p>

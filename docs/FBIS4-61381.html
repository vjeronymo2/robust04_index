			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Anatoliy Shapovalov: "Broken Ties </F> Restored"]    [Text] Bishkek -- The talks between the parliamentarians  of Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] and the Russian Federation in Bishkek  have been crowned with the signing of an agreement.    The document, which meets international standards, contains  11 articles. But to describe it you only have to cite one  article: The parliaments will do everything to promote all forms  of development of relations between the two republics. In other  words the course elaborated by Askar Akayev and Boris Yeltsin  has met with powerful parliamentary support.    To judge by the situation which has taken shape, this is a  very noble aim. The Union has collapsed but relations between  Kirghizia and Russia have remained. The euphoria born of the  romance of sovereignization is abating. And with it the  illusions that the world would greet us with open arms. In both  Bishkek and Moscow there is a growing understanding of the fact  that no one will be able to replace long-standing partners,  Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Council,  stressed when the agreement was signed.    The agreement lays a good basis not only for restoring  Kirghiz-Russian relations but also for bringing them to a  qualitatively new level. Kirghizia now, and this is no longer a  secret, is renowned for its unique high-tech production  facilities, for instance for the artificial growing of crystals.  But the almost completed complexes are standing idle. To  resolve the problem what is needed above all is capital. The  parliamentarians suggest a way out: organizing in the first  half of June a meeting near Moscow between Kirghiz and Russian  entrepreneurs and bankers. Let them investigate the existing  situation, consider the matter together, and be convinced of how  advantageous it is to invest capital in a most unique production  facility. Who knows, perhaps the industrialists, bankers, and  financiers will decide to create a multinational company.    All these questions were the focus of attention of V.  Shumeyko's meetings with Kirghiz President A. Akayev and Prime  Minister A. Dzhumagulov.    In the opinion of M. Sherimkulov, chairman of the republic's  Supreme Council, Kirghizia and Russia have similar political and  economic systems. Relations built on a basis of parity are the  model. The main thing now is to ensure that the restored  contacts become strong.    The interparliamentary agreement is geared to a two-year  period. If when this period comes to an end there has been no  application from either side it will automatically be extended  through the year 2000.</p>

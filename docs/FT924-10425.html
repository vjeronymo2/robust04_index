			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Miyazawa warns of prolonged economic downturn in Japan THE JAPANESE economy is in the middle of a prolonged and severe downturn, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, warned yesterday, as the country's leading banks disclosed a 54 per cent rise in their non-performing loans. The economy, on the edge of outright recession, is facing 'dire straits', Mr Miyazawa told the Diet, the Japanese parliament, which reconvened yesterday. Meanwhile, the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic party is consumed by a power struggle, provoked by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal over illegal political contributions. With the full scale of the economic downturn still becoming apparent, the forces of recession and growth within the economy are finely balanced. The Ministry of Finance said the bad loans of the leading 21 banks rose to Y12,300bn (Pounds 62bn) in the six months to September from Y7.9bn in March. The banks responded by unveiling long-awaited plans for a body they will fund, which from next year will start the lengthy task of clearing up the bad loans. The joint body is designed to allow the banks to start writing off some of their losses by taking over their bad loans. Senior bankers acknowledge that the system is plagued by bad debts which will take years to sort out. The weakness of the banking system may limit the economy's capacity for growth. The momentum of the downturn was confirmed by sharp falls in half-year profits at a wide range of companies including retailers and heavy engineers, and losses at JVC, the leading consumer electronics manufacturer, and Japan Air Lines, the nation's top airline. A continued fall in job offers, a sharp drop in overtime last month and low growth of summer bonuses suggest that personal consumption will become increasingly depressed this autumn. Housing starts rallied in September with a 10.4 per cent rise, but the market remains deeply depressed with a 41 per cent fall in starts on the construction of condominiums. Recession is being avoided only by a series of government measures to pour money into the economy. The cabinet approved a supplementary budget, to be debated by the Diet, which will implement a Y10,700bn emergency economic package announced in August. There will also be a 10.8 per cent increase in a special Y40,000bn-a-year investment programme, which lies outside the budget itself, and a Y3,000bn-Y5,000bn increase in spending by local authorities.

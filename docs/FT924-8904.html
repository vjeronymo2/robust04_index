			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Watchdog bitten by both sides: A regulator caught in the coal battle crossfire PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, finds himself caught in the crossfire of the battle over coal, and he may not escape unscathed. If the harrying he received at a Commons inquiry last week is anything to go by, he is in for a rough time and could even, some observers speculate, be edged out of a job. MPs from both sides of the House accused him of dragging his feet, copping out and taking a blinkered view of his responsibilities. The clash exposed sharply conflicting views of the role of the regulator. Many MPs had hoped that Prof Littlechild, with his powerful position in the electricity industry, could provide a convenient solution to the coal crisis by forcing electricity generators to burn more coal or by cancelling their plans to build gas-fired power stations. But Prof Littlechild takes a different view. He has stuck doggedly to his position that his statutory responsibility is to protect the electricity consumer and not the coal industry. He has repeatedly stressed that his brief does not run to saving miners' jobs, let alone dictating where power stations should be built or what sort of fuel they should use. 'Responsibility for the closures lies with the secretary of state and British Coal,' he says simply. That was typical of the professor of commerce at Birmingham University who has headed Offer, the Office of Electricity Regulation, since it was formed in 1989. He is an outright free-marketeer who was selected for the job by the Thatcher government because of his belief that competition would foster the most efficient power industry. While he sympathises with those who would be hurt by the threatened pit closures, he does not intend to intervene. He does not believe that the Electricity Act, which lays out his responsibilities, authorises him to do so. People who know Prof Littlechild well do not doubt the firmness of his beliefs - which raises the questions of whether he has become an obstacle to a political solution to the coal crisis. Based in Birmingham, Prof Littlechild can afford to be remote from the political process. He has not even met Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who is grappling with the coal problem, though for some people this is a welcome sign of his independence. However, he is not totally insulated from politics. He has already said that he will bring forward an inquiry which he is conducting into the relative merits of gas and coal so that the results can be fed into Mr Heseltine's policy review. He has also appointed an assessor to see whether electricity generators are unfairly shutting down coal-fired stations. Prof Littlechild stands in the government's way in another sense. One possibility for boosting coal would be to delay the deregulation of the electricity industry and slow the growth of other fuels such as gas. But Prof Littlechild is not only personally committed to seeing the deregulation process through, he maintains that the Electricity Act obliges him to do so. So any change in the regulatory timetable would require a big shift in his position, or new legislation. In either case, he might well have to go. The government's mishandling of electricity privatisation and the resulting distortions in the power market have raised serious doubts about the value of his role. There are widespread complaints about rising prices, monopoly practices in the generating industry and exorbitant pay for electricity company executives. If Prof Littlechild has to be sacrificed on the altar of coal, it is hard to see who would run to his rescue. One idea that is gaining popularity among MPs is an Energy Commission to set energy policy and oversee the regulators. This would oblige the regulators to adhere to a government line rather than acting independently. 'It is clear that MPs would prefer a more interventionist approach,' says Mr John Wilson, utilities analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house. He believes that investors may be nervous about electricity shares legislation may be changed. Prof Littlechild is also unpopular with MPs because they think he is in effect making policy decisions which impinge on the lives of millions - in fact, usurping parliament's role. That may be so, but it is not necessarily something for which Prof Littlechild can be blamed. The job of electricity regulator is the result of the government's policy in the late 1980s to phase out state intervention in the energy industry and to appoint an independent figure to protect the consumer. Now, that arrangement has become inconvenient for Westminster. The government finds that it needs a policy to save coal, but the regulator says that is none of his affair.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow runs into losses again as bonds retreat Wall Street US stocks lost ground yesterday as the bond market retreated in the face of more evidence of an accelerating economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.55 lower at 3,854.63, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 2.61 to 462.24. But secondary indices were little changed: the Nasdaq composite eased just 0.66 to 759.35. Volume on the NYSE remained heavy, with 302m shares traded by the close. With equity investors braced for another boost in short-term interest rates, yesterday brought more evidence to support an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit. The Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes last month had climbed 9.7 per cent to an annual rate of 703,000 units, against a revised July rate of 644,000. It also issued an upward revision of its estimate of second-quarter growth to 4.1 per cent, from 3.8 per cent. The stronger than expected readings sent bond prices sliding and briefly pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government issue to its highest point of the year. With the prospect of a further rise in rates looming larger, concern over the outcome of US-Japanese trade negotiations was also growing. The collapse of the talks could lead the Clinton administration to follow through on a threat to impose sanctions on Tokyo. Against this backdrop, blue chips opened weaker and were quickly showing solid declines. Alcoa, which has outperformed the market in recent sessions, shed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 85 3/4 , while General Motors receded Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 3/4 . But Goodyear Tire improved Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 on an upgrading by PaineWebber. Alcatel Alsthom made an appearance at the top of the NYSE's most active list during the morning. ADRs in the diversified French group fell a further Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 18 1/2 after Wednesday's initial reaction to interim results well below expectations. In the technology sector, IBM was Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 69 1/2 . Compaq managed to close Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 32 3/8: earlier in the session, SG Warburg had announced that it was lowering its 1994 earnings estimate for the company, and the stock retreated in heavy trading. Storage Technology dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 3/4 after disclosing that EMC had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the company. USAir's common shares lost 25 per cent of their value, plummeting Dollars 1 to Dollars 4. The decline followed the airline's announcement that it would defer dividends on its series A preferred stock because of heavy operating losses. Canada Worries about the outlook for US inflation after the latest spate of economic data, combined with uncertainty ahead of today's deadline for a US trade deal with Japan, unhinged bond markets and produced slightly lower stock prices on the Toronto market. The TSE 300 composite index ended 10.43 points off at 4,362.05, with declines outnumbering rises by 412 to 299 after volume of 57.1m shares. Overall, 10 of the 14 sub-group indices were down, with consumer products, transportation and mining stocks posting the biggest falls, and merchandising and pipelines showing the best advances.</p>

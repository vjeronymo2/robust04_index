			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Industrial tribunal pregnancy hearing A PREGNANT shop assistant lost her job after complaining about a rule that banned sitting at work, an industrial tribunal heard yesterday. Ms Francilla Languedoe, 31, sold costume jewellery part-time for a franchise operation in Morley's department store in Brixton, south London. Ms Languedoe, who is claiming sexual discrimination and compensation for loss of earnings and injured feelings, was told not to come to work after she complained about the removal of a chair. Buckingham Retail area manageress Hazel England told the tribunal she had become concerned about the use of a chair in the jewellery section when sales dropped and thefts rose. The hearing was adjourned until May 18.</p>

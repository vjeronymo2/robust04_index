			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET REBELS ENJOY THEIR TITLE . . .  </P> <P> Behind the sanctimonious stance of the NCAA infractions committee, there seems  to be an arbitrarily punitive and perhaps vengeful motive pertaining to its  investigation of UNLV's basketball program.  </P> <P> Leaking damaging rumors about schools to the media before the competition of an  investigation is tantamount to lynching.  </P> <P> The NCAA has done so with UNLV, thereby disrupting its program and discouraging  athletes to join the school for fear of possible retributions by the NCAA.  </P> <P> Tarkanian should be accountable for any misdeed he perpetrates, but first he  should be proven guilty. It behooves the NCAA to exercise fairness in its own  practices.  </P> <P> ARMEN GOENJIAN, Long Beach  </P> <P>  Editor's note: Tarkanian was, indeed, found guilty of recruiting violations by  the NCAA in 1977, and UNLV was ordered to suspend him for two years. Tarkanian  took the case to court, where it dragged on for nearly 12 years before the  Supreme Court decided, in late 1988, that the NCAA had such a right. Recently,  Tarkanian and the NCAA settled out of court, but another possible recruiting  violation by Tarkanian has been under investigation by the NCAA since 1987.  </P> <P> </P></p>

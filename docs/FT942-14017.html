			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Pledge over female mutilation: World Bank and IMF win commitment by Burkina Faso In an unusual broadening of their role into social and cultural issues, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have won a commitment from the government of Burkina Faso to take steps to combat female genital mutilation. The commitment is included in Burkina Faso's policy framework paper, a set of medium-term economic policy priorities negotiated with the international financial institutions as the basis for receiving assistance loans. The practice of female genital mutilation, sometimes referred to as female circumcision, is widespread in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Besides ritually reinforcing the subordination of women, the mutilation brings severe risks of infection and starkly increases health risks in later life. World Health Organisation officials estimate that genital mutilation doubles the risk of death at childbirth and increases the risk of still-birth by three or four times. Besides the WHO, donor countries such as the US and France have sought to discourage the practice. The United Nations Human Rights Commission last month agreed to a special investigation into violence against women, but referred only obliquely to genital mutilation as 'the harmful effects of certain traditional or cultural practices.' Burkina Faso is in the middle of a radical economic adjustment programme begun in 1991 but intensified this year by the 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc agreed by members of the currency zone in January. The IMF last month agreed to lend the Burkina Faso government Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) from its enhanced structural adjustment facility, which provides subsidised loans for very poor countries. The adjustment programme contains a number of measures designed to alleviate the impact of the devaluation on some of Burkina Faso's most vulnerable population groups. They included steps to spread price increases for essential consumer goods such as kerosene and generic drugs over a six- to 12-month period, and an expansion of primary health and basic education services.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Employers question the pooled approach to pension provision IS THE UK government sufficiently imaginative in devising debt securities that investors really want? For an increasing portion of the pensions industry, the answer is no. Pension fund investment is aimed at meeting specific requirements far off into the future. Ideally, investments should grow in line with average earnings during an individual's lifetime and thereafter, broadly in line with inflation. Sadly, investment professionals note, there is nothing to provide the former, and the vehicle which provides the latter, in the form of index-linked gilts, still has many shortcomings. Individual ownership of one's pension appears to be the ideological underpinning of government policy. The old-fashioned pooled approach to pension provision, which guaranteed a percentage of final salary upon retirement, is increasingly being questioned by employers who say it is too costly. Moreover, the government is taking the line that such pools are open to abuse by employers and receive too-generous tax breaks. Thus, the UK appears headed in the direction of personal pensions and so-called money purchase pensions at the expense of final salary schemes. But even the most ardent supporters of these schemes will concede their greatest shortcoming: volatility. These vehicles simply do not provide the certainty of benefit which final salary schemes guarantee. The pooled approach of defined benefit schemes allows investment managers to spread risks and rewards over many people and across several generations. Money purchase and personal pensions simply build up at a rate roughly in line with stock markets. 'Consider two people whose retirement is separated by Black Monday of 1987,' said Mr Ron Spill, director of pensions at Legal and General. 'The difference in the value of their pensions is 20 per cent.' Moreover, because of the volatility in gilt yields, the monthly benefits which can be purchased for the same lump-sum annuity vary sharply even over relatively short periods. Mr Spill says that in January 1992, Pounds 1,000 would have purchased a benefit of Pounds 129 a month for a 65-year old. But by January of this year, the same Pounds 1,000 would only have bought Pounds 118 a month. Increasingly, the issue for life insurance companies which offer such products is how to devise an investment structure which limits volatility. Moreover, the Labour party has suggested it would like to require those who offer personal pensions to guarantee a minimum level of retirement benefit, regardless of investment performance. How can investment managers build in such a guarantee? Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable, argues that perhaps the problem is that the appropriate investment vehicles have not yet been designed for such schemes. 'The basic problem is the structure of the cash flow,' says Mr Ritchie. He says that perhaps the UK government needs to consider a new type of gilt. The sort he has in mind would effectively be a deep discount zero-coupon security purchased with a lump sum at say, a 40th birthday. This would accrue, say, at a spread above retail prices, up until the individual's 65th birthday. Only then would it begin paying cash, and at a rate roughly equal to RPI. The Institute for Policy Studies, the left-of-centre think-tank, in a paper to be issued later this week, will urge the government to consider a new type of investment security whose capital value would be linked to an index of national average earnings. Barring the advent of imaginative government bonds, investment managers try to limit the volatility in the value of a personal pension in the years immediately prior to retirement by gradually shifting out of higher-yielding equities and into fixed interest and cash. But Gartmore has tailored a product which begins making the switch some time before then. Its Lifeplan product invests 90 per cent of an individual's cash in equities up until the 40th birthday. Then over the next 25 years, moves progressively out of them and into fixed interest, with the switching process accelerating between the ages of 60 and 65.</p>

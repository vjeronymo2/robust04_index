			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 11, BNS -- The International Monetary  Fund on Friday [8 March] approved a USD 36 million preferential  loan to Lithuania under the so-called systemic transformation  facility, the IMF office in Vilnius said.    This is the second equal part of a credit that was approved  Oct. 22, 1993. Under the systematic transformation facility,  assistance is provided to post-communist countries encountering  balance of payments problems that mainly appear when a country  stops using government-controlled prices in trade. Lithuanian  Finance Ministry officials said the first part of the credit was  used for investment projects and energy needs.    Lithuania joined the IMF in April 1992 and has already  received around 123 million dollars from it. A number of  political forces in Lithuania criticize the government for the  country's increasing external debt, but Prime Minister Adolfas  Slezevicius rejects all criticism saying the per capita debt is  quite small and that the Lithuanian economy cannot be rebuilt  without foreign loans.    The IMF approved its first USD 77.6 million loan to  Lithuania  in the fall of 1992. The loan was given for six years and was  used to stabilize Lithuania's national currency.    Peter Cornelius, IMF representative in Lithuania, said  Lithuania has already used up possibilities to receive loans  under the systematic transformation facility. There is also a  28-million dollar stand-by credit that Lithuania may receive if  it successfully carries out its current economic policy  memorandum. Cornelius said all the necessary information about  the first quarter of this year should be available by mid-April  and Lithuania can expect the first quarter of the 28 million in  mid-May.    In its press release, the IMF said Lithuania aims at keeping  its financial deficit below one percent of the GDP, in part by  adopting an 18-percent value-added tax that comes into effect  May 1. The fund said the establishment of a currency board is  expected to help curb inflation, cut interest rates and to carry  out a strict fiscal policy.    The IMF loan supposedly served as one of the principal  arguments for adopting the litas reliability law that provides  for the establishement of a currency board and pegging the litas  to a foreign currency. The law came into effect April 1.    Discussing the economic situation in Lithuania, the IMF said  privatization, which has already covered around half of all  large and small enterprises, has been proceeding smoothly.  According to the press release, the government seeks to  accelerate the process of privatization by removing all  preferential treatment for employees and managers in the  privatization process, and by lifting restrictions on share  ownership in agricultural processing enterprises.    The report said the bankruptcy law is in force, although a  clear bankruptcy procedure is still absent. Discussing trade,  the IMF said the Lithuanian Government now plans to introduce a  uniform 10-percent import tariff.    As regards efforts to soften the effect of economic reforms  on social life, the IMF said the Lithuanian Government intends  to carry out a broad package of pension reforms on Jan. 1,1995,  including an increase in the retirement age.    The IMF said signs that the private sector in Lithuanian  flourishes "give grounds for cautious optimism that the recovery  is underway in Lithuania. The recovery remains fragile,  however, and the authorities must be vigilant in their efforts  to foster a stable and predictable environment for economic  activity if growth is to be sustained."</p>

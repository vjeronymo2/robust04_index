			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / City life continues to lose appeal A CONTINUING shift in the UK population from urban to outer suburban and rural areas was revealed in the first detailed results of last year's 10-yearly census, published yesterday by the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys. The fastest-growing region, East Anglia, saw a 7.3 per cent rise between 1981 and 1991, while population fell in all metropolitan conurbations such as London, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Last year's census was the first to ask a question about ethnic origin. While 94.5 per cent of the British population is white, people from ethnic minority backgrounds make up a quarter of the 2.5m population of inner London. More than 20 per cent of the population comprises children under 16, with the highest proportion in the north-west. The south-west has the largest proportion of retired people. A 'substantial number of people', consisting mainly of men in their 20s, was missed out of the census last year, the OPCS admitted. While it believes that census staff tracked down almost everyone aged 45 and above, estimates for men in their 20s suggest an under-enumeration rate of up to 10 per cent. There had been concern that some people would avoid completing census forms because they feared cross-checking of records to detect poll tax evasion. The OPCS says, however, that the scale of under-enumeration in the British census is similar to other recent censuses in Australia, Canada and the US. Exodus from inner cities continues, Page 5</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Easier Dow anticipates FOMC move Wall Street US share prices receded in sluggish trading yesterday as investors anticipated a change in monetary policy today, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 8.42 down at 3,760.29, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.72 at 461.23. Volume on the Big Board reached only 223m shares. The American SE composite dipped 0.38 to 443.32 but the Nasdaq composite added 1.28 at 732.89. Most equity investors were marking time ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. The policy- making arm of the Federal Reserve was expected to announce this year's fifth move to tighten credit conditions. That widely held view, based on a stream of fairly strong economic data over the past two weeks, was reinforced by yesterday's news on July industrial production and capacity utilisation. Both figures suggested that the Fed's previous rate increases had not slowed the economy sufficiently to delay a further tightening. Even though a rate increase was seen as a foregone conclusion, most investors were reluctant to take new positions. There was still uncertainty over how the bond market would react to any action by the Fed. A sharp downturn could spill over into equities. With such questions still unanswered, the market was generally static until the final hours of trading, when dealing in a few large cyclical stocks picked up. Caterpillar gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 106 1/4 , but International Paper dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 and Alcoa Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 77. As a result, an early rise in the Dow was eroded, and the index closed with a modest loss. HJ Heinz added a touch of spice to the mostly bland proceedings amid stepped-up speculation that it was ripe for takeover. The stock, however, ended Dollars  1/4 down on balance at Dollars 36 3/4 after opening Dollars 1 3/8 ahead. Ouaker Oats, another food company considered vulnerable, added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 76. On the Nasdaq market, Lotus Development stood out with a Dollars 3 climb to Dollars 45. Canada Toronto stocks tended to ease in quiet trade as most players held the sidelines ahead of today's US Federal Reserve policy committee meeting. That meeting is expected to result in a rate increase by the US Fed. The Bank of Canada's bank rate is also expected to rise today following six weeks of easing. The TSE 300 index ended 5.4 points off at 4,169.7, while declines outscored advances by 402 to 292 after volume of 32.9m shares valued at CDollars 399.7m. Nine of the 14 stock groups were lower but with none showing major swings. Future Shop, CDollars 1 up at CDollars 18 1/8 , said it will acquire the outstanding shares of Granada Canada for about CDollars 3m. Mexico Equities finished higher but off the day's peaks in a cautious advance ahead of next weekend's presidential election. The IPC index gained 13.74 at 2,651.5. Turnover was a light 70.8m shares. Analysts expect volume to stay low prior to the election.</p>

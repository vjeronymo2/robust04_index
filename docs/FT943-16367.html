			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Know your customer - Manufacturer Cumana nearly learnt the hard way about the dangers of guesswork By rights Cumana, a maker of floppy disc drives for the BBC Acorn microcomputer, should not have survived the 1980s. Rarely since slide rules were swept aside by pocket calculators has technological change dealt such a sudden blow to a company's fortunes. Sales of Cumana's biggest-selling and most profitable product fell by about two thirds in 1991 as demand for the Acorn microcomputers requiring floppy disc drives fell sharply. Toy and fashion designers may be used to handling such violent swings in demand. But how do manufacturing companies survive such a sudden loss of market, particularly if they lack the resources to back a risky change of direction? And how can companies anticipate and avoid some of the pitfalls? Cumana's fall followed a decade in which the BBC Acorn had been one of the more successful early mass market computers. Launched in the early 1980s, the Acorn quickly took off in primary and secondary schools, where it was ideal for the rigours of the classroom. Guildford-based Cumana designed and built peripheral disc drives and became a near-monopoly supplier. It was a small company in the right place at the right time. Even after Acorn collapsed in the mid-1980s and was rescued by Olivetti of Italy, sales of its microcomputers remained firm. Cumana saw that its dependence on Acorn made it vulnerable but it continued to enjoy healthy margins. Then, processor technology changed quickly. The old 8-bit technology was fast replaced by 32-bit processors in computers, where typically floppy disc drives were integrated into the machine. Sales of Cumana's floppy disc drives fell dramatically. 'In round figures, sales fell from Pounds 3m of the company's Pounds 4m to less than Pounds 1m in one year,' says John Simnett, Cumana's managing director who arrived in 1991. 'Our customers were moving on to more recent systems that did not require our type of product - mainly the Acorn Archimedes which did not require external (floppy) disc drives.' Adding to Cumana's problems, the company had also made two unfortunate diversifications. It had tried to reduce its dependence on Acorn by making other products; first there were drives for Atari - profitable until Atari was hit by rival Commodore - and latterly for Omega Computers, where demand was strong but margins were continuously squeezed. However, Cumana also started developing newer technologies, such as early CD-Rom and magneto-optical disc drives. The problem was that its customers - the schools - were not interested. 'Cumana's history can be summed up as going into a product too early,' admits Don Bolton, the company's founder and largest shareholder who has since withdrawn from an executive role. 'The company never linked the development to customer requirements,' says Simnett. 'It was on a suicide path. It was building up an awful lot of stock.' While anticipating where markets are going is essential, racing too far ahead of customer needs is dangerous. It is also a common mistake, according to Liz Clarke, consultant and author of a book on change management. 'There is a danger in not listening to your customers and getting over-excited with the technology,' she says. Next, Cumana moved away from its known customer base in the schools and started trying to sell CD-Rom drives to utilities and to brewers who wanted a way of updating games in their pubs. 'We pushed away from traditional customers - educational budgets were constrained - and tried to get into utilities and some leisure customers, but we did it as recession took hold,' says Bolton. Cumana's rehabilitation since Simnett's arrival has been partly successful. Sales have recovered to Pounds 4.7m, two manufacturing sites have been combined and the company is working closer than ever with Acorn. The transition to a new product line required some radical surgery. The first thing Simnett did was write off nearly Pounds 500,000 of stock that was obsolete or not wanted by customers. He then had to deal with the bank, which had extended facilities of Pounds 650,000. Almost overnight the bank saw the balance sheet slashed to nothing as the stock was written off, at the same time as the main market was collapsing and the company was still groping for a new direction. Ten percentage points disappeared from gross margins in Simnett's first year as the company cranked up production of Omega disc drives to keep the skeleton workforce employed. And, not surprisingly, Simnett and Bolton had to put up personal guarantees and cash to support the company's banking facilities. Simnett then gathered most of the remaining staff together in a room with flip charts to brainstorm how the company could go forward. After considering pursuing interactive video, magneto-optical drives, karaoke drives, and even general distribution, Cumana decided to focus on the handling of stored data through CD-Rom technology. It also determined to get back in touch with its customers. Distributors were dropped, which not only improved margins but just as importantly helped Cumana gain a clearer idea of what customers wanted. 'Guessing where the market is going is one thing we have tried to avoid like the plague,' says Simnett. The strategy had an early payoff when Cumana won part of a Pounds 500,000 government contract to supply CD-Rom drives to primary schools. 'It was the first contract defining who the players were going to be. There was Toshiba, Sony, Hitachi and little Cumana,' Simnett says. The company is not entirely off the hook. It remains highly dependent on one customer, Acorn, and one product, the CD-Rom drive. While it is developing a networked multimedia product and hopes to do OEM manufacture, the fact remains that it could be significantly damaged if Acorn were to decide to fit its own CD-Rom drives. But Simnett feels Cumana is now better equipped to avoid past mistakes. The company will now embark on product development only on the back of orders from a known customer, he says. And any technological development has to be firmly backed by demand from an existing market rather than based on their estimates of what the market might one day become.</p>

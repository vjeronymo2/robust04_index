			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Russian vodka deal for IDV International Distillers &amp; Vintners, Grand Metropolitan's drinks division, has secured exclusive distribution rights for Stolichnaya Russian vodka in the US and Mexico from PepsiCo. The deal, terms of which have not been disclosed, gives IDV swift, if partial, compensation for the loss of Absolut, the Swedish-owned vodka brand. It signals a period of intense competition in the market. Distribution rights for Absolut, which IDV built into the leading imported premium vodka in the US with annual sales of about 3m cases, are being transferred next month to Seagram, the North American drinks group. Vin &amp; Sprit, Absolut's owner, is believed to have made the switch because of growing doubts about its future development alongside IDV's Smirnoff - the world's best-selling vodka - and Popov brands. Analysts estimated the move would cost IDV about Pounds 40m a year in lost profits, though the company has been compensated for the premature end to its contract which had been due to run until September. Stolichnaya is the second largest imported premium vodka in the US with sales, according to Impact International, the industry monitor, of about 1m cases a year. Several other brands of Russian vodka - Stolichnaya Cristall, Russkaya, Priviet, and the flavoured products, Limonaya, Pertsovka and Okhotnichaya - are included in the deal, which is subject to approval by US regulatory authorities. PepsiCo has held the US rights for Stolichnaya from Russia's Sojuzplodoimport since 1973 and will continue to do so on IDV's behalf at least until December 2000. The brands will be handled in the US by Carillon Importers, an IDV subsidiary, and in Mexico by Premium Brands.</p>

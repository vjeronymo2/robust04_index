			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Cut expected in electricity bills ELECTRICITY bills in England and Wales should be reduced slightly from April as a result of a cut in the Fossil Fuel Levy. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, announced yesterday that the levy on bills would be cut from 11 per cent to 10 per cent. Offer, the office of electricity regulation, estimates that the cut should reduce the typical household electricity bill by Pounds 2.42 a year. The levy, introduced in 1990, compensates electricity companies for having to buy a portion of their power from more expensive sources such as nuclear and renewables. In 1992-93 the levy will raise about Pounds 1.3bn, virtually all of which goes to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator. The levy is due to be phased out by 1998. Prof Littlechild said the cut represented a downward trend in support for the nuclear power industry. He also said that in future a larger proportion of the levy would be paid to renewables such as wind power. A new public inquiry into British Nuclear Fuels' reprocessing plant at Sellafield could cost BNF Pounds 100m, Mr John Guinness, BNF chairman, said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. He said the extra cost would be borne by the taxpayer because BNF was government-owned. He added that each week's delay in starting BNF's Thorp reprocessing plant was costing Pounds 2m in related costs and lost profit. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said that part of Thorp's funding was illegal because the government had broken EC rules by failing to notify the European Commission of Pounds 2.5bn given to BNF.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec directors stand down Hi-Tec Sports, the sports shoe and leisure wear company, has announced the resignation of its two non-executive directors, only weeks after the two men joined. Hi-Tec said Sir Michael Edwardes, former chairman of British Leyland, and Mr Richard Fenhalls, chief executive of Henry Ansbacher, were resigning immediately. No reason for their departure was given, and neither could be reached for comment. However, it is understood they disagreed with the way Hi-Tec was being managed, especially since the company announced an interim loss of Pounds 2.84m last October. Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, was unavailable for comment.</p>

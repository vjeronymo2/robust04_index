It was created  on March 13, 1989, one month after the withdrawal of our forces  from Afghanistan.    Today the AVU is a very large organization that brings  together not only Afghan war veterans but also veterans of other  local conflicts. The union operates in all the ex-Soviet  republics (unofficially in Estonia). It has more than 1,200  primary organizations and 287 regional and 15 republic divisions  with a total of 350,000 members.    The AVU engages in extensive charity work to provide  assistance to disabled Afghan veterans and to the families of  fallen comrades. It has currently spent more than $500,000 to  buy wheelchairs abroad. Two years ago the union began providing  financial assistance to the families of fallen comrades in  amounts of 100,000 to 300,000 rubles. Almost 3,000 production  and commercial enterprises currently operate under the union's  aegis. To mark its fifth anniversary the AVU has organized a new  charity operation for which it has allocated more than two  billion rubles.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Global tourism climbs by 3.8% The number of international tourist arrivals worldwide last year was about 500m, a 3.8 per cent increase over 1992, according to the World Tourism Organisation. International tourism receipts rose 9 per cent to Dollars 324bn (Pounds 219bn). The East Asian and Pacific region recorded the highest level of growth last year, with arrivals up 11.8 per cent to 68.5m. Tourist receipts in the region rose 15.2 per cent to Dollars 52.6bn. The Americas recorded the second highest growth, with arrivals up 5.6 per cent to 106.5m and receipts up 14.3 per cent to Dollars 95.5bn. Travel within North America fell as a result of difficult economic conditions but tourists from Europe compensated for the shortfall. The Caribbean and Latin America had a successful year, the organisation said. Europe remained the world's largest tourist destination, with 296.5m arrivals last year and receipts of Dollars 162.6bn. This represented growth over 1992 of 2.1 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively. Northern European countries had a difficult year, while eastern and central European destinations recorded strong growth. The eastern Mediterranean held up well. Growth in tourism to Africa was also limited, with arrivals up 2 per cent to 17.9m. Tourism receipts were healthier, however, growing 8.7 per cent to Dollars 6.4bn. The losers last year were the Middle East and south Asia. The organisation said the Middle East had failed to maintain its post-Gulf war promise, with arrivals down 8.4 per cent to 7.2m. Receipts fell 7.4 per cent to Dollars 4.9bn. In south Asia, arrivals fell by 1.4 per cent to 3.4m, with receipts down 2.9 per cent to Dollars 2bn. The organisation said it expected international tourist arrivals to rise to 661m by 2000 and to 937m by 2010.</p>

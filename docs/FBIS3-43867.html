			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "African News" program] </F>   [Text] There has been a sharp criticism in Zimbabwe over  President Mugabe's decision to pardon two men convicted of  shooting a prominent opposition leader Patrick Kumbai in 1985.  The pardon was granted shortly after the supreme court  dismissed an appeal by the two men, one of whom was a senior  intelligence officer. Zimbabwe's leading human rights  organization said the pardon suggested that the shooting in  which Mr. Kumbai was badly wounded had been authorized at a high  level. It said there would also be grave implications for the  relationship between the government and judiciary. Mr. Mugabe  has not explained his decision.</p>

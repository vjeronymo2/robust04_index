			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: MCA managers plan to discuss buy-out Mr Lew Wasserman, veteran chairman of MCA, the Los Angeles-based entertainment group, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, its president, are expected at a meeting today to raise the subject of taking control of MCA by buying a majority stake from Matsushita, its Japanese parent. Top managers from MCA are due to meet in Hawaii with representatives of Matsushita, the Japanese electronics company that acquired MCA four years ago. Matushita yesterday denied it would consider ceding control of MCA, which owns Geffen Records and Columbia Pictures, the studio behind a string of recent recent box office hits, including The Flintstones and Jurassic Park. Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita, said his group had not received notification of a bid for MCA. However, he admitted to a Japanese newspaper that there had been differences between MCA and Matsushita over the former's investment plans. The MCA management has made no secret of its frustration with Matsushita's apparent reluctance to allow the company to participate in the acquisitions and joint ventures sweeping across the entertainment industry. Since buying MCA for Dollars 6.1bn in 1990, Matsushita is reported to have blocked several proposed investments, including a plan to buy a stake in the NBC television network and an earlier bid to take control of Virgin Records. Faced with the aggressive expansion of rivals, such as Time Warner and Viacom, Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg are said to have become anxious to free MCA from Matsushita's control. The two, both of whom made substantial sums from the Matsushita acquisition, are believed to have discussed the possibility of a buy-back with external investors. They are also understood to have had discussions with the three Hollywood heavyweights - Mr David Geffen, the music magnate, Mr Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning film director, and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt Disney's movie studios - who last week announced plans to launch a new entertainment group.</p>

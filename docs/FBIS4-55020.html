			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third in a series of three unattributed articles: "The </F> Image of Party Programs 3."]    [Text] To make our readers' job easier in making a  decision, our editorial staff has put a set of questions to the  parties that were able to set up national lists. Our questions:    1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or  welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four  years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to  even at the cost of other problems?    2. What are the three larger-than-average economic,  political, social, or moral burdens facing society or some  strata of society in the next four years, burdens connected with  or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not  accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the  background compared with other similar problems?  <H5>  National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] </H5>   1-2. The NDSZ's economic policy is based on a fundamentally  different assessment of the situation, economic philosophy, and  value system than that of the liberal (or in other words,  neo-conservative) economists and the parties influenced by them.  Therefore, its questions and answers are also different from the  currently widespread liberal logic. In our view, rather than  the fact that we previously had a socialist system in Hungary,  the basic problem is that the driving forces of extensive growth  that uses an increasing amount of raw materials and energy have  been exhausted in the developed countries (both in the West and  the East), and from a consumer society, the (developed part of  the) world is entering a sustaining society that also takes the  requirements of environmental protection into consideration.  This transition goes with major economic commotions, and the  withdrawal of resources from the developing and former socialist  countries (including Hungary) through international credit links  is part of this process. Therefore, for Hungary and for other  former socialist countries, the establishment of some kind of a  capitalist system similar to 18th century England cannot bring a  solution. Instead, we have to find the economic mechanism and  social structure that correspond to our national circumstances  and traditions, and which meet the requirements of the 21st  century. As part of this, the NDSZ:    a. Wishes to break with the liberal politics that exposes  Hungary's markets to the significantly more developed  multinational companies, and it offers a policy of selective  market protection against it;    b. It also wishes to break with the liberal principle that  wishes to counteract the inflationary pressure of free prices  with high interest rates. Instead, the NDSZ advocates a tight  price control of basic consumer goods and raw materials, to  reduce inflation this way;    c. The above two changes make it possible to reduce the  interest rates, and to replace the restrictive financial policy  typical of the past few years with a policy of economic  stimulation.    2. Through its above economic policy, the NDSZ mainly wishes  to alleviate the burdens affecting the broad masses of people  and to improve their position. In the interest of this, it pays  less attention to satisfying the needs of rich people. For us,  it is more important that the average citizen be able to receive  affordable and satisfactory quality goods, say, within a Central  and East European cooperation, than to have all products of the  world for sale (for those, of course, who have the money for  them). For us, the just distribution of the national assets is  more important than the increase of the proportion of private  property at all costs. We do not believe the tale that can only  imagine a country's economic prosperity on the basis of selfish  private interests, accompanied by corruption. We do not believe  that private assets are more efficient than anything else; for  us, all forms of property are equal in rank. We do not believe  that, for the country's economic prosperity, we first have to  establish an immensely rich private owner social strata, and we  accept all the tensions arising from the fact that our views are  contrary to the now popular liberal, or in other words,  neo-conservative, views.  <H5>  Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] </H5>   1. The reduction of people's burdens and, at the same time,  reducing the parasite elite to obedience;    -- the establishment of equality of opportunity applying to  the whole life;    -- climbing out of the debt trap.    2. We pay less attention to those unemployed people who do  not wish to work; however, we do all we can for those who do  want to work;    -- we do not cry for the III/III department members  dismissed  from the Radio;    -- we are indifferent to the fate of the workers' militia  and  leather jackets [members of plainclothes police in the 1950's].  <H5>  Green Party of Hungary </H5>   1-2. The most important political tasks:    The suppression of the extreme liberal political trends in  Hungary in the interest of preventing the further proliferation  of fascist and racist strife. Deceiving the domestic ethnic and  national minorities with their political manifestations and  hypocrisy, and with the help of their instigator organizations  and provocations, they try to implant in them the feeling of  defenselessness, being persecuted, and being in a  disadvantageous position.    Due to being organized on a racial basis, they already now  create antagonistic feelings in citizens, which will continue to  increase in the future because of their unlimited greed for  power, and this can lead to conflicts. As they have control  over some of the media, we have to conduct enlightening  propaganda to prevent their deception.    We strive for a neutral position, and want to withdraw the  request for NATO membership. We had enough of foreign  dependence. After the Soviet Union, the military forces of  Western Europe would occupy our country. We would be a  deployment area, and a buffer zone between the West and the  East. We would again be the losers. Together with Switzerland  and Austria, we could very well exist as a third small neutral  country. Whatever conflicts we might have, NATO would not  defend us anyway, it is not in its interest, because we do not  have oil wells like Kuwait which was a U.S. interest. NATO has  many times shown its "inability" to act in the case of conflicts  outside its sphere of interest. Instead, we should strive for  good-neighborly relations with the neighboring countries, and  with Russia mainly, we should establish total conciliation and  cooperation because it will soon have a determining role in  Europe.  <H5>  Workers' Party </H5>   1. A correct analysis of the situation is a decisive  condition of socially acceptable politics and of good  governmental economic policy. In addition to the inherited  difficulties and the world economic situation, the economic  policy of the past four years was the decisive factor in the  deterioration of the economic situation. The forced  establishment of the economic and social bases of capitalist  transformation did not result in an increased economic  productivity. Today, the Hungarian economy is in a worse  situation than in 1989-1990. All this has serious social  consequences: 1 million unemployed people, the deteriorating  status of whole social groups, and mass impoverishment.    The political institutions do not reflect society's real  interest conditions. Today, a sicker economy and sharper  conflicts are the main characteristics of the crisis.    According to the Workers' Party, two remedies will have to  be  applied together. On one hand, we need a new economic policy.  On the other, through important political changes, we have to  release the economy from the confines of the forced politics of  the change of the regime.    The country's situation can be significantly improved in  four  to five years. Our economic policy is based on three pillars.    Instead of the current restrictive politics, we want  development, more investments, higher consumption, lower  interest rates, smaller and predictable taxes, and more  workplaces. Secondly, we want an economic environment that is  based on the equality of opportunity of the various forms of  ownership. Thirdly, the state has to take on an active role in  the economy, in ownership, in defining the main proportions, and  in financing some strategic areas.    We believe that the points of breakthrough in the next  period  can be created by establishing some leading branches in the  economy. We want to develop the construction industry through a  large-scale program to build 70-80,000 flats. With a more  favorable economic policy, the light industries would be  suitable for creating many new workplaces. In our view, the  development of telecommunications and road building are  important leading branches of industry. We need a state concept  to lay the basis of some industries' future development, for  example food industry and engineering.    The area of human investments is another explicitly  important  area from the economic and social points of view. Financing  education means financing the future. It is impermissible to  exclude whole social strata from acquiring modern education.  With a disheveled health system, Hungarian people will not just  have less knowledge to enter the 21st century than their  colleagues in Western Europe, they will also have a worse state  of health and less stamina. Therefore, in our view, it is  essential to ensure free medical provision as a basic right of  citizens. Among the welfare measures, we consider it important  to keep the current age limits of retirement, and that  guarantees should protect the value of pensions against  inflation. It is very important from an economic and political  point of view for the new parliament to change the law on  housing.    The Workers' Party believes that only a policy adjusted to  the needs, or at least to the tolerance level, of the workers  who make up the majority of society is able to fight the serious  and contradictory factors of the crisis. We cannot demand  society's various segments to confront each other.    With an active use of the current points of breakthrough,  unemployment can be reduced to below 5 percent in five to six  years' time, and inflation below 10 percent. We cannot continue  the forced consolidation of the capitalist conditions and the  governmental policy to expand it. Therefore, in the view of the  Workers' Party, it is harmful to force privatization at all  costs, without a concept of ownership. The current  privatization has to be stopped. It is more important to  operate the existing mixed economy efficiently. Any kind of  privatization should only be done with social control and the  workers' participation.    In our view, it is a basic requirement to end the policy  against agriculture and the cooperatives. Security has to be  established in land ownership, production, and selling.  Compensation has to be ended. It is impossible to build  economic solutions on the basis of moral categories.    It is important to rid ourselves of our illusions as regards  Western Europe. Social security can only be based on an  economic development that leads to a breakthrough. Naturally,  to achieve this, we need resources. In addition to creating a  supportive tax and credit system, we must significantly reduce  the state expenditure and stop bureaucratic overspending. At  the same time, we have to agree with the West that if it does  not want the Hungarian economy to collapse and a domestic  political explosion to ensue then they should cancel some of our  $24 billion debts or the repayment of the interest.    In the view of the Workers' Party, overcoming the crisis  requires fundamental political changes. We support a social  agreement or pact. However, this cannot be restricted to the  negotiations of the employee organizations, employers, and  government. A feasible social pact can only be based on a  parliament that expresses society's multifold interests and  asserts them through the laws.  <H5>  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] </H5>   1. The SZDSZ emphasizes three main tasks of economic and  social policy. The first one is establishing the conditions for  economic growth. Economic growth is not a matter of decision --  when the necessary conditions were missing, forced growth  created difficult situations on many occasions -- it requires  the establishment of various defined conditions.    The new government has to establish an atmosphere of  stability and predictability by forming the conditions for  clear-cut economic conditions. The increase of the budget  deficit can be stopped and inflation can be curbed through a  cheap state, namely by ruthlessly reducing public expenditure.  An overall social agreement can protect employers from  unpredictable wage demands and employees and pensioners from  their income losing value. Reduced taxes and allowances on  company tax and wage costs can stimulate the enterprises and the  establishment of new workplaces. The stabilization of the bank  system and the establishment of new money market institutions  can improve the entrepreneurs' conditions to have access to more  capital. The acceleration of privatization contributes to an  early consolidation of the decaying large enterprises. A fast  settlement of the land ownership will create stable conditions  for farming and agriculture.    Continuing the Hungarian economy's international integration  is another major goal of economic policy. Export orientation,  foreign economic opening, and an increasing presence of foreign  capital are the keys to economic success throughout the world.  This is the way we can have access to the indispensable  additional capital, the way modern technology can become  widespread in our economy, and the way Hungarian enterprises can  acquire markets. We have to accept the costs of this, namely  the discontinuation of uncompetitive domestic enterprises and  product cultures.    Preventing the division of society is the third priority.  Certain elementary social guarantees have to be ensured for  everyone. Therefore, compulsory health insurance has to be  maintained so that all citizens can have access to health care.  Basically, the system of family supplement also has to be  maintained, a mininum basic pension has to be ensured for  everyone, and we have to ensure that the increase of pensions  does not lag behind the wage increases.    2. Economic change and the stimulation of enterprises make  it unavoidable for the differentiation of incomes which is  unusual in Hungary to be maintained in the coming years. The  unfavorable effects of this have to be reduced by welfare  guarantees but cannot completely be eliminated. Economic  considerations demand that, in the course of privatization,  people who can contribute to restoring the former state  properties with their own capital and management expertise  should first become proprietors. However, this inevitably leads  to a smaller segment of society becoming owners and to  significant differences arising in assets.    The economic crisis, the assertion of the rights of freedom,  and the opening of the borders together caused the sudden  increase of the crime rate. We know that totalitarian  dictatorships normally have better public order than free  countries. However, rather than reinstating the total control  of a police state or closing the borders, we wish to act against  this by strengthening the police force, defending the injured  parties, and modernizing the prison conditions. It has to be  seen that public order and security can only be improved  gradually; this is the cost of freedom.    Something else the SZDSZ government will not solve in the  coming four years: It will not place all those people who have  in recent years been building the SZDSZ's organizations into  well-paid positions or supervisory committees, thus making them  satisfied. In personnel decision, we consider expertise and  management skills as guidelines rather than party membership.  Not all honest and brave Free Democrat activists are experts of  banking or theater life.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, Jan 17, SPA -- The Saudi newspapers  commented today editorially on a number of topics. [passage  omitted]    On Geneva talks held between the Syrian and U.S. Presidents  yesterday, 'UKAZ, which is also published in Jeddah, said the  meeting had earned a great importance in the view of the fact  that Syrian and the U.S. could play a crucial role in  realization of comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East.    The Arab stand is based on the international legitimacy and  the resolutions issued by the organization of the United Nations  as well as on the principle of land in return of peace, said the  paper.    The daily criticized the endeavors of Israel to obtain Arab  recognition and establishment of diplomatic and economic  relations with the Arab countries before its withdrawal from the  Arab territories.    The U.S. in its capacity as the sole big power in the world  and the sponsor of the peace process in the Middle East is  expected to put pressure on Israel until it withdraws from the  Arab territories and recognizes the legitimate Arab rights.    On the same topic Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH said the summit  conference of Geneva would enable Washington to activate its  role as a mediator.    The daily underscored the importance of U.S. political  pressure on Israel so as to pave the way for the settlement of  the Arab- Israel dispute.    For its part Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH hoped that  al-Asad-Clinton talks would pave the way for a real peace in the  Middle East.    The Arabs believe that the U.S. is the most qualified  country  to play an effective and decisive role in the peace process,  said the paper.    It is hoped that President al-Asad has successfully conveyed  to Clinton the Arab demands for realization of peace, added the  daily.    Ad Dammam-based AL-YA'UM deplored the Israeli maneuvers to  escape the implementation of the international resolutions.    Through its maneuvers Israel is trying to obtain further  Arab  concessions, said the daily. It has become very clear that  Israel will never positively respond to the peace efforts  without effective pressure from a country like the U.S., it  added. [passage omitted]</p>

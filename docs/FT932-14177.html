			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Chairman says Travelers poised for sharp upturn TRAVELERS, the US compo-site insurer in which Primerica holds a 27 per cent stake, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 195m for the first three months of 1993, although the figure was boosted by the inclusion of Dollars 123m of realised investment gains. In the first quarter of 1992, Travelers made after-tax profits of Dollars 224m. However, this figure was also distorted, by Dollars 2m of realised investment losses and a one-off Dollars 170m gain related to accounting rule changes. The Hartford-based insurer said yesterday that operating profits in the first quarter were Dollars 72m, against Dollars 56m. Mr Edward Budd, chairman, suggested the results left the group 'on target for achieving a sharp improvement in our operating performance in 1993'. He noted that the group's property-casualty, managed care and employee benefits, and financial services divisions all reported an increase in profits, year-on-year. The advance in the property-casualty division, moreover, came in spite of higher catastrophe losses - up from Dollars 7m to Dollars 21m after tax - resulting from the severe winter storms. Travelers - badly hit by a large, souring portfolio of property-related investments - said the underperforming mortgage loan and real estate portfolio remained at Dollars 5.1bn, unchanged from the end-1992 figure. Travelers shares gained Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 30 1/8 in New York yesterday.</p>

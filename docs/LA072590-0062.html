			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH SHOPPERS GET SLICE OF THE UPPER CRUST  </P> <P> The ultimate upper-crust loaf has gone on sale in England, an organic bread  named after Prince Charles' Highgrove estate and containing wheat organically  grown at his home farm.  </P> <P> The Tesco supermarket chain began selling Wholemeal Highgrove for $1.07 a loaf  on Tuesday as part of a 12-week trial at 23 stores in southeast England.  </P> <P> The bread is made from wheat grown without pesticides at Charles' Home Farm at  Highgrove, 100 miles west of London, as well as with Canadian organic wheat.  </P> <P> Charles agreed to the product to promote organic farming. Last year, he  denounced what he called the excessive use of chemicals in modern agriculture,  and in 1985, he partly converted Home Farm to organic methods.  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Fears for jobs begin to recede FEAR OF unemployment is beginning to recede, according to a survey released yesterday. It shows mild optimism about a slow recovery later this year. Business Strategies and Gallup, the research organisations, say a balance of 31 per cent of individuals were worried in the second quarter about losing their jobs, against 41 per cent in the first quarter. The survey also reports a slow improvement in general consumer sentiment about growth. Only two regions - north-west England and Wales - expect the economy to worsen in the next 12 months. The results support indications that a hesitant upturn may be starting about now, although people's willingness to take on debts and increase spending remains low. The organisations say consumer spending - which accounts for two thirds of UK output - will show a slight increase in the second quarter against the first quarter. Even though that implies a year-on-year fall of 0.3 per cent, the quarterly increase, if borne out by official statistics, would be the first since early 1990. In the second quarter, a balance of 11 per cent of people in the survey  - the balance being the difference between those expressing positive and those giving negative views - thought the economy would improve over the next year. Between January and March this year, the survey shows a balance of 4 per cent taking a pessimistic outlook. Among individual households, a balance of 5 per cent said their own financial state would improve in the next year, while in the first quarter the balance was zero. The survey is based on questions posed each month in the second quarter to 2,000 people around Britain. Regional Consumer Survey. Quarterly. Business Strategies, 10 Kendrick Mews, London SW7 3HG. Pounds 125 annual subscription. THE NUMBER of companies going into receivership fell 30 per cent in the second quarter of this year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, Diane Summers writes. There were 948 recorded receiverships, compared to 1,362 in the first three months of the year. However, the overall level of receiverships has continued to grow during the past six months. There were 2,310 in the first half of the year compared with 1,976 in the second half of last year.</p>

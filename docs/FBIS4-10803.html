			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] This week, the president of the lower chamber,  Robert Monde, will have to set about a series of consultations  with the various sectors of national life on the political  crisis the country is experiencing. This was confirmed through a  news release dated 15 April and released by Emmanuel Reyme,  first secretary of the Chamber of Deputies. The great bodies of  the state, the employers' associations, the protesters, and the  various political groups will be consulted on a solution to the  political problem. At around 1100 this morning, the office of  the lower chamber will meet with the Haitian Chamber of Commerce  and Industry before beginning consultations with the employers'  associations this afternoon at 1500, according to the timetable  sent to the media by Reyme.    The public was previously informed of this during the  address  to the nation on 13 April. In his message, Monde noted the  institutional vacuum created by the refusal of the president in  exile to appoint a new prime minister. [passage omitted]    Let us recall that the political parties gathered under the  Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization called Monde's  initiative maneuvers and a return to the starting point.  According to [Hubert] de Ronceray, Monde is desperately trying  to exhume the null and void Governors island Agreement.    For his part, National Assembly President Firmin Jean-Louis  keenly deplored the fact that Vice President Monde had  unilaterally decided to address a message to the nation and to  initiate consultations without bothering to send him the  outlines.</p>

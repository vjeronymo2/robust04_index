			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The release of an old  man, An Hak-sop, and the repatriation of old men Kim In-so and  Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea,  were urged strongly in different countries.    The secretary general of the Uganda-DPRK Friendship  Association, the general secretary of the Ugandan Union of  railway workers and the president of Chambogo Polytechnical  College of Uganda in a letter sent in joint name to the  International Red Cross on May 20, recalling that the South  Korean authorities have kept An Hak-sop behind bars for 40 odd  years and put him to all sorts of tortures for the mere reason  that he refused to recant his belief in communism, called upon  the organization to put strong pressure on the South Korean  authorities to set him free.    Noting that the inhumanitarian act of not repatriating still  now Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who should have been returned to  their hometowns under the Korean Armistice Agreement deserves a  strong denunciation, the letter strongly demanded their  repatriation to the northern half of Korea.    Chairman of the Human Rights Committee of Nepal Budacharya  Sakiya in his letters to the World Human Rights Committee and  the South Korean authorities said Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan  should be repatriated at an earlier date so that they may enjoy  a happy life with their families and relatives for the rest of  their life.    The Nepalese intellectuals' forum for solidarity with the  Korean people in its letters to the South Korean "president" and  to the"president of the Red Cross" of South Korea on May 23 and  24 said the South Korean authorities' refusal to send back the  old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan contravenes the 1907 Hague  Convention, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Korean Armistice  Agreement. It urged their unconditional and immediate  repatriation.</p>

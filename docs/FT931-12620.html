			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Restoring faith in a banking system - Japan's CCPC will tackle the industry's problems ON ARRIVING at work, staff at the banks' new self-help organisation will be forcefully reminded of the property collapse that triggered Japan's banking crisis. The offices are on the top floor of a half-empty building in an area of Tokyo which during the 'bubble' years of the late 1980s was a thriving business district. Formally established yesterday, the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), as the loan buying organisation is known, will open its doors on Monday to financial institutions and their non-performing loans. But the opening has been rushed and staff have had little time to prepare for the task of restoring confidence in the banking system. In defending the organisation against criticism that it is little more than a paper company, Japanese banking officials argue the CCPC is 'a genuine attempt to meet our problems head on'. However, the two executives and 22 staff of the CCPC will handle only a small portion of the estimated Y50,000bn (Dollars 405.5bn) in non-performing loans which weigh heavily on he banking system and the Japanese economy. The CCPC's first task will be to enable Japanese banks to write-off a part of their property exposure. If the banks bring in their bad loans before a February 5 deadline, there will be enough time to assess the collateral and name a buying price for the loan credit, allowing the institution to declare, for tax purposes, a loss at the close of the financial year on March 31. A second function of the CCPC is to establish a floor under property prices, which have fallen about 40 per cent over the past two years. After collecting the prices of the property collateral, which will be valued by independent assessors, the CCPC will either release details of individual deals or produce an aggregate index to try to stimulate the property market. The Federation of Bankers' Associations estimates Y500bn in non-performing loans will be handled in the first year of the organisation's life, expected to be 10 years. The federation insists this will alleviate the bad-loan burden, which officially rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn over the six months to end-September for the 21 leading Japanese banks. There is no doubt the CCPC, through its paper shuffling, will speed tax write-offs, but doubts remain about its ability to revive the property market or the banking system. Stronger banks will benefit most, as each of the 162 member-institutions will have to provide the CCPC with the funds to buy its own non-performing loans. Under tax laws, a write-off can only be made if an institution can prove it has lost money, generally through the sale of the collateral. By providing an independent valuation and, technically, 'buying' the loan at market value, the CCPC will enable banks to book a loss, even though the deal is done with its own money. The finance ministry has indicated these write-offs will be accepted, but has apparently indicated that banks should exercise self-restraint, as tax revenues are declining and the budget deficit is widening. There will also be pressure on the independent property valuers hired by the CCPC, as the higher the valuation of the property collateral, the lower the tax write-off and the higher the apparent floor under property prices. But Mr Masaaki Tanaka, senior manager of the corporate planning division at Mitsubishi Bank, which has played the leading role in establishing the CCPC, said the valuers must be objective in their estimates, otherwise their reputation would be harmed. Mr Shinichiro Goto, president of the CCPC and a former senior managing director at Mitsubishi Bank, said specialist housing loan companies may be eligible for help after they devise restructuring plans. He insisted the banking industry would look after its own, and not require direct government assistance. However, troubled Japanese regional banks are already receiving assistance from the Bank of Japan, which has increased its lending at the official discount rate of 3.25 per cent, allowing ailing regional institutions and their commercial bank backers to fund restructuring programmes. The self-funding character is a point of honour for the banks, as is the independence of the appraisal committee. In assessing prices, the committee will not only value the land collateral, but will examine the assets of any guarantors and review the company's cash-flow and earnings potential. From beginning to end, the bank which made the initial loan will be held responsible. When the property collateral is finally sold, it will be forced to book another loss if the amount was less than the CCPC appraised value. And, if at the end of the CCPC's life the property is unsold, the same bank will be responsible for finding a buyer.</p>

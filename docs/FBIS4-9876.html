			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in  Havana that the tour he begins today through five South American  countries will allow Cuba to advocate [word indistinct] in the  area, and for the coming Ibero-American Summit to be held in  Cartagena, Colombia. During a news conference at Havana's Jose  Martin Airport, Robaina said Latin America and the Caribbean  constitute priorities for Cuban foreign policy. Asked about the  possibility of Cuba's eventual reintegration into the OAS,  Robaina noted that the country awaits the OAS decision on this  because, he emphasized, we cannot knock on the door of a place  from which we were arbitrarily removed.    Robaina attributed underhanded intentions to the White House  decision to exclude Cuba from the so-called Americas Summit  convened by President William Clinton. Robaina's tour will  include Uruguay, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and Paraguay.</p>

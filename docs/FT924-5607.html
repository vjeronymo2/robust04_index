			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Ireland's poll promises a coalition conundrum THERE was brisk voting in Ireland's general election yesterday, but the process of deciding on a new government will be anything but brisk. The outcome of the poll will be known by tomorrow, but with no party expected to win outright, and uncertainty over how voters will cast their transfer votes under Ireland's single transferable vote system, it could be weeks before a new coalition is settled. The biggest uncertainty centres on the prospects for the Labour party. In opinion polls, Labour has been running neck-and-neck with Fianna Fail in Dublin, with more than 30 per cent each, while Labour has 22 per cent in the country as a whole. Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, is preferred by 38 per cent as next prime minister, far ahead of any other party leader, suggesting that many non-Labour voters will use their second and subsequent preferences for the party. Ireland has three- or five-member constituencies. In a three-seat constituency, a candidate requires more than 25 per cent of the vote to obtain a seat, while in a five-seat constituency 16.7 per cent of the vote is required. Under the single transferable vote system, candidates who fail to get the minimum number of votes to obtain a seat are successively eliminated and have their votes transferred to other candidates according to the voters' preference indicated on the ballot paper. Estimates put Labour with at least 23 seats, well up from its present 16. If there is a strong transfer vote to Labour, though, it could win more than 30 seats, putting Mr Spring in a very powerful position to determine the shape of a coalition. Fianna Fail is expected to lose five to seven seats, leaving it with around 70, while Fine Gael may also drop several seats to around 50. A total of 83 seats are needed to form a majority government. Policy and personality clashes will make the piecing together of a coalition very difficult. Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have ruled out a coalition together. On policy issues Fianna Fail and Labour share the greatest common ground, but Mr Spring has effectively ruled out such a coalition while Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, remains leader. The so-called 'rainbow coalition' of Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats, proposed by Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, would face serious strains over taxation and public spending. Mr Spring has also said that he wants to share the leadership if he enters a coalition with either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael, a demand ruled out by the other party leaders.</p>

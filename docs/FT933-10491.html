			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Bright outlook for work in Scotland UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland should continue to be lower than for the UK as a whole for the rest of this year and for 1994, although Scotland's rate of economic growth is likely to fall behind that of the UK. This is the view of the Scottish Economic Bulletin, a Scottish Office publication, which bases its opinion on the consensus of independent economic forecasters. Scotland's unemployment rate has been below that of the UK since January last year, a situation believed to be unprecedented since the 1920s. In June this year Scottish seasonally adjusted unemployment was 9.6 per cent compared with the UK rate of 10.4 per cent, and was lower than that of all UK regions except East Anglia and the east Midlands. The bulletin says that the relatively low rate of unemployment in Scotland reflects the severity of the recession in the south of England compared with the northern regions, including Scotland. It says that all independent forecasters except Cambridge Econometrics expect Scottish GDP growth to be equal to or below the UK's this year and in 1994. They expect the south of England to recover from recession faster than Scotland as the fall in house prices ends, while Scotland may also be affected by a drop in North Sea oil investment.

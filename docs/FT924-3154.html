			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sage maintains growth record with 33% advance SAGE GROUP, a Newcastle-based supplier of accounting software and stationery, finished the year slightly ahead of analysts' expectations, recording profits before tax of Pounds 8.85m, up 33 per cent on last year's Pounds 6.64m. Sage has now shown significant growth in revenues and pre-tax profits each year since 1988. The share price yesterday improved 21p to 455p. The company also announced the acquisition of Yorkshire Business Forms for an initial Pounds 1.05m, made up of Pounds 525,000 cash and a similar sum in new ordinary shares. Additional payments to a maximum of Pounds 2.95m will be paid over two years dependant on net profits in the period. Up to half the deferred payment may be made in shares. Turnover rose 36 per cent to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 20m) in the year ended September 30, of which Pounds 11.1m came from US operations. Earnings per share rose 21 per cent to 30.9p (25.5p) and the total dividend is raised 12 per cent to 9.02p (8.05p) via a final of 6p. Cash balances rose sharply to close at Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 1.2m) but have now been reduced by the purchase of Remote Control International in California, Ciel in France and Yorkshire Business Forms. The company remains strongly cash-generative. During the year Sage decided to discontinue MainLan, its US operation which specialises in networking software - losses amounted to Pounds 400,000 of which Pounds 250,000 were closure costs. Sage will continue to market MainLan in the UK where it has proved successful. DacEasy, a US accounting software company acquired two years ago, seems to be proving its worth with operating profits of Pounds 2.2m on sales of Pounds 10.2m. COMMENT Sage's strength and the secret of its ability to generate cash is its extensive customer list in the US and UK, It makes what it terms 'annuity' sales to these customers - upgrades and new versions of software packages and stationery. Abandoning the MainLan disaster in the US has removed one of the few downsides to Sage's progress. Others are a risk of a decline in UK packaged software prices to US levels and an over-ambitious acquisition strategy. Sage's management, however, has to date proved level headed - DacEasy, for example, is beginning to deliver its full potential. A rash of new products suggests that analysts' expectations of Pounds 10.9m pre-tax for 1993, giving an undemanding prospective p/e of about 12, will not be disappointed.</p>

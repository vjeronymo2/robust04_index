			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the first interim final rule changed the minimum size requirements for several varieties of peaches packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for peaches specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii), and (a)(5)(iii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column 2 of both Table I for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and Table 2 for late-season peach varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PCC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity relationships for these peach varieties, and the consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. The first interim final rule was designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh peaches consistent with expected crop and market conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revised handling requirements for California nectarines and peaches, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule finalizes the revised handling requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches consistent with expected crop and market conditions, and will help ensure that all shipments of these fruits made each season will continue to meet acceptable handling requirements established under each of these orders. This rule will also help the California nectarine and peach industries continue to provide fruit desired by consumers. This rule is designed to maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees, and other information, it is found that the finalization, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 916  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Nectarines, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 917  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Peaches, Pears, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Parts 916 and 917 are amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 916_NECTARINES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

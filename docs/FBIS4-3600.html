			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Gao Yan, Governor of Jilin Province, delivered at </F> the provincial meeting on launching the activities of  "transforming mechanism and improving management, skills, and  efficiency," on 1 April, entitled: "Extensively Launching the  Activities of `Transforming Mechanism and Improving Management,  Skills, and Efficiency,' and Fulfilling All 1994 Industrial  Economic Tasks"]    [Excerpts] Fellow comrades:    This meeting is being convened according to the decision of  the provincial government. Major tasks of this meeting are to  mobilize the entire industrial front of the province to  extensively launch the activities of "transforming mechanism and  improving management, skills, and efficiency," further implement  the targets concerning the provincial industrial economy of this  year, and make arrangements for the production in the second  quarter of this year. Successfully holding this meeting is of  positive and promoting significance in implementing in an even  better manner the guidelines of the second session of the eighth  National People's Congress, in submitting to and facilitating  the overall task of "seizing the favorable opportunities to  deepen reform, open still wider to the outside world, promote  development, and maintain stability," and in comprehensively  fulfilling the goal of pushing the economy onto a new stage this  year.  <H5>  1. On the Current Provincial Economic Situation </H5>   In the first quarter of this year, the province's situation  in economic operation was, in general, normal, and new headway  was made based on the high-speed increase of last year. The  situation in the countryside was very good. The bumper grain  harvest and the increased purchasing prices of grain and cooking  oil last year mobilized the initiative of peasants in growing  grain. As a result, the funds and materials prepared for spring  plowing were relatively sufficient. The prepared chemical  fertilizers reached 2.8 million standard tonnes, accounting for  68 percent of the total demand, of which, 2.4 million standard  tonnes have already been delivered to the hands of peasants.  This year, 150 million kg of seeds are needed, and 140 million  kg has already been delivered to peasants, accounting for 92  percent of the total demand. Affected by market demand, the  structure of the cropping industry was readjusted. Local  financial revenues of the province increased by a relatively  large margin. Revenues in January and February totaled 520  million yuan, an increase of 82.4 percent over the corresponding  period last year, of which, revenues from industrial and  commercial taxes amounted to 430 million yuan, an increase of  44.5 percent. Financial situation was relatively stable. Saving  deposits of urban and rural residents increased by a large  margin. In the first two months of this year, savings deposits  of urban and rural residents increased by 4.05 billion yuan, an  increase of 10.4 percent, or 2.18 billion yuan more than the  increased amount in the corresponding period last year. Of this  amount, bank savings deposits increased by 3.11 billion yuan, an  increase of 10.1 percent, or 1.75 billion yuan more than the  increased amount of the corresponding period last year, a record  high. Foreign economic relations and trade continued to keep  the trend of rapid development. In January and February, export  volume totaled $240 million, an increase of 50.6 percent over  the corresponding period last year. Of this, the barter trade  volume was $43.58 million, an increase of 480 percent. Since  the beginning of this year, the province has newly approved 303  foreign-invested enterprises, with the value of contracted  foreign funds reaching $233 million. Sales on market were  relatively brisk. In the first two months of this year, the  total volume of retail sales of commodities was 5.51 billion  yuan, an increase of 17 percent over the corresponding period  last year.    In the first quarter of this year, industry in the  provincial  economic operation increased slowly. Major problems facing  industry were: First, the increase margin of industrial  production was relatively small. From January to February,  output value of the industry at or above the township level was  9.355 billion yuan, an increase of 1.6 percent only over the  corresponding period last year. Of this, output value of heavy  industry increased by 3.8 percent, that of light industry  declined by 2.7 percent, that of state-owned enterprises dropped  by 5.3 percent; that of nonstate-owned enterprises increased by  30 percent; and that of large- and medium-sized enterprises  increased by 1.5 percent. Sales value realized by enterprises  amounted to 10.65 billion yuan, a decline of 1.8 percent from  the corresponding period last year; and marketing rate of  enterprises was 85.7 percent, a decrease of 4.4 percentage  points from the corresponding period last year. In January and  February, the national industry increased by 18.2 percent, while  the increase in the provincial industry was 16.6 percentage  points lower than the national level. In March, the growth rate  of the production of the province's industry at or above the  township level was enhanced. It is estimated that from January  to March this year, the increase margin of industry at or above  the township reached 3.1 percent. However, this margin lagged  far behind the goal of effecting a 15-percent  increase.    Second, the economic results were not ideal  enough. In the first two months of this year, the state-owned  budgetary industrial enterprises registered only a 1.1- percent  increase in profits; the money-losing budgetary enterprises  suffered 264 million yuan of deficits, an increase of 330  percent over the same period of last year; and 60.4 percent of  the budgetary state-owned industrial enterprises suffered  deficits. After striking a balance between profits and  deficits, the state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises  across the province changed their situation from creating 110  million yuan of profits in 1993 to suffering 150 million yuan of  losses. Increasingly more enterprises partially or completely  suspended their production. According to the statistics  compiled by the end of February, of the 4,930 enterprises at or  above the county and district levels in the province, 19.5  percent partially or entirely suspended their operation. There  emerges a tendency that the scale of entire or partial  suspension of operation has been expanded from small-sized  enterprises to large- and medium-sized ones.    There were many factors for causing the changes in the  province's industrial production situation from fast development  in 1993 to low-speed increase in the first three months of this  year and for creating the bigger fluctuation. Viewing the major  environment, we know that the state stresses the necessity to  control the aggregate credits and the scale of investment in  fixed assets in order to control inflation, alleviate the  "bottle-neck" restrictions, and maintain a sustained, fast, and  sound development of the national economy. Our province lays  particular stress on the industrial structure. The state-owned  enterprises account for a large proportion. So, we are rather  poor in suiting the market changes. The implementation of the  "general rules for financial affairs of enterprises and the  business accounting standards" as well as such state major  reform measures as the new tax system and the unified foreign  exchange rate is the necessary step for speeding up the setup of  the socialist market economic system. However, some new  problems have been brought to enterprises. That is, some  enterprises have the factors for increasing taxes and reducing  profits and undertake heavier burdens. According to the  statistics compiled through the survey on 98 budgetary  enterprises of 12 industrial bureaus in Changchun city, through  implementation of the "general rules and standards," these  enterprises are expected to reduce 190 million yuan of profits  in the first half of this year, and have to pay another 130  million yuan of taxes this year due to the increase in tax rates  and the changes in the categories of taxes. The implementation  of the unified foreign exchange rate has results in the increase  in the value added taxes of imported vehicle parts. Thus, the  production cost of each Audi sedan car of the Changchun No. 1  Vehicle Manufacturing Plant increases by 28,000 yuan. After  implementation of the new tax system, the Jilin carbon plant and  the Jilin paper-making mill will hand over to higher levels  23.36 million yuan of taxes annually. Due to the increase in  taxes, some enterprises that used to make small profits will  suffer profits.    Viewing the overall situation of the province, we know that  there were two direct reasons for causing the declines in  industrial production in the first quarter of this year: First,  since the beginning of this year, the large enterprises and key  trades, that gave a stimulus to the increase in the province's  industrial production last year, have lowered their production  growth rate. When compared the first quarter of this year with  the same period of last year, the production growth rates of  such large enterprises as the No. 1 vehicle manufacturing plant,  the Jilin ferroalloy plant, the Jilin paper-making plant, and  the Qianguo oil refinery were reduced in varying degrees; and  those of medical, sugar refining, and metallurgical trades were  reduced by a big margin. Second, the working funds for  industrial production were in short supply. Although more  capital was put into circulation, the enterprises used a  considerable number of funds to pay taxes, electricity charges,  debts, and wages retroactively; and only a small amount of money  were directly used in production. Therefore, from the beginning  of this year, the enterprises were generally short of funds.  According to the calculation by the provincial economic and  trade commission, this year, 8.29 billion yuan of working funds  should be added for industrial production but only 4.7 billion  yuan can be supplied and 3.59 billion yuan are in short supply.  The main reasons for causing the strain on capital are  insufficient input, the increasingly higher occupation of  capital by enterprises, and the increasingly heavier debt  chains. According to the statistics compiled by the people's  bank, the industrial credits in the first two months of this  year only increased by 46 million yuan, a drop of 120 million  yuan from the same period of last year. As of the end of  February, the 1,248 enterprises with industrial and commercial  bank accounts had 24.51 billion yuan of funds tied up by  finished products, goods shipped in transit, and receivable and  advanced payment for goods, an increase of 820 million yuan over  the figure at the beginning of the year. Enterprises were  linked up with one another with the debt chains involving 31  billion yuan. Due to the bigger deficiency in capital and the  excessive more capital occupied, many enterprises are unable to  normally organize production.    The current economic situation shows that to  comprehensively fulfill the various tasks for promoting Jilin's  economy to a new height this year and to safeguard political and  social stability, we should ensure the attainment of three  targets as defined by the provincial government earlier this  year, namely a 12-percent increase in gross domestic product, a  15-percent increase in industrial output value, and the price  rise kept within 10 percent. Industry is the key to fulfillment  of these three targets. We may say that industry is where the  priority, difficulty, potential, and hope lie. A large part of  Jilin's economic growth and revenue come from industry. We plan  to increase this year's industrial output value by 15 percent  and will strive for an 18- percent increase, and we will  increase the profit-tax rate of funds by 2 percentage points.  These two indicators will be the major criteria for judging  Jilin's endeavor to promote the economy to a new height.  Industry is the sector affected most by the measures that the  state has drawn up and is drawing up for the reform of the  financial and tax, banking, foreign exchange, price, and  investment systems. To achieve rapid and healthy development in  industrial production, we should do a good job in helping the  enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially  resume production and provide for themselves in addition to  making a number of key enterprises successful. This has a  direct bearing on social stability. Therefore, making this  year's industrial economy successful is at once an arduous  economic task and a major political task. Leaders at all levels  must approach this issue from the perspective of safeguarding  the basic principles and general task for the work of the entire  party and entire country this year and correctly handle the  relationship between reform, development, and stability. Since  the beginning of this year, cities and the autonomous prefecture  as well as economic departments and departments in charge of  industries have exerted great efforts to organize industrial  production under rather difficult conditions, and they have  scored some achievements. We should play up the achievements,  continue to work hard in unity, change the current passive  situation in industrial production as soon as possible, promote  industry, and facilitate sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development in the province to provide a solid economic  foundation for the smooth progress of reform and for maintaining  political and social stability.  <H5>  2. Regard the Activities of "Transforming Mechanism and </H5> Improving Management, Skills, and Efficiency" as the Theme of  This Year's Industrial Work    The State Economic and Trade Commission decided to carry out  the activities of "transforming mechanism and improving  management, skills, and efficiency" among all the enterprises in  the country beginning this year. This represents an important  measure to respond to the central authorities' call for  establishing the modern enterprise system and for new ideas for  economic development and also is the road enterprises should  take in the new situation of deepening reform. In early March,  the State Economic and Trade Commission again conducted further  study and made arrangements at the national enterprise  management forum held in Zhuzhou. The activities have changed  the past practice of dealing with mechanisms, management, and  efficiency separately and brought to light the internal  relationship between the mechanisms, management, skills, and  efficiency of enterprises. Related to the establishment of  enterprises' position as the major participators in market  competition and establishment of the modern enterprise system,  the activities constitute a basic project for establishing the  socialist market economy system and are in total conformity to  Jilin's reality. We should carry out the activities among all  the enterprises in the province and regard the activities as the  theme of the endeavor to organize Jilin's industrial economy.    We should note that the activities have a very important  immediate significance in Jilin's endeavors of deepening  enterprise reform, enhancing the vigor of large- and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, relying on scientific and  technological advance, adjusting the product mix, and improving  economic efficiency. Jilin's state-owned enterprises are faced  with the common problems of sluggish transformation of the  operating mechanism, outdated technology and equipment,  low-level management, and heavy debts. In the past, we  invigorated enterprises, to a very large extent, by granting  them more autonomy, allowing them to share more profits, and  implementing supporting policies. Following the in-depth  development of the economic reform, the focus of enterprise  reform has been shifted from policy adjustment characterized by  tax reduction and more profit retention to system innovation  aimed at establishing the modern enterprise system. It can be  said that reform has entered a period for tackling the most  difficult problems and the arduous task of establishing the  modern enterprise system, with the focus on reform of property  right, has been put forward. Under such conditions, the way for  state-owned enterprises, especially competitive enterprises, to  survive and develop lies in deepening reform, transforming the  operating mechanism, and participating in the market competition  by relying on their own efforts. Poor economic efficiency is  the conspicuous contradiction restricting Jilin's faster  industrial development. Our profit-tax rate of funds was 3.3  percentage points lower than the national average last year, and  factors leading to enterprises' increase of expenses and  decrease of profits will increase due to the implementation of  the several major reform measures this year. To improve the  economic returns of industry, we should strengthen enterprise  management, tap the potential of enterprises, improve their  quality, reduce their material consumption, and raise their  efficiency. To promote the economy to a new height this year,  the basic measure is still to invigorate enterprises. The  activities of "transforming mechanism and improving management,  skills, and efficiency" will facilitate enterprises' reform and  development and speed up their march toward the market economy.  We should pay close attention to this theme and use it to lead  the various work of enterprises so as to fulfill the tasks for  promoting industry to a new height this year. [passage omitted]  <H5>  3. Go All Out To Organize Well the Industrial Production for </H5> the Second Quarter of This Year    The second quarter is the golden season for industrial  production. In view of the underproduction in the first  quarter, the second quarter is the key to a better growth rate  and efficiency in industrial production in the first half of  this year. The general demand is to uplift spirit, organize  meticulously, and mobilize forces from all quarters to promote  industrial production. We should pay attention to funds, which  constitute the key link; help the enterprises which have  suspended production totally or partially, especially large- and  medium-sized ones, start up production; explore and address the  new contradictions and new problems we encounter in the process  of deepening reform; and ensure a two-digit growth rate in  industry in the first half of this year and better efficiency in  second quarter than in the first quarter.    First, we should adopt every means possible to collect and  enliven the circulation of funds. Funds are the most  conspicuous problem which arouses the strongest dissatisfaction.  Whether the industrial production of the second quarter of this  year can be promoted is decided, to a certain extent, by how the  problem of funds is solved. The following are the current  priorities. 1) We should pay attention to collecting funds. We  should maintain the good trend in the increase of bank savings  that emerged in the first quarter and strive to increase urban  and rural savings deposits to overfulfill the task of increase  in bank savings deposits for the first half of this year.  Meanwhile, we should collect funds from various channels, such  as inter-bank lending, introduction of foreign capital, issuance  of bonds and securities, and other direct or indirect  money-lending methods. We should further strengthen contacts  with the head offices of the various specialized banks of the  state and do more work to win state support.    2) We should  grasp fund enlivenment. The target set in this regard is to  have the industrial enterprises throughout the province release  1.2 billion yuan from enlivening the irrational occupation of  three funds. Various cities, autonomous prefecture, and  departments concerned should further break down the target;  fulfill the target to every enterprise; and integrate fund  enlivenment with bank loans. Loans lent to enterprises that  have fulfilled the target will not be withdrawn and those that  have not fulfilled the target will no longer receive new loans.  Financial and banking departments should help enterprises  handle their left-over debts, do a good job in adjusting the  equipment set aside and conducting mortgage and auction for  tangible assets, and actively clear up the idle accounts and  loans as well as the "debt chain" among them so as to promote  the fund circulation to enter a benign cycle. The provincial  economic and trade commission and banks should cooperate each  other, do a good job in fund management, optimize the  orientation of investments, and ensure the limited funds to be  put to best use.    Second, a good job should be done in boosting the large  enterprises that are influencing the province's economic  situation. The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises  have occupied an important position in the national economy of  the province and made important and great contributions over the  past few years to the province's reform, development, and social  stability. The rapid growth scored by the industrial  enterprises throughout the province last year and the somewhat  of improvement in their economic results chiefly depended on the  impetus given by large enterprises, including the Changchun No.1  Motor Vehicle Plant and the Tonghua Iron and Steel Plant. The  low growth of industrial production across the province in the  first quarter this year was also, to a certain degree, due to  the fluctuation of production in the large enterprises, also  including the motor vehicle and iron and steel plants. By  judging from the whole situation in the economic development  strategy, Jilin Province requires the vigorous fostering of  collectively-owned and township enterprises; "three types of  foreign-funded" enterprises; and privately and  individually-owned enterprises. These new growing points of the  economy may upgrade the proportion of non-state-owned  enterprises in the national economy. However, the decisive  position occupied by large and medium-sized enterprises in  economic development and the pillar industrial business formed  by these enterprises, which is with the No.1 motor vehicle plant  and the Jilin chemical industrial company as the mainstay,  cannot be replaced by other economic sectors and industries.  Therefore, successfully boosting the large and medium- sized  enterprises always represents a focal point of the province's  work. [passage omitted]    Third, we should actively do a good job in encouraging the  production-suspension-or-semi suspension enterprises to fully  restore their production. Present prominent factors that are  affecting the social stability include commodity prices and  these production-suspension enterprises. The province's  increased scale of retail prices scored in January this year was  10.7 percent calculated in term of new accounting standard and  that in February was 17.3 percent. Although the increased scale  of prices is lower than the national average level, it is still  too high. By no means should we lower our guard in this regard.  [passage omitted] In dealing with the production suspension or  semi suspension of enterprises, we should have in principle  every level be responsible for the work. Problems belonging to  the level should be resolved by units at the level. According  to the different conditions of these production-suspension  enterprises, we should conduct classified guidance. As for the  enterprises whose products enjoy good sale and that have  encountered production suspension or semi suspension just  because of fund shortage, we should help them restore their  production. With the agreement of departments concerned, we may  allow these production-suspension enterprises covered by the  local tax revenue plan to be the first group of restoring their  production by postponing paying the taxes of various categories.  Banks should allow these enterprises to preferentially use the  debt and loan repayments to buy raw materials and to  retroactively pay their staff members and workers. Governments  at all levels should raise some funds specially for these  production-suspension enterprises to restore their production.  They should integrate their investments with the output of  enterprises and use the funds by circulating them. These  production-suspension enterprises should extensively open more  avenues, organize their staff members and workers to provide for  and help themselves by engaging in production, and find out a  way out by opening markets. The leading personnel of these  enterprises should set an example in work and lead their staff  members and workers to wage arduous struggles and to commonly  tide over the difficulty. The leading cadres of all  money-losing enterprises are not allowed to buy sedans and  marketable houses. [passage omitted]</p>

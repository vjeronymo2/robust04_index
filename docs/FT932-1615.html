			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / 2% limit on water bill rises urged OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday called for rises in water bills to be held to about 2 per cent a year in line with likely rises in household income. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'Escalating price increases must stop.' He added: 'A continuing increase in prices, well above the rate of inflation, will not be acceptable to customers.' Ofwat's report for the year to March, published yesterday, showed that customer complaints to its regional committees rose by 39 per cent last year to 14,795. Of these, 62 per cent were about rising prices and other problems with bills. The sharp annual rises in bills are being caused by the industry's modernisation, costing about Pounds 45bn, which is required by new UK and European environmental rules. Water suppliers, Page 26</p>

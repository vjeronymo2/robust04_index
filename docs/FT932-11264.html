			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Observer: Italy's latest inside job Stand up Antonio Fazio, the new governor of the Bank of Italy, who succeeds Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's new prime minister, as the eighth governor in the bank's 100-year history. Age and experience appear to have counted in Fazio's favour over the two other internal candidates, Lamberto Dini, currently the bank's number two, and Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, its deputy director general. Fazio, 57, was the most senior of the threesome, in terms of length of service at the bank, where he has worked all his life, notably on the research side, as chief economist. By contrast, both Dini and Padoa Schioppa have spent periods outside its walls. Dini worked for 17 years at the International Monetary Fund, while Padoa Schioppa has spent some time at the European Commission in Brussels. However, Fazio's star only started rising at a relatively late stage in the race - especially after suggestions that Dini's powerful political connections might count against him rather than in his favour. Given the current pace of political change in Italy, knowing the right people in politics is no longer such an easy game to play. In time, the bank may appoint a successor to Fazio as deputy director general alongside Padoa Schioppa. However, there is no lack of talented insiders and little sign of a desire to stir the pot.</p>

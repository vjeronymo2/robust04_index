			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FESTIVAL IN BRIEF  </P> <P> Box-Office Update:  </P> <P> Seventeen shows are sold out and festival officials now expect to surpass the  60% capacity originally predicted for 230 ticketed programs.  </P> <P> Sold out are all five performances of "The Temptation of St. Anthony" by New  York's Wooster Group, four Bread and Puppet Theater shows, three evening shows  by performance artist Rachel Rosenthal, three of eight "Jupiter 35" programs by  Los Angeles Poverty Department, and opening nights of "The Legend of the Water  Flame" and performance artist Guillermo Gomez Pena.  </P> <P> An additional Rosenthal matinee has been added Sept. 16 at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> All $40 tickets for Royal Court Dancers' program at the Arboretum as well as  the Cambodians' performances there are sold out.  </P> <P> Festival officials have upped projected ticket revenue figures from $600,000 to  $650,000.  </P> <P> Dial Some Familiar Voices  </P> <P> The days of Orson Welles and radio dramas like "This Is Your FBI," "The  Shadow," "Sam Spade," "Dragnet" and "The Life of Riley" have been brought back  to life on the CARS telephone hot line: (213) 688-ARTS. The computer-operated  service began Sunday, listing events in both the curated festival and the  connected Open Festival by date, discipline and, in some cases, by geography.  Organizers hope that it will provide a form of entertainment besides merely  giving lists through the voices of such notable old-time radio stars as Les  Tremayne (a veteran of some 30,000 radio programs), Parley Bear (Chester in  "Gunsmoke"), Robert Rockwell (Philip Boynton in "Our Miss Brooks") and Vance  Colvig (the original Bozo the Clown); other recognizable voices include  Jeanette Nolan, Peggy Webber, Dick Wilson and Lou Krugman. All are members of  the Los Angeles-based California Artist Repertory Theater, which has about 100  members from radio's heyday in the 1940s.  </P> <P> Shamans to Visit Korea Town  </P> <P> Two performances by the Chindo Ssitkim-Kut Korean Shamans have been added  Sunday at the Korea Town Plaza shopping center at 928 S. Western Ave. A  traditional ceremony will begin at 2 p.m. and a performance of folk music will  be held at 3:30 p.m. Information: (213) 623-7400.  </P> <P> Bolivian Sounds  </P> <P> Bolivian music ensemble Miriam Mita Ayllu Sankayo has been added to the Sept. 9  "Andean Winds" program at UCLA's Sunset Canyon Amphitheater. The group will  perform traditional Incan music, replacing the originally scheduled Ecuadoran  ensemble Runa Pacha,(cq) which was dropped from the festival lineup last month  because of visa problems. A festival spokesman said that no "Around Town"  performances are currently scheduled for the Bolivian group, although such  appearances might be added at a later date.  </P> <P> The Philharmonic Connection  </P> <P> Philharmonic assistant conductor David Alan Miller will conduct the original  "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" Sept. 13 at Hollywood Bowl. John Nelson had  previously been announced as conductor. The Los Angeles Philharmonic/Los  Angeles Festival program, held in conjunction with a live performance of John  Adams' "Harmonielehre," is a replacement for festival director Peter Sellars'  silent-film parody, "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez." The program also includes a  sampler of ethnic music and dance from other festival events.  </P></p>

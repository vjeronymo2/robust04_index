			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT  </P> <P> As one of the many Filipino immigrants living here in Los Angeles, I am deeply  saddened by the recent military attempt in the Philippines.  </P> <P> However, I feel that the Filipino people and the world should not totally  discredit Aquino. People must understand that the country's economy was at its  lowest possible point when Aquino took over. The economy has improved by 4%  since she became president. It took 20 long years for the Filipino people to  react to all of Marcos' political wrongdoings and corruption. The least they  can do now to contribute to the country's stability is to give Aquino a break  and a little more time.  </P> <P> A coup attempt like this only puts the economy further down and discourages  foreign investors from doing business in the Philippines. What Filipinos should  work on is the establishment of discipline and unity as a people. There can be  no growth and progress without these vital factors.  </P> <P> SOCKIE CARRIEDO  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

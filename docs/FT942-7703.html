			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Talisman Energy discovers independence pays off - The Canadian oil company has concentrated on its upstream activities Jim Buckee's career has taken some surprising turns since he arrived in Calgary in September 1991 as president of British Petroleum's Canadian subsidiary. Mr Buckee's job was to get rid of BP Canada's mining interests and narrow its focus to the upstream business of oil and gas exploration and production. Less than a year after his arrival, the UK-based oil and gas group decided to spin off its 57 per cent stake in BP Canada to public investors. One condition of the deal, however, was that Mr Buckee, after 15 years service with BP, would remain in Calgary at the helm of the newly independent company, which was renamed Talisman Energy. Mr Buckee, who has a doctorate in astrophysics from Oxford, has stuck to his original mandate of confining the company to upstream activities. At the same time, he has spearheaded a spectacular burst of growth, which culminated in Talisman's proposal this week to pay about CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn) in cash and shares for Bow Valley Energy, also based in Calgary. British Gas, which owns 53 per cent of Bow Valley's shares, has approved the deal. The Bow Valley acquisition will catapult Talisman into the top ranks of the world's purely upstream energy companies. It is now more than treble the size - measured by oil and gas output - of the old BP Canada. Operating cashflows soared by 88 per cent in the first quarter to CDollars 82.5m, due to last year's purchase of Encor, another western Canadian oil and gas producer, as well as higher gas prices and a weaker Canadian dollar. First-quarter earnings climbed by almost 70 per cent to CDollars 13.3m, with revenues more than doubling to CDollars 110m. Bow Valley and Talisman together produced a total of 500m cubic feet of gas a day last year. Their combined oil output was 53,000 barrels a day. These figures will rise substantially this year, as production rises from the North Sea East Brae field, in which Bow Valley has a 13.3 per cent interest. Its share of production from East Brae will rise to about 14,000 barrels of liquids plus 38m cubic ft of gas a day by the end of the year. Mr Buckee has no qualms about Talisman's rapid growth at a time when many integrated oil and gas producers are shedding assets. 'Investors prefer a purer play than the integrated companies can provide,' he says, adding that 'my expertise is in upstream only. I don't wish to fiddle in things that I don't understand'. Mr Craig Langpap, energy analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Calgary, describes Talisman's management as 'very astute and very skilled in finding oil and gas'. It has succeeded in fully replacing its liquids and natural gas production with new reserves for the past three years in a row. According to Mr Langpap, the Bow Valley acquisition has two big benefits. First, it will boost Talisman's exposure to oil, giving it a roughly 50-50 balance between oil and gas. Second, Bow Valley's properties are concentrated in the North Sea and two areas of Alberta. Talisman expects that by combining the two companies, it will save CDollars 10-CDollars 15m a year in operating costs. Mr Buckee says Talisman will continue to stick mainly to gas exploration in western Canada and to oil in other parts of the world. Capital spending this year (excluding Bow Valley) is expected to reach CDollars 225m, about 50 per cent higher than 1993. According to Talisman's latest annual report, 'even in the event that lower oil prices persist for a substantial part of 1994, we intend to maintain an aggressive capital investment programme'. But Mr Buckee eschews anything too adventurous. 'I'm not in the elephant hunting business and I don't particularly like deep water,' he says. 'I want relatively proven but less mature basins.' The gas exploration programme is especially geared towards deep and relatively unexplored reservoirs in western Canada, centred on the Rockies foothills in north-east British Columbia. Offshore oil activities have so far focused on Cuba and Algeria. But the Bow Valley acquisition will broaden Talisman's reach to the North Sea and Indonesia. Bow Valley and its partners are working out marketing arrangements for a sizeable gas field in the Corridor area of South Sumatra, from which the Canadian company's share would reach 100m cubic ft per day. Under the terms of the Bow Valley deal, British Gas will acquire enough Talisman shares to make it the Canadian company's biggest single shareholder with a stake of between 8 per cent and 16 per cent. But British Gas will not seek board representation, and it will come as no surprise if it also puts these shares on the block in the not-too-distant future. After spending the first 20 years of his career with big integrated oil companies, Mr Buckee clearly relishes his independence. 'Control blocks are often seen as security, but patently in the case of BP Canada and Bow Valley, they've been completely the opposite,' he observes.</p>

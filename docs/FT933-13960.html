			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / House of the rising reformers: Japan's election will transform the political landscape Japan will emerge from this weekend's general election with conservatives in a stronger position than perhaps at any time since the end of the second world war. That the resurgence and modernisation of Japan's conservative politics will be the main outcome of the election may seem paradoxical. After all, the turmoil was set off a month ago by a split in the ruling Liberal Democratic party which now threatens its 38-year grip on power. The June 18 defection of more than 50 LDP members of the parliament's lower house led to the Miyazawa government's defeat in a no-confidence vote and the formation of three conservative parties which will contest the election on Sunday. Large-scale opinion polls conducted over the past few days and the Tokyo metropolitan council elections two weeks ago have suggested the likely outcome. The main casualty could be the socialist opposition, the Social Democratic party. The anti-LDP protest votes which have usually gone to the socialists are likely to go to the new conservative parties, the Japan New party, the Japan Renewal party and the New Harbinger party. They hope to be especially popular among younger, independent, urban voters with their concentration on political reform and consumer-oriented policies. The LDP is not facing an electoral catastrophe. It is unlikely to win an overall majority, yet it is almost certain to emerge as the largest party after the election, which will bring to a close the first act of a political drama that could run for weeks, if not months. The days after the election will probably be dominated by hectic and confusing negotiations over the formation of a coalition government, with black cars ferrying politicians in shiny suits between Tokyo hotels. During this transition period, the traditional ingredients of Japanese politics will come to the fore, as party leaders horse trade over positions and patronage rather than debate policies and principles. There is likely to be a second election soon after the first under revised electoral laws. Reform of Japan's corruption-riddled electoral system has been the only national issue in the campaign, and will be the new government's first priority. However, amid the confusion and instability of the next few months, two issues will determine whether changes will be lasting. Are the new conservative parties just a fad, or a third force which could rewrite the character of Japanese politics? Will the upheaval lead to different policies being pursued by the future Japanese government? In particular, will the Japanese political script be rewritten by younger leaders who want the country to play a larger, more assertive and independent role in world affairs? The election will be the first step to answering these questions. There are four possible outcomes: The least likely is an outright LDP victory. It is defending 227 seats and needs a further 30 to win an overall majority in the 511-strong lower house of parliament. Yet the strength of the LDP's local organisation means it is likely to maintain its core support. A coalition government between the SDP, smaller centrist parties such as the Komeito, the clean government party, and the conservative Japan Renewal party is a marginally more probable outcome. Such a coalition may not, however, get the numbers. Opinion polls suggest the SDP could lose between 40 and 70 of its 140 seats. In the Tokyo local elections it lost half its seats. The Japan Renewal party, led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former LDP finance minister, is fielding only 69 candidates and may win 40-50 seats, and the Komeito is expected to retain its 46 seats. Even if the opposition drew the Japan New party into the coalition, to give it a majority, it would be sharply divided over policies and personalities. The SDP adheres to a foreign policy which predates the end of the cold war and is at odds with the new conservatives. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the JNP leader, is a bitter rival of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, once the power behind the LDP throne, who is playing the same role in the Renewal party. Much more likely is a coalition led by the LDP if, as expected, it wins between 210 and 230 seats, with the Japan New party and the New Harbinger party (which plan to merge after the election), if they win about 50 seats between them. Such a coalition might provide the catalyst for the LDP's renewal and revival. The election may pave the way for younger, more reformist leaders to take over the helm at the LDP. Senior LDP officials believe that, with the JNP's help, the party could weather the worst of the storm by helping to give it a reformist image as a precursor to resuming its role in later elections as the natural party of government. Shrewd political observers in Japan's bureaucracy believe the JNP's appeal could prove shortlived. Its policies are vague. It is largely a vehicle for the ambitions of its leader, the aristocratic Mr Hosokawa. He might be drawn into the LDP fold by the promise of a job such as foreign minister. As likely as an LDP-led coalition is further fragmentation which could prolong instability. Mr Ozawa believes the opposition parties will have the numbers to threaten a no-confidence motion at any time even if they cannot form a government. He foresees further defections of young reformers from the LDP and a split in the SDP after an electoral setback which would force it to revise its policies, a development which a hardline minority might find hard to stomach. Whatever the precise standings of the parties and the details of their plans for political reform, this election is part of a fundamental process which is reshaping Japanese politics. It will not end this weekend. The centre of gravity of the entire political system is shifting, in a belated response to the economic and social changes which have swept Japan as it has become perhaps the strongest economy in the post-cold-war world. The old dividing line between left and right is increasingly irrelevant. For the foreseeable future the most important divide in Japanese politics, which will cut across the main parties, will be between modernisers and traditionalists. This new divide has several components. There is a growing generational rift between the young and the old, and also between the cosmopolitan, urban middle class and the provincial working class. Supporters of political reform are spread through all parties. Elderly defenders of the status quo congregate in both the LDP and the SDP. Reformers in different parties often have more in common with one another than with their seniors within their own party. The believers in Japan's old foreign policies - the right's adherence to US leadership and the left's pacifist opposition to it - are at odds with the young realists in all parties who want Japan to play a more assertive, independent world role, symbolised by their enthusiasm to dispatch Japanese troops to serve abroad in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The rise of the new conservative parties to challenge both the established LDP and the SDP could be the vehicle for transmitting the conflict between modernisers and traditionalists into the political arena. Across the political system the balance of power is swinging in favour of modernisers, whether they are young LDP politicians who want to appeal to voters with consumer-oriented policies or their socialist peers who want to ditch old policies, such as support for communist North Korea. The divide between young and old will be enduring and could provide fertile soil in which the new conservative parties will take root. It is reflected in the business community, which finances politics, between domestically oriented construction companies and small retailers, on the one hand, and international manufacturing and financial companies on the other. The stronger the performance of the established parties, the LDP and the SDP, the slower will be the pace of modernisation. The stronger the performance of the new parties, the quicker will be pace of change. In large part this is because the success of the new parties will force the older parties to respond by adopting the reformist policies advocated by their younger members. The election will allow the young modernisers who will lead Japan into the next century their loudest shout yet. It is unlikely to be their last.</p>

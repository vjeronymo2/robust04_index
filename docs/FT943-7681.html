			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / This Week: The FT Guide to the Rail Strike How did the dispute begin? The RMT transport union made a claim in January 1993 for an interim 11 per cent payment for signal staff, to cover past productivity improvements and restore differentials with other rail workers. It re-submitted the claim in February. The signalling workers grievances go back to 1987 when they raised the issue of productivity payments linked to automation. The RMT told first British Rail and then Railtrack, the state-owned company which since privatisation in April has run the rail network, that once agreement was reached on the interim claim it would discuss restructuring working practices. The union's claim was rejected. In April signalling staff voted 4-1 on an 80 per cent turnout for strikes over the claim. Why did the ballot not lead to a negotiated settlement? Between June 6 and June 8 the RMT and Railtrack held what the union calls 'intensive negotiations' and the company 'exploratory discussions'. The union claims it was offered verbally a 5.7 per cent pay increase in return for productivity and lost differentials. However, on June 9, after the management met the Department of Transport, government ministers said the proposed offer breached the public sector pay policy. On Monday June 13 RMT negotiators walked out on Railtrack, claiming the company had withdrawn its offer. How have the strikes proceeded? The first 24-hour strike was on Wednesday June 15. They continued each Wednesday until the week beginning July 24, when a 48-hour stoppage was called. The worst period of disruption was on August 12, 15 and 16. When the strikes started very few trains ran. But Railtrack has mobilised supervisors and managers to man signal boxes. By the end of last month about 30 per cent of services were running. Today Railtrack hopes that 40 per cent will be operating. What are signalling workers paid? Signal workers' basic rates are between Pounds 146 and Pounds 235.75 per week. Allowances, shift premia and overtime payments averaging 11 hours on a 39-hour normal week, increase average gross earnings to Pounds 320 a week, an average hourly rate of Pounds 6.51. This compares with Pounds 6.85 for all BR staff and Pounds 9.01 for London Underground workers. What do signalling workers do? Most signal workers operate highly computerised equipment, covering large areas of the rail network. The RMT argues the increased responsibilities have not produced higher earnings under the old job classification system. What is Railtrack offering the signalling workers? The definitive offer to the RMT was made on June 27 at the conciliation service ACAS. The company proposed a three-part package which would have produced a payment of over 3 per cent in earnings, on top of a 2.5 per cent annual pay increase. The package involved an extra 6 per cent supplement on basic rates from July 1, not to be used in calculations for shift or premium allowances, a one-off lump sum of Pounds 200 for everybody accepting cashless pay (this was later raised to Pounds 250) and the promise of a restructuring productivity deal to be negotiated by October 1. Railtrack said the full package would increase most earnings by 10 per cent. It conceded the earnings of up to a quarter of staff would be cut by the integration of allowances into basic pay. In return for the pay increases the signalling workers would have to accept sweeping changes in their working practices, some of which date back to just after the First World War. The reforms would involve acceptance of compulsory Sunday working, longer shifts as well as the introduction of job evaluation and more flexibility. What are the prospects of an agreement? Still not good. Despite 11 weeks of argument, the union insists signal staff must receive an interim payment of between 5.7 per cent and 11 per cent before it will discuss a restructuring package. On August 9 it said a settlement was possible if Railtrack would offer a 4.6 per cent pay rise plus either a one hour cut in the basic working week, improvements in shift and overtime payments or an improvement in an index linked payment. In return for this the RMT said it would enter five days of talks on restructuring and put the results to a ballot. Railtrack said the proposals were unacceptable because they would involve an increase in a payment workers were not entitled to and no promise that it would result in a deal by October 1 - the company's deadline if the workers pension arrangements are to be safeguarded. What options are there to end the strike? Railtrack is planning, if necessary, to encourage signalling workers individually to accept its final restructuring package. Yet it remain's hesitant about such a move for fear of being rebuffed by the workers. It has virtually ruled out the more draconian idea of dismissing workers who refuse to accept new terms of conditions and employment. It does not have an alternative, trained workforce that could replace existing signal workers. In the highly unionised railway industry, such a step would antagonise other groups of workers. The alternative is to open up more of the rail network during each strike through a more effective use of managers and supervisors, supplemented by signalling staff who are drifting back to work. If Railtrack can run more than 40 per cent of services in defiance of the strike, the union will be under severe pressure to return to the negotiating table.</p>

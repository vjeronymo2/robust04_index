			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Grenade attack kills four Haitians A grenade attack on a pro-democracy march in Port-au-Prince yesterday - which left at least four dead and up to 40 injured - threatened to destabilise the Haitian capital on the eve of a huge demonstration expected today. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, the most violent incident since US troops arrived in the country. It came after US and Haitian authorities staged the symbolic return of elected mayor Evans Paul to the Port-au-Prince town hall. Mr Paul had been in hiding for nearly a year. People gathered in the streets, chanting slogans demanding the arrest of Haiti's military leaders and calling for the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is still in the US. The celebration was thrown into chaos when the grenade was tossed into the crowd. The incident, which was followed by another reported attack, this time a shooting, set off a wave of looting. The US army immediately stepped up its deployment, sending in Sheraton tanks and Bradley armoured vehicles. Troops shot their way into a warehouse in an attempt to secure the area. Mr William Swing, US ambassador in Haiti, said that 'brutal acts of violence are not totally unexpected. . . because the enemies of democracy will resort to any ends and means to stop the democratic change process.' Even before the attacks, tension was expected today as thousands of Haitians are due to march through the streets of Port-au-Prince to show support for Mr Aristide on the third anniversary of the coup that ousted him from office. The United Nations Security Council voted last night to lift fuel, trade and arms sanctions against Haiti, beginning the morning after President Aristide returns from exile. The vote was 13-0, with Russia and Brazil abstaining.</p>

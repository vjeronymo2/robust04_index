			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Tricky task to lay Mideast bank's foundations Many Arab and Israeli political and business leaders were hailing the prospective Middle East and North African Development Bank as the most 'concrete' achievement of the Casablanca regional economic summit which closed yesterday. But if so, not only is the concrete neither set nor moulded, there will be much tricky negotiating before even the mix is agreed upon. This, according to yesterday's 'Casablanca declaration', will be the task of a 'group of experts', so far unchosen, who will 'examine different options for funding mechanisms including the creation of a Middle East and North Africa Development Bank'. The experts are expected to meet in Washington before the year's end and make an initial report in six months. It will not be easy. Although the bank has general political support from the US, the EU, Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians, speakers over the past three days in Casablanca have canvassed a wide and sometimes contradictory variety of possible structures, uses, lending criteria and locations for the institution. Its creation is seen by many as addressing political rather than economic needs, and some question the need for it - institutions such as the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Islamic Development Bank already exist. Mr Omar Mohanna, head of corporate finance at the Cairo-based Misr Iran Development Bank, said flatly: 'It would take a lot of time and then be a white elephant.' He said a more practical option would be that suggested yesterday by Mr Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, chairman of National Bank of Egypt, for a wholly private-sector regional bank, capitalised at Dollars 500m (Pounds 316.4m) with joint and equal Arab and Israeli participation. But to its proponents, such as Mr Michel Marto, deputy governor of Jordan's central bank, there is a clear need for a government-backed institution. 'Every area of the world has a development bank, but we have been deprived of one for so long. For major projects there is no institution which can do what a development bank will. And there will be others, not in themselves economically viable, but which must be financed for their external economic effects.' The bank is likely to be capitalised at Dollars 10bn, with 60 per cent held by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. There appears agreement that it should concentrate on financing big regional infrastructural projects. But even among its political backers, almost every other aspect of the bank is likely to attract considerable debate. Egypt, for instance, is uneasy about attempts to create regional institutions of any kind while critical regional players such as Lebanon and Syria, which have not reached peace with Israel, remain outside what has now become the Casablanca process. Within the Israeli government there are differences, with Mr Jacob Frankel, the central bank governor, arguing strongly that potential shareholders in the bank should concentrate on making direct, immediate investments in the region, rather than engaging in 'academic debate' over its structure. The Palestinians are also uneasy. They say the bank's apparent role in financing big development projects would be inappropriate to their present small economic enclaves in Gaza and the West Bank. 'Will a bank like this really attend to our needs? From what we hear from the Americans this bank will not be offering any concessionary finance. But we would like to see some benefit from it,' said Mr Nabil Shaath, Palestinian minister for economic planning. Some Gulf states have been positive - Qatar yesterday pledged its support. Others, in particular Saudi Arabia, are reluctant to commit money to the bank. Britain is also understood to be suspicious of creating another regional bank given the unhappy experiences of organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Middle East Bank's most oft-quoted model, and the African Development Bank.</p>

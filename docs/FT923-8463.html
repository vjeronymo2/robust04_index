			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Lord Devlin: an original legal mind - Obituary LORD DEVLIN, the former law lord who died on Sunday aged 86, became the youngest High Court judge this century when he was appointed to the Queen's Bench Division at the age of 42 in 1948. He retired early in 1964 after only three years in the House of Lords and it was said that the law had lost one of the finest and most original legal minds of his generation. His fellow law lord, Lord Reid, commenting on his decision to stand down at the age of 58, said: 'He could have been the greatest among us.' His reasons for taking early retirement, at a time when there was no compulsory retirement age for senior judges, were never made clear. Later he said he had resigned because he found the work in the House of Lords 'so utterly boring'. It has also been suggested that he saw little prospect of further advancement under a Conservative administration, having fallen out with the Macmillan government over his 1959 inquiry into the disturbances in Nyasaland and having been passed over for the job of Master of the Rolls in 1962. His early retirement from the bench did not signal retirement from public life. In 1964 he was appointed chairman of the Press Council, the first person from outside the industry to hold that position. In recent years he became a staunch campaigner on behalf of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven. From 1971-72 he was a member of the committee on identification in criminal cases and from 1969 to 1991 he was high steward of Cambridge University. Patrick Arthur Devlin was born in 1905 and educated at Stonyhurst College and Christ's College, Cambridge. In 1932 he married Madeleine Oppenheimer, youngest daughter of Sir Bernard Oppenheimer. They had four sons and twin daughters. He took silk in 1945 and was appointed attorney general of the Duchy of Cornwall two years later. He was appointed to the High Court bench in October 1948, the Court of Appeal in 1960 and the House of Lords a year later, taking the title Baron of West Wick. He presided over many celebrated cases, including the trial for murder of John Bodkin Adams, the Eastbourne doctor acquitted after being accused of poisoning his elderly patients. Among his publications was a book he wrote in 1985 about the Adams case, Easing the Passing, in which he said he did not think Dr Adams was a mass murderer.</p>

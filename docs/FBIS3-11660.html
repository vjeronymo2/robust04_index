Belizaire, president of the Alliance for Parliamentary  Cohesion [ACP], has shouted: Meddling! In Belizaire's opinion,  it is not up to U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing to  ask the parliamentarians elected on 18 January to respect the  New York pact. The following is a report by Daly Valet:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The nation's political  crisis has begun to deteriorate. The problems of the high cost  of living and the blackouts have turned the country, especially  Port- au-Prince, into a hell. If the political authorities fail  to take action, there could be social explosions leading to  civil war in Haiti. Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has not  ruled out this danger, because hunger drives the wolf out of the  woods.    The U.S. Government also is aware of the fact that the worst  can happen if the country's political crisis continues. This is  why William Lacy Swing, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, has turned  into a malevolent, master voodoo priest [yon papa boko] who  wishes to bring the zombies that the Governors Island agreement  and New York pact constitute back to life. The ambassador has  disinterred the dead bodies of these two political documents,  and is asking all the signers to respect their signatures.    Regarding the [contested] parliamentarians elected on 18  January, the U.S. ambassador is very firm: He has asked them to  respect the New York pact, which requires them to abstain [from  participating in parliamentary activity]. This has angered  Dejean Belizaire.    [Belizaire] To become senator, on 18 January 1993, I  campaigned under the slogan: The nation's independence is in  danger. We must defend it. So I can hardly understand how today  I, a senator of the Republic and a Haitian citizen, could be in  such a situation, to have to obey orders given by Mr. Swing.  Dejean Belizaire is a legitimate citizen. The parliamentarians  elected on 18 January are legitimate citizens. We are therefore  telling the ambassador that he has gone too far in his meddling  in the country's internal affairs.    They may be able to give orders to President Aristide, but  they cannot give orders to the senators elected on 18 January.  [passage omitted]    [Valet] The U.S. ambassador's statements have angered the  entire group of legislators elected on 18 January. All of them  have used nationalistic words to reply to the ambassador, and  have spoken of meddling and violation of the senators'  independence. Margareth Martin is even more radical in her  reaction. Her main demands are that the New York pact be  declared null and void, that the country's president be  impeached, and [that] Article 149 [be implemented]. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco cheer A rare piece of good news for the food retail sector came in the form of a trading statement from Tesco, which was well received by the market and sent the shares forward 15 to 251 1/2 p in hefty trading of 18m. Food analysts said the supermarket group's decision to cut its capital expenditure and store opening programme eased concern over market saturation. They were also cheered by the decision to increase the dividend ahead of earnings growth. 'Tesco has at last faced reality with this statement,' said one specialist. As widely rumoured, the supermarket group decided to begin making provisions for depreciating its buildings and also to make a write-down of Pounds 85m on surplus land. The positive sentiment, together with the rising market, helped the other retailers. Among these, J. Sainsbury climbed 10 to 477p. Strong two-way business in Rolls-Royce saw turnover jump to 18m as US buyers returned to the stock, ignoring a profits downgrade from Hoare Govett, the group's broker. However, there were fears that the renewed US interest may soon challenge the 29.5 per cent limit on overseas ownership set in the group's articles of association. Hoare reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 75m. The shares firmed 1 1/2 to 174p. British Aerospace was back in favour on hopes of a lucrative Hawk order from India, and a view that the recent falls had been overdone. The shares bounced 25 to 416p, with volume reaching 7.5m. The Pacific Rim-influenced bank stocks, principally HSBC and Standard Chartered, continued to race ahead, boosted by the latest rise on the Hong Kong market. Standard was 26 higher at 1229p, after reaching 1248p, after Cazenove, the bank's broker, was said to have given the stock a strong push, highlighting the discrepancy between Standard's prospective price/earnings ratio, around the 7.5 mark, compared with that of HSBC, some 10.5 times, and other Far Eastern stocks which are rated around 20 times earnings. Some of the market's super optimists are forecasting a doubling of Standard's share price. HSBC added 29 at 976p. Bank of East Asia is not a subsidiary of HSBC, as incorrectly reported here yesterday. TSB rose 10 to a record 286p as a number of broking firms continued to upgrade their estimates and recommendations on the stock following the recent preliminary figures. Oil issues were restrained by worries about crude oil prices, but were also said to have been held back by hints that Enterprise and Lasmo are about to have their debt ratings reduced by Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the leading US credit-rating agencies. Enterprise retained a 7 gain at 469p, still helped by stories that Elf-Aquitaine has decided not to sell its 10 per cent stake in the short term. Lasmo edged up 2 1/2 to 126 1/2 p following news that its important Indonesian oil equivalent reserves have been upgraded by 13 per cent, or 59m barrels of oil equivalent, following an independent assessment. BAA lost 4 to 1056p on fears that a review on airport regulation announced on Tuesday may have a negative impact on BAA's pricing formula discussions with the government due to start later this year. In a strong property sector, MEPC was further boosted by a positive annual meeting and the shares jumped 29 to 561p. Some leading leisure stocks were knocked, with Forte declining 5 to 276p. Kleinwort Benson, which has Forte as a 'hold', said the stock was overbought in the face of the hesitant pace of recovery in the hotel market. Turnover in Burton hit 16m as Lehman Brothers matched a buyer and seller of 6.5m shares. The deals were struck at 73p and 73 3/4 p. The stock nudged up a half-penny to 74p.</p>

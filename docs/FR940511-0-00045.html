			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discharges Outside the Sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Clarify to what extent the ``sphere of influence'' of the discharge regulation extends, to what degree it may affect coastal communities including the tribes, and who determines if injury to a Sanctuary resource has occurred. Would a community such as Ocean Shores or an Indian tribe face increased water quality regulations or enforcement? Further, does the discharge prohibition apply to particulates that are discharged into the air from pulp mills and subsequently enter the Sanctuary and harm Sanctuary resources and qualities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOAA should not impose additional restrictions, beyond the existing requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPA), on the discharge of effluent and dredge spoils into marine waters. There is no evidence that additional restrictions on these activities are required to protect water quality in the proposed sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MPRSA protects Sanctuary resources and qualities (including water quality) from the impacts of discharges from within and outside the boundary of a Sanctuary whether airborne or waterborne. NOAA is responsible for determining injury to Sanctuary resources. Discharges pursuant to existing permits may be continued subject to the certification requirements of &sect;925.10. New permits are subject to the review process of &sect;925.11. At a minimum, secondary treatment will be required for any treatment plants discharging directly into the Sanctuary. With respect to airborne or waterborne discharges outside the Sanctuary, NOAA may condition such permits only if it is established that the discharges are entering the Sanctuary and injuring Sanctuary resources or qualities. NOAA will work closely with all to ensure that none is unduly burdened by permitting requirements related to discharges. NOAA will coordinate with the State's Air Quality Board and Department of Ecology to monitor air and water quality over and in the Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Application of Discharge Regulations to Vessel Traffic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application of this regulation should prohibit organic and inorganic discharges from fishing vessels and submarines (including bilge), aircraft. The prohibition should apply to all naval operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Sanctuary regulations specify the fishing and vessel related activities exempted from the discharge prohibition (&sect;925.5(a)(2)(i)&hyph;(iv)). Discharges and deposits from vessels are prohibited except for specific discharges intended to provide for traditional fishing activities, such as fish wastes resulting from traditional fishing operations in the Sanctuary, and for allowed vessel operations in the Sanctuary, namely biodegradable effluent incidental to vessel use and generated by approved marine sanitation devices, water generated by routine vessel operations, and engine exhaust. Such discharges are determined to be of minimal threat to the Sanctuary and are important for the safe and effective functioning of fishing and other vessels. Other discharges from vessel operations are prohibited. If in the future NOAA determines that increased protection for Sanctuary resources and qualities from these exempted activities is warranted, the Sanctuary regulations could be revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Clarify acceptable and unacceptable discharges from fishing vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See response to previous comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Impacts of Discharge Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banning the use of approved dredge disposal sites would impose severe economic impacts on marine navigation and commerce, and ultimately to the coastal communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The boundary of the Sanctuary does not encompass the approved dredge disposal sites off of Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, and the Columbia River. However, no new dredge disposal sites may be located within the Sanctuary boundary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA must examine the economic impacts of the discharge regulations on existing industries. There are currently 72 identified dischargers in the study area. It is unclear if the proposed Sanctuary would impact the continued operation of the pulp mill's NPDES permitted discharge near Grays Harbor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Sanctuary's boundary does not extend south of Copalis Beach. Therefore, the only discharge regulation that would apply to dischargers in Grays Harbor would be the prohibition on discharges from outside the boundary that subsequently enter and injure Sanctuary resources or qualities. NOAA will need to establish that effluents from pulp mills are injuring Sanctuary resources or qualities before it would impose terms and conditions on the pulp mill's NPDES permit. If this situation were to occur, NOAA would work with the discharger, the State of Washington, and EPA to minimize the economic impacts of reducing the impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue: Oil and Gas Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA's failure to offer as an alternative an outright, no conditions ban on hydrocarbon development within the Sanctuary is contrary to NEPA regulations, 40 CFR 1502.14 which states that the alternatives section is the heart of the environmental impact statement. NOAA should permanently ban oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2207 of the Oceans Act of 1992 prohibits oil and gas exploration, development and production within the Sanctuary. The Sanctuary regulations repeat this prohibition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA should designate a buffer zone based on ocean currents and local seabed geography to prevent damage from external mineral operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

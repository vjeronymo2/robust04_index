			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Maine relents over drink boxes The state of Maine has been forced to back down in its fight against drink boxes, the rectangular laminated packages made by companies such as Tetra-Pak and Combibloc, George Graham reports from Washington. Governor John McKernan this week signed a bill repealing Maine's three and a half year ban on the drink box, which is more difficult to recycle than aluminium cans or glass bottles and which the state feared would fill up all scarce landfills. But the boxes have proved a hit with consumers, who buy around 4bn of them in the US each year. Maine's state legislature decided in 1990 to ban the boxes, but last month, after years of industry pressure, it reversed itself. Packaging companies have agreed, in exchange, to help municipalities set up recycling programmes.</p>

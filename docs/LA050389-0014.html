			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN-CONTROL LEGISLATION  </P> <P> This letter is to address the key point of the personal weapons issue.  </P> <P> This point is the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was written to  ensure a means to overthrow the government by force of arms if necessary. The  right to overthrow the government is mandated in the Declaration of  Independence.  </P> <P> The Founding Fathers possessed great wisdom by including this safeguard measure  knowing that limited government as they established, tends to become unlimited  government as we have in this country today.  </P> <P> This point established, the conclusion drawn is that personal weapons for  defense against the state should be military-type weapons.  </P> <P> This poses a certain degree of risk of misuse of these weapons, one Patrick  Purdy being the most recent example. But liberty can only be maintained by  making the imposition of tyranny too perilous for the would-be Hitlers or  Stalins in public office to contemplate.  </P> <P> I, for one, will take the danger.  </P> <P> JOHN L. BINFORD  </P> <P> Lake Elsinore  </P></p>

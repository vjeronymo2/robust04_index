Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Plans for what will be  Taiwan's largest industrial park have been finalized, Vice  Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien reported Tuesday [4  January]. The park is being built in Yunlin County on Taiwan's  southwest coast and is scheduled to be completed by 2016.    Yang said four and a half years of work went into planning  the project, including site selection, environmental evaluation,  and geologic and water studies.    The industrial complex will occupy a total of 11,000  hectares  on reclaimed offshore land in the towns of Mailiao, Hsinhsing,  and Sihu. The Mailiao section will contain 2,500 hectares, the  Hsinhsing section 1,072, and the Sihu section 7,428.    Formosa Plastics Group is building Taiwan's sixth naphtha  cracking plant in the Mailiao section, while the Industrial  Development Bureau will be responsible for the development of  the Hsinhsing and Sihu sections, which will house steelworks,  oil refineries, and petrochemical plants, among others.    To facilitate transportation of raw materials and finished  products in and out of Taiwan, two industrial ports will be  built in Mailiao and Sihu. The ports will be able to handle 30  million metric tons and 90 million metric tons, respectively.    Separately, Yang said the government has yet to make a final  decision on whether to locate Taiwan's first-ever free trade  area within the Sihu section. In a bid to attract multinational  companies, Taiwan has been mulling setting up a free trade area  to promote the island as a business operations center in the  Asia- Pacific.</p>

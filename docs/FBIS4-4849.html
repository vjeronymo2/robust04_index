			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- The number of Chinese who  disappeared after coming to Japan to receive higher professional  training while working for business firms almost doubled in 1993  to 65, the national police agency said Saturday [2 April]. Most  of these Chinese overstayed their visas and went underground to  get higher-paying jobs at places of employment other than the  original business firms where they received job training, the  agency said.    The number of Chinese who disappeared under similar  circumstances in 1992 was 35, it said. Of a total 76 foreign  business trainees who went missing in 1993, 85 percent were  Chinese.    Many of the missing hid themselves shortly before the  expiration of their agreed training tenures and then overstayed  their visas to land higher-paying work than their previous jobs,  an agency official said.    The Philippines ranked second with nine missing persons,  followed by Bangladesh with two, the agency said.    A total of 19,000 foreign business trainees from 108  countries are presently working in Japan, of which Chinese  account for about 10,000.    In addition to the missing trainees, 17 Chinese university  and college students have disappeared while the whereabouts of  58 Chinese students of technical and language schools also  remains unknown, it said. The reasons for the disappearance of  the students were not immediately known.    An agency official said, "disappearances among Chinese  business trainees may increase further in the future."</p>

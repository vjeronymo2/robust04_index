			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Sales of vans and trucks rise 11.6% as imports grow New commercial vehicle registrations rose 11.6 per cent last month to 18,884, figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. Sales of new commercial vehicles, which are an important economic indicator, have been higher than a year ago in seven of the past eight months. Imported vehicles are increasing their share, however, as the market recovers from recession. Imports accounted for 45.2 per cent of the market in April, compared with 39.1 per cent a year ago. In the first four months of the year, new commercial vehicle registrations rose by 12.4 per cent to 75,486. The share taken by imports jumped to 43.1 per cent from 40.3 per cent a year ago. Imports are making the biggest impact in the truck sector, where the domestic production base was hit by the financial collapse a year ago of Daf, the former Dutch commercial vehicle maker. Registrations of new trucks (of more than 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight), which have led the commercial vehicle market out of recession, rose by 20 per cent in the first four months to 12,677. Sales of imported trucks, however, jumped by 50 per cent to 7,299. They account for 58 per cent of the total truck market compared with 46 per cent in the first four months last year. Daf Trucks, which succeeded the old Daf group - the former UK truck market leader - has ceded considerable ground to its rivals. The Iveco group, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, is now the market leader, while Mercedes-Benz of Germany has moved into second place and was the market leader in April. Volvo and Scania, the Swedish truck and bus makers, account for more than a third of the UK heavy truck market (more than 15 tonnes), where MAN of Germany and Renault of France are also strengthening their presence, albeit from a small base. In the medium van market, which is dominated by the Ford Transit, LDV (formerly Leyland Daf Vans), the company rescued by a management buy-out from the former Daf group, is successfully rebuilding its presence. It increased its registrations by 52 per cent in the first four months in a market that has increased by 11 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-APRIL 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Volume    Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                               (Units) Change (%)  Jan-Apr 94  Jan-Apr 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                 75,486     +12.4        100.0       100.0 Imports                       32,544     +20.2         43.1        40.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                         24,893     +13.6        100.0       100.0 Imports                       10,002     +29.3         40.2        35.3 Ford                          10,844      +4.7         43.6        47.3 Vauxhall (General Motors)      7,305      +2.5         29.3        32.5 Renault                        1,671     +54.7          6.7         4.9 PSA Peugeot Citroen            1,406      +8.9          5.6         5.9 Rover (BMW)                    1,224     +41.3          4.9         4.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium vans &amp; pick-ups (1.81 - 3.5 tonnes) Total                         32,076     +11.3        100.0       100.0 Imports                       12,422      +9.7         38.7        39.3 Ford                          14,962      -1.4         46.6        52.6 LDV                            3,531     +51.6         11.0         8.1 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)   2,540    +103.4          7.9         4.3 Volkswagen                     2,378     +13.5          7.4         7.3 Renault                        1,984     +23.9          6.2         5.6 Nissan                         1,512     +50.4          4.7         3.5 Vauxhall (GM)                  1,466     +15.2          4.6         4.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen            1,293     -19.7          4.0         5.6 Toyota                         1,236      -9.0          3.9         4.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks (over 3.5 tonnes) Total                         12,677     +20.1        100.0       100.0 Imports                        7,299     +49.7         57.6        46.2 Iveco group** (Fiat)           3,062     +12.2         24.2        25.9 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)   2,314     +17.6         18.3        18.6 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)       2,095     +11.0         16.5        17.9 Volvo                          1,583     +26.4         12.5        11.9 Scania (Investor)              1,049     +35.5          8.3         7.3 MAN                              865     +52.3          6.8         5.4 ERF                              728     +37.4          5.7         5.0 Renault                          520     +42.1          4.1         3.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes) Total                          7,256     +28.9        100.0       100.0 Volvo                          1,425     +30.1         19.6        19.5 Scania (Investor)              1,049     +35.5         14.5        13.8 Iveco group** (Fiat)           1,048     +25.4         14.4        14.9 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)       1,017     +30.9         14.0        13.8 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)     837     +10.7         11.5        13.4 ERF                              728     +37.4         10.0         9.4 MAN                              491     +48.3          6.8         5.9 Renault                          303    +119.6          4.2         2.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (names in brackets indicate ownership)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles. **includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and industry estimates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith firm on policy for benefits MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday said he opposed moving away from universally available social security benefits - apparently pre-empting the impact on party policy of the independent Commission on Social Justice he was launching. Mr Smith said the 16-member commission would carry out the most sweeping review of employment, tax, benefits and 'the social condition of our nation' since the Beveridge report 50 years ago. Labour would 'gain enormously' from the ideas the commission recommended, he said. He would welcome a 'fresh examination' of Labour's support for mortgage-interest tax relief, although he did not suggest its policy would change. Mr Smith said there was 'a very strong case for having child benefit and the retirement pension as universal benefits'. His remarks jarred with past hints and indications from shadow cabinet members that the Labour leadership would completely rethink tax and benefit policy - including extending benefit targetting. His comments also annoyed some Labour MPs. Mr Frank Field, MP for Birkenhead and chairman of the Commons' social security committee, said: 'Everything must be up for consideration. There are no sacred cows. It should not be an exercise in merely shuffling our prejudices.' Tax and the cost of Labour's spending proposals were widely regarded in April as having contributed to the party's fourth successive general election defeat. The Commission on Social Justice, chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, former director-general of fair trading, is expected to report in 18 months. Mr Smith said it was 'akin to a Royal Commission'. The need for its work was as great as when Sir William Beveridge reported in 1942, Mr Smith said. 'In an increasingly competitive world, Britain cannot afford poverty. Neither can we afford such high levels of unemployment . . We should no longer be thinking just in terms of providing a safety net, but of creating a springboard to independence, self-reliance and personal fulfilment.' At least one member - Mr David Marquand, professor of politics at Sheffield university - is a Liberal Democrat supporter. But the Liberal Democrat party said the commission would do little to help build an anti-Tory pact. 'It moves an inch when the need is to move a mile,' said an aide to Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader. Sir Gordon hopes for consensus on the commission, even though the past record of its members suggest disputes on the principle of universality. He believed Labour would look 'kindly' on its conclusions but said the exercise 'will be of value in itself for the political life of this country'. Sir Gordon's starting point was a belief in the importance of social cohesion and common purpose but also of individual opportunity. The commission will be serviced by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. Other members are: Mr Tony Atkinson, professor of political economy at Cambridge university; Ms Anita Bhalla, editor of Asian programmes on BBC radio in Birmingham; Mr John Gennard, professor of industrial relations at Strathclyde university; the Very Rev John Gladwin, provost of Sheffield cathedral; Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods; Ms Patricia Hewitt, deputy director of the IPPR; Dr Penelope Leach, president of the Child Development Society; Ms Ruth Lister, vice-chairman of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations; Mr Bert Massie, director of the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation; Dr Eithnie McLaughlin, lecturer in social policy at Queen's University, Belfast; Ms Emma MacLennan, vice-chairman of the Low Pay Unit; Mr Steven Webb, economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Ms Margaret Wheeler, national officer for the health service union Cohse; Mr Bernard Williams, professor of moral philosophy at Oxford university.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Industrial Output Rose by 3 Percent"] </F>   [Text] According to the Austrian Central Statistical  Office, in February 1994 the index of Austria's industrial  output (1990 equals 100) rose to 101 points after being adjusted  in line with work days and went up by 3 percent compared with  February 1993 and by 7 percent compared with January 1994.    In January 1994 (94.5) the index rose by 2.2 percent  compared  with January 1993, while it went down by 9.8 percent compared  with December 1993. Without including the energy sector  (electricity, gas, and heat supplies as well as other energy  products) output was 5 percent higher in February than during  the same month last year.    Their increase in output was 7 percent higher than in  January  1993 for high-tech products, 2 percent for goods for fixed  investments, and 1 percent for consumer goods. Output in the  energy sector declined by 1 percent.    At the end of February 1994 orders received in the 17  industrial sectors included in the study amounted to 176.1  billion schillings. Compared with January 1993 their value  increased by 3 percent (foreign orders up 4 percent, domestic  orders up 3 percent).    The highest growth rate -- 43 percent -- was registered in  the paper industry. The strongest slump -- 17 percent -- was in  the metal industry.    In February 1994 orders received amounted to 47.9 billion  and  thus rose nominally by 7 percent compared with February 1993  (foreign orders up 11 percent, domestic orders up 1 percent).</p>

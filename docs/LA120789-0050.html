			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS: 'ETIQUETTE ZEALOTS' MAY GO TOO FAR  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- Several times in your columns you have mentioned that if  individuals do not act in a manner generally approved of by society, they have  to suffer society's sanctions. Social control is an absolute necessity in any  society, especially in as large and individualistic a society as ours.  </P> <P> But how is this to be accomplished? We now have such a fragmented culture that  peer pressure is diminished, and rudeness and crime (which is extreme rudeness)  abound.  </P> <P> To complicate matters even further, it appears to be "politically correct" to  advocate a pluralistic, multicultural society (I don't support this), and  perhaps one person's "bad manners" are correct in his culture.  </P> <P> If so, doesn't that negate the whole concept of manners in America, and manners  especially as a form of social control, at least in principle?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- No. American manners draw on both a variety of traditions and  the original ideas of the country's founders, who had a specific interest in  developing an egalitarian etiquette that would be different from the  aristocratic traditions they knew. But even allowing for the ignorance of  newcomers and regional differences, we can all distinguish good American  manners from bad.  </P> <P> As to how we punish the bad, that is a more difficult problem. Society's  consequences for violating etiquette are not -- nor should they be -- what  society's consequences are for mass murder or grand larceny. For this reason,  etiquette zealots are often frustrated enough to take matters into their own  hands, delivering rude punishments for rudeness, much as vigilante groups  punish violations of the law by illegal means.  </P> <P> Obviously, Miss Manners condemns this. But she also believes it to be based on  an underestimation of what she has been pleased to call society's sanction.  </P> <P> That sanction is social disapproval. Purposeful rudeness antagonizes those who  are its victims, and they, in turn, treat perpetrators with disdain -- not  return rudeness, Miss Manners hopes, but the coldness of distaste. Politeness  does not require anyone to pretend to like being deliberately treated rudely.  </P> <P> While being generally disliked may not be as clear or severe a punishment as a  jail sentence or fine, it is unpleasant enough to discourage most people from  persisting in provoking it.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I have a group of female friends to whom I have been  writing for quite a number of years. Several of these friends have married  recently. I have never met their mates.  </P> <P> I would like to continue writing and exchanging gifts, but feel awkward now  that these friends are married. May I continue to address the letters to my  friends only, or do I now need to address letters to "Mr. and Mrs."?  </P> <P> We usually exchange Christmas and birthday gifts. Should I now include the  husbands in the gift exchange?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Although seasonal greetings are customarily addressed to both  members of a couple, a lady does not lose her private mailing privileges upon  marriage. Your letters and birthday presents continue to go to her alone,  although it would be courteous to send greetings to her husband and perhaps the  wish that you will someday meet. If your Christmas presents are for the  household, they could also be sent to both.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- This will be my first year of sending Christmas cards as a  widow. I have a son living at home, who has always been part of our signature.  How do I write my name and his so that no one will mistakenly think that he is  my husband and not my son? I am also curious about how I should sign my name on  other correspondence, "Mrs. Alan Hanlin" or "Mrs. Adele Hanlin"?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Your signature is "Adele Hanlin," with the formal name ("Mrs.  Alan Hanlin") beneath it in parentheses on business letters, so unknown  recipients will know how to address you. A lady's name does not change on her  husband's death, and an honorific is not part of anyone's signature. Don't let  anyone tell you otherwise.  </P> <P> As for the Christmas cards, sign them "Adele Hanlin and Sean." Miss Manners  assumes that you do not make the mistake of sending social greetings to people  who know you so little as to be unaware that you are recently widowed and have  a son. You therefore run little risk of having them believe that you have taken  up with a gentleman too young to have a surname.  </P></p>

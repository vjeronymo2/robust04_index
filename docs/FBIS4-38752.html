			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report under the "Province" rubric: </F> "Yegor Gaydar Lifts Up Yaroslavl Country. Big Investors Start  Pouring in To Governor Lisitsyn"]    [Text] The Days of Yaroslavl Oblast festival was under way  in Moscow between 24 and 27 May. The oblast administration was  pleased with the festivities' results, after having taken stock  of them: Governor Anatoliy Lisitsyn announced at a news  conference that two main goals could be reached -- to attract  investments to the projects developed jointly with Gaydar's  Institute of Economic Problems of the Transition Period, and to  establish feedback between the capital and the major industrial  and cultural center of Russia.    More than 40 projects received support from Russian and  foreign investors. Mr. Lisitsyn pointed out, among the more  successful ones, a project worth $450 million to reconstruct an  oil refinery (and agreement was signed on a credit of $230  million from an export-import bank) and a program for the  construction of cottages developed jointly with the French firm  "Phoenix." French Ambassador Pierre Morel confirmed the  readiness of his government to provide a $40 million credit.    The successful fulfillment of the investment projects,  according to Mr. Lisitsyn became possible thanks to the regional  economy development program drawn up by the Gaydar Institute --  its specialists have been working in Yaroslavl Oblast since  1993. During this time, according to Yegor Gaydar, it has become  possible to identify the painful points in the structure of  industrial production and to convert the enterprises to turning  out products to match the current world trend. The institute  is currently working on a scheme to create financial-industrial  groups, and on a form of the local administration's  participation in the process of bankruptcy of enterprises.    Speaking about relations between the center and the region,  Mr. Lisitsyn pointed out that "now that the province has  acquired genuine independence, it is important to overcome the  lingering dependence on the center in the medium management  echelon." The constructive process was moving along  successfully at a time when, under Premier Ivan Silayev,  regional policy was shaped by Valeriy Makharadze: It was in his  time that the Union of Governors of Russia was formed. But  after Sergey Shakhray took over the charge of regional policy,  normal relations with Moscow virtually stopped. With the coming  into the government of Nikolay Yegorov, former governor of  Krasnodar Kray, "there may come a new stage of normalization of  relations between the center and the regions," the governor of  Yaroslavl Oblast stated.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / TUC moderniser strives for new horizons MR JOHN MONKS can have no illusions about the magnitude of his task regenerating British trade unionism after more than a decade of decline. His first testing week compelled him to address two audiences. In his inaugural speech as TUC general secretary on Wednesday he made a calm and reasoned appeal to the world beyond the conference hall. Here he appeared as the moderniser and competent manager, keen to show by his commonsense and efficiency that the TUC still has an important role to play. Ready to adapt to change, he assured his audience that his personal ambition was to lead 'a united TUC into the 21st century, spanning new horizons yet committed still to the enduring values of solidarity, unity and justice'. His speech may have lacked punch in its delivery but its content suggested that Mr Monks may turn out to be the most far-sighted reformer the TUC has seen since the era of George Woodcock more than 30 years ago. But then on Thursday we saw a different Mr Monks in action. Union leaders turned congress into what Mr Monks described as 'a bear hall' as they tore each other to bits over the electricians' return, after a six-year absence, to the TUC as a section of the recently merged AEEU engineering and electrical union. The sheer strength of feeling took many by surprise. The Berlin Wall may have fallen, the Soviet Union is dead, but the TUC is still convulsed by events at Mr Rupert Murdoch's print plant at Wapping more than seven years ago when members of the then EETPU electricians' union took printworkers' jobs during the bitter dispute. The hard left was displeased by Mr Monks' reaction to this particular inter-union war. One journal yesterday said: 'His first task under fire found him deploying the tactic of last resort. By making support for the general council retreat an issue of personal confidence he devalued his office.' In fact, the new TUC general secretary showed a steely courage under pressure that we have not seen in congress for a long time. His unprepared response was coherent and devastating. But then for more than 20 years he has been mediating between the warring factions behind the scenes at TUC headquarters. Mr Monks may have failed to achieve a final settlement over the return of the electricians but he did enough to show he has no intention of dodging hard questions. Thursday's debate suggests that too many union leaders want to settle old scores and ignore what is going on in the world beyond their own shrinking memberships. The row over the electricians was the only issue in the week at congress to clear the bars and fill the hall with fury. More important debates - on the future of labour law and how unions should respond to their decreasing memberships - provoked little interest. Few delegates showed much interest in new ideas. Human resource management was denounced. Performance-related pay found no friends. It was the marginalised Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM mineworkers' union, who stirred emotions with his advocacy of struggle. But Mr Monks knows well enough that if he is forced to devote his skills and energy in trying to prevent further civil wars between the unions, he will fail as a moderniser. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, was yesterday elected as TUC president for the next 12 months.</p>

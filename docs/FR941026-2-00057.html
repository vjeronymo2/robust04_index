			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Proposed Projects To Be Funded With FY 1994 and 1995 Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this announcement is to invite single year (up to seventeen months in duration) or up to thirty-six month proposals from eligible applicants to undertake any or all of the Phases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may apply for projects of up to 36 months duration. A multi-year project, requiring more than 12 months to develop and complete, affords applicants the opportunity to develop more complex and in-depth projects. Funding after the first 12 month budget period of an approved multi-year project is non-competitive and subject to availability of funds. (see Part E for further information)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phase I:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of Phase I is to conduct the research and planning needed to identify environmental impacts to Indian lands caused by Department of Defense activities on or near Indian lands and to plan for remedial investigations to determine and carry out a preliminary assessment of these problems. These activities may include, but not be limited to, the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;conduct site inspections to identify problems and causes related to DOD activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;identify and develop approaches to handle raw data that will assist in performing comprehensive environmental assessments of problems and causes related to DOD activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;identify approaches and develop methodologies which will be used to develop the activities to be undertaken in Phases II and III;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;identify other Federal agency programs, if any, that must be involved in mitigation activities and their requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;identify potential technical assistance and expertise required to address the activities to be undertaken in Phases II and III; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;identify other Federal environmental restoration programs that could be accessed to cooperatively coordinate and mobilize resources in addressing short and long-term activities developed under Phase III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phase I should result in adequately detailed documentation of the problems and sources of help in solving them to provide a useful basis for examining alternative mitigation approaches in Phase II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase II:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of Phase II activities is to examine alternative approaches for mitigation of the impacts identified in Phase I and to lead toward the mitigation design to be developed in Phase III. Phase II activities may include, but need not be limited to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;conduct remedial investigation and/or feasibility studies as necessary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;plan for the design of a comprehensive mitigation strategy to address problems identified during Phase I which address areas such as land use restoration, clean-up processes, contracting and liability concerns; regulatory responsibilities; and resources necessary to implement clean up actions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;design strategies that coordinate with or are complementary to existing DOD cleanup programs such as the Defense Environmental Restoration Program which promotes and coordinates efforts for the evaluation and cleanup of contamination at DOD installations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;review possible interim remedial strategies that address immediate potential hazards to the public health and environment in order to provide alternative measures i.e., providing alternate water supplies, removing concentrated sources of contaminants, or constructing structures to prevent the spread of contamination;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;identify specific types of technical assistance and management expertise required to assist in developing specific protocols for environmental assessments, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, interim remedial actions and strategic planning for existing and future mitigation activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;review other types of assessments that need to be considered, reviewed and incorporated into the conduct and/or design process such as:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _estimates of clean-up cost;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _estimate of impacts of short-term approach;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _estimate of impacts of long-term approach;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _cultural impacts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _economic impacts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _human health-risk impacts; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;document approaches and procedures which have been developed in order to negotiate with appropriate Federal agencies for necessary cleanup action and to keep the public informed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In establishing the basis for a design process, particularly when there are multiple problems, the applicants may want to consider a prioritization process as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;emergency situations that require immediate clean-up;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;time-critical sites, i.e. sites where the situation will deteriorate if action is not taken soon;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;projects with minimum funding requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;projects with intermediate-level funding requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;projects with maximum funding requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Achieving compliance with Federal environmental protection legislation is the driving force behind all Federal clean-up activities. The following is a list of major Federal environmental legislation that should be recognized in a regulatory review as all Federal, state and local regulatory requirements which could have major impacts in the design of mitigation strategies:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act of 1992;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Clean Air Act (CAA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Clean Water Act (CWA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Economists urge Emu fast track FOREIGN exchange markets need a fast-track move by Europe's strong currency countries towards closer monetary co-operation to convince them of the feasibility of economic and monetary union (Emu), a group of senior French economists said yesterday. The group, assembled by the Commissariat du Plan, the French government think-tank, issued a report calling for 'an informal Emu among the hard-core countries' of the present European Monetary System. This could start once the Maastricht treaty was ratified, and take the form of 'semi-institutional' agreements by the hard-core countries to stabilise their currency parities, the study said. Mr Jean-Michel Charpin, senior economist at the BNP bank who presided over the group study, said last September's monetary crisis had sown serious doubts in the markets about Emu's feasibility. These doubts could only be removed by a new initiative, he said. Creating a network of specially close monetary co-operation between some EC states would not be contrary to the Maastricht treaty, and could be achieved within the framework of the European Monetary Institute to be set up under the treaty, the report claimed. The report reflects similar sentiments inside the French presidency and in the opposition, which has pledged to give autonomous status to the Banque de France soon after its expected election victory this month. But, in contrast to the economists, most French politicians do not want to say anything in public which could jeopardise ratification of the Maastricht pact in Denmark and Britain.</p>

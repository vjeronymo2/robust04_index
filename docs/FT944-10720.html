			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Data General files suit against IBM Data General has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, charging that IBM has 'wilfully' infringed upon seven Data General patents for several years. A computer technology leader in the early 1980s, Data General is struggling to regain profitability as it switches from proprietary minicomputer technology to 'open systems' based on industry standards. In its suit, Data General alleges that IBM's two most profitable product lines - its System/390 mainframes and AS/400 minicomputers - incorporate patented technologies developed by Data General in the late 1970s. Data General is seeking 'compensatory damages' based on IBM's mainframe and minicomputer revenues. In its suit, Data General estimates that IBM's cumulative revenues from AS/400 systems have exceeded Dollars 25bn, while those from its System/390 mainframes, introduced in 1990, are more than Dollars 50bn. Data General claims IBM had known of its patents since the mid-1980s, but nonetheless had used the technology in its computer systems. 'IBM's infringement has been and continues to be wilful,' Data General said in its complaint. IBM said that it had not yet received a copy of the suit and declined further comment. Data General said the seven patents allegedly infringed by IBM were among more than 50 issued as the result of an ambitious computer design effort called the 'Fountainhead Project', undertaken in the 1970s, 'to design and develop the most advanced computer system of its time.' Data General's struggle to develop the world-beating computer is described in The Soul of a New Machine, a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winning book by Ms Tracy Kidder. The company is seeking a permanent injunction to bar IBM from further infringement of the patents by manufacturing and selling the S/390 mainframe and AS/400 mid-range computers. 'IBM will continue to infringe unless enjoined by this court,' the Data General lawsuit says.</p>

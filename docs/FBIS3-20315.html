			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Helsinki, March 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic is  the first post-communist country to enter the second phase of  reform, the post-transformation stage, Czech Premier Vaclav  Klaus said in a speech to the Paasikivi Society in Finland.    Klaus began his official visit on Thursday [24 March] and  returns to the Czech Republic on Sunday.    The first phase, the transformation phase, includes all the  basic reform measures. In the subsequent stage there are no  visible new reforms but the reform process is deepened and  improved. It is important to proceed with reform decisively and  rapidly throughout, he said.    He recalled a paper he read at a UN conference in Finland on  reforming centrally planned economies in June 1989 -- a few  months before the anti-communist revolution in Czechoslovakia.  His pre-revolutionary conclusions proved to be correct and were  confirmed after the Velvet Revolution, he said.    The Paasikivi Society, named after the Finnish president of  1946- 1956, was established in 1958 with the aim of developing  the study of foreign policy and became a basis of the Finnish  International Relations Institute.    Today Klaus also met Pertti Salolainen, the Finnish deputy  premier and minister of foreign trade. Salolainen is the chief  Finnish negotiator in talks with the European Union (EU), and  consequently his talks today with Klaus focused chiefly on EU  integration.    Salolainen said Finnish advice particularly on the EU's  regional and agricultural policy could be very useful to the  Czech Republic. In these areas Finland had had great  difficulties adapting to the European system, he said.    Salolainen explained that his country's two main reasons for  seeking EU membership were the possibility of developing closer  links to West European security structures through economic  integration, and secondly, psychologically, to assuage Finland's  feeling of isolation after the other Scandinavian countries  joined the EU.    The official part of Klaus's visit to Finland then ended  with  a ceremonial dinner held by Premier Esko Aho.    On Saturday morning Klaus and his wife will journey to  Lapland to spend a private weekend deep in the arctic circle in  Ivalo, where, well-informed sources say, he will drive snow  scooters and ride an a reindeer sled.</p>

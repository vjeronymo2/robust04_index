			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: True artist of the people - Joseph Beuys's 'social sculptures' 'Three artists above all define the possibilities of art today,' wrote Norman Rosenthal in 1991, going on to name Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys. Exhibitions of the work of Beuys are a fixture of the European and US museum circuit. In the UK, however, there has until now been no museum survey of his work. Praise, then, to the Tate Gallery, Liverpool for Joseph Beuys: the Revolution is Us, an exhibition of works from its collection, accompanied by a programme of events which seek both to place Beuys in the context of European and international art history, and to introduce his work to the widest possible audience by taking up its environmental and social themes in workshops and community events of all kinds. Beuys believed that everyone could be an artist, because for him society itself was the greatest and most profound work of art. In his immense range of activities he tried both to exemplify this principle and to convey it to as many people as he could. He did this very simply, making the most direct use of his life experience as well as the traditional skills (drawing, painting, sculpture) in which he received his artistic training. His legend has become well known. Born in 1921, he flew fighter planes during the Second World War. When he was shot down over the Crimea in 1943, the Tatar nomads who succoured him were the source of the materials of his subsequent artwork. The felt and fat in which they wrapped his broken body against the cold became the materials by which, through their use in sculptures, performances and installations, he sought to energise the creativity of all. His 'everyone is an artist' concept was not, however, an invitation to take up paint daubing or mucking about with clay. It was rather a challenge, a call to each individual, to contribute to that great 'social sculpture', the making of a world that is humane and fulfilling for everyone. Beuys did not just preach a doctrine, however. He put his words into action. He was sacked from his post of Professor of Monumental Sculpture at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf in 1973, for example, for refusing to abide by its discriminatory admissions policy. A founder member of the Green Party, in 1979 he stood unsuccessfully for election to the European Parliament. His latter work was increasingly involved with 'actions' to tackle environmental problems, such as the planting of 7,000 oak trees begun at Documenta VII in Kassel 1982. It is hard to convey the experience of attending one of his lectures or watching his extraordinary performances in which the slow repetition of actions, incomprehensible in themselves but the product of profound contemplation, gradually set up a mythic resonance. It was the description by Richard Demarco of the 'Three Pots Action' performed in Edinburgh in 1974 which finally turned its curator, Judith Nesbitt, too young to have seen any of the live work, and sceptical of the legend, into what she now describes with a laugh as 'a believer'. The exhibition, though small, is exemplary. The selected pieces from the collection, augmented by loans, are linked by their use of Celtic themes and locations in Scotland and Ireland, countries with close associations with Liverpool. They include as well as the Poorhouse piece four blackboards from a lecture at the Belfast Museum in 1974, and several vitrines. These contain objects using Beuys' essential materials, fat and felt and various metals, and, a link with Duchamp, dust. 'Vitrines' are a device much abused these days and it is good to see these originals, which powerfully conjure up the status of the museum and the authority of science to add gravitas to their esoteric contents. Beuys' 'science' was of his own making, combining his knowledge of history, plants and physical and chemical processes into a symbolic alchemy developed to support his philosophical investigations. The second room is devoted to the installation 'The End of the Twentieth Century.' I was fortunate enough to have my first sight of it courtesy of its maker. In the Gallery Schmela in Dusseldorf where it was first, our interview developed into a discussion that went on long past gallery closing time. Beuys left no plans to explain how the work, 31 basalt columns, each with a plug drilled out, wrapped in felt and clay and replaced, was to be displayed. Judith Nesbitt consulted his widow Eva, hoping for instructions. Do what seems right for you, feel comfortable, sit amongst the stones and have a cup of tea, she was told. Thus fortified, she has done a superb job. The stones seem to delight in the ample space, the diagonal thrust of their movement full of life and grace. For despite their weighty mass, the tumbled columns somehow manage to convey not collapse and despair but lightness and hope. It is a fitting summation of Beuys' philosophy that the fallen masonry of history should contain the potential for future growth. Joseph Beuys: The Revolution is Us. Tate Gallery Liverpool until January 3. Tel 051 709 3223.</p>

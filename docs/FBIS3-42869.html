According to official  sources, Russia's foreign trade turnover was $53.0 billion,  including exports--$35.4 billion and imports--$17.6 billion.)  and increased by 0.8 percent as compared to January-November  1992.    Russia's exports were equal to $41.2 billion and  increased by 14.2 percent, including to industrially developed  countries--$24.7 billion, increasing 17.0 percent; to developing  countries--$5.8 billion, 56 percent; and other countries (former  CEMA countries, the republics of the former Yugoslavia, China,  the DPRK, and the Baltic countries)--$10.7 billion, and they  decreased by 4.9 percent. In November 1993 exports of products  amounted to $4.2 billion or 3 percent more than in November  1992. Exports (according to official sources) of the most  important goods during 11 months of this year were characterized  by the following data:                          Quantity         Value,           In % of                                         millions of      January-November 1992                                         dollars   Crude oil, millions   74               7,670            124  of tonnes   Natural gas,          83               6,337            104  billions of cubic  meters   Petroleum products,   32               3,175            141  millions of tonnes   Hard coal             18               589              110   Iron ore and          6.0              146              83  concentrates,  millions of tonnes   Mineral               9.7              742              79  fertilizers,  millions of tonnes   Ammonia, millions     2.6              205              124  of tonnes   Methanol, thousands   774              627              82  of tonnes   Synthetic rubber,     133              116              105  thousands of tonnes    Round timber,         10               591              130  millions of cubic  meters   Paper pulp,           653              163              198  thousands of tonnes    Iron, millions of     2.0              204              129  tonnes   Aluminum, millions    1.2              1,058            151  of tonnes   Machines and          --               2,492            77  equipment      The prevailing tendency in foreign trade was expansion of  the  scale of exports abroad of natural resources (timber, petroleum  fish), ferrous metals, mineral fertilizers, and electric energy  against a background of reduction of exports in a number of  other commodity groups.    Imports during January-November 1993 amounted to  $27.4 billion, which in current prices is 14 percent less than  during the corresponding period of 1992, including from  industrially developed countries--$17.0 billion (a reduction of  16 percent); developing countries--$5.2 billion (an increase of  26 percent); and other countries--$5.2 billion (a reduction of  31 percent). During November 1993 $2.9 billion worth of goods  were purchased through imports, or 5 percent less than during  November 1992. The reduction of imports was determined by the  reduction of the amounts of centralized import operations.    Imports (Footnote 2) (According to official sources) of the  most important goods during January-November 1993 were  characterized by the following figures:                        Quantity         Value,           In % of                                       millions of      January-November 1992                                       dollars   Grain, millions     9.2              1,323            34  of tonnes   Fresh frozen        70               102              25  meat, thousands  of tonnes   Raw sugar,          1,660            493              79  thousands of  tonnes   Refined sugar,      715              285              52  thousands of  tonnes   Fresh apples,       44               19               57  thousands of  tonnes   Coffee, thousands   12               30               44  of tonnes   Tea, thousands of   46               104              100.4  tonnes   Medications         --               224              24   Textile clothing    --               646              80   Knitted clothing    --               238              39   Leather footwear,   13               193              35  millions of pair   Ferrous metals      --               142              50   Machines and        --               5,923            48  equipment      Purchases through imports of fresh potatoes, wheat flour,  soy  oil, leather clothing, and fur clothing decreased more than  10-fold.    There was an increase in the imports of butter (73 percent),  citrus fruits (84 percent), and natural rubber (2.2-fold) but  this was related to the low volumes of procurements of these  products last year.    Russia's foreign economic ties with its main trading  partners  during January-November 1993 were characterized by the following  data:                   Exports                         Imports                  millions    in % of             millions    in % of                 of          January-November    of          January-November                 dollars     1992                dollars     1992   Germany        5,375       102                 5,981       99   China          2,900       125                 1,988       135   Italy          2,958       117                 1,296       48   United         1,854       309                 1,868       72  States   Japan          1,814       132                 1,530       100.3   Great          2,007       96                  807         163  Britain   France         1,643       90                  1,183       97   Hungary        1,538       117                 613         61   Austria        1,390       239                 796         89   Finland        1,452       109                 592         56   Switzerland    1,358       182                 653         150      The foreign trade balance during 11 months of 1993 was  positive in the amount of $13.8 billion (for the corresponding  period of last year it was positive in the amount of $4.1  billion).    The balance of payments of Russia (not including  the CIS countries) during January-November 1993 was  characterized by a positive foreign trade balance and growth of  foreign assets of commercial banks and state reserves of Russia:                                               billions of dollars   Trade balance                              12.8   export of goods                            41.2   import of goods                            -27.4   technical aid                              -2.0   Balance of services                        -0.5   export of services                         2.5   import of services                         -3.0   Revenues (interest on bank credit)         -1.5   receipts according to schedule             3.5   payments according to schedule             -5.4   Transfers                                  2.5   to Russia                                  3.0   from Russia                                -0.5   ACCOUNT OF CURRENT OPERATIONS              13.2   Direct investments                         0.3   in Russia                                  1.5   abroad                                     -1.2   Portfolio investments                      0.1   in Russia                                  0.4   abroad                                     -0.3   Other investments (credits)                0.1   attracted credits                          4.0   payments on main debt (according to        -13.0  schedule)   granted credits                            0.1   revenues on main debt (according to        12.0  schedule)   other capital (assets and liabilities of   -5.0  commercial banks)   Delays and postponements of payments on    18.0  interest and main debt   Delays and postponements of revenues       -16.0  from interest and basic debt   ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL           0.5  OPERATIONS   RESERVES                                   -3.0   OMISSIONS AND MISTAKES                     -10.7   OVERALL BALANCE                            0.0      PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS. As compared to 1992 the influx  of foreign investments into the Russian economy during 1993  increased, although it remained insignificant as compared to the  demand. Its declared volume exceeds $400 million as compared to  $290 million in 1992. The number of registered enterprises with  foreign capital (PII) will approach 12,000, that is, it will be  approximately double what it was at the end of 1992.    The investment of capital by foreign companies did not  develop in a uniform way throughout 1993. A certain increase in  investments during the summer period was followed by a decline  beginning in October of this year as a reaction to certain  political events: although the number of enterprises registered  with the RASMiR [expansion not identified] in October stayed at  the September level--390, the volume of declared investments  dropped almost 10-fold (from $115.7 million to $13.8 million).  In November of this year 442 enterprises with foreign capital  were registered, whose volume of declared investments amounted  to $65.3 million.    During the course of the year there was a sharp change in  the  ratio between investments of Russian and foreign partners:  During the first half the foreigners' share of the declared  authorized capital remained stable at an average of 52.5  percent. During the subsequent period (July-August) it increased  significantly--to 75-80 percent, and during October-November it  decreased to 36 percent.    The development of the aforementioned tendencies is  predetermined above all by the crisis condition of the economy  and also the instability and imperfection of the legal base for  foreign investments and entrepreneurial activity as a whole. As  before, it is mainly small enterprises that are being created.    In spite of the doubling of the number of enterprises  operating with foreign investments (to 6,239 as of 1 November)  their share in the volume of industrial production is reaching  no more than 2.5 percent, although their significance in the  sphere of foreign economic activity is growing: according to  estimates, during 10 months of this year they accounted for more  than 6 percent of Russia's exports and about 13 percent of  imports.    The activity of enterprises with foreign investments is  beginning to have an effect on the solution to the problem of  employment: the number of people working at these enterprises as  of 1 November of this year was 274,000, an increase of 110,000  individuals as compared to the beginning of the year.    The branch priorities chosen by foreign capital investors  and  their Russian partners largely fail to coincide with the  priorities of the structural policy of the Russian government.  They are drawn mainly to the sphere of services and are not  adequately represented in machine building, particularly in the  production of science-intensive products. At the same time in  1993 foreign investments were more actively attracted to the  sphere of conversion of enterprises of the defense industry,  above all the aviation industry and the production of means of  communication and medical equipment. In the volume of oil  production, enterprises with foreign capital account for 3  percent.    In the second half of 1993 there were signs of a livelier  interest on the part of foreign partners in the process of  Russian privatization of state and municipal enterprises,  although the mechanism for attracting them remains imperfect in  this case. Foreign firms or, on their instructions, Russian  legal entities purchased blocks of shares in privatized  enterprises of the tobacco, food, sewing, chemical, and certain  other branches of industry. As a rule, the foreign firms are  obligated to make large investments in modernization and  expansion of production capacities.    Thus the German concern Siemens acquired 10 percent of the  shares in the Kaluga Turbine Plant and in August 1993 concluded  an agreement with it for cooperation in the production and sale  in Russia and abroad of steam turbines with a capacity of up to  35 megawatts. The transnational corporation Proctor and Gamble  intended to acquire at an open trading session 14 percent of the  shares in the Novomoskovskbytkhim Joint-Stock Company, the  largest producer of means of chemical dry cleaning in the CIS.  Over five years the corporation has invested another $50 million  in this joint-stock company in exchange for an additional  proportion of the shares. The English company Illingworth Morris  purchased 49 percent of the shares in the Bolshevichka factory,  the largest in Russia. The firm is investing 3.64 million pounds  sterling in technology, personnel training, and licensing. The  Swiss firm Nordwest AG has acquired 20 percent of the shares in  the Cherepovets Amofos Joint-Stock Company and has made a  commitment to invest about $8 million in this enterprise.    The entry of foreign banks and insurance companies into the  Russian financial market became more active in 1993.    On 27 September of this year the president of the Russian  Federation issued Edict No. 1466 "On Improvement of Work with  Foreign Investments." The edict earmarks a program of measures  for stabilization of the legal situation of foreign investors,  considerable improvement of the activity of federal  administrative organs in this sphere, the development and  adoption of state programs for stimulating an influx of foreign  capital into priority branches, and so forth. Thus real  preconditions are being created for a marked improvement of the  Russian investment climate. Preparations are being completed on  proposals for making changes and additions to the Law "On  Foreign Investments in the RSFSR" and the Laws "On Concessions"  and "On Free Economic Zones."    It should be emphasized that against the background of the  overall decline of industrial production in the country, many  enterprises with foreign capital managed to increase their  production in 1993. Thus during the first three quarters of this  year as compared to the corresponding period of last year they  increased production as follows: oil (including gas  condensate)--1.9-fold, secondary aluminum--twofold, and  steel--43 percent. There was a significant increase in the  volume of production of a number of consumer goods, especially  sewn and knitted items. At the same time the output of footwear  and fabrics decreased. There was a marked increase in the  production of bakery items, meat and sausage items, and frozen  fish. At the same time the decline in production in machine  building did not bypass enterprises with foreign capital: the  production of trailers for motor vehicles did not increase. In  1993 there was an appreciable increase in the output of personal  computers--2.8-fold.    The influx of foreign investments into the Russian economy  is  modest in scale and clearly does not correspond to the potential  demand for them or the capabilities of the world investment  market, where competition from other capital recipient countries  is becoming stiffer.    The RUBLE EXCHANGE RATE, which is established according to  results of trading at the MMVB [Moscow International Foreign  Currency Exchange], after stabilization during the first 10 days  of November, began to drop gradually and by the beginning of  December amounted to 1,231 rubles per U.S. dollar as compared to  1,181 rubles at the beginning of November. The demand for  foreign currency exceeded the supply, which brought about a  reduction of the ruble exchange rate. The volume of sales for  November exceeded 1.6 billion rubles and increased by 29.5  percent as compared to October. By the end of the year a certain  increase in the ruble exchange rate is expected in connection  with the end of the fiscal year, which is confirmed by trading  at the beginning of December.

The ruble exchange  rate was 9.5 times greater than the parity of buying power in  1992, and in 1993--5.3 times greater.    FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH NEARBY FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  This year, as in preceding years, mutual deliveries are not  providing for the fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements.  Still suppliers of the Russian Federation are fulfilling their  commitments to their partners in nearby foreign countries at a  higher level. The dispatch of fuel resources, the main commodity  exported from Russia, during 11 months of this year amounted to  65-90 percent of the annual volumes. Coal delivery was ahead of  schedule (160 percent).    Deliveries from Russia to CIS countries were fulfilled  during  the 10 months of this year for oil--by 63 percent, gas--73  percent, gasoline--84 percent, diesel fuel--58 percent, and  furnace fuel--71 percent.    Deliveries of meat, cooking salt, and sugar from the Ukraine  were fulfilled during this period at a level of 12-52 percent.  Delivery shortfalls of MAZ and BelAZ trucks from Belarus  amounted to 40 percent, and meat and meat products--44 percent.  Of the 3 million tonnes of grain envisioned under the agreement,  Kazakhstan delivered more than 800,000 tonnes and there were  considerable shortfalls in the deliveries of wool, synthetic  fibers, and nonferrous metals. During the aforementioned period  the cotton growing republics of Central Asia delivered to  enterprises of Russia 60 percent of the amount of cotton fiber  (about 500,000 tonnes) that was supposed to be delivered on a  mutually coordinated basis.    In certain cases the delivery shortfalls were caused by the  refusal of Russian enterprises to purchase products from nearby  foreign countries because of the excessively high prices for  them.    The regulation of mutual settlements and payments is of  decisive significance for the development of economic relations  with CIS countries.    The indebtedness of the CIS countries on state credit  granted  to them by Russia exceeds the Russian debt by 2.3 trillion  rubles (approximately $5 billion). Moreover, the debt of  enterprises and organizations of the CIS countries for goods and  services received (according to figures as of the beginning of  November 1993) exceeds creditor indebtedness by 3.5 trillion  rubles. Of this sum, 1.5 trillion rubles is from indebtedness to  enterprises of the fuel and energy complex.</p>

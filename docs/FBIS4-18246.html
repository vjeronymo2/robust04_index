			<p>BFN     [Text] The Algerian Government has decided to extend its  territorial waters. According to a draft decree-law, they will  be extended 30 miles to the east, toward the Italian coastline  and 53 miles -- that is nearly 100 kilometers -- to the west,  toward the Spanish coast.    Fisheries Minister Vicente Albero underlined that Algeria is  sovereign in its decision to extend its territorial waters.  According to Albero, in order to continue fishing, one will have  to sign fishing agreements with Algeria and create joint  ventures with capital from Algeria and from a Community country.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> NOSTALGIA OF YESTERYEAR RETURNS IN 'THE BRADYS'  </P> <P> Come with us now to the days of yesteryear as "The Brady Bunch" returns from  sitcom limbo.  </P> <P> "The Bradys" returns at 8 tonight with a two-hour movie (Channels 2 and 8) that  will be followed in succeeding weeks by hourlong installments.  </P> <P> It reunites all but one of the cast from the original 1969-74 series.  </P> <P> And gee, don't they look good? But what's all this relevancy stuff?  </P> <P> Jan (Eve Plumb) wants a baby, so she and husband Philip (Ron Kuhlman) spend  their time leaping into bed. Peter (Christopher Knight) has just broken off his  fourth engagement. Greg (Barry Williams) is an obstetrician married to his  nurse (Caryn Richman). Little Cindy (Susan Olsen -- with the pigtails,  remember?) is a rock 'n' roll deejay.  </P> <P> Marcia, played by Leah Ayres (replacing Maureen McCormick from the original  cast), has two kids and is married to out-of-work Wally (Jerry Hauser). They've  all moved in with Mom and Dad. Mom (Florence Henderson) is now a successful  real-estate agent and Dad (Robert Reed) is still a successful architect. And  yes, Ann B. Davis is back as Alice, the housekeeper.  </P> <P> It's Bobby (Michael Lookinland) around whom the action revolves. About to  triumph as a professional race car driver, he crashes and is paralyzed, perhaps  for life. But he's got an old girlfriend (Martha Quinn) waiting in the wings if  he can just swallow his pride.  </P> <P> Don't worry, though. Relevancy may have been the intention, but director Bruce  Bilson sticks to '70s-sitcom actions and reactions with a masterful disregard  for dramatic context.  </P> <P> He's aided and abetted by writers Sherwood Schwartz and Lloyd J. Schwartz, who  go for nostalgia with the same simplistic dialogue and contrived, sweet  situations we remember from the old days. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: US economy Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, looks like a man determined to keep his options open. Those looking for hints of further easing in yesterday's congressional testimony may draw some satisfaction from his admission of disappointment with the pace of economic recovery in the second quarter. The same goes for the assertion that US inflation is to sink to a level lower than has been sustained for 25 years. Those expecting no change in policy will point to the forecast of increased economic momentum and the excuse, in the form of changed velocity, for money supply growth stuck below target. The Fed may now be in a reactive mode in which it will ease policy again if the recovery does not pick up over the summer. But implicit in Mr Greenspan's remarks is a degree of doubt on whether a further fall in short term rates would help. The real need is to keep long term rates headed lower to encourage mortgage refinancing and ease the burden of consumer debt. If Mr Greenspan's natural inclination yesterday was to reassure the politicians about growth, he will also have been anxious to ensure that the markets heard his message on inflation.</p>

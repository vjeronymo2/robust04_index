The commenters stated that if the loan is rehabilitated, the lender purchasing the rehabilitated loan will be required to disclose new terms. The commenters further stated that if the borrower has a written statement from the guaranty agency, but not from the lender, the borrower may be able to claim that he or she has no legal obligation to abide by the terms established by the rehabilitating lender.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary did not intend to require the guaranty agency to disclose new repayment terms on the rehabilitation loan. The Secretary agrees that it would be more appropriate for the disclosure to be done by the purchasing lender. Rather, the Secretary merely intended the guaranty agency to provide written confirmation of the agency's determination of the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount, the number of consecutive monthly payments that must be made to qualify for consideration for loan rehabilitation, any deadlines attached to those payments, and any factors the agency will consider in determining whether the repurchase of the borrower's loan is practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 682.405(b)(1)(iv) of the regulations has been revised to require the guaranty agency to provide a written statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount and other conditions surrounding the loan rehabilitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the guaranty agencies be required to inform borrowers who enter into a renewed eligibility plan of the possibility of loan rehabilitation after 12 months. The commenters suggested that by doing so borrowers can make informed decisions about whether exercising the option after 12 payments is to their advantage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a guaranty agency should be required to inform a borrower when entering into an agreement to reinstate loan eligibility of the possibility of loan rehabilitation after an additional six monthly payment amounts and the potential consequences of loan rehabilitation. The Secretary believes that a borrower should be provided sufficient information about the circumstances and potential consequences of loan rehabilitation to have an understanding of what is expected before making the required 12 monthly payments. Borrowers should be aware of, for example, that a potential increase in loan payment amounts may be necessary once the loan is repurchased by the lender if the reasonable and affordable monthly payment amount paid to the guaranty agency will not provide for the borrower to repay the loan within the 10-year maximum repayment period. The Secretary agrees that providing this information will place the borrower in a position to make an informed decision of whether or not to exercise his or her option for loan rehabilitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations have been revised to provide that guaranty agencies must inform borrowers of the consequences of loan rehabilitation after 12 months. Additionally, a new paragraph has been added as &sect;682.401(b)(4)(iv) to require guaranty agencies to provide information to defaulted borrowers who made the required series of monthly payments to reinstate Title IV eligibility of the possibility of loan rehabilitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.406(a)(14)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters recommended that the regulations be revised to reflect the 1993 Technical Amendments change that provides that the guaranty agencies certify that diligent attempts of skip-tracing have been made by the lender under &sect;682.411 before receiving reinsurance payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters suggested that the regulations should indicate that the guaranty agency assures the Secretary that diligent attempts have been made by the lender and the guaranty agency under &sect;682.411 to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 428(c)(2)(G) of the HEA, as changed by the 1993 Technical Amendments, provides that the guaranty agency may not receive reinsurance payments unless it  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> certifies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that diligent attempts have been made to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques. As pointed out in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the Secretary believes that it is primarily a lender responsibility to locate the borrower through the use of skip-tracing techniques. However, the Secretary intends that diligent attempts must be made by either the lender or the agency to locate the borrower. The language of the regulations is intended to insure that if the lender does not perform the required skip-tracing, the guaranty agency will be responsible for doing so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

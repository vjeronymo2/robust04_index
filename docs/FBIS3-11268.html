			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview via telephone with U.S. Congressman Charles </F> Rangel by Roberto Cavada and Ana Margarita Gill on the "Doing  Radio" program -- live, passages in quotes are in English]    [Text] [Cavada] For some days now we have been trying to  make an international call to U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel,  who just two days ago presented a bill to the Congress to  establish free trade between the United States and Cuba. From a  hotel in Miami I have Mr. Charles Rangel on the line, who will  give an international news conference. Ana Margarita Gill will  serve as interpreter for us and for Mr. Rangel. From Havana,  good morning.    [Gill] "Good morning, Mr. Rangel. We are calling you from  Havana Cuba, and we would like to ask you about details  concerning your projects to ease or establish free commerce  between Cuba and the United States.    [Rangel] "Well, as you know, the U.S. has always felt that  Cuba with association with the Soviet Union represented a threat  to our national security and as a result of that it established  the embargo some 34 years ago. It is my opinion and that of many  members of the Congress that that threat no longer exists if it  existed at all and that the embargo should be removed. I had  hearings on this bill, and we have had many people in the  Congress to agree. And I think that with all the witnesses,  there is an overwhelming belief that the purposes that existed  for the embargo before do not exist now and that it should be  removed.    "The problems that we do have is that there are many people  in the United States who believe that the rights of Cuban people  to speak their minds and the terms of the type of government  that they would have are held in jeopardy if they speak out  against the Cuban Government. The Cuban Government, of course,  says that this is not so, that people do have the opportunity to  say anything that they want, and so, therefore, I think that now  that we have established an area of differences that we also can  establish an area of debate and that is exactly where we are at  this moment.    [Gill] "Thank you so much I will translate for a few  seconds." He states that the embargo, or the blockade, is  established due to relations between Cuba and the United States.  At the present moment this situation has changed completely, and  if there is an area of differences there should also be an area  of dialogue and mutual exchange.    [Cavada] The listeners would like to know about the future  of  your bill. What other steps would be followed because the Cuba  people are interested in learning of this future.    [Gill] "Mr. Rangel, which will be the next steps in Congress  concerning the project?    [Rangel] "Well, since there is an overwhelming feeling that  the embargo has nothing to do with the security of the United  States and since many of the business people believe that indeed  the United States is losing as a result of not participating in  trade with Cuba, as we have established with the North America  Free Trade Agreement, then what remains is some concern about  the type of government and the type of conditions that exist as  relates to the human rights of the Cubans. Of course some of us  believe, that support the bill, that the embargo has caused an  undo hardship in terms of lack of food and medicine, in terms of  the pain and suffering of the people in Cuba. So, when people  have said that many Cubans have been arrested and placed in jail  because their only crime was to speak out in support of  democracy, other people have said that that is not so.    "In my opinion, if that is not so and that is the only  reason  why we are not establishing trade and a normal relationship with  Cuba so that we can enjoy each other's culture and education and  advancements in medicine and of course in commerce, then it  would seem that perhaps our government should start talking and  remove what appears to be the only obstacle as relates [words  indistinct].    [Gill] "Thank you so much Mr. Rangel."    [Rangel] Good morning. [in Spanish]    [Gill] Good morning. Let us summarize what he said. He said  that, currently, there is an overwhelming feeling about the fact  that U.S. security has nothing to do with Cuba and that much is  being said about the alleged violation of human rights in Cuba.  He says that there is no greater violation than the pain and  suffering that the embargo or blockade is causing to our people.  That the time has come for the United States and Cuba to enjoy  each other's culture and education and that they should sit down  to talk. In short, that is the message of Mr. Charles Rangel.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Care on African debt relief Sir, Oxfam's overseas director, Stewart Wallis ('Africa needs new economic medicine', April 6) would be better off continuing to encourage private donations in support of Oxfam's excellent famine-relief and other developmental work in Africa. The charity is right to expose failed public-sector strategies; but compounds the problem by urging Group of Seven nations to throw more money and unconditional, debt forgiveness at often corrupt and unaccountable ruling elites. After recent elections in Angola, Liberia, Ghana, Zambia and Kenya, most government officials have not improved their moral behaviour. Transparency and accountability are still absent. Flight capital represents up to 80 per cent of national GDPs, according to most recent World Bank statistics. G7 nations should link long-term amortised debt forgiveness with demands for tightly monitored, ongoing accountability by African governments. Forgiving the debts of miscreant ruling elites will not help Africa's poorest people. Karl A Ziegler, The Centre for Accountability and Debt Relief, 6 Bradbrook House, Kinnerton Street, London SW1X 8EL</p>

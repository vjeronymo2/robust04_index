			<p>BFN     [Text] On 15 April the press center of the Security Service  of Ukraine reported that Swedish subject Erik Olaf Estenson,  born in 1962, who was temporarily staying on the territory of  our state, was expelled from Ukraine for attempts to carry out  actions which can be qualified as international nuclear  terrorism in relation to a foreign state.    As UNIAN learned from reliable sources, the Swedish subject  was seeking contacts with relevant specialists with the aim of  taking nuclear warhead components away from Ukraine. According  to unofficial data, the organization which, presumably, tasked  Estensson has not yet been disclosed.</p>

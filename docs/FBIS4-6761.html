			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said on Tuesday the country should launch sweeping rural  development programs upon the inauguration of the World Trade  Organization (WTO) next year.    "We should depart from the old-fashioned view of agriculture  being a declining primary industry," he said. "We should  instead establish a new future-oriented perception that  agriculture is a developing secondary or tertiary food industry."    While talking with the members of the Rural Development  Committee, a presidential advisory organ, at Chongwadae  [presidential office], the president said it is especially  important to improve educational, medical, cooperative and  marketing systems in the rural areas.    The Rural Development Committee reported to the president a  set of programs being planned to improve rural conditions.    Also on Tuesday, President Kim met nine American promoters  of  a Korean war memorial program. The visitors included William  Livesey, one-time commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea. The  visitors said they were promoting the construction of a large  Korean- and Vietnam- war memorial education center in  Pennsylvania.    "I hope the projected education center will become a  significant space helpful to enhancing friendship between the  peoples of Korea and the United States," President Kim said.</p>

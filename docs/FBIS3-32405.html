The foreign minister said Brazil  refuses "to admit the imposition of other countries' laws"  within its territory, alluding to the Torricelli Law which  punishes U.S. companies that do business with Cuba, even though  they are subsidiaries installed in other countries.    Amorim's observations came during a speech at a lunch  offered  in honor of Cuba's Vice President Carlos Lage who began a  two-day visit to Brasilia today. Amorim expressed hope that the  political changes being implemented in Cuba today will "help to  facilitate, as we all wish, Cuba's full reinsertion in the  hemisphere's coexistence."    The Brazilian foreign minister said Brazil and Cuba can join  forces "to overcome our weaknesses," citing as examples the  benefits that might be derived from the recent bilateral  agreement for the purchase of medicines in Cuba; exchanges in  the agroindustrial field, particularly on sugar and alcohol; and  bilateral scientific and technical cooperation.    The Cuban vice president said that during his conversation  with Amorim the Brazilian foreign minister reiterated Brazil's  position against the U.S. embargo on Cuba. "The embargo has  caused our country many difficulties and it is important that it  is rejected by all Latin American countries," Carlos Lage said.</p>

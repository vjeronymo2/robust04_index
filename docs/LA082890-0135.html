			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: RESERVISTS ADOPT A HEALTHIER VIEW OF MILITARY CRAP SHOOT  </P> <P> Last week's call-up of military reserves by President Bush struck some painful  chords here. It reminded me of a period from mid-1950 through 1951 when  President Harry Truman did the same thing. And I was sitting on the catbird  seat.  </P> <P> At that time, there were two types of miliary reservists: active and inactive  (they go by different names today). The active reservists were the weekend  warriors, the men and women who drilled once a month, went to a two-week summer  camp and continued to be an integral part of the military. For this they were  paid, and the time could also be accumulated to provide for a higher rank and a  substantial pension after 20 years.  </P> <P> The inactive reserve was made up of people like me who developed certain skills  during World War II that were deemed vital enough that we weren't permitted out  of the reserves. There was nothing voluntary about our reserve status. We were  in because they wouldn't let us out.  </P> <P> I wanted out. I had spent four years on active duty in World War II and had  amassed almost 2,000 flying hours when the war ended. I was saturated with both  the military and flying, and I wanted to be a civilian again as soon as  possible. The peacetime military held no charm for me.  </P> <P> So in the five years between the end of World War II and the beginning of the  Korean War, I was surely the most inactive reservist in military history. There  were times I didn't even read my mail from the military. When I went back to  college at war's end, I was married and had one child. When Korea came along, I  had three children, a mortgage on a house and my first decent-paying job. I was  beginning to sell writing to magazines and taking part in another war --  especially one as fuzzy as the Korean conflict -- was rock bottom on the list  of things I wanted to do.  </P> <P> Most of my World War II buddies felt the same way -- but not all of them took  the same route. There were two groups in particular who were attracted to the  active reserve. First, those who were still enamored of flying and wanted the  chance to play with military aircraft free of charge. And, second, those who  wanted to build up rank and hang out with the reserves until they could collect  retirement pay.  </P> <P> There seemed little risk in the active reserve route then. After all, we'd just  brought two superpowers to their knees and won the second war to end wars.  Surely there would be a long enough grace period for these veterans to reach  retirement age.  </P> <P> The reasoning was OK, and if I hadn't been so turned off by the military, I  might have considered it, too. But my first day of the peacetime Navy gave me  all the inkling I needed. The day after the Japanese surrendered, officers were  ordered to begin wearing ties at all times on the crummy island where I was  then stationed. And shortly thereafter, my return home was almost delayed  because I had lost two pieces of flight gear that the Navy routinely burned  when it was turned in.  </P> <P> So when Truman began calling up the reserves to go to Korea, the bleats from my  peers who chose to remain in the active reserves were loud and anguished. And  that's when I began to develop the hard-nosed attitude I have today about  weekend warriors.  </P> <P> Whatever reason prompts a person to join the reserves -- patriotism, money,  retirement, the chance to sharpen skills or play war without danger, a need to  get away from the old lady or the old man -- there is also a risk implicit in  that decision: the risk that they may be called to active duty for a multitude  of reasons. That's why I don't feel particularly sorry for them if that  happens. It's a crap shoot, and you win some and lose some.  </P> <P> But I felt pretty sorry for myself during the Korean War because the Truman  call-up reached into many thousands of inactive reservists. We had a pretty  good network going among ourselves and we knew when inactive reservists with  our skills began getting called up.  </P> <P> It was a miserable year for me. I dreaded going home to look at the mail, and I  was paranoid about telegrams. A lot of my inactive reservist buddies went to  Korea, and some of them were killed. But this time the dice rolled right for  me. I was never called.  </P> <P> After Korea the risk of being sent into combat as a reservist went down  considerably, even though we spent almost 10 years bogged down militarily in  Vietnam. The Establishment reason was that we needed the reserves as a backup  force at home for trouble spots that might develop elsewhere. In my opinion,  the real reason was that Lyndon Johnson -- with steadily declining support at  home for our involvement in Vietnam -- couldn't risk sending the reserves  overseas because they were mostly made up of the sons of middle and upper-class  Americans whom Johnson didn't care to antagonize.  </P> <P> Our current vice president of the United States was one of those people. For  all his protestations, the reserves provided a haven for a lot of young men  with clout to avoid combat. I'm not judging this. I think I would have used any  device that came to hand to avoid going to Vietnam. I just wish J. Danforth  Quayle could have been honest about it.  </P> <P> Joining the reserves -- along with graduate studies in college, putting braces  on teeth and phonied-up physical infirmities -- provided safe houses for those  who had the necessary resources to avoid Vietnam. The ultimate hypocrites were  eligible draftees (and their parents) who used such means and then castigated  those who fled to Canada. That's why I get a little queasiness in the pit of my  stomach when I hear all this unctuous talk about the reserves of that period  representing the ultimate in patriotism. The young men without clout who were  drafted and sent to fight that miserable war were the real heroes.  </P> <P> It's certainly understandable, however, that the failure to activate the  reserves en masse for combat duty in Vietnam may have had more than a passing  influence in persuading some of the current reservists to join up. If so, it  must have come as a bit of a shock when George Bush reached into the reserves  very quickly in the current Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> The quotes that I've been reading from Orange County reservists in the  newspaper make it appear that we have a very different crew here. They are  hardly ecstatic but most have accepted their military responsibilities  matter-of-factly even though it will mean a considerable dislocation for many  of them in their civilian lives. Without debating the merit of what Bush is  doing in the Persian Gulf, this attitude on the part of reservists is healthy  and the way it should be.  </P> <P> We've come a long way in establishing the identity of the reserves since those  frenetic months in Korea and those tragic years in Vietnam. Maybe we've hit on  the right formula now. But let's all hope that the reserves who have been  called up will all be back at their civilian jobs in a few months. Or sooner.  </P></p>

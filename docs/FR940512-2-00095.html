			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property on January 14, 1994, from Donnie M. Jones, MAI (Jones), a real estate appraiser located in Port Arthur, Texas. Jones represents that he is not related in any way to the Plan or the Union. Utilizing the income, cost and sales comparison approaches to value, Jones estimated that the Property had a fair market value of $462,800 as of the date of the appraisal. By letter dated March 1, 1994, Jones stated that he was aware, in preparing the appraisal, that the Plan was the prospective buyer of the Property and that this knowledge had no influence on his calculation of value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Plan now proposes to purchase the Property from the Union so that the Plan itself will own the training and educational facilities used to train journeymen and apprentices. Plan fiduciaries note that ownership of the Property will give the Plan full control of the buildings, grounds and parking lots and will enable the Plan to make improvements to the Property as needed. The Plan will pay no more than current fair market value for the Property, as established by an updated independent appraisal. The purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the purchase. The applicant represents that, after the purchase of the Property, the Plan will have more than enough funds for operational purposes of the training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Plan and the Union have selected Joseph P. Connors, Sr. (Connors), an attorney with the firm of Connors Associates, Inc. in Washington, DC to serve as independent fiduciary in regard to the proposed transaction. The applicant represents that Connors is independent of the Plan and the Union. Connors states that he has had extensive experience working with Taft-Hartley plans, including serving as chairman of funds of the United Mine Workers. Connors further states that he is well aware that while acting as independent fiduciary he assumes personal liability and he must act solely in the interest of the Plan and its participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Connors maintains that the proposed transaction is definitely in the best interests of the Plan. In this regard, Connors has met with officers of the Union and trustees of the Plan and has made an inspection of the Property with Russell Allen, the training director for the Plan. The Plan has operated an apprenticeship program utilizing the Property since the initial time of construction in 1968. As independent fiduciary, Connors will make certain that the Plan pays no more than fair market value for the Property and will enforce all rights of the Plan in regard to the proposed transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) The purchase of the Property will give the Plan ownership of the facilities it uses for its apprenticeship training program; (2) an independent fiduciary has determined that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants; (3) the Plan will pay no more than fair market value for the Property, based on an updated independent appraisal; (4) the purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash; and (5) the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Paul Kelty of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8883.

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY TO FIGHT OVER RETIREE INSURANCE  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to fight a judge's order that the  county provide medical coverage for thousands of retired county workers whose  insurance benefits were slashed more than a decade ago.  </P> <P> The supervisors reached an agreement to appeal the March 9 ruling by Superior  Court Judge Claude M. Owens during a closed-door executive session after  Tuesday's regular board meeting in Santa Ana, county officials said. Board  members declined to comment on their decision because of the litigation.  </P> <P> In his ruling earlier this month, Owens chastised the county for its "cavalier"  decision to discontinue the insurance coverage and said its actions violated an  obscure state law governing medical benefits.  </P> <P> "We very respectfully disagree with the judge's opinion," said Lois Jeffrey,  special counsel to the county. "As far as we know, no one has ever interpreted  the statute that way and it's been on the books for 27 years."  </P> <P> If Owen's ruling is not overturned, the cost of paying insurance premiums for  the county's 4,600 retirees could climb to $90 million annually by 1995,  Jeffrey said. In addition, county officials have estimated that reimbursing  retirees for benefits denied them since 1982 could cost another $42 million to  $50 million.  </P> <P> The county stopped paying insurance benefits for workers who retired after  1979. But the Orange County Employees Assn. did not file suit until 1985 and  the claims are limited by a three-year statute of limitations.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the cost to the county would be prohibitive, the county's special  counsel said.  </P> <P> "The county doesn't have the revenues," Jeffrey said. "They would have to look  at potentially laying people off or canceling some existing programs." We're  limited as to what we can do with taxes by Proposition 13 and assorted other  laws."  </P> <P> Among retirees fighting the county is Rachel Hill, 79, the first female to work  as a sergeant in the county marshal's office. Hill said she was considering  retirement in 1963. But that same year the Legislature enacted a law requiring  public agencies to offer retirees insurance benefits comparable to the coverage  offered employees still on the job.  </P> <P> As Hill understood the law, she would be eligible for full medical coverage if  she hung on for another three years to complete her 20 years of service. She  did, and the county extended her full coverage in 1966, the first year of her  retirement and the first year the county offered the benefits to retirees under  the new state law.  </P> <P> At the time, the cost of full coverage for Hill and her husband was $44 a  month. But health insurance costs began soaring in the mid-1970s and, while the  county increased its contributions for active employees, it required retirees  to pay the difference themselves.  </P> <P> Hill now pays the bulk of her $215 monthly insurance payment for herself and  her husband, who is in a nursing home, out of her retirement income.  </P> <P> But Hill said she considers herself fortunate. Employees who retired after 1979  must pay the entire cost of their insurance coverage, ranging as high as $300  monthly.  </P> <P> Attorneys in the case said Tuesday that the appeal could take another year or  two to resolve and that additional appeals to the state Supreme Court could  drag the case out even longer.  </P> <P> Richard S. Rockwell, an attorney for the employees association, disputed the  county's contention that it has no money to meet retirees insurance needs.  </P> <P> "I think they could reorganize their priorities a little bit and get this thing  covered handily," Rockwell said. "The total county budget is $4.5 billion. One  billion of that is discretionary." ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR  </P></p>

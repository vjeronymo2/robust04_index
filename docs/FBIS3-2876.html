Yang, 50, a Shanghai-based dissident and a founder of the Peace  Charter movement created last November, was also detained on  Friday and then released yesterday morning after receiving a  "warning" from authorities.    Li Guoping said her husband had been arrested along with  another dissident, Li Guotao, who was also a leader in the CHRA.  On Friday, he was detained with another leading Shanghai  activist, Wang Fuchen. Wang is still being held.    Several other dissidents, including veteran democracy  activist Xu Liangying, also said by telephone yesterday police  had thrown security cordons around their apartments, in examples  of official pressure on dissidents during the visit of United  States Secretary of State, Warren Christopher.    To date, police have arrested or detained about 15 activists  in the run-up to Mr. Christopher's visit. Mr. Xu, 74, said he  was being kept in a state of virtual house arrest, with police  not allowing anyone into or out of his home. He was one of  seven intellectuals who wrote to government leaders last week  demanding the release of political prisoners. He said two  policemen had stationed themselves at his door and four more had  come to the main entrance of his building yesterday morning to  keep friends from visiting him.    "When I asked them what they were doing, they said: 'We're  protecting intellectuals'," Mr. Xu said. He later tried to  leave his apartment in Beijing's university district to pick up  a newspaper, but police would not let him out, he said.    "I fought with them, and demanded to know what law allowed  them to do this," he said. "All they answered was: 'It's  orders from higher authority'. " His wife, historian Wang Laidi,  said: "They don't allow our friends to come in. They're  concerned we'll have contact with Mr. Christopher."    Mr. Christopher has said he has no plans to meet dissidents  during his trip. Speaking during his hours of freedom, Yang --  Shanghai's most prominent political dissident -- said he had  been treated well by police.    Police also swarmed around US diplomatic compounds in  Beijing  yesterday in an attempt of head off any demonstrations during  Mr. Christopher's visit.    Journalists who tried to see some prominent dissidents on  Friday night or yesterday were stopped by police and, in at  least three cases, detained for questioning.    A Dutch reporter was held for five hours yesterday for  attempting to visit Liu Nianchun, the founder of a new labour  rights' organisation. Caroline Straathof, of the Dutch  newspaper De Volkskrant, said she and her Chinese translator  were taken to a police station in the city's university district.    Mr. Liu was one of three dissidents who last week sent  government officials an official application to establish a  group to look after labour rights in the current economic boom.  Straathof said police seized a copy of a document in which Mr.  Liu proclaimed the labour federation, along with her notes,  tapes and film. They also accused her of "visiting Chinese  citizens without permission" and failing to carry her residence  permit.    Mr. Liu's wife said he left the house on Friday and had not  returned. Two other reporters, Nicholas Driver of United Press  International and Matthew Forney of Newsweek, were detained near  Mr. Liu's house on Friday. They were held for six hours.    Other important dissidents have left Beijing in recent days  and do not appear likely to return during the U.S. official's  visit. They include China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng.</p>

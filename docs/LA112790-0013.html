			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GULLS' TRAVELS CONTINUE WITH ANOTHER VICTORY  </P> <P> The Gulls ran their unbeaten string on the road to eight games by defeating  last-place Albany, 6-3, Tuesday. The victory was the Gulls' sixth in a row, and  they are now 7-0-1 during the streak.  </P> <P> It was first meeting this season between the Gulls (12-9-2) and the Choppers  (6-14). The Gulls remained in second place in the Western Division behind  Peoria (18-2), which was idle. The two teams will play again tonight in Albany  as the Gulls' longest road trip of the season continues.  </P> <P> Darcy Norton led the Gulls with two goals. Dennis Holland, who has scored at  least one point in the last nine games, Clark Donatelli, Charlie Simmer and  Derek Mayer also scored for the Gulls, who trailed 2-1 after the first period.  </P> <P> Norton's first goal tied the game two minutes into the second period. Simmer  made it 3-2 when he scored 17:10 into the period, then the Gulls broke the game  open with three goals in the third period. Mayer scored to make it 4-2, then  Holland scored his 20th point in the last nine games, and Norton capped it with  his second goal with under two minutes to play.  </P> <P> The Gulls have scored four times in their last eight power-play situations.  They've scored 35 goals on the power play this season.  </P> <P> "Our power play has been clicking of late," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said.  "We're getting some chances and we're doing a good job taking advantage of  them."  </P> <P> Goalie Alain Chevrier, making his second consecutive start, stopped 31 of 34  shots and improved to 2-0 since being sent down by the Detroit Red Wings.  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Drama in court Terence Frisby wrote the memorably named play There's a Girl in My Soup. A slightly Noel Coward piece about a wine and food critic who expects to seduce every pretty girl in sight, it ran for over six years in the West end, starting in 1966. Fashions change, however, When I went to look it up, I was convinced that it must have been called There's a Man in My Soup. No-one treats philandering so lightly today. Frisby has changed too: out with the frivolous, in with the serious. The only common element between Soup and Rough Justice is that the central character is a media man who also writes books. But they are writers of a very different kind. Robert Danvers in Soup is pompous and vain and would never have written about ethics. James Highwood in Rough Justice, represents  -as his name suggests - the higher journalism. The trouble is that this paradigm of liberal virtue is up in court for having killed his brain damaged baby son. Or so it seems. But I shall not give away the plot, save to say that it you are of a sentimental frame of mind, you can probably guess the outcome. The action takes place in the Old Bailey, mainly in court, sometimes in the defendant's cell and occasionally in a corridor outside where deals between lawyers can be done. As in most court dramas, the characters tend to be made out of cardboard. Nevertheless, there is a Wimbledon-like fascination in watching the exchanges between the prosecuting counsel Margaret Casely QC (Diana Quick) and the defendant played with some anguish by Martin Shaw. Alan Dobie's judge sits as the umpire in the middle. Issues abound: the case for so-called mercy killing and the distinction between murder and manslaughter. The law which comes in for most abuse (rightly in my view) is contempt of court: it allows the judge and the prosecution ruthlessly to bully anyone conducting their own defence and smacks, in this play, of a lawyers' cartel. Rough Justice is not very profound. It conforms effectively to the middlebrow rule of treating controversial subjects without much risk of offending anyone. Some of the characters, especially the wife, might be more developed. Still, the piece can hold an audience. I enjoyed it. Direction is by Robin Herford. Apollo Theatre, (071) 494 5070</p>

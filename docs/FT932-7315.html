			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Latin American growth 'slower' ECONOMIC growth in Latin America outside Brazil will slow this year while the region's current account deficit will continue to widen, according to a new survey of economic and financial forecasts for the region. The survey, published for the first time this month by the London-based Consensus Economics, reckons inflation (outside Brazil) will stay on its downward track. Latin America, again excluding Brazil, will grow by an average 3.4 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent next year, compared with 4.5 per cent last year. Including Brazil, which is forecast to grow 2.7 per cent this year following a 1 per cent shrinkage of the economy last year, growth in Latin America will accelerate to 3.1 per cent this year and next, from 2.2 per cent in 1992. The region's current account deficit, excluding Brazil, will widen to Dollars 41.6bn (Pounds 27bn) this year and Dollars 42bn next, from Dollars 37.7bn in 1992. The survey says Mexico's current account deficit will widen to Dollars 24.7bn this year and Dollars 26.5bn next, from Dollars 22.8bn. Argentina's current account deficit is forecast to come down from Dollars 7.8bn to Dollars 7.7bn this year and Dollars 7.2bn next. Brazil's surplus would shrink from Dollars 4.8bn last year to Dollars 3.1bn this year and Dollars 2.1bn next. Inflation in Brazil - forecast to rise to 1,631 per cent this year from 1,129 per cent last - is expected to push average inflation for the region higher this year. Excluding Brazil, the trend is downward to an average 18.6 per cent this year and 16.2 per cent next year, from 23.1 per cent in 1992. The survey, conducted among 60 international and domestic forecasters, will be repeated and published every two months.

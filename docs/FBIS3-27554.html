			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji on Friday [25 February] stressed the importance of  Japanese technology and know-how in helping China to modernize  its economy.    He called for further Japanese investment in the country's  booming market.    With a 28 percent share of Chinese high-tech imports, Japan  is China's most important supplier of modern technology, Zhu  told a news conference.    This is not only a "very important factor" for China's  economic development, but it also benefits Japan's economy by  strengthening the competitiveness of Japanese products in the  world market, he said.    Zhu arrived Wednesday for a nine-day trip to drum up  Japanese  investment and support.    Know-how transfer through Japanese production in China is  what benefits both sides most, said Zhu, pointing to Matsushita  Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.'s production of heads for video  recorders at a plant in Beijing.    Japan-China trade soared by 54 percent to 39 billion dollars  last year, but it nevertheless is "still small" considering the  potential of China's huge market, he said.    Zhu, who also heads the central bank, played a major role in  the drafting of a comprehensive reform package introduced at the  beginning of this year.    Since the start of Chinese market reforms in 1979, Japan has  provided Beijing with trillions of yen in loans through its  overseas development assistance program. Another 819 billion  yen have been allotted for the 1990-95 term.    As part of the ambitious modernization program, the  country's  burdensome state-owned sector will be privatized along different  lines, including selling them off to foreign companies, Zhu  said. Already, two-thirds of them are in the red.    Beijing also is considering mutual stockholding as practiced  by many Japanese companies, he said. However, for the time  being most companies will be turned into ordinary corporations  and not into stock-holding companies. Zhu said Beijing is eager  to avoid the occurrence of the asset-inflated economy of the  late 1980s that afflicted Japan.    Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will  help gradually increase the central government's revenue share  from the present 30 percent to about 60 percent by 2000.    While the provinces grew rich over the last decade by  pocketing more levies, the falling tax revenue has left the  central government with a cumulative budget deficit of 400  billion yen (70 billion dollars).    Zhu, dismissing allegations that local governments will try  to defend their vested interests, said Beijing has their full  support for the reallocation of tax revenue.    Zhu said he is confident that the Chinese yuan eventually  will become a fully convertible currency.    The yuan's value has been stable since the introduction of a  single, market-oriented foreign exchange rate on January 1 and  "will continue to be stable," he said.    Zhu, who leaves Saturday for the Kansai region, has had a  busy schedule in Tokyo meeting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa,  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi  Mieno, and a number of former prime ministers. He will visit  the Kansai region to study Japanese corporate structures.    He indirectly warned against inviting Taiwanese President Li  Teng-hui to Tokyo saying that "the Taiwan question has always  been a very sensitive matter" between Japan and China.</p>

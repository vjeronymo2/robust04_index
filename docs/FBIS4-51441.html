			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Foreign Minister Fredrick  C. Chien said Thursday [26 May] that Taiwan is sincere in  negotiating with the United States in trying to settle a debt it  has owed since World War II.    "However, we will not pay the debt without prudent  consideration," Chien said while responding to a legislative  query by Democratic Progressive Party legislator Yu Ling-ya.    Chien said the United States granted about US$1 billion in  loans to the Republic of China [ROC] during the war, but that  the ROC Government made huge expenditures for US troops  stationed in Mainland China. Therefore, he said, to simply say  the ROC owes the US the money would be unreasonable.    Taipei and Washington have since 1960 held several rounds of  talks on the debt issue, but because of the difficulty in  finding documents related to the debt, no conclusions have  resulted.    Chien, however, said that Taiwan is still willing to discuss  the issue with the United States in an effort to find a  solution. "As long as the US wants us to talk, then we will  talk," Chien said.    Several lawmakers have urged the government to reject US  requests to pay the debt because the United States no longer  recognizes the Republic of China. Instead, they say, the United  States should turn to Mainland China to claim the debt.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Chirac advances in polls Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR's candidate for the French presidential elections in 1995, was almost level with the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, in a poll on who is best placed to beat the likely Socialist candidate, Mr Michel Rocard. The poll, published yesterday in the weekly Valeurs Actuelles, said Mr Balladur could beat Mr Rocard by 56 per cent to 44 per cent, while Mr Chirac could win by 55 per cent to 45 per cent. Mr Balladur, a longtime Chirac aide and RPR member, has not yet said whether he will run. But several polls published on Wednesday suggested that Mr Balladur had fallen from favour. A Gallup poll for L'Express, France's leading news magazine, gave his approval rating as 47 per cent, compared with around 60 per cent for most of 1993.</p>

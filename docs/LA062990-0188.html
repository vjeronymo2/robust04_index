			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MURDER COUNT FOR PROSTITUTE?  </P> <P> A prostitute whose picture in Newsweek magazine led to her arrest may be  charged with attempted murder if she has the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> Linda Kean, 36, was arrested on charges of violating her probation.  </P> <P> Police said they will seek to charge her with attempted murder if a judge  agrees to order her to have her blood tested and she turns out to be HIV  positive.  </P> <P> Kean has refused to undergo the test and told police that she does not have  AIDS. She denied an article in the June 25 issue of Newsweek that quoted her as  saying she still worked as a prostitute in spite of having acquired the AIDS  virus.  </P> <P> "She told me she was clean but she also told me she wasn't violating her  parole," Police Sgt. Mike Martin said Thursday.  </P> <P> Martin arrested Kean minutes after seeing her photograph in the magazine. He  arrested her for violating her probation from a previous prostitution  conviction when she got into a man's car in an area of town frequented by  prostitutes.  </P> <P> The attempted murder victim would be the unidentified San Jose man who picked  up Kean on Monday night. He was not arrested.  </P> <P> "I didn't tell him straight up front what the problem was," Martin said. "I  told him to go home and look at Page 23 of this week's Newsweek."  </P></p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fall in volume cuts UDO 37% UDO HOLDINGS, which supplies drawing office equipment and reprographic services, saw year-end pre-tax profit fall 37 per cent in recessionary trading conditions from Pounds 9.03m to Pounds 5.71m, writes Walton Morais. Turnover fell from Pounds 55.84m to Pounds 51.71m in the year to July 31. Despite measures taken to modify the operational structure, no amount of savings in overheads could offset the profit lost by the volume fall. The company made provisions of Pounds 300,000 for further rationalisation and reorganisation costs, which pushed total exceptional charges to Pounds 517,000 (Pounds 213,000). Although earnings per share fell to 13.66p (20.78p), the company is recommending a final dividend of 4.76p for a 17 per cent increase in the total payment to 6.70p. The company cited a strong balance sheet to justify the increased payment. Cash balance at year-end stood at Pounds 13.3m, making up 46 per cent of net assets. The dividend cover stood at 2 times, down from about 3.5 times. The slight decline in the cash balance, from Pounds 13.4m, was largely due to Pounds 2.9m cash spent on four longer-term strategic acquisitions to increase geograpical coverage or extend services provided. This also led to a 22 per cent fall in interest income to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.75m). Mike Wright, chairman, said the strong balance sheet was achieved through close attention being paid to cash generation and the monitoring of working capital. Mr Wright forecast another tough year ahead for the group because there was no forseeable improvement in trading conditions.</p>

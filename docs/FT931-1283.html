			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Polluted land register proposal dropped PROPOSALS for a register of contaminated land have been abandoned after 'substantial criticism', the government confirmed last night after weeks of speculation. A 'new wide ranging review' examining how local authorities might play a greater part in tackling problems of land pollution would replace the register, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said. Property developers and surveyors welcomed the move, arguing that implementation of the proposals would have caused blight of property values across the country, including up to a third of the Midlands. However, they criticised the lack of a new policy to tackle the issue of polluted land. Mr Michael Chambers of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: 'We were expecting a firm announcement at this stage. This is rather a disappointment.' Proposals for the registers, which were part of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, were abandoned after two public inquiries. The Department of the Environment said yesterday that it had responded to three main criticisms: The registers would have listed potential not actual contamination as they included all sites which had been used at some point in the past by specified types of industry. There would have been no way of removing sites from the register even if contamination had been cleared. It was not clear who should carry the liability and costs of cleaning up contamination. Mr Howard said: 'The government remains determined that contamination does not give rise to unacceptable risks to health and safety, to ground water and the environment. 'Local authorities will still have their long-standing statutory powers to find and deal with actual pollution and to decide planning issues about contamination.' The new review will look at whether local authorities' powers and financial resources are adequate. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said: 'We seem to be getting yet a third round of consultation. The entire burden of assessing whether land is fit for development will now fall on local authorities.' He was sceptical that all would be capable of that task.

This was  the day of the deadline for the GATT Uruguay Round. On 7  December, Chairman Denis' revised proposal arrived, and Prime  Minister Hosokawa accepted the proposal according to which "we  will agree to a six-year deferral of total tariffication [on  rice imports], and during this period we will allow minimum  access (a minimum volume of imports, 4 percent [of the market]  the first year, 8 percent the last year)."    This is an old, shopworn method by which "one officially  opposes, but in the end gives in to gaiatsu [external pressure]  and reluctantly agrees." But the prime minister himself cannot  shift responsibility since he has repeatedly said that he would  abide by the "Diet resolutions." The Diet resolutions advocate  a "totally domestic supply."    Besides rice, there is the problem of countermeasures to  improve business conditions, with which in particular an  increase in the consumption tax is combined. The widespread  argument is that a 5-10 trillion yen consumption tax [increase]  would be an effective measure to improve economic conditions.  As a source of revenue, a deficit-covering national bond is  popular within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). But the  Finance Ministry, as well as Shinseito and Komeito, argues that  "it is irresponsible unless, at the same time, we decide the  income tax reduction, we decide to raise the consumption tax  rate at some specific time a few years from now." They fear  that if we do not raise the consumption tax rate, there is the  prospect of "eat and run" [a situation where one takes the  benefit first and does not pay the price]. In the background,  there is also an ulterior motive of "letting Hosokawa take care  of all the difficult issues, such as rice and the consumption  tax."    The Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) took the  combination of rice and the consumption tax most seriously. The  SDPJ is, due in part to being the inheritor of the farmers'  movement, sensitive to the rice issue. The three senior party  officers, headed by Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, declared their  opposition on 7 December, saying that "the acceptance of partial  liberalization is contrary to the agreement of the eight parties  which formed the coalition government."    Moreover, as the budget is drawn up, if a consumption tax  rate hike is included, the SDPJ's resistance will be even  stronger. It was only a few years ago when the SDPJ experienced  an overwhelming victory in a national election under Chairperson  Takako Doi who opposed the consumption tax, saying that "when it  will not do, it will not do." One of the Komeito executives  said that "this is a crisis under which the SDPJ could split up,  but at the same time, there is a chance it could leave the  coalition government. To begin with, there are some people in  the SDPJ who have an allergic reaction to Ozawa. The party,  which essentially stands for demilitarization and neutrality,  could never go along with revision of the Constitution and the  overseas dispatch of Self-Defense Forces. A desire to change  the party to avoid being controlled by Ozawa exists naturally in  the left wing of the party, but also in the right wing."    Would the SDPJ still cling to government power and choose to  stay on, holding cabinet posts? Or would they dissolve the  coalition? It is not necessary to explain how severe the blow  would be to the Hosokawa Cabinet, if the SDPJ, the largest party  in the government, were to pull out.  <H5>  Passage of Political Reform Bill Will Be Difficult </H5>   The end of the extraordinary Diet session is 15 December. It  is also the deadline day the Hosokawa Cabinet, which publicly  promised the "passage of a political reform bill before the end  of this year." As of 8 December, the bill, which passed the  House of Representatives on 18 November in an ordinary manner,  remains in the House of Councillors without even recitation  (explanation of purpose) taking place. Probably they will not  be able to start actual deliberation until the 15th.    The biggest factor for such a delay is that in the House of  Councillors, the LDP and SDPJ conspired behind the scenes and  adopted joint efforts in an attempt at delay. Especially in the  proportional districts of the SDPJ, there is strong opposition  to the single seat election district system and to the House of  Representatives' proposal on proportional representation, which  is identical to that of the House of Councillors.    Moreover, the speed of the drop in business conditions has  far exceeded the Hosokawa Cabinet's forecast. It was reported  that the unemployment rate in October jumped up to 2.7 percent,  and is still showing an upward trend, according to a Labor  Ministry study. The Hosokawa Cabinet was thinking that "first,  we will complete political reform, then we will start on  economic countermeasures." But it has become clear that there is  no progress on political reform, and they have been slow to  respond with countermeasures for the economic conditions.  Voices have been heard within elements of the government  regretting that "they made a mistake in priorities."  WARNING: JAPANESE MEDIA PROJECT    Moreover, two unanticipated incidents occurred which  stopped discussions in the House of Representatives Budget  Committee. One was the comment Defense Agency Director General  Keisuke Nakanishi made concerning revision of the Constitution.  Director General Nakanishi resigned mainly on the pretext that  he could not delay deliberations.    The other incident involved Prime Minister Hosokawa's  relationship with Sagawa Express. A fuss was raised about the  "composition of the repayment" of 100 million yen Hosokawa  borrowed from Chairman Kiyoshi Sagawa. At first, Prime Minister  Hosokawa answered that "I took the cash and repayed it. I used  40-50 million yen out of 70 million yen separation pay from my  governorship." Mr. Hakuo Yanagisawa of the LDP took a point by  saying that "the Prime Minister said he had repayed in full by  the end of January 1991, but he served as governor until  February, and did not receive his separation pay in January."  The prime minister further submitted a document on 7 December  stating that "he paid it back 10 million yen annually over 10  years." But the LDP objected that "it differs from the answer  he gave before," and sought further detailed explanation. So  deliberations were delayed until the 8th. There, many people  who say in the LDP that "Hosokawa insists the money he was given  as a gift was a loan, and he says he repayed it even though he  has not. That is where the inconsistencies come from. This is  similar to the case of Finance Minister Miyazawa. Mr. Miyazawa  made a false reply that he did not receive Recruit stocks,  though in fact he did. He was cross-examined and pressed into  resignation." There are also voices that "we can get  Hosokawa's head any time" [to get him to resign]. Secretary  General Mori and the party executives have not yet made up their  minds." But the LDP executives' plan seems to be as follows:    "Because the supplemental budget is an important  countermeasure for dealing with economic conditions, we must get  it passed through the House of Councillors by 15 December, which  is the end of the session. For that reason, we will not pursue  Hosokawa further, even though we are not satisfied with the  answer he has given. Besides, if the supplemental budget does  not pass this session, it will result in giving an excuse for  the coalition government to extend the session."    This makes it appear as if the LDP, which secretly conspired  with the SDPJ, has taken the leadership for Diet management.  The LDP, which only 20 days earlier was in terrible shape,  plagued with a number of rebellious members and facing the  crisis of a possible split, is now filled with a triumphant mood  because the chance for passing the political reform bill before  the end of this year is completely gone.  <H3>  Ozawa and Takemura Debate Over "Cross-Year" [extending the  Diet session so that it carries over from 1993 into 1994] </H3>   It has been reported that in early December, Mr. Ichiro  Ozawa, senior Shinseito representative, and Masayoshi Takemura,  the chief cabinet secretary, met for discussion and had a clash  of opinions. Mr. Takemura insisted as follows:    "There is a severe downturn in business conditions. We want  to designate the political reform bill a matter of deliberation  to be carried over and to close the curtain on the extraordinary  Diet session. We want to pour our full efforts into  countermeasures to boost economic conditions and into developing  the budget for Heisei 6 (1994)."    Mr. Ozawa was said to be furiously opposed to such an  argument.    "What are you talking about? The carry-over [of discussion]  of the bill is the same as abandoning the bill. As we publicly  promised, we must get it passed, whatever it takes. We can open  the regular Diet session on 30 January. We can extend the  [extraordinary session] until 29 January. We should be able to  concurrently handle the bill on the political reform and the  formation of the budget."    This is Mr. Ozawa's argument for the crossing-over the year  extension. Mr. Takemura's is the common sensical argument. Mr.  Ozawa's is a strong-armed, unprecedented plan. The following  House of Representatives Administrative Office comment shows  that.    "Since last year, the ordinary Diet was to be convened in  January. But prior to that, it was convened in December and in  the latter part of the month entered into a regular New Year's  recess. It was reconvened in the latter part of January when the  budget was printed. They almost never had any actual  deliberation in January. The exception was that year before last  (1991), on 18 January, the regular session was convened to deal  with crisis countermeasures related to the Gulf war. Other than  that, there has been no precedent for actual deliberation before  20 January."    It seems that the Diet is always in recess during the New  Year's period, and the politicians participate in various  activities and meetings in their districts. I do not believe  that the House of Councillors will respond to January  deliberations.    Then, why do Mr. Ozawa and others in Shinseito venture to  advocate the crossing-over the year extension? Frankly  speaking, that is because they are aiming at dissolution in the  latter part of January. Shinseito Secretary Hajime Ishii  explains as follows:    "If we start on 10 January, we have as much as three  weeks left. We should give up the year end and the New Year  holidays and tackle the political problems. First, we should  propose a large scale tax cut for the benefit of better business  conditions. With the budget's current scale, prospects for the  immediate future are dismal. We must bravely fight for the  benefit of better economic conditions and adopt good measures  for it, and then dissolve the Diet. By dissolving the Diet, the  second realignment in the political world will occur, and the  way to political reform will pave itself."    They believe that the passage of the bill in the House of  Councillors will be difficult even if the session is  substantially extended. What worries them additionally is the  recession's continuation. Criticism is expected to the effect  that dissolution of the Diet at this time "will delay the  passage of the regular budget by nearly two months. This is  against the wishes of the Japanese people, which is that [the  government work on] measures to tackle the recession. Then they  are to "come up with countermeasures for the economy, namely, a  large scale tax cut and a third supplemental budget."    But even if they put up an "ad balloon," actual  implementation will be delayed during that period [nearly two  months needed for the dissolution, election, and formation of a  cabinet]. There are also many questions, such as where the  source of revenue to make up for the tax cut will be found.  Among the government parties themselves, there are many  critical voices against this long extension of the session. One  of the Komeito leaders says the following:    "One of the issues is that the budget will be made in  January  and passage will be [further] delayed. As a consequence, it  will have to be a provisional budget. I question the wisdom  during such a time of recession. Second is that in the midst of  the Diet session, the preliminary plan made out by the Finance  Ministry for the 1994 budget will be submitted, so each  committee [in the Diet] will have to deliberate on this. In the  past, the LDP Policy Research Council meddled with the Finance  Ministry plan, but this time the Diet committees will make  demands. The preliminary plan will be greatly altered. Despite  the fact that the government has the right to make the budget,  the Diet will interfere. The government cannot respond to this.  It is impossible to simultaneously handle political reform  deliberation and budget making."  <H5>  Mr. Ibuki's Argument for Early Dissolution of the Diet </H5>   The argument for the cross-over the year extension also  contains the strategy for a January dissolution in the event the  political reform [bill] fails to pass. As if to respond to  this, within the LDP there is also a voice for a January  dissolution. That is the pet theory of Mr. Bunmei Ibuki, the  deputy chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee. He has also  been advocating early dissolution to Diet Affairs Committee  Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato. But Mr. Ozato wonders about this,  saying, "I do not understand his point very well." When I  questioned Mr. Ibuki, the following answer came back:    "There is a phenomenon of distortion in the political world  today. Mr. Ozawa of the coalition government and Mr. Michio  Watanabe of the LDP share conception and policies, but Mr.  Ozawa, Prime Minister Hosokawa, and SDPJ Chairman Murayama do  not. Because of this unnatural and unfortunate distortion  phenomenon, they [in the coalition government] also can not  agree on an economic counter-plan and can not take any effective  measures. If nothing is done, the situation will develop into  the Heisei Panic. It is not fair to the Japanese people.  Therefore, I propose that the coalition government should take  a temporary truce on political reform and seek cooperation from  the LDP outside the cabinet. The LDP also proposes that it will  cooperate on a counter-plan for the recession."    I understand up to this point.    "There are various arguments concerning political reform,  and  in both the coalition government parties and in the LDP there  are distortions. It is also necessary to solve this situation  to build a healthy two-party system. Today, numbers mean  everything. The coalition parties have not formed the  government because of their compatible policies. I want this to  be straightened out. That is why I keep insisting that we  should keep the medium size electoral district system and go for  dissolution. If we go into election with the single  constituency electoral district system, then the distortion will  never be corrected."    It appears that his argument for the dissolution has an  ulterior motive for realigning the political world. What Mr.  Ibuki left unsaid, Mr. Jiro Kawasaki, another deputy chairman of  the Diet Affairs Committee, supplemented as follows.    "Mr. Ibuki is racking his brains on how to realize Michee  Watanabe's assumption of the prime ministership. I wonder if he  would leave the party, with Watanabe in the lead, using  dissolution as the opportunity. I wonder if he is considering a  government by Watanabe, Ozawa, and Ichikawa."    His surmise is that they cannot wait out President Kono's  two- year term and that their strategy is to bring Mr. Watanabe  in as candidate for coalition chief after Prime Minister  Hosokawa has failed. There are many people who doubt this  theory. One Komeito senior official points out the following:    "In addition to his ill health, Michee Watanabe's image is  just too different from that of Mr. Hosokawa. He could become a  prime minister with popularity of nearly zero."    A Shinseito senior official concurs:    "It is no longer Watanabe's time. His face, constitution,  and career are just too old. Beside, can he get out [of the  LDP] taking 20-30 people? If 20-30 people leave, then it is  significant that the LDP will become a permanent opposition  party."    Thus, with the cross-over the year extension debate and  January dissolution argument at the center, the counter-plan for  dealing with the recession, rice, and the consumption tax are  all tangled together. And the political situation is creaking  as it turns.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Save the alliance The international community could not save Yugoslavia, and it has failed to save Bosnia. That failure has hovered like an evil fairy over the cradle of the European Union. Along with the parallel failure in Somalia, it has blighted efforts to make a revived United Nations the centre of a new world order. And it now seems to threaten a death blow to the ageing Atlantic alliance. It is too late to save Bosnia as an effective country in its original frontiers. But Nato might still be saved - though it is desperately vulnerable - and it is worth saving. Nato is vulnerable because, with the demise of the Soviet threat, it has come to be seen as a luxury rather than a necessity by many people on both sides of the ocean. That may not be such a bad thing if it leads Europeans to take Nato less for granted than they did in the past, and so to think more seriously about what they themselves can and should do to ensure their own security. But it would be no less criminally irresponsible for Europeans to imagine that they can easily do that without any assistance or co-operation from the US, than it is for them to assume that such assistance will always and inevitably be forthcoming. That is why the alliance is worth saving, even at the cost of some national pride and self-righteousness. No major power, after all, has any right to feel proud or self-righteous about the situation in Bosnia. Britain and France are much given to reminding the world that they, unlike the US, have troops on the ground. But the events of the last week have cruelly demonstrated, once again, that those troops are deployed not as an instrument of policy but as a substitute for one. Sorry mix The US is equally prone to accuse the Europeans of betraying the Bosnian government and appeasing the Serbs. But it has never shown convincingly that it was able or willing to help the Bosnian government redress the imbalance of forces on the ground. US policy, like European policy, has been a sorry mix of indecision, rhetoric and gesture. Senator Robert Dole, to whose words the mid-term elections have given an authority equal to, if not greater than, that of President Clinton himself, has now called for the withdrawal of the UN protection force (Unprofor), arguing that its presence serves merely as a pretext for Britain and France to oppose any effective Nato intervention from the air. Those powers, and other troop contributors, will be sorely tempted to take him at his word. Undeserved blame The troops, whose mandate contains almost as many contradictions as it does Security Council resolutions, are getting a great deal of undeserved blame for not carrying out a task for which they are not equipped, namely holding back the Serb offensives and counter-offensives. They are certainly not saving Bosnia. They are saving an unknown number of individual Bosnian lives, but possibly at the cost of others if you believe (as many do) that their presence prolongs the war. It is never the right time to pull the troops out. Their departure could easily provoke a resumption of fighting throughout Bosnia and even beyond - though there is no guarantee that this will not happen anyway. It may also be violently opposed by one or more parties to the conflict. And it could easily be accompanied by even more bitter mutual accusations across the Atlantic than we have already heard. Those are all strong arguments against withdrawal now - except that the difficulties are likely to get greater rather than less if more time is left to elapse. Only the risk of jeopardising a real hope of peace would be a convincing argument for keeping Unprofor in place. And the only ground on which such hope can now be based is the acceptance of the Contact Group partition plan by both the Bosnian and Serbian governments, and the pressure exerted by Serbia on the Bosnian Serbs to do likewise. If this pressure is not seen to bear fruit within days, or at most weeks, the Serbs and their Russian protectors must understand that removing Unprofor and lifting the arms embargo will become unavoidable for the west irrespective of its effect on Bosnia, because it will be the only way to save the Atlantic alliance.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Japan Of the world's main financial markets, Japan is traditionally the least affected by political uncertainty. That seems to have changed after the troubles of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa prompted the dissolution of the Diet. For a time, at least, the markets will have to live with a degree of uncertainty that extends to the question of whether the Liberal Democratic party can survive intact. That implies renewed strain for the equity market which even official support buying may be unable to offset. The yen also weakened sharply yesterday, though that could be a more transitory response. The Nikkei has already fallen more than 1,000 points from its 1993 peak on fears that the stronger yen would damp Japan's modest economic recovery prospects. Palliatives, such as a large discount rate cut or further fiscal stimulation, now seem remote given the political vacuum. The election campaign may produce promises of tax cuts which would boost consumption. Whether the poll will produce a government capable of delivering them quickly is another matter. Similarly, there seems less chance of a bilateral trade agreement with the US, which might reverse the yen's recent rise. This could thus resume after the initial political shock has worn off. The yen may be saved further upward pressure if the dollar's jump against the D-Mark yesterday means the US currency has found new strength. Otherwise next month's Tokyo summit could be dominated by spats over the exchange market instead of co-ordinated measures to revive world growth.</p>

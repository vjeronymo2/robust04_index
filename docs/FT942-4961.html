			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold reserves confirmed Following a study of reserves the definitive ore resources of Bakyrchik Gold have been reduced slightly to 31.4m tonnes producing a total of 8.6m ounces. That compares with earlier estimates of 31.6m tonnes and 9.3m ounces. However, the measured reserve category has almost doubled from 655,760 ounces to 1.26m ounces. The study confirmed expectations that it was capable of producing 1m tonnes of ore a year with gold output of about 250,000 ounces a year from the stage II sulphide plant. Stage II is likely to be sanctioned once gold has been produced through the stage I plant, which is expected to be commissioned within the next few weeks, and revenues have been received in foreign currency. The study results were given when the company, which came to the market in August to exploit a gold mine in Kazakhstan, announced losses of Dollars 635,000 (Pounds 423,000) for the period from incorporation in April to March 31.</p>

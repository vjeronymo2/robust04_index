			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;LS GAVE $513,000 TO ASSEMBLYMAN BANE IN '80S;  </P> <P> FUND RAISING: THAT WAS MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE LEGISLATOR RECEIVED FROM THE  INDUSTRY, FOR WHICH HE IS A LONGTIME CHAMPION.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys), a longtime champion of the savings and loan  industry, received $513,000 in campaign contributions from thrifts -- more than  any other state legislator in the 1980s, according to a survey released  Thursday by two public-interest groups.  </P> <P> In all, the survey said, savings and loans in the last decade contributed $4.1  million to state lawmakers, including at least $216,000 to Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), $214,000 to Senate President Pro Tem David A.  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and $154,000 to former Assembly Republican Leader Pat  Nolan (R-Glendale).  </P> <P> The survey, called "Clearance Sale of the Decade: The Role of California's  Elected Officials in the Savings and Loan Scandal," was released at press  conferences here and in Los Angeles by the public advocacy group California  Common Cause, and by Public Citizen, a consumer group formed by Ralph Nader.  </P> <P> Common Cause officials singled out bills by Bane and Nolan as having fueled  "the radical deregulation" of the savings and loan industry and helped heighten  the current thrift crisis in California.  </P> <P> Bane said that there was no connection between the campaign contributions and  his efforts on behalf of the thrift industry. "I shared that money with most of  the Democrats in California who ran for office or who were financially unable  to finance their campaigns," Bane said.  </P> <P> Nolan could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Ruth Holton, a Common Cause lobbyist, said the survey shows their legislation  "opened up the floodgates for anyone to run a savings and loan." She cited the  savings and loan contributions as one reason the public should support  Proposition 131, the Nov. 6 ballot initiative that would limit legislative  terms and establish partial public financing of campaigns.  </P> <P> Nolan's bill, which became law in 1982, was a sweeping overhaul of the industry  that lifted restrictions on the percentage of a savings and loans' assets that  could be invested in a single venture.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, Bane, chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, also  successfully pushed legislation to remove some state anti-fraud provisions for  savings and loans.  </P> <P> Common Cause said the measure helped deregulate the savings and loan industry.  But Bane, a former executive of a savings and loan trade association, dismissed  the criticism, saying his measure merely recodified existing statutes.  </P> <P> Dave K. Milton, lobbyist for the California League of Savings Institutions,  called the assertions made by Common Cause ridiculous. He said the blame for  the savings and loan crisis lies in changes enacted in Washington, not  Sacramento.  </P></p>

At a press conference here today, Hui Yongzheng,  vice-minister of the commission, said that over 10,000 such  enterprises were set up over the past year.    High-tech enterprises refers to firms started by scientists  which raise capital funds through non-governmental channels and  enjoy independent management and hold sole responsibility for  their own profits and losses.    For example, some of the country's best-known high-tech  firms, such as Stone Company, Legend Group Corp., Beijing  University Founder Co. Ltd. and Hope Computers Co. Ltd. are  among these enterprises.    According to the Chinese official, the 40,000  non-governmental firms, who in total have more than 600,000  employees, hit a record profit of 25 billion yuan (2.9 billion  U.S. dollars) last year.    He said that the businesses of these enterprises have  extended to virtually all industries in the national economy  while concentrating in technology-intensive industries including  chemical industry, telecommunications, machinery, precision  instruments, computers, building materials, medicines,  biological products and environmental protection.    Hui noted that the average input in research and development  has made up over 6 percent of these enterprises' total income  and the scientific and technological employees have accounted  for over 30 percent of their total staff.    According to Hui, China's large non-governmental scientific  enterprises have got off to a good start in industrialization  and internationalization of high technologies.    One example is that the Hope Computers Corporation under the  Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was started by eight  graduates ten years ago, now has the largest share of the  country's sales of cad products.    The Legend Group Corp. now holds ten percent of the  international market in the sales of QDI [expansion unknown]  personnel computer cards.    "In the next two years, the Chinese Government will work out  a series of policies, documents and regulations in order to help  the non-governmental technological enterprises grow in a  healthy, sustainable, rapid manner, bringing them into the  international market in a big way," Hui said.</p>

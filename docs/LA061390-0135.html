			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1989-90: THE YEAR IN REVIEW;  </P> <P> QUOTES OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> Sorry, but I'm not much of a morning person."  </P> <P>  -- Brea-Olinda guard Aimee McDaniel, who emerged from the locker room wearing  pink slippers after Auburn Placer had ended the Lady Cats' 55-game winning  streak in the State Division III championship game played in the early morning.  </P> <P> I'm not going to Disneyland; I'm going to Vegas!"  </P> <P>  -- Esperanza sprinter Roshawn Sims, after winning three events at the Orange  County Track and Field Championships.  </P> <P> If we do wind up ranked No. 1, you won't find me reading about it. What does it  mean? One day you're up and the next day you're a dog."  </P> <P>  -- Brian Rofer, Edison boys' volleyball coach, after the Chargers upset  Huntington Beach, ranked No. 1 in the Orange County Coaches' poll at the time.  </P> <P> Apologetics. That's the defense of the Christian religion. I think a  creationist theory is intellectually supportable. . . . I'm fascinated by  morality and ethics and why people follow certain religions."  </P> <P>  -- Saddleback High School distance runner Robby Price, a straight-A student,  junior theologian and heavy-metal drummer.  </P> <P> I guess I'll just study."  </P> <P>  -- Former Servite running back Derek Brown after learning last summer that he  had to sit out his freshman year at Nebraska because he failed to meet academic  requirements under Proposition 48.  </P> <P> I hate it. I think it's real stupid. The SAT and the ACT are just trying to get  your money. You could be a 4.0 student and you could still get a low score on  the test. The tests have nothing to do with your schoolwork. I totally dislike  them."  </P> <P>  -- Brown, after passing the ACT last winter and becoming eligible for the fall  semester at Nebraska.  </P> <P> Something that's easy."  </P> <P>  -- Los Alamitos basketball player Robert Conlisk when asked what would be his  major at Arizona State.  </P> <P> It's sad but funny. Nobody won the game, we ended up forfeiting their forfeit."  </P> <P>  -- Fountain Valley Athletic Director Mike Henigan after the Barons had to  forfeit a football game to Huntington Beach because of an ineligible player.  Huntington Beach had already forfeited the game to Fountain Valley for the same  reason.  </P> <P> When the fleet's in, they're mighty tough."  </P> <P>  -- Laguna Beach Coach Ed Bowen when asked what he knew about the Coronado  basketball team.  </P> <P> We're the bad boys of the South Coast League and sometimes we have to defend  ourselves."  </P> <P>  -- Capistrano Valley basketball player Scott McCorkle after the Cougars had  been involved in two fights in two games.  </P> <P> I think (Southern Section Associate Commissioner) Dean Crowley wants to make  sure he gets home in time to watch David Letterman."  </P> <P>  -- Magnolia High School Coach Bob Mangan, on the announcement that the triple  jump portion of Southern Section track and field championships would be  postponed for three days because the meet was running late.  </P> <P> I think the pineapple was the problem."  </P> <P>  -- Dos Pueblos basketball player Adam Estabrook, who was one of five Charger  players who came down with food poisoning the day of the Southern California  Regional Division II final against Servite. The night before the game, the  players had eaten a pizza topped with pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and  pineapple.  </P> <P> You just climb way up in this tree and jump. You let yourself fall, and the  boughs kind of catch you. You can get pretty scraped up, but I've never really  gotten hurt . . . I'm not that crazy."  </P> <P>  -- El Toro hurdler David Fair, on his favorite hobby -- flying from trees.  </P> <P> You have to be careful with Estancia, they run a Heckle and Hyde."  </P> <P>  -- Servite basketball coach Richard Smith during a practice prior to the  Friars' Southern Section 3-AA championship game against Estancia.  </P> <P> If the playoffs had been postponed a week, Coy (Collins) could have played.  Maybe we should have filed something in court."  </P> <P>  -- Loara football Coach Herb Hill after the Saxons, minus their star running  back, lost to Santa Ana, 3-0, in the first round of the Southern Section  Division III playoffs. Collins, who rushed for 1,666 yards, missed the game  because of a deep thigh bruise.  </P> <P> The thing doesn't bark, howl or whine. It could be the perfect player."  </P> <P>  -- La Serna baseball Coach Vern Hodge describing the team's mascot, an iguana  owned by pitcher Willie Adams.  </P> <P> I even made them sign a contract. No kidding. My parents are tricky people."  </P> <P>  -- Dana Hills discus thrower Andy Marrone on his parents' promise to buy him  the car of his choice if he threw more than 190 feet this season. Marrone threw  192-1 May 18, and less than 24 hours later, drove away with "the whole primo  four-wheel drive vehicle."  </P> <P> It was like all of us were in a fog. Huntington Beach was in a San Francisco  fog and we were in a Laguna fog. Their fog was thicker than ours."  </P> <P>  -- Lance Stewart, boys' volleyball coach at Laguna Beach, after watching his  team defeat Huntington Beach in a sloppy five-game match.  </P> <P> It would have been nice to get at least one more win before retiring . . . or  even a hit."  </P> <P>  -- Los Alamitos baseball Coach Mike Gibson after the Griffins were no-hit by  Ocean View's Jim Gwaltney in the first round of the Southern Section 5-A  playoffs. It was Gibson's last game as coach.  </P></p>

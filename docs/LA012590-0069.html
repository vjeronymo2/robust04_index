			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: SPORTS CAN SLIM OVERWEIGHT KIDS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm overweight and both of my children (ages 9 and 13) are  also a bit on the plump side. They don't seem to mind and their grandparents  tell me to ignore it -- that they'll outgrow it. Because no one seems to  object, it's almost impossible to get them to lose weight. How important is it  to put them on a diet? -- W.O.  </P> <P> DEAR W.O.: If either child is 20% over what is considered ideal weight for  height, sex and age, then I believe it's important to put them on some kind of  exercise-diet health regime that will improve their health. Despite the fact  that they say they don't mind being heavy, I find that hard to believe. They  may be denying the truth of the matter. Children are not known for kindness and  sensitivity when it comes to making fun of fat classmates. If your youngsters  haven't been the butt of jokes, they will be if they continue to put on pounds.  </P> <P> Also, obese children are more likely to become fat adults and if you and your  family don't help your youngsters to slim down now, they may curse you for it  later. If they're only moderately overweight, it may simply be a matter of  placing less emphasis on candy and desserts and more on exercise. Remember that  sitting in front of a TV set isn't exercise. Fat increases by 2% for each hour  of TV viewed daily.  </P> <P> If your kids aren't sports enthusiasts, make it a family project. Get out and  play with them and initiate family hikes on weekends. It will help you, too.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: It seems to me that drivers are much more aggressive than  they used to be. My grandson assures me that this isn't true, but I remain  unconvinced. One reason I discussed this with him is because he and his friends  are prime offenders in this department. They think nothing of jumping in their  car when they're angry. -- J.R.  </P> <P> DEAR J.R.: This is unfortunate because studies show that anger or any strong  emotion can be a cause of serious accidents if the person who is out of control  happens to be driving. People who take out their aggression with their  automobiles are hazardous to themselves and everyone else.  </P> <P> Driving teachers point out that one way to minimize aggression on the highway  is to leave plenty of time for traffic. A mismatch between goals and reality --  what you want and what you get -- often triggers rage. It's difficult for young  drivers to plan ahead, but if they are supposed to be somewhere and have to  drive through town at rush hour, they'd do well to anticipate road tie-ups.  </P> <P> Another difficulty, especially with male drivers, is that they frequently see  the car as an extension of themselves, so that they are apt to interpret a  minor dent as a major attack on their personal dignity.  </P></p>

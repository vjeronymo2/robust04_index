			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- Not a single provision in  the State Duma resolution on amnesty will be reversed or  reconsidered, Duma Deputy Chairman Valentin Kovalyov said.    Kovalyov said that a working group has prepared a draft  resolution on the application of the amnesty resolution. He did  not rule out the possibility that the draft may be submitted to  the Duma on Friday.    "The idea of the document is to specify the provisions which  may be interpreted in different ways. Particularly, the draft  stipulates that the amnesty resolution shall not stop legal  proceedings instituted against those who committed criminal  offences during the August 1991, May 1993 and October 1993  events which were not directly connected with these events,"  Kovalyov said.    In accordance with this provision, marauders who plundered  the parliament building during the October revolt in Moscow or  thieves will not be amnestied. "Only those are subject to  amnesty whose actions were in the cause-effect relation with the  political events in August, May and October," Kovalyov explained.    He noted that the draft resolution is the result of  agreement  between all participants in the work on it, including deputies,  representatives of the public prosecutor's office, the  ministries of justice and foreign affairs and presidential  representatives.</p>

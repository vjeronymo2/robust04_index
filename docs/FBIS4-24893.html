			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (CNS) -- Public security  departments in China plan to strengthen administration over  migrant people in cities through improvement of administration  over urban residence registration and enactment of  administrative methods on migrant labourers.    According to statistics, there are 80 million migrant  population in the Mainland at present. As a result, numbers of  various kinds of criminal cases are increasing at a rate of 6  percent growth every year and big case numbers increasing at 18  percent growth. Crimes committed by migrant people have taken a  rather great ratio of the total criminal cases in number.  Criminal cases committed by migrant people in Guangzhou and  Shenzhen make up 80 percent of the total cases of the two cities  in number, and in Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin, such cases  making up 50 percent of the total in number. Part of migrant  people even engage in drug trafficking, drug taking, gambling  and pornographic business, which have seriously harmed public  security.</p>

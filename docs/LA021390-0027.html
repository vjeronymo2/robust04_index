			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Bye Bye 45s?The Tower Records chain issued an in-house memo telling its store  managers and buyers to "not purchase any seven-inch vinyl new release or hit  singles from any vendor."  </P> <P> Tower was one of the last champions of the vinyl 45, and has prided itself on  continuing to make vinyl records available to its customers despite drooping  sales. The chain was one of the last that stocked a wide selection of the  singles. Tower will continue to purchase oldies singles, however. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid from Baghdad] </F>   [Excerpts] Iraq is two thirds of the way down the road  toward lifting the three-year old comprehensive embargo.  Through patient diplomatic efforts and rational measures --  which fulfilled 99 percent of the UN Security Council's demands  -- Iraq was able to contain the stands of three of the five  permanent members of the Security Council. This step was a  political achievement in Iraq's interest because it succeeded in  surrounding the hard-line stands in the Security Council and in  bringing states, which a few months ago were revolving in the  U.S. orbit, to Iraq's side. Iraqi sources said that the split  within the Security Council is a gain for the international  majority and supports Iraq's rights in the face of "the idols,"  as stated in AL-QADISIYAH, the paper of the Iraqi Armed Forces.    The reaction in Baghdad ranged between optimism and  reservation. Meanwhile, some sources believe that what took  place within the Security Council was an important diplomatic  gain from which Baghdad will benefit in the consultations to  take place next May. Other sources, however, believe that it is  too early to talk about the results now. A source at the Iraqi  Foreign Ministry, who asked to remain anonymous, said that  Iraq's reaction will be decided after Iraqi Deputy Prime  Minister Tariq 'Aziz returns to Baghdad. The source said that  'Aziz, who will return after two days, will brief the Iraqi  leadership on what took place in the corridors of the Security  Council and the possibilities that he came up with after his  talks and meetings there.    These sources, however, are still leveling accusations at  Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, describing  him as a puppet of Washington and London. Iraqi newspapers  yesterday did not devote their editorials to this subject, but  rather carried news reports [as published]. This strengthens  the opinion that the government's reaction has been delayed  until 'Aziz returns from New York. 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin,  former military spokesman and President Saddam Husayn's press  secretary, told AL-DUSTUR in a telephone conversation that if  the economic embargo continues Iraq will be forced to take  certain measures, including noncompliance with Security Council  resolutions. He added: So long as the Security Council does not  abide by its resolutions, Iraq will be free to cooperate  unilaterally with a number of countries and can resort to many  measures that will affect U.S. interests in the region. Muhsin,  however, did not reveal the nature of these methods, but said  that Washington's insistence on continuing the embargo smacks of  Zionist desire. This, he added, simply means that the  aggression against Iraq and the imposition of the blockade were  not just because of Kuwait, but were planned even before the  Iraqi forces' invasion of Kuwait. Muhsin added that renewing  the blockade is an attempt to exhaust Iraq's military and  economic potential. [passage omitted]    An Iraqi source told AL-DUSTUR that a delegation led by the  chief of the Political Desk at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry is  currently on a visit to Baghdad to hold talks on political and  oil issues. The source added that the three-man delegation met  the day before yesterday with experts from the Iraqi Oil  Ministry.    An economic source revealed figures on the size of Iraq's  commercial activities before the international embargo  resolution was issued. The source said that Iraq has the  potential to be the largest trade market in the region and that  its imports -- which were estimated at $25 billion in 1990 --  will increase to $40 billion when the embargo is lifted. The  economic source said that the economic cycle in the region is  now crippled because one of its basic links is paralyzed. The  source advised Britain, in particular, to realize this fact, and  asked ridiculously: Why does London prefers a 1-billion dollar  market in Malaysia to a 40-billion dollar promising and strong  market?    Interviewed by AL-DUSTUR in Baghdad, political analysts  expressed their astonishment at the pretexts created by  Washington and London to continue the economic embargo on Iraq.  They said that the issue of the Kuwaiti borders is a bilateral  issue that cannot be placed under anyone's tutelage. They  called for leaving the issue for the future and did not rule out  better circumstances in the future to reach results regarding  it. Regarding the file of the Kuwaiti prisoners, whom the  Kuwaiti regime claims are held in Iraq, this file cannot be  closed easily three years after the Gulf war. [passage omitted]</p>

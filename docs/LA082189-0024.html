			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'HEATHEN VALLEY'S' TRUE TALE OF ASPIRING ANGELS  </P> <P> Three things to pray for: "A school that teaches, a hospital that heals and a  church that doesn't presume."  </P> <P> Romulus Linney's "Heathen Valley," in its West Coast premiere at the Grove  Theatre, concerns a Bishop who brought his flock back to God and decided that  that wasn't enough -- he would make angels of them.  </P> <P> Result: disaster. For the people in the valley. Not for the Bishop. He had  moved on by then.  </P> <P> Linney based this 1987 play -- and an earlier novel -- on a true story from his  native South Carolina. He doesn't tell the story cynically. There's sympathy  for the Bishop (Dennis Robertson), who believes himself to be a man of  conscience operating for the good of those entrusted to his care.  </P> <P> He also sees himself as existing on a higher plane than they do. They are  supporting players in his spiritual drama and they must look the part, even  dress the part. "God" loves uniformity.  </P> <P> Do all leaders end up confusing themselves with God? We're much more drawn to  the Bishop's second-in-command, played by Ron Kuhlman. A layman and a sinner,  he is well aware that human nature is twisty (starting with himself), and he's  not too sure about the taller tales in the Bible (starting with the virgin  birth).  </P> <P> Typically, he does the real work of bringing "the heathens" in the valley back  to the light, largely by applying horse sense to their problems. But he's as  lost as they are when the Bishop turns his back on the mission. Linney wishes  that we could get along without the symbolic magic of religion, but suggests  that we can't. All the more reason to use that magic wisely.  </P> <P> "Heathen Valley" is a platform piece, almost an oratorio. Philip Killian's  staging is firmly shaped and earnestly spoken. Life in the mountains, whether  one serves the Lord or the devil, is seen as a serious business.  </P> <P> Due regard is paid to the fact that these are people who speak a kind of  poetry. Each face instantly creates a rural archetype, yet nobody falls into  rural cliche. It is sound, honest acting, on a tidy wood-planked set by Thomas  Buderwitz.  </P> <P> The production is also a bit bland. The voices tend to stay on the same elegiac  note, with the diction not as sharp as it could be. Scene transitions are  smoothly blended, rather than being crisply observed. A contour map of the  performance wouldn't suggest hills and valleys but a contiguous plain.  </P> <P> Too, we'd like more of a sense of the individual face behind the archetype.  David Officer as the young man who tells the story is much less sure about who  he's playing than he was in "South Central Rain," and as a result comes off as  a voice rather than a character.  </P> <P> We instantly see that Kuhlman's lay deacon will keep his pain to himself, while  Dennis Robertson's bishop will enjoy sharing the fineness of his conscience  with the world -- but where do we go from there? The only unexpected piece of  behavior in the play is Kuhlman's sudden demonstration, at a dance, that he's  the liveliest step-dancer in the room. We need more such surprises.  </P> <P> No complaints about Marte Boyle Slout's midwife, Thor Edgell's mountain man or  Christina Carlisi's fierce wife, except that we know everything we're going to  know about them right away. "Heathen Valley" is intelligent, substantial  theater, but the mystery of human personality -- the reason we can't be  programmed into angelhood -- isn't felt.  </P> <P>  Plays Wednesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7:30. (Sept. 10 performance  at 3 p.m.) Closes Sept. 16. Tickets $10-$20. 12852 Main Street, Garden Grove.  (714) 636-7213.  </P> <P> </P></p>

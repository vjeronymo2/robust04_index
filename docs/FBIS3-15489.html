			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program] </F>   [Text] Russia is starting to play a more active role in  settling the Balkans crisis, reinforcing its diplomatic efforts  with a specific peacemaking contribution.    [Unidentified correspondent] The arrival of Russian  paratroopers in the Sarajevo area was a key moment in the  implementation of plans for a political settlement of the crisis  in Bosnia. As stated by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov,  chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces, the  proposed air bombardment of Serbian positions could bring about  a fresh escalation of the Balkans war.    [Begin Kolesnikov recording] I would like particularly to  emphasize that by threatening to make bomb strikes against  targets around Sarajevo, the NATO Command put itself, I would  say, in a fairly ambiguous position. It was publicly stated  that the use of force was to be the instrument which, it was  claimed, would make it possible to normalize the situation  around Sarajevo. In actual fact Western diplomats have admitted  that bomb strikes would have been been regarded in the North  Atlantic alliance as a failure. For this reason the NATO bloc  was relieved to learn the news that, thanks to the efforts of  Russian diplomacy, success was achieved in convincing the  Bosnian Serbs that they needed to withdraw their heavy weapons  from the blockade of Sarajevo. [end recording]    [Correspondent] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin,  commander  of airborne troops, was directly involved in implementing the  plan put forward by Russia for settling the Bosnian crisis.    [Begin Podkolzin recording] I had two meetings with General  Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, who assured me and gave me a guarantee that  our troops would be safe. Of course no one at present is  guaranteeing the lives of our people against the chance sniper's  bullet, but as for large-scale combat actions, both sides and  also the Bosnia-Herzegovina command have given an assurance that  there will not be any such operations. I would like to add that  we brought in this battalion or independent formation of 400 men  on condition that NATO would not make any bomb strikes and that  NATO would verify the fulfilment of the commitments made to NATO  by both the Serbian and Muslim sides. Among other things, I was  there in the locality, and on the whole these commitments were  almost 100 percent carried out. [end recording]    [Correspondent] At the present time our blue helmets are  carrying out their peacemaking mission in the so-called buffer  zone in the Bosnian capital. Along a 16-km front they are  separating Serbs and Muslims. In addition, Russian  paratroopers, together with French blue helmets, are now  guarding Sarajevo Airport. By mid-March there will be 1,500 men  in the contingent of Russian troops in former Yugoslavia.</p>

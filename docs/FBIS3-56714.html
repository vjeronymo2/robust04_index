Two candidates have been put on ballot papers, including  chairman of the North Ossetian parliament Akhsarbek Galazov and  head of the North Ossetian government, Sergey Khetagurov.    For the time being, Galazov has the highest rating,  according  to the results of a sociological poll, ITAR-TASS learned from  the Central Electoral Commission. The turn-out as reported by  10:00 A.M. was average. The people are casting their ballots in  a calm atmosphere and no violations of the franchise have been  reported.

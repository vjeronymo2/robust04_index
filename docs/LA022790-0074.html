			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: CARDENES FINDS HAPPINESS  WITH PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY  </P> <P> When former San Diego Symphony concertmaster Andres Cardenes left town in the  darkest days of the orchestra's canceled 1986-87 season, he did not completely  sever his local ties. Each year Cardenes, who is now concertmaster for the  Pittsburgh Symphony, has returned to perform in various chamber music series.  On March 6 and 8, he will play a pair of recitals with pianist Karen  Follingstad, featuring the solo violin works of Brahms and Schubert, at La  Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church.  </P> <P> After he left San Diego, Cardenes joined the University of Michigan music  faculty with the intention of avoiding the politics and instability of  orchestra playing. It took Pittsburgh two years to woo him away from the  academic confines of Ann Arbor.  </P> <P> The Cuban-born violinist admitted that as his first year as Pittsburgh's  concertmaster draws to a close, his trepidation about returning to play in an  orchestra has been proven unfounded.  </P> <P> "It has turned out much better than I thought it would. So far, I've been wrong  about my reservations -- the usual orchestra mentality, problems of commitment,  and union troubles. Here there's a good give and take with management that  keeps things a lot calmer."  </P> <P> In addition to his solo performing and teaching violin students at Pittsburgh's  Carnegie-Mellon University, Cardenes has been busy cultivating new violin  repertory.  </P> <P> "I've commissioned a new violin concerto by Riccardo Lorenz, which I'll  premiere with the San Antonio Symphony on Oct. 4, 1990. Lorenz is a young  Venezuelan composer who directs the Latin American Music Center at Indiana  University. We were college classmates.  </P> <P> "A year ago, I had asked him to compose a violin and harp piece, which I played  last August at the Skaneateles (New York) chamber music festival. I enjoyed  working with him, so I put him to work on a concerto."  </P> <P> When apprised of the San Diego Symphony's recent return to solvency and  apparent stability, he expressed pleasant surprise.  </P> <P> "I'm glad it's back on its feet. I'm sure Wes Brustad and others worked hard,  and I hope this time they'll stay afloat."  </P> <P> Does he regret leaving San Diego?  </P> <P> "I can only say this. In retrospect it was a good decision, however painful. At  the time, there was not much of a choice. Anybody who knows me knows that I'm a  doer. I don't like to sit around and wait."  </P> <P> Replacement diva. The San Diego Opera has announced that American soprano  Johanna Meier will replace Sabine Hass in the company's Richard Wagner concert  March 20 at Civic Theatre.  </P> <P> The German soprano has been advised by her physicians not to travel, so she  canceled her spring American engagements, including her appearance with New  Orleans Opera as Senta in "The Flying Dutchman," her debut role with San Diego  Opera two seasons ago.  </P> <P> Meier, whose Wagnerian credentials include being the first American to sing  Isolde at Germany's Bayreuth Festival in 1981, performed in a number of San  Diego Opera productions during the 1970s. Her Marschallin in San Diego's 1976  "Der Rosenkavalier" was a memorable performance. She has not sung for the local  company, however, since her Met debut in 1979.  </P> <P> Although Hass will not sing in the Wagner concert, her husband, bass Artur  Korn, will perform as scheduled. His local debut in last season's "Fidelio" was  the most universally praised aspect of that controversial production.  </P> <P> American tenor Gary Lakes, whom many consider to be the newest great white hope  of Wagnerian heldentenors, will complete the trio of singers on the concert.  This all-Wagner program, conducted by Heinz Fricke, music director of East  Germany's Berlin State Opera, will include a concert version of the entire  first act of "Die Walkure."  </P> <P> Musical Mecca. More than 400 string players made inquiry into the San Diego  Symphony's auditions for two first-chair positions and five section vacancies.  Music director designate Yoav Talmi is in town this week to sit in on these  auditions, which started Sunday and will end Wednesday, for which the symphony  chose 150 candidates.  </P> <P> Talmi and the audition committee will hear more than 40 candidates for the  single section viola vacancy, but only 14 cellists are trying out for the  principal cello chair left open when former first-chair cellist Eric Kim took a  similar position with the Cincinnati Symphony.  </P> <P> According to symphony executives, they received inquiries from musicians in all  50 states and from 14 foreign countries.  </P> <P> Opening tonight. Rustavi, the much touted 50-member singing and dancing troupe  from Soviet Georgia, opens a week run at Symphony Hall tonight at 8 o'clock. .  . . At UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium, the Tokyo International Music  Ensemble "New Tradition" will present a single concert of contemporary music  employing traditional Japanese gagaku instruments. Among the composers  represented on this program, which also begins at 8 p.m., are John Cage, Toru  Takemitsu, and UCSD faculty member Joji Yuasa.  </P></p>

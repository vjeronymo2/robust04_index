			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Archer still affected by problems at Lloyd's The problems of Lloyd's of London continued to adversely affect the results of Archer Group Holdings, one of two agencies at the market which have a full stock exchange listing, writes Richard Lapper. Archer, which administers 15 syndicates and is the fourth largest managing agency, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 430,000, compared with a restated Pounds 550,000, for the six months to March 31. Profit commission earned by the agency in the 1991 year amounted to Pounds 1.1m (restated Pounds 1.4m) but were not received by the group until after the end of March. Lloyd's, which reports its results three years in arrears, earlier this month announced losses of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year. Agency fees - earned during the reporting period - fell to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.5m). Despite an increase in capacity managed, fees were reduced from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent of Names' capacity. Expenses rose to Pounds 4.57m (Pounds 3.77m), while underwriting agency operating losses amounted to Pounds 491,000 (Pounds 713,000). Insurance services suffered operating losses of Pounds 64,000 (profit of Pounds 18,000). Mr Bryan Kellett, chairman, said that prospects for the 1992 and 1993 underwriting years, the results of which Lloyd's will report in the next two years, were improving. Losses per share were 1p (1.3p) but the group said it was maintaining the interim dividend at 0.5p in recognition of improving fortunes.</p>

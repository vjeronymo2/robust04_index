			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Police call for anti-drugs campaign The government was facing growing pressure yesterday to launch an education campaign to counter the increasing use of drugs. But as police chiefs renewed their call for attention to be switched from supply to demand for drugs, there was a claim of a cabinet split over plans for a school-based initiative warning of the risks of addiction. Whitehall moved swiftly to deny any rift between Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and the education secretary Mr John Patten after a report in The Mail on Sunday said Mr Patten believed that giving pupils hard-hitting lessons about the dangers of hard and soft drugs could be counter-productive. A joint statement issued by both departments dismissed the report as 'ridiculous and without foundation'. The denial came as Mr Keith Hellawell, the chief constable of West Yorkshire and chairman of the chief constables' committee on drugs, stepped up pressure for government action against the growing demand for drugs. He told The Sunday Times: 'We've won several battles, but we've lost the war. The current policy has not stopped young people turning to drugs.' Mr Hellawell has suggested that cannabis might be legalised at some point as part of a new approach to drugs.</p>

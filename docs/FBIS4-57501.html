			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, 17 May (PL) -- Today, Cuba claimed  it continues to be subject to an intensive radio broadcasting  campaign supported by the U.S. Government which is aimed at  imposing foreign political models on that contry.    Cuban delegate Edgardo Valdes, who participated in the  general debates of the sessions of the UN Committee on  Information, described those actions as a clear violation of his  country's sovereignty and of international regulations on  peaceful coexistence among states.    Valdes said those actions are also contrary to the  information order promoted by this committee and contravene  international rules and regulations on communications signed by  all countries, including the United States.    He recalled that at a recent conference on sustained  development of small islands held in Barbados, UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said "no single theory, model, or  group of priorities can be imposed from abroad" and urged each  society to choose its own path.    This radio policy, however, is being used against Cuba, with  the excuse of an alleged need to inform Cubans, claiming to have  the authority to define what is described as a "free flow of  information." More than 15 radio stations and one television  station are broadcasting to Cuba, Valdes protested.    "Cuba rejects the continuation of that practice and warns  that no attempt to increase those broadcasts will go  unanswered," he noted. Valdes added that as the U.S. Congress  control office has admitted, programs broadcast by those  stations "ignore the majority of positive news about Cuba, or  they are reinterpreted or mystified," and that frequent calls  are made to change the current political system.    Valdes said there are 1.7 radios per family in Cuba, more  than 100 international broadcasts can be heard, including VOA,  and that 400 out of the 600 Western films shown each year are  from the United States.    He added that there is free access to publications of  various  kinds in libraries and document centers, the national television  rebroadcasts CNN, CBS, and other networks' reports, while 120  foreign journalists live in Cuba and hundreds visit the country  each year.    "Even if this were not the case, no foreign government has  the right to decide what the information policy of a sovereign  state should be, ignoring the most basic principles of [words  indistinct] Valdes stressed.</p>

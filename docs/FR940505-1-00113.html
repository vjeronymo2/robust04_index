			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Network Type. Two basic types of inspection networks have existed since the start of I/M programs_centralized, test-only networks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decentralized, test-and-repair networks. A centralized, test- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only network consists of inspection and retest at high-volume,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multi-lane, usually highly automated stations, run by either a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government agency or a single, state-hired contractor within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined area. A decentralized, test-and-repair network consists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of inspection and retest of vehicles at privately owned, licensed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, such as gas stations and other shops which may also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do repair work. California's current I/M program is of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latter variety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 called for EPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop performance standards for both basic and enhanced I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, they also established minimum requirements for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program parameters. In the case of enhanced I/M programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> network type was one of these prescribed parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, section 182(c)(3)(C) of the Act states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced programs must include, at a minimum, ``operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program on a centralized basis, unless the State demonstrates to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the satisfaction of the Administrator that a decentralized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program will be equally effective.'' Based upon its evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current decentralized, test-and-repair programs, as well as upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data gathered by individual states on their own I/M programs'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness, EPA provided for the approval of a decentralized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test-only network as an equally effective alternative, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inherent conflict of interest found in test-and-repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs had been removed. It may be that the State of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California will ultimately choose to design a decentralized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test-only system in order to guarantee that there are many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent businesses which participate in providing inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. But it is not a practical choice for a federally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented I/M program. Given the significantly lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation burden of a centralized system, EPA has determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is appropriate to propose a centralized program for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA has the authority to forbid the State of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California to register vehicles which do not have a certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of compliance with the prescribed enhanced I/M program, it does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have the authority to order the State to write the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules, oversee the construction or licensing of test-only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations or carry out any of the tasks involved in program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation and oversight. Therefore, it is necessary for EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to design a program which will divert as few as possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources from the national environmental effort to the day to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day operation of what would ordinarily be a state-run emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

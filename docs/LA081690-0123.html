			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOPANGA KILLING SHATTERS FAMILY -- AND ILLUSIONS;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE SECURITIES BROKER AND HIS WIFE SEEMED A TYPICAL AFFLUENT COUPLE.  THEN THEY ARGUED ABOUT A GATE TO THEIR YARD, AND HE SHOT HER EIGHT TIMES,  POLICE REPORTS SAY.  </P> <P> David and Grace Lang had a horse called Sweet Pea, four Shetland sheep dogs,  three children and a rose garden that was the envy of Colina Drive in Topanga  Canyon.  </P> <P> But what happened on the night of June 4, police reports say, belied those  trappings of upper middle-class comfort and the image of the hard-working  father who helped pay for them. David Lang, a securities broker, emptied six  shots into Grace Lang's body, then reloaded and fired two more shots into her  head at point-blank range.  </P> <P> What touched off the slaying was deceptively mundane: where to place a gate  outside the family's ranch-style house. But the violent act has led to  revelations that little about the couple's 27-year relationship was as  conventional as it seemed, including Lang's disclosure in court records that he  and Grace were never legally married.  </P> <P> The whole relationship was a bizarre one," said attorney Albert Garber, now  defending Lang against a charge of first-degree murder.  </P> <P> Further complicating the situation is a civil suit the children filed against  their father after their mother's death. The Superior Court case seeks to  prevent David Lang from depleting the family's assets for his criminal defense  and to ensure that the children -- ages 22, 19 and 16 -- will have money for  their daily needs and education.  </P> <P> Garber said that the civil case is being settled and that his client has no  intention of leaving his children without money. The children are living with  relatives and have had no contact with their father since their mother was  killed, Garber said, although Lang, who is being held in Los Angeles County  Jail, would love to see them.  </P> <P> Why someone of Lang's success and lack of a criminal record would resort to  such violence is a question many who knew the couple are asking, and one  expected to be the focus of a preliminary hearing Aug. 24 in Malibu Municipal  Court. Lang, 47, has pleaded not guilty.  </P> <P> "He is in the process of being examined by a psychiatrist to answer the  question of why a man of such intelligence and no element of violence would  shoot the woman he loved," Garber said. He said the former broker for Dean  Witter Reynolds Inc., who earned at least $100,000 a year, killed in  self-defense after years of abuse from a woman who drank and threatened him  with knives.  </P> <P> But police reports and friends of Grace Lang portray David Lang as the troubled  spouse, describing him as a driven, controlling man whose final act of rage  against his 46-year-old common-law wife was set off when she moved a gate  without his permission.  </P> <P> Court records indicate that the couple had been bickering over the gate most of  the weekend of June 2 and 3, and continued the argument Monday night, June 4.  </P> <P> "When the suspect saw what had been done on Saturday morning with the gate, he  became enraged because it was done without his permission," said a report by  Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators.  </P> <P> "The victim accused him of being a 'dictator' in his own house," the report  continues, citing Lang's own description of the argument after his arrest. He  also told investigators he had been "deeply in love" with Grace since 1963,  their reports said.  </P> <P> But the couple "had not gotten along for several years," their 16-year-old  daughter told investigators, adding that "her father is very abusive both  physically and mentally toward her mother."  </P> <P> The daughter was awakened by the 11:30 p.m. shooting and her mother's cries for  help, police reports said. She ran to neighbors who phoned for emergency help.  </P> <P> Neighbors on Colina Drive -- where residents greet each other on horseback and  along the trails of Topanga State Park -- declined to discuss the Langs as a  couple. But they described Grace Lang as a gentle, friendly woman who hiked  daily and took pride in her garden.  </P> <P> "She was a hiker, a mother and a happy person," close friend Esperanza Riskin  said. "She had a beautiful garden filled with roses, lots of roses. She had the  prettiest garden in the neighborhood."  </P> <P> Riskin said Grace Lang had a college degree in anthropology but never used it.  Most recently, she had worked as a secretary in a Woodland Hills pharmaceutical  company.  </P> <P> "She was a very generous, warm, good person, and I think this was a horrible,  horrible act," Riskin said. Of Lang's allegations that it was Grace who was  abusive -- drinking and wielding knives -- Riskin vehemently denied the  characterization, saying, "That's not her."  </P> <P> John Walsh, Grace Lang's employer at the Boots Co. Inc., remembered her as a  warm, efficient woman and said he found David Lang's allegations that she was a  knife-wielding threat hard to believe.  </P> <P> She was clearly devoted to her children, Walsh recalled. The boys checked in by  phone regularly, and she would pick up her daughter from high school each  afternoon and bring her back to the office until it was time to go home, Walsh  said. "You could see they had a strong bond," Walsh said, adding, "I just saw  her as really the one who was holding the family together."  </P> <P> Adrian Lang, 19, said in an interview that his mother was "really close to all  three of us even though each us of were different." Of his father, Adrian said:  "He wasn't even a father when he was here. He was just like the businessman who  came home and barked at everybody."  </P> <P> Lang was a father under pressure to pay for his children's schooling, cars and  trips to Europe, his attorney said. Lang has been fired from Dean Witter since  his arrest, a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> Lang also supported a fourth child from a previous marriage, Garber said. The  son, now 22, was born within a month of when Grace Lang gave birth to the  couple's oldest son.  </P> <P> David Lang disclosed in court records that after his sons were born in the  spring of 1968, while he was still legally married but involved with Grace, "it  became impossible me to maintain two separate residences, one with my legal  wife . . . and the other with Grace."  </P> <P> So Grace Lang and the baby moved in with Lang, his wife and the other baby,  "and we all lived together for a period of time," his statement said.  </P> <P> David and Grace, whose last name was Lujan, never married because "we mutually  had the same opinion that no marriage was necessary," Lang said in his court  statement.  </P> <P> A former biology teacher, Lang changed careers to support his family, his  attorney said. He loved to read and the den where Lang kept his handgun also  contained 10,000 books, Garber said.  </P> <P> Lang appeared to be under constant pressure to succeed in business, according  to colleagues and clients -- several of whom wrote letters to Municipal Judge  Lawrence J. Mira on Lang's behalf.  </P> <P> "Something horrible had to have happened to him for him to have resorted to  such a thing," Lynn James, a client of Lang for eight years, said in an  interview. "It was just the biggest shock in my life when I heard the news."  </P> <P> James praised Lang's sound investment advice, availability and patience.  </P> <P> "Any time I had a question, no matter how stupid it was, he'd take the time to  answer it and explain it," she said.  </P> <P> Robert Levy, who worked with Lang for several years at a now-defunct bond  brokerage, similarly described Lang as a diligent municipal bonds broker who  worked 12-hour days, often skipping lunch.  </P> <P> Sometimes the men worked together at night, Levy said, and Lang had confided  that his marriage was strained over how to discipline the teen-agers. Lang  favored a stricter approach while his common-law wife was more liberal, Levy  and Garber said. "I feel as though David is innocent in this situation and it's  only because I feel there was a lot of pressure brought on him through whatever  was going on," Levy said.  </P> <P> But another former colleague, securities broker Steven Siskin, recalled Lang as  an extremely high-strung man with a reputation for confrontation. Lang could be  overheard speaking harshly to his children on the phone, said Siskin, and he  was known around the office for disagreements set off by seemingly petty  matters.  </P> <P> In one such confrontation, Siskin said, Lang provoked a third broker into a  shouting match after repeatedly turning over or pushing aside the other man's  family photographs on a shared filing cabinet. In another instance, Lang became  angry when his birthdate was added to a list of office birthdays without his  permission, Siskin said.  </P> <P> "You're going to find a situation not all black on one side and not all white  on the other," attorney Garber said. "It's a tragedy. There's no justification  for it, but there may be an explanation of how it could reach that level."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMODITIES;  </P> <P> OIL JUMPS ON NEWS OF SPECIAL OPEC MEETING  </P> <P> Crude oil futures rose sharply Thursday after OPEC ministers agreed to hold an  emergency meeting on May 2 to try to brake the recent price slide that pushed  crude to its lowest levels in 16 months.  </P> <P> Prices rallied immediately after word spread that the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries had decided to call a special session of its eight-member  monitoring panel.  </P> <P> Sadek Boussena of Algeria, the cartel's acting president, said an urgent  meeting was necessary, "given the persistence of the deterioration registered  on the international oil market."  </P> <P> "This meeting will examine the measures needed to halt the constant degradation  of the market and to raise prices so as to re-establish them at the level set  by OPEC," Boussena said in a statement released by Algerian officials in  London.  </P> <P> The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, jumped  $1.10 per 42-gallon barrel to settle at $18.06 on the New York Mercantile  Exchange. Other contracts also gained.  </P> <P> "The market has decided to take it very bullishly," Nick Antill, analyst at the  London-based investment firm of County NatWest, said of OPEC's announcement.  </P> <P> The crude had been trading in the range of $20 to $21 a barrel early in April.  It plummeted nearly 90 cents in the two previous sessions, finishing at its  lowest since December, 1988.  </P> <P> Prices have been pummeled on reports that OPEC was exceeding its own output  limits at a time of seasonal declines in demand by oil consuming nations.  </P> <P> The average price of seven crudes used as the cartel's reference plummeted to  $15.38 a barrel last week, compared to $17.12 a barrel in the first week of  April and well below OPEC's target price of $18 a barrel.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Police have reported that Demetrio Limoniel Chavez  Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano" or "Loco Limoniel," has had direct  contact with "Artemio" and "Clay," who are, respectively, the  political and military chiefs of the Shining Path's Huallaga  Regional Committee and were members of the terrorist  organization's national board. Both Artemio and Clay were close  to Abimael Guzman Reynoso, aka "Gonzalo."    Even though "Vaticano" gave the Shining Path thousands of  dollars as "quota" or "contributions," the drug trafficker said  he was not the only one to do so, adding that there are other  "firms" (organizations of "drug traffickers") who have done the  same and are still paying large amounts of money.    Among the firms are the groups led by "El Ministro," "Lucho  Culon," "Cholo Claudio," and "Cachiques."    During a news conference at DINCOTE [Counterterrorism  Directorate] facilities on 27 January, it was reported that  "Vaticano" was practically the "king" of Uchiza in 1988 and 1989.    After that he moved to Campanilla, Mariscal Caceres Province  (San Martin), where among other things he repaired a stretch of  the Marginal Highway to use it as an airstrip.  <H5>  Services to Other `Firms' </H5>   This was the point of departure for not only his small  planes, but he also used the airstrip to render services to  other "firms," with the protection and security granted by the  Shining Path, which was paid $5,000 per flight plus $3 per  kilogram of basic coca paste or $6 per kilogram of washed coca  paste.    Furthermore, Vaticano has supplied terrorists with war arms  (FAL and AKM rifles, submachine guns, pistols, etc.),  transportation services, military outfits, communications  equipment, food, medicine, and information on the activities of  the forces of order.    Repented terrorists identified by codes AIA-000083,  AIA-000092, AIJ-O55461, and AIJ-O55463 have confirmed this  information, positively identifying "Vaticano" as the person who  gave money to "Artemio" and "Clay," and to other terrorist  leaders known as "Mancini," "James," and "Liborio," whom he used  as liaison for paying "quotas" or contributions.    DINCOTE sources said "Vaticano" has admitted before the  special military prosecutor that he is a "narcoterrorist" and  that when he had his operations center in Uchiza and Campanilla,  he supplied the Shining Path with medicine, food, clothes,  transportation, etc.    But he did not admit that he supplied firearms, ammunition,  and explosives.    It should be noted that along with "Vaticano," DINCOTE also  has pressed high treason charges against Shining Path chiefs  "Artemio" and "Clay," who were charged "in absentia."  <H5>  Narcoterrorism Uncovered </H5>   DINCOTE sources said this is the first time police have  arrested a drug trafficker of "Vaticano's" level who has  cooperated with terrorism, thus confirming the existence of the  so-called "narcoterrorism."    "In the past, references were made only to the union of  terrorism and drug trafficking. Countless documents hinting at  it were found but there was no direct evidence. Now we have it,"  the sources said.    One of the major documents shown at the 27 January news  conference is the "Economic Balance of the Shining Path,  produced by the `quotas' of (TID) [illegal drug trafficking]  firms," which DINCOTE seized on 23 August 1993 in the village of  Anda (Tingo Maria).    The balance book has detailed information on daily  operations  with income and expenses. It also clearly shows that they  charged $3,000 to $7,000 per flight by small planes.    The balance book, which is dated March 1991, mentions  "Limoniel" as a debtor for flights that were already made.</p>

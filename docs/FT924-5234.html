			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Metro gets go-ahead for Asko deal GERMANY'S federal competition authorities yesterday reversed their decision to stop Metro, the privately-owned Swiss retail giant, from buying a majority stake in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, a large German retailer. The reversal, coming just over two weeks after the Bundeskartellamt ruled that the merger would have been uncompetitive, paves the way for the creation of one of the world's largest retail groups with combined sales of more than DM70bn (Dollars 44bn). The Berlin-based competition authorities have given their go-ahead to the transaction because the two companies have given binding undertakings to sell off businesses with turnover of DM1.3bn, a relatively small share of the two companies' total sales in Germany which exceed DM50bn. The authorities originally said that the transaction would have given the new grouping anti-competitive market dominance in certain parts of Germany in a number of different retail sectors. However, the proposed sales of businesses in food, furniture and DIY sectors are enough to remove the original worries, the cartel office has decided. A statement from Mr Erwin Conradi, Metro's chief executive, said that the forced sales would be painful and lead to a serious weakening of its market position in a number of sectors. He said, however, that the fusion would lead to meaningful synergies between the two groups. The stock market welcomed the new yesterday, and Asko's shares rose from DM500 to DM533 on the assumption that the companies would benefit from the tie-up. Asko lost DM269m last year on sales of nearly DM20bn, reflecting write-offs on acquisitions and share stakes. Sales had risen 64 per cent from 1991, reflecting the acquisition of the Co-op retail group. Metro, which reported turnover of DM46bn last year, was founded by Mr Otto Beisheim, who copied the 'cash and carry' concept from the US and opened his first store in Germany in 1964. Although the company subsequently moved its headquarters to Switzerland, it expanded rapidly and aggressively in Germany and it owns majority stakes in a number of German retailers, including the quoted Kaufhof and Kaufhalle. Metro announced it wanted to acquire a majority in Asko in July. The move has the support of Asko's management and although Metro's direct stake in Asko is only 11 per cent, it is thought to have accumulated more than 50 per cent via indirect holdings.</p>

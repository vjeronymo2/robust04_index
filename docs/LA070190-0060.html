			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: WALTER PISTON ET AL: NATIVE GENIUS  </P> <P> The name of Walter Piston (1894-1976) isn't frequently encountered after  leaving college, where his textbooks on harmony and orchestration are among the  student's indispensable guides. Piston's compositions are accordingly tarred as  academic, as if writing texts and teaching at a university -- Piston was the  bulwark of the Harvard composition faculty for three decades -- were synonymous  with lack of creative imagination.  </P> <P> Piston was not only an inspiration to his students, a glittering, heterogenous  assemblage that included Elliott Carter, Irving Fine, Harold Shapero and  Leonard Bernstein, but was himself an important creative force, as the current  recorded examination (live performances remain rare) of his sizable output  indicates.  </P> <P> As part of their ongoing American music recording project -- still, at this  writing, handsomely supported by the National Endowment for the Arts -- Gerard  Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony are turning their attention to Piston's eight  symphonies, with Nos. 2 (1943) and 6 (1955) and the 1941 Sinfonietta making up  the initial release (Delos 3074).  </P> <P> The Second is a terrific piece, emotionally spare, yet full of lively rhythms  and some ear-sticking tunes. The brilliant orchestration and all that  contrapuntal activity may be textbook stuff in certain respects, but Piston  wears his erudition lightly -- and he did, after all, write the book.  </P> <P> The Sixth is more self-consciously grand and showily orchestrated, but with a  gregarious, sharp-witted scherzo/second movement to balance the rhetorical tone  of the outer movements.  </P> <P> Both symphonies are projected with optimum clarity, affection and skill by  Schwarz and his responsive Seattle musicians, while the third work on the  program, the tough, dark Sinfonietta (1941) has Schwarz leading the New York  Chamber Symphony.  </P> <P> Samuel Barber, like Piston, spent a period of time studying with Nadia  Boulanger in Paris during the '20s, but, unlike the clear-eyed Piston, he  became fully immersed in the spirit of European Romanticism while there.  </P> <P> That Romanticism comes to full flower in the 1948 "Knoxville, Summer of 1915"  settings of deep-South nostalgic texts by James Agee. "Knoxville" -- is there a  more lushly lyrical vocal work in all of American music? -- is for the first  time recorded by non-native forces: British soprano Jill Gomez, in a  performance of gorgeous, relaxed sensuality, with the City of London Sinfonia  under Richard Hickox (Virgin Classics 90766).  </P> <P> The title of Leonard Bernstein's 1988 "Arias and Barcarolles" originated much  earlier, in an approving comment made about Gershwin by President Eisenhower  after Bernstein had played that composer's music at the White House: "I like  music with a theme, not all of them arias and barcarolles." (One assumes he  meant tune rather than theme.)  </P> <P> Bernstein's appealing composition has both tunes and a theme, that of love  (which sounds thin when so blandly stated), projected largely in dialogue form,  to (mainly) his own texts.  </P> <P> Its first recording (Koch 7000) is a smashing success. The star of the event is  Judy Kaye, whose fearless characterizations and the ability to vary vocal  delivery from laceratingly acidulous to comfortingly mellifluous make her  perhaps the one soprano in captivity equally at home in musical comedy and on  the recital stage. Her skilled, dedicated colleagues in the enterprise are  baritone William Sharp and the piano duo of Michael Barrett and Steven Blier.  </P> <P> Koch's coupling is a collection of the wry best of the Bernstein of "On the  Town," "Wonderful Town" and "Songfest," with the same performers. Not a dud in  the lot, and there's a revelation: the wrenchingly lovely "Dream with Me,"  dropped from Bernstein's 1949 "Peter Pan" score and never before recorded. Kaye  sings it with the textual sensitivity and vocal control of a lieder singer, the  naturalness of a mistress of pop.  </P> <P> Not content with the limited exposure likely for the chamber original,  Bernstein commissioned from composer Bright Sheng an orchestration of "Aria and  Barcarolles" which has been recorded by the Schwarz-Seattle team (Delos 3078).  The expansion succeeds only in diminishing the score.  </P> <P> The rueful, person-to-person quality of the original slips into theatrical  posturing when Bernstein's intimacies are pitched against an ensemble of  strings and percussion. Furthermore, Delos' female protagonist, Jane Bunnell,  is too contained and neutral in expression to offer even token competition to  Kaye.  </P> <P> And, while Dale Duesing, with his gleaming, cultivated baritone, is potentially  more communicative than Koch's Sharp, the orchestration is against him.  </P> <P> Delos' program further includes Barber's "School for Scandal" Overture and a  first recording of Gershwin's "An American in Paris" in an edition that  restores, to minimal effect, some measures the composer deleted from the score  after its premiere.  </P></p>

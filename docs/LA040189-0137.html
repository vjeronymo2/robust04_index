			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR MUSEUM  </P> <P> Charles Desmarais is the new director of the Laguna Art Museum. He is off to an  excellent (start), most recently obtaining for the museum the David Park  exhibition. This is a show that comes from the Whitney Museum of American Art  in New York, and contains many works from an 11-year period of the Bay-area  figurative painter.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum does so much for Orange County's cultural life. It is a  pity that too few of the residents of Orange County support the museum. With  membership one receives free entry to the museum, so by joining now, one can  support the museum and be able to see the David Park exhibition. It closes May  7.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum needs the funds to continue to perform its mission. Your  readers should support this vital institution, and enjoy the privileges of  membership by experiencing these important exhibitions.  </P> <P> GENE FELDER  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN AFRICANS WITHER, BORDIN WINS IN BOSTON  </P> <P> It is by now a familiar sight: the start of a marathon, one of sport's most  grueling trials, and runners from Africa shoot off the line, sprinting, with 26  miles to the finish.  </P> <P> It is a style uniquely African, and one that has proved ultimately successful.  The world record-holder, Belayneh Dinsamo of Ethiopia, grinds down his  opposition in this manner.  </P> <P> Thus, when eight African runners started Monday's 94th Boston Marathon at a  shocking pace, there was little surprise. That the pace was not maintained was  no surprise, either. Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania led the race to a halfway time of  1 hour 2 minutes 1 second, an improbable 2:04 pace.  </P> <P> Gelindo Bordin of Italy has seen it before, too. The Olympic champion resisted  the urge to go with the leaders and, after their energy or legs failed them,  Bordin patiently moved up, utilizing the fast pace to win in 2:08:19, a  personal best and an Italian record. The world record is 2:06:50.  </P> <P> The stampede at the start was an impressive sight on a warm, sunny Patriots  Day, with more than a million spectators lining the streets to watch this  annual spectacle.  </P> <P> "It never ceases to amaze me the aggressiveness and the abandon with which the  Africans attack a marathon," said Rob de Castella of Australia, who won here in  1986. He placed fifth Monday. "They just go as hard as they can and keep on  going as long as they can. It's inspirational."  </P> <P> The women's race had no such wild abandon. Prerace favorite Rosa Mota of  Portugal won in 2:25:24. Uta Pippig, who fled East Germany just before the fall  of the Berlin Wall, was second in 2:28:03, and Maria Trujillo of Phoenix was  third in 2:28:53. Kim Jones of Seattle, ranked No. 3 in the world, was fourth  in 2:31:01.  </P> <P> John Campbell of New Zealand set a world master's record in placing fourth in  2:11:04. Campbell, 42, bettered Jack Foster's record of 2:11:19. Mustapha Badid  of France won the men's wheelchair race in 1:29:53 and Jean Driscoll from  Champaign, Ill., won the women's wheelchair race in 1:43:17.  </P> <P> Bordin and Mota each won $50,000, and Mota became Boston's first female  three-time winner.  </P> <P> Ikangaa, 29, has a history of finishing second in big races. In 1988, he was  passed by Ibrahim Hussein in the last steps of this race: Hussein won by one  second. Ikangaa was the runner-up here last year, losing to Abebe Mekonnen of  Ethiopia. Mekonnen also beat him by 11 seconds in Tokyo in 1988, and Ikangaa  was beaten by three seconds in Fukuoka in 1983.  </P> <P> Asked the obvious question about placing second here for the third year in a  row, Ikangaa paused then said: "Yes, it is very disappointing. But I will keep  trying until I win."  </P> <P> Bordin and the rest of the field watched in amazement as a pack of nine  runners, including Salvador Garcia of Mexico, bolted from the start, covering  the first mile in 4:26.  </P> <P> The usually effusive Bordin had this simple assessment of the strategy: "Those  guys were crazy."  </P> <P> Perhaps, but Bordin went with the leaders for the first few miles, while de  Castella headed up the distant second group, a more sensible group he would  later say.  </P> <P> "I knew they were running fast, because I was running fast and they were out of  sight," de Castella said.  </P> <P> The lead pack was, for most of the race, an all-African group. In fact, it was  an all-Rift Valley group, with two runners each from Tanzania, Kenya and  Ethiopia. Ikangaa moved into the lead at four miles, and the group settled into  an easy rhythm, passing water and sponges among themselves and, despite the  torrid pace, looking comfortable and in control.  </P> <P> The group was more than a minute under world-record pace early and showed no  sign of breaking up. In the group were these surprises: Kip Kimeli of Kenya,  the 1988 Olympic 10,000 meter champion; Tesfaye Tafa of Ethiopia, running in  his first marathon, and Simon Robert Naali of Tanzania, a once-lightly regarded  runner who placed third at the Commonwealth Games in January.  </P> <P> By 10 miles, Naali dropped off the pace. Of those in the lead group, only  Ikangaa and Hussein -- old adversaries in this race -- looked prepared to keep  the pace as it was. Their half-marathon time of 1:02:1 was one of the fastest  halfway marks ever. Steve Jones of Wales ran 1:01:42 in Chicago in 1985, but  most runners say that such a pace frightens them.  </P> <P> Bordin was hanging back, 46 seconds behind at the midway point, still not  believing the pace. "I thought, 'This is crazy,' " he said. "I ran too fast the  first half. If someone would run a 2:04, I would shake his hand. But I really  thought something would happen."  </P> <P> It did. Ikangaa first broke off from his pack, but as he gathered himself for  his own long kick, his body unraveled.  </P> <P> At 16 miles, Ikangaa made his move, dropping Hussein and pushing the pace for  two more punishing miles, just to make sure.  </P> <P> "I wanted to keep that pace," Ikangaa said. "I was thinking of a record. About  that time, someone held up a sign that said we were on 2:05 pace. I was  thinking 2:07."  </P> <P> Such thoughts were short-lived, however. Running alone and squinting into a  bright sun, Ikangaa had no idea what was unfolding behind him. Hussein and  Naali dropped out. Bordin was methodically picking off the remnants of that  first pack and came within sight of Ikangaa. Someone shouted to Ikangaa that  Bordin was behind him, and both raced up Heartbreak Hill with six miles to go.  </P> <P> Bordin passed Ikangaa just after they crested the hill. Then it was Ikangaa's  turn to be left behind. The Tanzanian was unable to go with Bordin, he said,  because of a cramp in his left calf. At that point, he began to worry about  being caught for second.  </P> <P> He never was as he finished in 2:09:52. Rolando Vera of Ecuador, running in his  first marathon, was third in 2:10:46.  </P> <P> Mota emerged from an emotional week, culminating in a long-sought agreement  with the Portuguese federation. The agreement allows her to choose where and  when she will run, a freedom she has not enjoyed in the past.  </P> <P> Mota said she was unsure if she could set aside her emotions in time for the  race.  </P> <P> "I felt very nervous before the race because I didn't know if I could  concentrate with everything that has happened," she said. "When I started  running, I forgot everything and ran a good race. I came here today to win, not  break my fastest time."  </P></p>

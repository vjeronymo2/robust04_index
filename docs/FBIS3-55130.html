Not a single  national radical has made it into the supreme legislative organ  this time. In electing 72 deputies for the next four years from  224 candidates, the republic's population definitely showed its  preference for centrists.    Between 18 months and two years ago the republic experienced  an upsurge of national extremism -- there were open-ended  rallies in Nalchik's main square attended by thousands of people  calling on the authorities to resign, protest hunger strikes,  and even an attempt to storm Government House. In order to  defuse the situation, V. Kokov then relinquished his powers as  chairman of the republic's Supreme Council. Tired of living  under the threat of violence, the people rejected the  extremists' calls and in the first presidential elections  plumped for V. Kokov from among the many candidates. His policy  of stabilization, consensus, and unity with Russia is supported  today too. Confirmation of that was the first joint session of  the chambers held just before the New Year. It elected the  chamber chairmen and deputy chairmen backed by President V.  Kokov. The Council of the Republic is headed by Vice Premier Z.  Nakhushev, who is a Kabardin. The Council of Representatives is  headed by M. Zhaboyev, technical director of the Tyrnyauz  Tungsten and Molybdenum Combine (Europe's largest), who is a  Balkar. The deputy chairmen are Russians -- L. Fedochenko,  deputy director of the Uplands Geophysical Institute, and Ye.  Golovko, director of a sewn goods enterprise.    A note of consensus was struck by the voters themselves.  Contrary to the fears that people would vote only for  representatives of their own ethnic group, the Russian Mayskiy  Rayon elected as parliamentary deputy the Kabardin Yu.  Shomakhov, while Nalchik plumped for a Kabardin, a Balkar, and a  Russian. But the republic is most proud of the fact that a  confident victory in the elections to the Council of  Representatives was won by A. Shkhagoshev, a senior official at  the Kabardino-Balkar MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]  Administration for Combating Organized Crime, who lost his hands  when confiscating a grenade from a participant in the open-ended  rally outside Government House 18 months ago. People from  different ethnic groups collected money to pay for him to be  treated in Germany. The German doctors managed to achieve the  inconceivable -- they sewed his hands back on. Adalbi Lyulevich  can now do a great deal with these hands -- he even drives.</p>

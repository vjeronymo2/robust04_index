			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Demand for new homes still rising A further sharp rise in demand for new homes has provided evidence that consumer confidence has not been derailed by April's tax increases, according to a survey of more than 400 housebuilders. The survey published today by the Housebuilders Federation shows a bigger rise in sales of new homes than in the general housing market. According to the federation, net reservations of new homes - agreed sales on which deposits have been paid, less cancellations - increased in every month this year compared with the corresponding months last year. The federation said sales of other homes have risen more slowly judging by recently published estate agents' figures. These were inflated last spring by sales from the private sector to housing associations and Business Expansion Schemes. The federation said that the proportion of builders reporting house-price increases had risen steadily since the beginning of this year. Almost a third of builders reported last month that prices had increased in the past 12 months, with a quarter saying that prices had risen by 1 per cent to 2 per cent. This compares with 65 per cent reporting static prices and only 2 per cent reporting price falls. Sales figures were more impressive with 64 per cent of companies reporting an increase in net reservations compared with April last year  - 16 per cent said net reservations had fallen and 20 per cent said they were static. Four-fifths of builders expected sales to increase this year compared with 1993. The sales rise has been supported by a big increase in site visitors with 61 per cent of companies reporting a rise in site visits in April compared with 12 months earlier. The federation said that the proportion of companies reporting sales and price increases was higher last month than in March. The strongest growth in site visitors and net reservations was in north-west England, East Anglia, Greater London and south-east England. Mr Richard Adamson, the federation's chairman, said the market, after a dipping a little in the previous month, had bounced back in April with 'new homes sales leading the housing market as a whole. 'Clearly the anticipation of April's tax increase had more effect on the market than the reality of the increases, and it's reassuring to see this reflected in the April figures,' he added. Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, has forecast that house prices could rise by at least 5 per cent this year provided consumer confidence does not subsequently weaken because of tax increases. House sales on the same basis could rise by 10 per cent or 15 per cent. Most observers, however, say it is too early to assess the full impact of tax increases.</p>

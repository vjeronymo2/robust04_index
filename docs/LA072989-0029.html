			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> A LANDSCAPING SHOWROOM AT THE FULLERTON ARBORETUM  </P> <P> Three predominant impressions came to mind as I completed a recent tour of the  Fullerton Arboretum, located on the campus of Cal State Fullerton: This is a  very practical arboretum; it is a historically fascinating place; there is  something here for everyone.  </P> <P> You don't have to be a horticultural aficionado to enjoy and benefit from a  visit. It is a most practical place to observe plants and determine how they  will fit into your particular home landscape or gardening situation.  </P> <P> For instance, do you want to know how a particular rose will look and perform  under Southland growing conditions? Visit the Rose Section; chances are the  rose you are interested in will be there in full bloom, along with many other  modern roses and a fine collection of old-fashioned ones.  </P> <P> What about growing fruit trees in Southern California? Wander through the  Subtropical Fruit Grove and check out fruit trees designed for our climate. A  visit right before harvest time will demonstrate which peach, apple, apricot,  plum, etc. varieties produce the best. Urban gardeners will be particularly  interested in the Dwarf Fruit Section, which features a selection of  space-saving dwarf fruit trees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rare Fruit Collection  </P> <P> Within the Subtropical Fruit Grove is a marvelous collection of rare fruit  trees maintained by the California Rare Fruit Growers, whose headquarters is at  the arboretum. Exotic cherimoyas, papayas and guavas are just a few of the rare  fruit varieties growing here, most of which may be suitable for planting in  your own yard. Incidentally, you can sample some of these rare fruits in season  by purchasing them at the arboretum gift shop.  </P> <P> Xeriscaping (landscaping with drought-tolerant plants) is a subject of  particular concern in our semi-arid climate. Visit the various collections and  specimens in the Arid Zone Section of the grounds and pick out plants that  might fit into your particular landscape.  </P> <P> The arboretum sponsors a Community Garden Area, consisting of 48 garden plots  each planted and maintained by dedicated individuals. These people have done a  marvelous job with their vegetable and flower plots. Browse through the area on  a weekend and chat with these enthusiastic gardeners. They'll proudly show you  their garden and perhaps supply you with a few gardening tips. In addition,  there is a new organic demonstration garden where you can view vegetables being  grown organically.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 19th-Century Ambience  </P> <P> At the center of the Historic Section of the arboretum stands Heritage House  with its surrounding gardens and structures that take you back to the 1890s in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Heritage House was built in 1894 by Dr. George C. Clark, a pioneer Fullerton  physician. It was both his home and office and has been lovingly and  authentically restored as a museum depicting Southland family life in the late  19th Century. It is a prime example of Eastlake Victorian architecture that was  prevalent in Orange County at the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Of special interest are the surrounding gardens, which are reproductions of the  gardens tended by the doctor's wife. Included here are a kitchen garden  featuring heirloom vegetable varieties, a cut-flower garden with flowers of the  era, a culinary herb garden and a fascinating medicinal herb garden like the  one the doctor utilized to produce the medicines he dispensed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orange County Oranges  </P> <P> In close proximity to Heritage House is the Historical Orchard, devoted to  fruit trees that were important to the early development of agriculture in  Orange County. Among trees included here are Bacon, Hass and Furete avocado  trees grown from the original budwood, and the Olinda Valencia orange tree, a  variety that contributed so much to Orange County's early economy.  </P> <P> Apropos of orange trees, scattered throughout the various orchard sections are  specimens of the original trees dating back to the time when the land now  occupied by the arboretum and university was a working orange grove.  </P> <P> Among other diverse and interesting attractions at the Fullerton Arboretum is a  working apiary containing beehives maintained by three CSU professors. Honey  from the hives is on sale at the gift shop.  </P> <P> A stream containing native chub and stickleback fish meanders through the  beautiful grounds and includes a small waterfall and a lake.  </P> <P> Additional horticultural adventures include a carnivorous-plant bog, an  extensive cactus and succulent garden, conifer and palm collections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deciduous Display  </P> <P> Homesick for fall foliage? If so, plan to visit the Occidental Section during  autumn. It is full of deciduous trees adapted to Southern California growing  conditions, many of which put on a beautiful fall foliage exhibit.  </P> <P> In addition, there are many other plant collections, plant areas and  interesting individual plant specimens. In the Tropical Section, I was  delighted with the monkey-hand trees, which got their name from the hand-shaped  interior of their large red flowers. Incidentally, the tree is pollinated by  bats.  </P> <P> If you would like to get educationally or culturally involved, the arboretum  offers many opportunities by providing lectures, tours and demonstrations.  There is a Heritage House tour on selected Sundays, when the authentically  furnished interior of the home can be viewed. A Victorian Christmas celebration  centers on the house during the holiday season.  </P> <P> A good selection of plants displayed at the arboretum is available at the  weekend plant sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community Endeavor  </P> <P> The arboretum was established in the 1970s by students and faculty at the  university, along with the City of Fullerton and various community groups.  </P> <P> My tour was conducted by Celia Kutcher, the resident curator-taxonomist, and  Rico Montenegro, the assistant director. They are part of a small but dedicated  professional staff that relies heavily on the 800-member Friends of the  Arboretum support group for assistance.  </P> <P>  The Fullerton Arboretum is at the northeast corner of the university campus.  Take the California 57 to Yorba Linda Boulevard. Turn west on Yorba Linda and  go to the first stoplight, at Associated Road; turn south onto the campus. The  arboretum is open from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. daily except major holidays.  Admission is free, but donations are appreciated. Phone (714) 773-3579 for  information.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft Pounds 0.73m loss better than expected WHITECROFT, the Cheshire mini-conglomerate which has slimmed down to three core businesses, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 727,000 for the half year to September 30, compared with profits of Pounds 2.23m. That was better than expected, but the company is sticking to its decision to pass its interim dividend, announced a few days before the end of the period, when it forecast losses of about Pounds 1m. A decision on the final dividend will be taken in June. The improvement over forecast was the result of revaluation of Whitecroft's pension fund, which actuaries said would be adequately funded at company contributions of Pounds 600,000 a year, compared with Pounds 1.3m previously. The figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 164,000). In previous years these were largely charged against property development and did not appear in the profit and loss account. Turnover fell 4.6 per cent to Pounds 60.19m (Pounds 63.1m) for trading profits down 62 per cent to Pounds 904,000 (Pounds 2.39m). Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said the group's two years of restructuring were now largely complete, with Pounds 3.6m of capital spending in the last six months, substantial cutting of the cost base and a reduction in numbers of operating units from 30 to 15. Losses per share were 2.89p, compared with earnings of 3.25p. The payroll was 1,900, compared with 2,500 a year ago and more than 3,000 when Mr Goold became chairman late in 1990. He said marked improvements in cash flow and profitability were expected from January. Gearing is 102 per cent and shareholders' funds declined Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 38.6m because of the loss and disposal of the group's double-glazing businesses. Whitecroft now has lighting, doors and medical cotton fibres divisions, all of which are trading profitably.</p>

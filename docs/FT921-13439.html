			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Melbourne bank plunges into red BANK OF Melbourne, one of Australia's newest licensed banks, plunged into the red in the December half, reflecting its exposure to the Occidental/Regal life insurance crash, writes Bruce Jacques in Melbourne. The bank yesterday disclosed it had suffered a loss of ADollars 21.1m (USDollars 15.5m) in the half, against a ADollars 13.1m profit last time. The loss followed a ADollars 65m pay-out to the judicial manager of the two life companies after the bank settled a prolonged legal action.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE: ARIAS, DUETS AND OVERTURES BY VERDI, DONIZETTI, ROSSINI, GOUNOD,  MOZART AND LEHAR. KATHLEEN BATTLE, SOPRANO; PLACIDO DOMINGO, TENOR;  METROPOLITAN OPERA ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY JAMES LEVINE. DEUTSCHE GRAMMOPHON 427  686-2 (COMPACT DISC).  </P> <P> The occasion for this potpourri concert, the Met's spring 1988 visit to Japan,  summoned superlative sonics in Tokyo's Bunka Kaikan and gleaming performances  from all participants. Domingo's attempts to fill Don Giovanni's baritonal  shoes remain as bewildering as ever, but he and Battle infuse duets from "La  Traviata," "L'Elisir d'Amore," "The Merry Widow" and "Romeo et Juliette" with  considerable poise and style. Levine's traversals of the overtures to "La Forza  del Destino" and "L'Italiana in Algeri" are spit-and-polish affairs, and the  audience reaction is understandably vociferous. ALLAN ULRICH  </P></p>

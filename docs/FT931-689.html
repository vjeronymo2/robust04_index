			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Trade talks seek to avert US sanctions, revive Gatt round SENIOR US and European Community trade officials hold critical talks in Brussels today aimed at averting US sanctions over EC government purchasing policies, and at restoring momentum to stalled negotiations on global trade liberalisation. The most urgent task facing Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and the US trade representative Mr Mickey Kantor will be to find a compromise in a dispute over government contracts. At the centre of the disagreement is an EC rule that Washington believes gives unfair preference to Community companies in winning public contracts. A US threat of sanctions affecting about Dollars 45m to Dollars 50m of EC goods was put on hold following talks in Washington last week between President Bill Clinton and Mr Jacques Delors, EC president. US officials have warned that sanctions will go ahead later this week if Sir Leon and Mr Kantor fail to reach a compromise. The row could rapidly escalate, as the EC says it is ready to retaliate. The talks coincide with figures published today by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that show world trade grew by 5.5 per cent to Dollars 3,700bn (Pounds 2,600bn) last year, reversing four years of slowing growth. Gatt officials are calling for fresh efforts to be made to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation at a time when 'trade has been a source of relative strength in an otherwise mostly weak economic environment'. Both the EC and the US say they are keen to use the meeting between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor to revive the Uruguay Round. Today's talks are expected to be confined to charting a route towards a market access package under which the EC would lower tariffs on electronics products, non-ferrous metals and paper and wood products. The US in turn is being pressed to cut high tariffs on textiles, ceramics and glass products. A wide-ranging review of US trade policy is still in progress in Washington, making definitive US statements unlikely this week. Mr Kantor meanwhile signalled to EC negotiators in an interview with the FT that while trade politics fascinate him, trade theology does not. 'I'm not going to be caught in a theological debate that does not lead to practical and pragmatic results,' he said. 'It does not matter what you are called or how you are labelled, it matters what we get done. The idea is not to engage in endless debate about whether someone is a free trader, a protectionist, a managed trader or results oriented,' Mr Kantor said. He added that the US 'is the largest open market in the world, and it is not going to change and everyone knows that'.

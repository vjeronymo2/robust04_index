			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Turkish Cypriot leader </F> Rauf Denktas]    [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus, sent a second letter to UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot side  is ready to discuss the confidence-building measures concerning  the Cyprus problem.    In his second letter, Denktas announced that the Turkish  Cypriots accept in principle articles 37, 38, 42, and 43, which  stipulate the transfer of Maras [Varosha] to UN administration  and the opening of Lefkosa [NIcosia] Airport to traffic. In the  letter, Denktas also declared that he is ready to discuss the  implementation of the said articles with Greek Cypriot  Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis.    In a statement to TRT, Denktas charged that Kliridhis found  himself in a difficult situation after the Turkish Cypriot side  announced its readiness to discuss the confidence-building  measures and sent a letter to Butrus-Ghali in an attempt to  alter the agenda. Denktas pointed out that Kliridhis tried to  eliminate the guarantee agreements by raising the proposal to  demilitarize the island.    Denktas remarked that following this confusion, he asked Joe  Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus, to  clarify the matter and therefore wrote the second letter.  Denktas added: There is no sense in solving the issue through  statements without sitting at the negotiating table. As we have  always stated, if a picture emerges from the negotiating table  to the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot people, one that  guarantees the interests and security of the Turkish Cypriots in  line with the stipulations of the UN secretary general and the  experts' reports, then our Assembly can say yes to this. If,  however, such a picture does not emerge, then we can make a  reassessment. Therefore, we stated and underlined our position  once more. If the negotiations are to begin, then let them.</p>

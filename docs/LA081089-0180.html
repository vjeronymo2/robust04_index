			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCNB BUYOUT OF U.S. SHARE IN TEXAS BANK COMES EARLY  </P> <P> NCNB Corp. on Wednesday bought out the federal government's 51% interest in  NCNB Texas National Bank, completing the $1.32-billion purchase of the  institution created in the nation's costliest bank failure.  </P> <P> The buyout, announced 10 days ago, comes four years ahead of a timetable  established last year when NCNB was selected to manage the 40 failed banks of  First RepublicBank Corp.  </P> <P> In that deal, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB also got a five-year option to buy all  of Texas' largest bank holding company, which has $27.9 billion in assets. NCNB  changed the company's name to NCNB Texas at that time.  </P> <P> With the acquisition, NCNB becomes the nation's ninth-largest commercial bank,  with about $60 billion in assets and $43.2 billion in deposits.  </P> <P> NCNB paid $210 million for a 20% share of NCNB Texas on Nov. 22, then  accelerated its plans, paying $310 million for an additional 29% on April 28  and $800 million for the remaining shares Wednesday.  </P> <P> The price gives a $270-million profit to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  which provided $840 million of the initial recapitalization of First  RepublicBank. FDIC is also financing part of Wednesday's purchase through $320  million in a one-year, interest-bearing note.  </P> <P> In all, the government has estimated that the First RepublicBank rescue will  cost $3 billion.  </P> <P> Improved profits at the Texas institution led to NCNB's decision to move up its  purchase, the bank said last month. NCNB Texas earned $63.1 million in the  second quarter, with $28.8 million going to NCNB Corp.  </P></p>

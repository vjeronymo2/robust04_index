			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ljube Profilski: "Promotion of Cooperation </F> Between Two States"]    [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  and Albanian President Sali Berisha had "informal, but friendly"  discussions yesterday, accompanied by their wives and  delegations from the two states. The meeting of the two  presidents, which was held on the territories of the two states,  had a characteristic course and contents. At first, discussions  were held at the presidential residence in the Albanian town of  Podgradec by the side of Lake Ohrid. In the afternoon the  Albanian delegation headed by President Berisha crossed the  Albanian-Macedonian border for a short visit to Ohrid and made a  tour of the cultural and historical monuments together with the  Macedonian delegation headed by President Kiro Gligorov.    President Berisha welcomed Macedonian President Gligorov in  front of the residence and the two presidents held private talks  for an hour. After that the two delegations joined the  discussions. Then Gligorov and Berisha went for a short walk  along the side of the lake, stopping for a brief discussion near  the lake. They held discussions without an interpreter.    After the discussions, both presidents made statements to  journalists, assessing the talks as very positive, fruitful, and  as a step forward in the development of relations between the  two states. Moreover, we found out from unofficial sources that  the talks were held in an open, friendly, and relaxed  atmosphere, that a number of questions were raised, and that it  was concluded that there were not and that there should not be  open questions between the two states. We have also found out  that President Berisha confirmed that Albania would support the  admission of Macedonia to the CSCE. The Albanian side also  supported the census in Macedonia.    In his statement to journalists Berisha said that he had  invited President Gligorov, his wife, and his closest associates  to spend the weekend together, so, as he put it, "the meeting is  not official, but friendly, and I need hardly assure you that it  is very positive. We have had open, friendly discussions and we  talked particularly about cooperation between the two countries.  We agreed to work on deepening this cooperation.  Substantially, we talked about better communications between  the two countries. The opening of the air traffic route  Skopje-Tirana is very important." The two sides assessed the  signing of a great number of agreements as very useful because  they will promote this kind of cooperation. For instance, the  transportation of goods and people by rail, and so on.    Sali Berisha also said that Albania was ready to help store  1.5 million tonnes of fuel in Albanian ports and depots, as well  as another million tonnes of other goods. "I think it is very  important," he said, "to abolish visa requirements for the two  border zones for a distance of 20 to 25 kilometers, on which the  two sides will have to agree. This will be one of the initial  steps toward a total abolition of visa requirements. The  signing of other agreements, such as the one on economic  cooperation and on guarantees for investment, will encourage  better opportunities for the promotion of cooperation and  friendship between the two states."    "We," Berisha said, " discussed political cooperation, too,  as well as relations in the Balkans. I personally welcome the  efforts of President Gligorov to carry out the census in  Macedonia and to pass the law on the census, as well as for the  further promotion of the rights of Albanians in Macedonia, for  the daily publication of the newspaper "Flaka et Vllazerimit,"  for the expansion of radio and television broadcasts in the  Albanian language, for opening a faculty for teachers in Skopje,  for the expansion of the secondary school system, and so on.  All these will increase the role of the Albanian factor for the  stability of Macedonia and of the Albanian population in  Macedonia. We also encourage the contribution of the Albanian  political forces in Macedonia within the framework of the  government coalition to the stability of the state. We also  discussed the development of the situation in the region. Both  countries are resolute in their efforts to be integrated into  Europe and European institutions. At the same time, both  countries are resolute in overcoming the present difficulties  through dialogue. Ultimately, we think that the cooperation  between Albania and Macedonia represents a contribution not only  on the bilateral, but also on the regional plane. President  Gligorov has invited me for an official visit to Macedonia,  which I have accepted with pleasure," Berisha said in conclusion.    President Kiro Gligorov told the journalists that the two  delegations had discussed a number of questions related to  further cooperation in all fields in an unofficial but friendly  atmosphere on this beautiful day. "In this respect," Gligorov  said, "we have a broad understanding of the need to promote  cooperation between the two neighboring countries, for which we  have concluded that there are a lot of possibilities and a lot  of reasons. The absence of a railroad track connecting our two  neighboring countries is not normal. That is a remnant of the  past. The most fruitful cooperation is cooperation between  neighbors in the first place. Such things as a railroad track,  with the possibility of using the ports in Albania, as we have  been offered here, open perspectives for promoting overall  economic cooperation. In addition, after the establishment of  diplomatic relations at the highest level, our relations need  legal regulation. In order to build relations on a long-term  basis it is necessary to have regular cooperation in all fields.  It can help not only the promotion of economic cooperation but  also the security of the borders. We spoke of an agreement on  economic cooperation, on guarantees for mutual investment in  order to avoid double taxation, an agreement on cultural  cooperation, and mutual care for the borders and a gradual  increase of traffic there."    "All the neighboring countries," Gligorov continued, "ease  traffic and economic cooperation between people at the borders.  We have to urge the experts in this direction, to make them sit  down and discuss that. Concerning our cooperation in the  Balkans, we have concluded there are many reasons for  maintaining peace and stability. We have remained outside this  senseless war and I think we have to secure this. That is  another reason for good cooperation. It is of extraordinary  importance to take the necessary measures in each country for  the Albanians in Macedonia and the Macedonians in Albania to  feel they are in their own state, and our mutual assessment was  that the implementation of the census will cancel one item from  the agenda that was causing or could cause misunderstandings.  In each country it is necessary to know the number of citizens  who consider themselves Albanians or Macedonians; in each  country they are citizens who must enjoy all their rights and  have all their responsibilities. This and the atmosphere at our  discussions, with a common European orientation, must represent  a reason for the respective ministries to meet; we must urge  more frequent and more successful meetings between our  economists, as well as other delegations, in order to construct  an atmosphere of greater confidence day by day."    "The official visit of President Berisha to Macedonia will  be  of great importance. So far all our meetings have produced  results and proved our good relations. I hope that at the next  official visit of Sali Berisha to Macedonia we shall make a step  forward. I am grateful for the cordial hospitality," Gligorov  said.    After lunch at the residence both delegations left for Ohrid  where they visited cultural and historical monuments.  Presidents Gligorov and Berisha visited Saint Clement's Church,  the gallery of icons in the church, and Saint Sofia's Church,  and then they took a walk in the old part of the town as far as  the port. In a good mood and in nice weather President Berisha  showed a special interest in Ohrid's historical sights. After a  short rest in the "Biljana" residence in Ohrid, Sali Berisha  returned to Albania.</p>

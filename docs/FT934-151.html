			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar moves higher The dollar rose against the D-Mark and yen on new indications of robust US growth next year, Peter Marsh writes. Traders in London were reported to be looking for further gains in the US currency over the next few weeks, while few were willing to bet on any relaxation in German interest rates when the Bundesbank council meets on January 6. While the Bonn government on Tuesday made bullish noises about a recovery from the damaging German recession next year, the message from German industrial groups yesterday was less encouraging. The inference from this is that some on the Bundesbank's policymaking body may consider appropriate a small easing in monetary conditions, especially as news on the inflation front recently has been fairly positive. Helping the dollar to gain in thin holiday trading were data indicating continued strength in the US economy, particularly in the previously hard-pressed housing market. Sales of existing US homes rose 2.9 per cent in November from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.21m, the National Association of Realtors said. The US government's main economic forecasting gauge showed a fourth straight gain in November as industrial activity picked up. The index of leading indicators, which is supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead, rose 0.5 per cent after an identical increase in October. Helped by this news, the dollar rose to a European close of DM1.718, a gain of 1 1/2 pfennigs on Tuesday's finish. Against the yen, it rose to Y111.8 against Y111.35 previously and was close to brushing the 'wall' of Y112. The Federal Association of German Industry said it expected only a slight recovery in west Germany in 1994, with little chance of higher employment. This gloomy tone was reinforced by the HDE German retailers' association, which said German store groups would shed at least 30,000 jobs next year. These reports may encourage hopes of a cut in German interest rates next month. In London the Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 487m, through its bill operations and Pounds 195m of 'late assistance' - lending to discount houses at an unspecified rate. This compared with its forecast of a Pounds 750m liquidity shortage. In Frankfurt, German call money rates tightened as the Bundesbank unexpectedly drained a net DM5.1bn from the banking system in its money market operations. The pound slipped against the stronger dollar, closing in European trading at Dollars 1.4915, compared with Dollars 1.5085 the previous day. Against the D-Mark, sterling was little changed at DM2.5624. With effect from today, the currency rates used in the FT's tables will use data from a new source - the WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rates, after more than a year of preparation by WM, Edinburgh-based portfolio valuation specialist. The main change for readers is that the new data will be based on currency values established at 4pm London time during the previous day's trading, rather than the time of around 5pm used up to now. Research by WM indicates that 4pm not only captures a larger selection of quotes from continental contributors to the Reuters system, but also reflects more accurately the peak trading period for the London and New York foreign exchange markets. The main purpose of the venture, supported by leading London market practitioners, is to establish a daily standard for the foreign exchange rates required for index calculation, investment management and portfolio valuation. For the first time, a single suite of rates is available that will allow accurate comparisons between competing indices and competing funds. Outside the financial community, users of foreign exchange rates for commercial contracts and transactions will benefit from access to a more consistent set of data. Because the market functions round the clock, establishing authoritative 'closing' rates for currencies has previously been difficult. As a result no single, consistent set of foreign exchange rates has gained universal acceptance. WM has developed a mechanism with Reuters to calculate and publish a daily fixing, based on market rates derived from Reuters' foreign exchange reporting system. The initial selection of 62 currencies includes all those included in global or regional indices. Besides using data from the WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rates for the foreign exchange tables published in the newspaper, the Financial Times, with its partners Goldman Sachs and NatWest Securities, has adopted the rates for use in the FT-Actuaries World Indices. Other leading users of foreign exchange data which will adopt the standard include international index compilers such as J P Morgan, Morgan Stanley Capital International and Salomon Brothers. The system will work by selecting - at short intervals before and after 4pm London time - representative bid, offer and mid rates for the 62 currencies against the dollar. Anomalous data will be screened out, and a median rate calculated for each currency. Spot rates for all 62 currencies against sterling are then calculated as cross rates from the dollar parities, reflecting foreign exchange market practice.  -----------------------------------------             POUND IN NEW YORK  ----------------------------------------- Dec 29            Latest    Prev. close  ----------------------------------------- Pounds spot       1.4815       1.5080 1 mth             1.4842       1.5054 3 mth             1.4742       1.5008 1 yr              1.4622       1.4890  -----------------------------------------</p>

Bin-Ghalbun said:  "Since that group broke away there have been voices calling for  prudence and trying to dissuade this group from its plan under  the pretext of unity, claiming that splits weaken the unity of  ranks and serve the interests of the regime only. But that is  untrue, because the split is prompted by the care for national  interests and aimed at correcting and strengthening the moderate  national line." He expressed his hope that "the new  organization will become one of the active and strong Libyan  organizations. I know some of the men responsible for its  establishment, management, and guidance. They are capable of  shouldering the responsibility and are experienced and  knowledgeable and their national commitment and sincerity are  above all suspicion." [passage omitted]</p>

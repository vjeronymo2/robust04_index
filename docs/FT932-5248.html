			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: SMH shrugs off recession as profits rise by 64% SMH, the group that rescued the Swiss watch industry in the early 1980s, continues to buck the recession, with a 64 per cent rise in 1992 net profit to SFr413m (Dollars 290m), higher dividends and a forecast of further brisk growth. 'We hope that we shall record a considerable increase in profit and sales this year,' Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman, told the group's annual press conference yesterday. Mr Hayek pointed out that the group was planning for sales to double over the next five years to SFr5.5bn. SMH is best known for its Swatch watches, but it also makes several other famous brands - including Blancpain, Omega, Longines, Tissot and Rado - and is an important supplier of watch components for third parties. It has begun making a line of Swatch telephones and is developing an environmentally-friendly Swatch car. The car project suffered a setback in January when SMH's partner, Volkswagen, withdrew. Mr Hayek said SMH was continuing to negotiate with other potential partners. The project was absorbing only about 5 per cent of SMH's investment budget, he said. Mr Hayek said last year was 'the best ever' for the world watch industry, with production up 4 per cent to 860m units. SMH's sales surged 12 per cent to 86.9m units. This year, in spite of dull economic conditions in many key markets, 'we have found that our watch sales are still growing', he said. Sales were up more than 16 per cent in the first four months and profit growth was higher. He predicted that the group would have net cash balances of SFr1bn by the end of the year, compared with SFr262m at the end of 1992, but said no acquisitions were planned. The directors have proposed a 28.6 per cent rise in dividends for 1992, to 18 per cent of the nominal value of its two classes of shares and participation certificates.</p>

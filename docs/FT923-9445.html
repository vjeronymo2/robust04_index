			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fears Chinese wool boost may not last - Prices are holding last season's gains but the outlook is unclear THE NEW Zealand wool season has begun with prices holding on to the gains achieved last season. But the Wool Board warns that the surge in Chinese demand that did much to fuel last season's price recovery may not be maintained this year. Last season was seen as a turning point. Though farmers' returns were generally lower than in the previous season because of the loss of the minimum price support scheme, the season's average price rose 4 per cent from 422 to 437 NZ cents (Pounds 1.25) a kilogram. Looking ahead, the board says the demand outlook from developed countries appears positive in the new season, though growth rates will remain low. Allowing for the 10 per cent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar since last December, prices of New Zealand wool have not increased significantly in overseas currency terms, enabling it to maintain its price competitiveness with artificial fibres. The board expects the supply of New Zealand wool to drop slightly with a fall in production and a continued reduction of stockpiled wool from board stocks. In its annual review, it says much will depend, as in the past, on the centrally-planned economies. 'The Chinese economy is in danger of overheating as it did in 1988, which suggests their high level of purchases last season may not be maintained.' This would particularly affect prices of medium micron wools. Sales to Russia are likely to depend on the availability of credit, while exports to the Indian subcontinent may also decline as demand for hand-knotted rugs eases in developed countries. 'However, these negative factors are expected to be offset by increased demand from the developed economies as they emerge from recession' the board says. The season began on a weak note in July because of the suspension of the minimum price scheme in February and worries about high stocks and world recession. Prices deteriorated rapidly, hitting a 45-year low in October of 369 NZ cents a kilogram. If prices had stayed at that level wool farming would have become uneconomic. Devaluation of the currency and better demand saw prices begin to firm, reaching peaks of 515 cents a kilogram in late February and 530 cents in late April before dropping back to close the season in June at 468 cents. In the first sale of the new season on July 31 the index closed at 471 cents. The high level of prices at the time of the seasonal production peak, which surprised traders, was caused by short-term hiccups in supply and unexpectedly strong demand. In part, this appeared to be because European manufacturers needed to buy to keep their mills going at a time when they were keeping their stock positions low because of the recession. The second peak of the season in April and May coincided with the announcement that the board was negotiating a sale to Russia, formerly one of New Zealand's most important customers. The board says the prospect of the sale and its effect on prices then is an indicator of what will happen when the former Soviet republics eventually return to the market. The Russian sale, from board stocks, has yet to be finalised. The agreement in principle followed the signing of western loan agreements with Russia, and it was expected that the board would be able to sell 16,000 tonnes of wool, worth NZDollars 100m. The board says the recovery occurred in spite of negative influences. Economic growth rates in western economies remained low, while the Commonwealth of Independent States purchased minimal quantities during the season. However, the New Zealand industry managed to sell a greatly increased volume of wool. As production fell 3 per cent, the board reduced its stockpile from 72,000 to 53,400 clean tonnes. The provisional figure for wool production last season shows a 3 per cent drop to 221,000 clean tonnes. Total sales at auction dropped 9 per cent while private sales rose 18 per cent, taking their share of the market to 27 per cent. Sheep numbers fell 5 per cent to 54.3m, the lowest since June 1965. Provisional trade figures show wool exports rose 22 per cent to 230,000 clean tonnes, worth 12 per cent more at NZDollars 1.08bn. Wool product exports also rose 12 per cent to bring the grant total to NZDollars 1.307bn. Wool was New Zealand's third largest export after meat and dairy products. China dominated the market taking 21 per cent of all exports buying 48,000 tonnes, while some of the 10,000 tonnes shipped to Hong Kong also went to China. Australia's struggling wool industry was dealt another blow yesterday when South Australian police said they were investigating allegations of a substitution racket involving wool destined for export, reports Reuter from Sydney. Police said documents were seized from premises in Port Adelaide on Tuesday but no charges were laid. The alleged fraud involves the substitution of poorer grades of wool for fine grades stored in a warehouse after sale. Details were not released. But a senior official of the Australian Wool Corporation said the allegations could not have come at a worse time for the industry, which has been hurt by world recession, fashion changes and weak demand from China and Eastern Europe. 'Anything that has the potential to cause customers of our product to be apprehensive about its use is something which stands to cause us damage,' said Mr Peter Wallace, the AWC's general manager of industry services. 'Markets are clearly sensitive to information which questions the quality of the product.'</p>

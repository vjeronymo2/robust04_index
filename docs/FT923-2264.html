			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: German acquisition lifts Saint-Gobain SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and materials group, saw its net profits rise by 9.8 per cent to FFr1.35bn (Dollars 210.18m) in the first half of the year compared with FFr1.22bn in the same period last year. The group benefited from the acquisition of Oberland, the German glass maker, last year. Oberland's contribution helped to offset the sluggish state of the international building materials market, which has been hit by the slowdown in the construction industries in North America and western Europe. Turnover rose by 3.6 per cent in the interim period to FFr38.77bn from FFr37.41bn and operating profits increased to FFr3.69bn from FFr3.58bn. Income from industrial investments fell to FFr2.14bn from FFr2.27bn, while income from financial investments fell to FFr1.09bn from FFr1.34bn. The glass treatment divisions showed growth during the first half, although Saint-Gobain's construction materials interests suffered from slowdowns in North America and Brazil. The group's paper and reinforced fibre businesses were hit by a fall in prices. Ceramics were affected by the problems of the capital goods sector. The group had hoped to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from 56 per cent last year to about 40 per cent by the end of this year. However Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman, warned earlier this year that it would be unable to achieve its target. The debt/equity ratio fell to 55 per cent, on net debt of FFr20.3bn, at the end of the interim period, from 62 per cent on FFr21.9bn, at the same point in 1991. Clarins, the French skincare products manufacturer, yesterday announced a 20 per cent increase in net profits to FFr130m from FFr108.2m in the first half of the year. Clarins said that it still hoped to achieve its aim of 15 per cent growth for the year, in spite of the difficult state of the international marketplace.</p>

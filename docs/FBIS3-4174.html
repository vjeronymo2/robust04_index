			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 28 Mar (XINHUA) -- While holding talks  with Korean [ROK] President Kim Yong-sam at the Great Hall of  the People this morning, State President Jiang Zemin said  emphatically: In developing Sino-Korean relations, we should  keep in mind peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,  development and prosperity in the Asian region, and the 21st  century.    Jiang Zemin said: "Although China and Korea established  diplomatic relations not long ago, relations between the two  countries have developed rapidly, leading to ever-widening  fields of exchanges and cooperation, thanks to the joint efforts  of the two sides. We are pleased with the smooth development of  relations between the two countries."    He said: Friendly relations between China and Korea now have  a very good foundation. Moreover, they possess the conditions  and possibilities for further developing these relations. In  particular, there are good prospects for strengthening and  deepening mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the  two countries. The two countries may explore specific industrial  sectors for cooperation, as well as the forms of cooperation.    He said: President Kim Yong-sam's current visit is bound to  give a positive impetus to further developing relations between  the two countries.    Last November, Jiang Zemin met with President Kim Yong-sam  in  Seattle in the United States. He expressed his pleasure at  meeting with Kim Yong-sam again four months later and at  exchanging views on relations between the two countries and on  issues of common interest.    Kim Yong-sam expressed great pleasure at having an  opportunity to visit China. He said: Korea and China enjoy a  traditional relationship dating back several thousand years.  Economic cooperation between the two countries is highly  complementary, and there are quite a few favorable conditions in  this respect.    He said that he had been deeply impressed by his visit to  Shanghai the day before. There is tremendous potential for  economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. They  can cooperate in such industrial sectors as aviation,  automobiles, and electronic program-controlled telephone  exchanges.    Kim Yong-sam noted: Further cementing economic and trade  cooperation between the two countries will play a tremendous  role in stabilizing the economy in the Asia-Pacific region, or  even in the world at large. It will help promote world peace  and stability.    Kim Yong-sam expressed his belief that the visit would  prompt  the Korean side to actively encourage its enterprises to invest  in China so that Korea would become China's reliable partner for  economic and trade cooperation, and that cooperation between the  two countries in all fields would be promoted further.    Speaking of the situation on the Korean peninsula, Jiang  Zemin said: The Chinese Government sincerely hopes that  long-term peace and stability will be maintained on the Korean  peninsula, and it supports the call for a nuclear-free Korean  peninsula. Without peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,  there will be no genuine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific  region.    He said emphatically: In dealing with the issue of the  Korean peninsula, one should proceed from the overall  consideration for maintaining and developing peace and stability  on the Korean peninsula. The nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula should be resolved properly through dialogue within a  trilateral framework involving the four sides.    President Kim Yong-sam noted: The Korean side also hopes  that the nuclear issue of Korea [DPRK] will be solved through  dialogue and negotiation, instead of through pressure, and that  China will continue to play its role toward this end.    He invited President Jiang Zemin to visit Korea at a  convenient time. Jiang Zemin expressed his thanks and noted  that relevant specifics would be discussed separately through  diplomatic channels.    During the talks, the two leaders also briefed each other on  economic development in their countries, exchanging views in  this regard, and on regional and international issues of common  interest.    Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and  concurrently foreign minister, and Wu Jichuan, chairman of the  Chinese Government's reception committee and minister of posts  and telecommunications, were present at the talks.    Also present at the talks were Han Sung-chu, ROK minister of  foreign affairs, and Kim Chol-su, ROK minister of trade,  industry, and energy, who are accompanying President Kim  Yong-sam on his visit.    Prior to the talks, President Jiang Zemin hosted a ceremony  in the central hall of the Great Hall of the People to welcome  President Kim Yong-sam and his wife on their official visit to  China. Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the National People's  Congress Standing Committee, and others attended the ceremony.    In the evening, President Jiang Zemin hosted a banquet there  for Kim Yong-sam and his wife and delegation.</p>

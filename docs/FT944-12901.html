			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (9): A strategy to beat inflation - Rising costs Buying a house is probably the largest capital expenditure most people expect to make. But if you intend to educate your children privately, you should not be surprised if school fees come a close second or, depending on the number of children, even first. Estimates put the cost of sending a child through primary and secondary school at Pounds 100,000. The average annual fee for the independent day schools in this survey is Pounds 4,117, and Pounds 9,914 forboarding schools. Some of the best-performing boarding schools are charging fees of more than Pounds 4,000 per term for the first time this year. These include Eton (2nd: Pounds 4,128), Winchester (4th: Pounds 4,262), and Roedean (27th: Pounds 4,135). These would make a dent in your income even if your child qualified for a scholarship. Boarding-school fees inflation was well above the retail price index in the early 1990s and still remains higher, although it has slowed down in the past year. If fees are to rise above inflation and will be paid over a long period  - at least 10 years  - you may need to plan their payment. As with any grand operation, a strategy is needed: Keep it simple. Some financial advisers may bombard you with complicated school-fees plans. If you do not understand how the plan works forget about the proposed investment. There is little point in risking learning the hard way once you come to pay the fees. Keeping it simple also involves choosing a flexible way to plan. Most school-fees planning packages are based on the endowment policy but their main problem can be the lack of flexibility. Mr Anthony Murrell of Knight Cavendish Information Technology, which has a school-fees software package, says: 'All too often circumstances can change and the money will be needed for purposes other than school fees.' Other schemes are specifically designed to pay school fees, such as educational trusts. 'Tied schemes usually impose penalties if the money is not spent on education and they are regarded as fiscally vulnerable because of their charitable status, which could well be removed by a change in government,' says Mr Murrell. It is never too soon to start saving  - the best time is before the child is even planned. If you have chosen a flexible mix of investments and your plans change  - your child wins a scholarship or you decide to emigrate  - you can use the money for something else. Do not be too speculative. Stock market investments go up and down but schools demand regular payment. It is best to mix stock market investments, such as unit or investment trusts held within a personal equity plan (Pep), with deposit-based investments for a stable backbone. If you are choosing unit trusts for your Pep you could narrow your choice, from among the 1,500 or so on offer, to the tracker funds which have lower charges. Gartmore UK Index which tracks the FT-SE-A All-Share has an annual fee of 0.5 per cent and no initial charge, combined with top 25 per cent performance in the UK general sector. Deposit-based investments include Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) which allow you to save up to Pounds 9,000 over five years. Interest is tax-free if the account is held for its full five-year term. National Savings products are another stabilising force. The new 42nd-issue savings certificates pay a tax-free 5.85 per cent a year when held for five years. The return is equivalent to 9.75 per cent gross for a 40 per cent taxpayer (7.8 per cent gross for a lower-rate taxpayer). The maximum holding is Pounds 10,000 but husband and wife can each have a holding. The Children's Bonus Bond (Issue G) pays 7.85 per cent a year if held for five years but the maximum holding is Pounds 1,000. Bear the interest rate cycle in mind. Now that interest rates look more likely to move up, it is probably a good idea not to put everything into fixed-rate savings, to avoid losing out on the possibility of higher guaranteed rates in the future. Parents worried that their school fees will escalate might decide it is a good time to fix mortgage payments. If interest rates do rise, you have the security of knowing what your monthly mortgage payments are  - even if school fees increase. About two-thirds of parents sending children to private schools have not made financial plans to do so. If you are one of them and need to top up payments made out of income, you are likely to be restricted to taking out a loan. Claremont Savile, independent financial adviser, runs a scheme for the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis) which is most suitable for those with a large amount of equity in their home. The mortgages are provided by Citibank Mortgage or Halifax building society and structured so that funds can be drawn down to meet the cost of fees up to four times a year. The maximum loan is 85 per cent of the property's value. The mortgages are not based on endowment policies. Instead, Claremont Savile advises the use of a pension where possible and, depending on circumstances, a free-standing additional voluntary contribution, as the most tax-efficient way of repaying, although other options, such as a Pep can also be used. Finally, there is a limited amount of central and local government help. The Assisted Places Scheme pays for children from low-income families to go to independent schools, while some local authorities may be able to give scholarships or bursaries. Charitable bodies, some international organisations and professional associations may also be able to provide help. Further details about the relevant bodies to contact are available from Isis.

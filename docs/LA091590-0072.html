			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A PLEA FOR THE TREES  </P> <P> Excess tree trimming is going on in the West Valley, where they are cutting  over 70% of healthy branches for no reason at all. I understand that if a tree  presents a hazard, it should be taken care of, but this is not the case.  </P> <P> When I called City Hall and spoke with the person in charge of the project, he  told me that there is not much that he could do, because these so-called "tree  trimmers" (I'll call them "tree killers") are private contractors and they have  to cut as much as possible to make a profit.  </P> <P> So, who is in charge? How can we stop them before they destroy the beauty of  our trees and deprive us of shade on our sidewalks?  </P> <P> The city should use the money to plant trees, not to kill them.  </P> <P> CARLOS LACAMARA  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

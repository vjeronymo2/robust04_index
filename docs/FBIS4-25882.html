			<p>CSO   <F P=106>   [Editorial: "Preserve Hong Kong's Value to China"] </F>   [Text] The 10th anniversary of the official signing of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration falls on 19 December this year.  For nearly 10 years since the signing of the Joint Declaration,  China, Hong Kong, and the world have undergone enormous and  profound changes.

What changes have happened in China, Hong Kong, and the  world  over the past 10 years or so? On the world scale, the biggest  change is that the Cold War has ended, peace and development  have become the theme of the times, and international relations  have switched to a track dominated by economics. As far as  mainland China is concerned, reform and opening up have further  unfolded on an overall scale since the mid-1980's.

China has become the engine of Asia's economic development. As  far as Hong Kong is concerned, it entered a transitional period  upon the signing of the Joint Declaration. The Chinese  Government's basic principles and policies toward Hong Kong laid  down in Annex 1 of the Joint Declaration material.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / PM's brother in graft probe Mr Paolo Berlusconi, younger brother of Italy's new prime minister, has become implicated in a fourth corruption investigation by Milan magistrates. According to press reports yesterday, Mr Paolo Berlusconi admitted two weeks ago paying L800m (Pounds 334,000) in 1988 and 1989 to facilitate a development project in the suburbs of Milan. The payments were allegedly made by Edilnord, his construction group, to a local Socialist mayor and two planning officers. Previously Mr Paolo Berlusconi has acknowledged another L1bn payment by Edilnord for property developments in the Milan suburbs, but said he was forced to pay the money. Until transferred to Mr Paolo Berlusconi in 1992, Edilnord was part of the Fininvest empire controlled by his elder brother, Silvio. In another development yesterday the Milan public prosecutor demanded prison sentences of four years eight months for two former Socialist mayors, Mr Paolo Pillitteri and Mr Carlo Tognoli, for alleged corruption related to contracts with Aem, the municipal energy company. The prosecution also called for prison sentences of between two and three years for four former politicians and six businessmen. Mr Pillitteri is a brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader. Mr Craxi was yesterday reported to be recovering in a Tunis clinic amid reports that Milan magistrates will soon seek his arrest for alleged corruption.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The government is working to effectively implement  its ``Copyright Law,'' said a senior legislator on Tuesday.    And rules are being made to crack down on exporters who  abuse  foreign intellectual property rights, according to Cai Cheng,  vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's  Congress.    Customs will aim to prevent pirated goods from being shipped  out of the country, he said.    And on the domestic front law enforcement bodies will  investigate ``major and important'' cases in cooperation with  the departments of science, technology, culture, public  security, industry and commerce.    Intellectual property rights courts are already operational  in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the booming special economic  zone adjacent to Hong Kong.    The Central government will improve its supervision of law  enforcement by local authorities, Cai said.    But while the government will do its best the  non-governmental sector is being encouraged to help, Cai said.    Lawyers and auditors and professional science, technology  and  culture associations must all do their bit.    ``When organized, they can provide services, including legal  consultancy and investigations into complaints,'' he said.    According to official statistics, an average of 13,000 cases  of trademark abuse and counterfeit goods are reported every  year, including 500 that directly affect foreign companies.    Cai attributed this to the fact that intellectual property  protection is still new in China. ``But the country is sincere  and serious in its effort to improve,''he said.    The country is now a member of the World Intellectual  Property Rights Organization and has signed the Paris Convention  on Industrial Property Rights Protection, the Madrid Convention  on International Registration of Trademarks and the Berne  Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rediscovering a taste for the Midlands - Engineering companies have recently been popular stocks GLYNWED International, more generally accustomed to a life in the shade as an indicator of UK industrial fortunes, a stalwart of the Midlands engineering industry, has suddenly looked fashionable. There has been a minor vogue on the stock market for engineering companies. Since the beginning of the year a host of Midlands industrial groups, especially second line stocks like Concentric, Bromsgrove Industries, Ash &amp; Lacy and Dowding &amp; Mills, have enjoyed a revival of investor interest. That interest caught up with Glynwed last week. Partly this reflected the expectation of higher earnings after two hard years of recession. The surveys have been more encouraging. This week the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands reported that for the first time since last May more companies are reporting fattening order books than those reporting a downturn in demand. Capacity utilisation has increased modestly. The recovery in Glynwed's annual profits is symptomatic of a more general phenomenon in the Midlands - the great push for productivity growth during the last two years. Mr Gareth Davies, the Glynwed chairman, attributed the 30 per cent rise in earnings to 'the measures taken to reduce operating costs and adapt operations to lower levels of demand in order to improve competitiveness and manage cash'. The effect of cost-cutting measures on GKN, the automotive components manufacturer with plants around the Midlands, will be seen today. And next week IMI, the diversified engineering group and another of the large Midlands companies, will announce its figures. The recession pushed managements into finding ways to obtain fatter profits from a more slender base. In many cases, they have accepted slow market conditions as the norm and have preferred to treat any enlargement of demand, any chance to raise prices, as a bonus to be exploited rather than a natural change in the commercial order of things. Recent prices in steel billets, for example, have quickly given a new element of profitability to some of Glynwed's steel processing. As steel manufacturers seek to make higher prices stick, the prices of Glynwed steel products are ratcheted upwards. In the earlier part of the recession, solace could be sought in the markets of continental Europe, especially for the motor component manufacturers. Now that is disappearing, the investment fashion has swayed. Europe is out. The UK and the US are in. Transfer Technology is another Midlands group, the shares of which have been favoured and which also announced figures yesterday. Part of its sharp rise in profits came from the exposure to the US for a third of its sales of precision components and manufacturing systems. Glynwed captures the movement as well. Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, suggested: 'With the majority of sales still made in the UK, Glynwed will clearly be a significant beneficiary of any improvement in the domestic economy. 'The relatively small proportion of continental European earnings, which over the last two years have been the group's main weakness, is now likely to be one of its key attractions in the eyes of investors.' This is not the case with either GKN or IMI, the shares of which have not moved up with the same enthusiasm as the engineering second liners. They both have extensive exposure to the German market, and it remains to be seen whether their US interests will be sufficiently strong to offset any downturn in their European markets. After the 1980s recession there was a general move among Midlands engineering groups to expand exports and to cut their vulnerability to the cycles of the UK economy. Glynwed went down this route but not with the same enthusiasm as GKN and IMI. It was then deemed a weakness. Now it is seen as a strength. Another factor has been the room for catching up by the engineers and the metal processors on the stock market. Last year engineering stocks were sluggish, declining relative to the FT-A All-Share Index. This had the effect, this year, as interest rates settled at abnormally low levels, of making the yield on companies like Glynwed look increasingly attractive. Investors responded enabling the engineering sector to out-perform the index.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Quebecor shrugs off recession as profits triple QUEBECOR, the north American publishing, printing and forest products group, tripled first-quarter profit in spite of the long recession and pressure on advertising volumes. Revenues were CDollars 671m (USDollars 527m), up 13 per cent, and net profit was CDollars 15.4m, or 24 cents a share, up from CDollars 5.2m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. All segments improved, but most of the gains came from the fast-expanding commercial printing business, now the second-biggest in north America following the 1992 acquisition of Maxwell Graphics in the US for CDollars 510m. Quebecor Printing, which has since gone public, is seeking acquisitions in the western and south-western US and a beachhead in Europe.</p>

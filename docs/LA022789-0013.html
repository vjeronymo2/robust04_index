			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY  </P> <P> I didn't feel the article "Putting 'X' into Xmas: A More Sensible Approach" was  representative of myself or most of the other Jewish people I know. It is true  the December holidays are difficult but it is possible to walk a tightrope of  emotions between Hanukkah and Christmas.  </P> <P> I appreciate the desire of teachers and merchants to include Jewish children  and consumers in the holiday spirit, and I don't mind my children being able to  make different art projects and sing Hanukkah songs along with their Christian  friends.  </P> <P> Our neighbors are reaching out to us and attempting to include us while  allowing us to celebrate our own beliefs in schools and communities. I feel  this is a very positive approach to coexisting and maintaining our special  heritage.  </P> <P> SHERRI BRASH  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

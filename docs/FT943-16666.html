			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): S&amp;N's journey south may prove expensive - Other Companies This week sees full-year figures from two brewers, one national, one regional. Today's results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle will be scrutinised closely for evidence of early progress from Chef &amp; Brewer, which S&amp;N bought from Grand Metropolitan late last year. The Pounds 703m deal was of strategic importance to S&amp;N, since it greatly increased its pub estate in the south of England and gave it an important new outlet for its beer. On the other hand, GrandMet has the reputation of extracting top prices for businesses it sells. Forecasts are for profits of about Pounds 230m pre-tax against Pounds 201m.</p>

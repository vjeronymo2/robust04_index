			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YEARLONG RECORD CHASE HAS DESORMEAUX WITH ONE VICTORY TO ACHIEVE  </P> <P> Kent Desormeaux's yearlong record chase has endured two days of letdowns and  disappointments.  </P> <P> Since pulling within one winner of Chris McCarron's 15-year-old record of 546  victories in a year on Sunday, Desormeaux has ridden in 12 races without a  visit to the winner's circle.  </P> <P> That has made for 12 hopeful pre-race conversations with 12 trainers and 12  owners.  </P> <P> "They all say: 'I hope it's this one. I'd like to be in the circle when the  record breaks.' Right now they all want to be there when I tie it," Desormeaux  said after coming up empty Tuesday. (Story in Section C.)  </P> <P> "I can see the anticipation and desire to be there to enjoy the feeling of it  all. Today (Tuesday) and all day (Sunday) it's been a letdown to them."  </P> <P> Laurel is dark today and Desormeaux, who has promised to stay in Maryland to  break the record, has been named on horses in six of the track's 10 scheduled  races Thursday.  </P> <P> "It's Christmas season, and my fiancee is off tomorrow, we'll probably do some  Christmas shopping," Desormeaux said Tuesday. "We've got some things to do  about the wedding and to go home for Christmas.  </P> <P> "We'll just probably be out . . . tackling the malls, and just trying to forget  about all this."  </P> <P> Desormeaux will be trying to file away his second day of failing to equal  McCarron's mark. He came away without a winner in five mounts at Laurel  Tuesday.  </P> <P> A day off can only do some good for Desormeaux, who has won once in his last 16  mounts, and has three winners in his last 26 mounts after averaging better than  one winner in every four rides the rest of the year.  </P> <P> With 11 mounts on Sunday, including five favorites, Desormeaux won only once,  giving him 545 victories in 1989.  </P> <P> "We're still a long two away," Desormeaux said. "It's like the last two pounds  of a diet. This is where it really gets tough."  </P> <P> Desormeaux even heard a few boos after his final ride Tuesday.  </P> <P> "They've been really good up until the last race," he said of the boo birds.  "They know there wasn't much stock today."  </P> <P> Or much action for the rider who has been averaging eight or nine mounts a day.  Three of the horses he was named to ride on Tuesday were scratched.  </P> <P> "I was a little upset," he said. "It's not usual for me to only ride five  horses. We always do the best we can with what we have to work with. . . . We  had three scratches. That would have been three extra shots. We're playing to  win. We only played half the time today."  </P></p>

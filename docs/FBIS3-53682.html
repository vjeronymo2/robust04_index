			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Efrayim Davidi] </F>   [Excerpt] Ghassan al-Biyari has again won the elections  for the post of chairman of the Gaza Strip Palestine Trade Union  Federation, established in 1965.    Al-Biyari told DAVAR yesterday he was unanimously elected by  more than the 50 union heads, and will serve in the post for  another term of two years.    Three lists competed in the elections: Fatah, the People's  Party (the former Communist Party), and the Democratic Front.  The results of the elections indicate that control over the  trade unions remain in the hands of Fatah, considering the fact  that al-Biyari is affiliated with this organization. The  radical Muslim groups have absolutely no foothold in Gaza Strip  trade unions. [passage omitted]</p>

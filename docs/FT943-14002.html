			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn hopes dashed Leisure and electronics group Thorn EMI reversed an earlier rise to close 9 lower at 1065p, after the company dashed market speculation of a demerger of a number of its businesses. Volume was 1.8m at the close. The shares had risen sharply in recent sessions fired by speculation that the group planned to split its rental and music businesses. However, the chairman told the company's annual meeting yesterday that the current group structure, 'was a positive advantage and adds significant value'. Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court said the news was 'a slap in the face for the punters' but there was value for fundamental buyers of the stock at these levels. The group also announced an increased stake in Thorn's joint music venture in Japan with Toshiba.</p>

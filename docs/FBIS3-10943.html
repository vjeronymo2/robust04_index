Guido  Nule Amin, energy and mines minister, fears that the decision  will scare away foreign capital.    The State Council's decision to eliminate the possibility of  automatically renewing grant contracts signed with Colombia fell  on the foreign oil companies like a bucket of cold water.    [Begin Shell official Luis Enrique Conde recording] Shell  has  asked the Colombian Government to extend its contract for 10  years beginning in 1994. Considering the points we have  mentioned, Shell expects the government to grant the extension.  [end recording]    Guido Nule Amin, mines and energy minister, believes the  ruling jeopardizes foreign investment in Colombia.    [Begin Nule Amin recording] The disadvantage that the  ministry and the government see in this ruling is that it  weakens the relationship with and the expectations of foreign  investor companies. [end recording]    Five contracts signed between Ecopetrol and the  multinational  corporations Esso, Texpet, Jocol, and Petronor, which extract  crude oil in Lower, Middle, and Upper Magdalena and in the  Catatumbo Basin, will expire this year. Ecopetrol will take  over all installations and oil fields now in the hands of those  companies.</p>

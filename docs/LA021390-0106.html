			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDS REJECT SANTA BARBARA SAVINGS' PLAN  </P> <P> The parent company of Santa Barbara Savings disclosed Monday that federal  regulators rejected its plan to restore its capital level, an action that puts  the firm perilously close to being seized.  </P> <P> The action also makes Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, among the state's 20  largest thrifts, the first S&amp;L in California to publicly disclose that its  capital plan was rejected.  </P> <P> Philip R. Brinkerhoff, chief executive of Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara,  said in an interview that investors or buyers are being sought for the  institution. He said there has been interest by prospective bidders, but he  also acknowledged that investors would have to pump about $93 million into the  thrift to bring it into compliance with the tougher capital standards that  federal regulators put into place for all thrifts two months ago.  </P> <P> Any action against Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara will not effect most  customers because deposits up to $100,000 remain insured by the federal  government.  </P> <P> Officials with the Office of Thrift Supervision, which turned down the thrift's  capital plan, would not comment specifically about their action. They did say  that, barring the infusion of major new sources of capital, they generally will  recommend that the federal Resolution Trust Corp. seize thrifts whose capital  plans are rejected. The RTC is an agency created last year to mop up the thrift  mess.  </P> <P> Capital is the money that thrifts maintain to protect against losses. New  thrift rules, enacted last year in the wake of the nation's S&amp;L debacle,  require higher levels of capital to force owners to put more of their own money  at risk.  </P> <P> Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, like several other thrifts, has been hurt by  losses in its risky, high-yield junk bonds. The company lost $23 million in the  nine months ended Sept. 30. Santa Barbara Savings, which has 44 branches,  operates mostly in Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern counties.  The company is based in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> The firm, already under severe restrictions that include a prohibition against  making new loans, disclosed Monday that it is under even more limits. It must  receive permission from regulators to sell or transfer assets worth more than  $1 million and to enter into a lease for more than $500,000. Also, salaries  have been frozen for employees making more than $50,000 a year.  </P></p>

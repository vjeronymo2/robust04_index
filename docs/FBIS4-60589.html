			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ajay K. Roy, special correspondent of the </F> NATIONAL HERALD]    [Text] The prime minister Mr. Narasimha Rao's week-long  visit to the United States has turned out to be an unqualified  diplomatic success and its impact on the economic front has been  quite encouraging with no compromises made on India's consistent  stand on (?contentious) issues like nuclear nonproliferation and  human rights. The main objective of the visit was not to break  new ground with regard to differences between the two countries  on some issues, but to establish a relationship between Mr. Rao  and President Bill Clinton, and that has been achieved in full  measure. The two leaders after their summit meeting have struck  a personal rapport and it would be now easier and more natural  for them working together.    As senior officials from both sides said in Washington, they  listened to each other to understand the differences in  perspective. They established a basis to communicate on a number  of issues which are now ongoing agenda. This one-to-one bond  has alleviated the Indo-U.S. relations to an appropriate level  of maturity which can withstand differences of perception of  national interests. A good measure of such maturity was in  evidence when president Bill Clinton, responding to a query at  the joint press conference, candidly said I would not say  differences between ourselves narrowed down, but I think they  should be seen in the context of whole relationship. Equally  mature is the attitude of the Prime Minister Mr. Rao toward  bilateral relations. He told newsmen in Washington, as mature  democracies we might differ on this or that issue, but such  differences are subsumed in the overall understanding that  characterizes our relationship.    Calling for new partnership in the joint communique of the  summit, the two leaders decided to expand the scope and pace of  high-level exchanges at the full range of political, commercial,  technological, and social issues. Mr. Rao has started this by  inviting President Clinton himself, which Mr. Clinton has  accepted in principle. Visits at the level of vice presidents  have also been planned. The first lady Mrs. Hillary Clinton is  also likely to visit India. President Clinton himself has  announced that the Commerce Secretary, Mr. Ronald Brown, will  lead a presidential trade and investment mission to India in  November and the Energy Secretary, Mrs. O'Leary, will visit in  July this year.    A significant gain from the summit meeting is the signing of  six Memorandums of Understanding [MOU] between the two  countries. The first decision is to revive the Indo-U.S. Joint  Commission set up in 1974. To begin with, its subcommission on  economic and commercial issues would meet before the end of the  year. Secondly, it was decided to establish regular official  consultations at various levels alternatively in India and the  U.S. This is the pattern followed by India with Germany, Japan,  Britain, France, and some others. The third and most  significant of the decisions was to review and update the 1984  MOU on the transfer of high technology from the U.S. Since  1987, when the U.S. started imposing sanctions against the  Indian Space Research Organization, the MOU has been virtually  defunct. Fourth, it was agreed to enhance defense cooperation  at the civilian and service-to-service level. The U.S. defense  secretary, Mr. William Perry, and the new U.S.  commander-in-chief of the Pacific region would visit India some  time this year. Fifth, it was decided to examine the possibility  of setting up an eminent persons group of nonofficials to  provide intellectual stimulus to bilateral ties. Lastly, a  business partnership initiative would be set up, particularly on  the subject of infrastructure development in India.    The high point of Mr. Rao's visit was his brilliant address  to the joint session of the U.S. Congress wherein he displayed  exemplary reasoning and fortitude in establishing the Indian  viewpoint. In pursuing economic agenda during his visit, Mr.  Rao had succeeded far beyond anything that had been anticipated.  The captains of the U.S. multinationals during their  interactions with Mr. Rao in New York, Houston, and Washington  showed positive interest in specific areas. Above all, the two  countries agreed on the goal of nuclear nonproliferation which  has been hanging fire for quite some time now. Thus, now India  and the U.S. have reached a stage where they could enter into  constructive dialogue.</p>

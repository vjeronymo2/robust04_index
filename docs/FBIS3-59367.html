Authoritative analysts believe that this winter and next  spring, grain and oil prices will tend to rise.    We can expect wheat prices to rebound. Presently wheat  prices  in localities throughout the nation are essentially in a slump.  The price of some three white wheats on the Zhengzhou market is  0.76 yuan per kilogram, 0.02 yuan lower than corn. The price of  wheat on the Jinnan market is about 0.72 yuan, and adjusted  sales are not smooth and the market is not active. Several other  grain producing regions are wavering at only about 0.64 yuan.  The wheat price situation of such areas as Hubei, Jiangsu, and  Shanghai is a little better, floating around 0.80 yuan. The  China Grain Trading Company forecasts that in the short-term  wheat prices still could waver in a low valley, but by this  winter or next spring or at a little later point, wheat prices  could rebound to about 0.90 yuan.    Corn prices continue to rebound. The corn market has  maintained a two year high temperature without retreating and  has not suffered an impact from new corn. The price, after a  slight decline, will continue to rebound. In some regions the  price approaches or exceeds the price of wheat. In East China,  Hubei and Hunan, South China, and the Central Plain, the price  of corn has remained at about 0.80. In such places as Chongqing,  Nanning, Chengdu, and Kunming in the southwest, it has broken  the 1 yuan barrier, and the Kunming Market has reached as high  as 1.17 yuan. There are three reasons that corn receipts are  huge and quotations are not declining: The first is that corn is  full of nutrients and resistant to disease. The second is that  the scope of its use is widespread and its uses are constantly  expanding. The third is that feed requirements are increasing  and international quotations look good.    Sales of other grains are active and prices will remain high  and stable. With increases in agricultural and agricultural  byproduct purchasing prices, the sales prices of small grains on  various markets will stabilize at a rather high level. Based on  information from more than thirty markets, including Beijing,  Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, this July the price rise for  red beans over the same period last year was the highest,  reaching 225 percent, rising from 2.40 yuan to 7.80 yuan. The  rise for mung beans also reached 122 percent, rising from 4.50  yuan to 10.00 yuan. The small grain market continues to be  active, and although new grain coming to the market will have an  impact, the effect will not be great. The price of mung beans on  the southern and western markets is still 4.00 yuan or more. The  Shanghai market has reached as high as 4.60 yuan. In some  regions of north China and the northwest, it remains at 3.20  yuan and above. Because of the rapid development of the  livestock and the feed industries and the soaring development of  the vegetable oil processing industry, soybeans are always in  very tight demand, and although prices float down, they still  stay high and do not decline. This year the area in the country  planted in soybeans was greatly increased. So, after the new  grain comes on the market, the price could stabilize at a high  level.    There is a ready market for oil products and price rises are  obvious. Because the area planted in rape, peanuts, and cotton  was greatly reduced, peanut oil reserves have declined 30  percent to 40 percent from the same period last year. In  addition, customers from various localities are pouring into  Xinjiang and the price of productive land has reached about 4.50  yuan, causing oil product markets throughout the nation  beginning this year to constantly rise. Jinnan wei  [5898] oil has now reached 5.50 yuan or more and in Hebei peanut  oil has reached as high as 5.90 yuan and rapeseed oil,  wei oil, and soybean oil have all broken the 5 yuan  barrier. Henan's price for peanut oil within the province has  reached 5.70 yuan and the price outside the province has reached  as high as 6 yuan. And palm oil is 5.30 yuan or more. Rapeseed  oil is 4.80 yuan or more in both Shanghai and Jiangsu. On  Hebei's Laohekou Market, the prices of scarce rapeseed oil and  soybean oil have risen to 5.40 yuan and 5.60 yuan, respectively.    On the basis of the current domestic grain and oil market  situation, all business units should pay close attention to  market information in formulating business tactics.</p>

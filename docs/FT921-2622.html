			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Ten killed by bomb at Israeli embassy: Pledge to punish those responsible for attack in Buenos Aires ISRAEL vowed last night to punish those to blame for a bomb blast that ripped through the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 10 people and injuring more than 100. The bomb virtually demolished the three-storey building and rescue workers were still digging through rubble seven hours later to free victims. Argentine president Carlos Menem said it appeared explosives were planted inside the embassy, the attackers taking advantage of building and decorating work under way there. Earlier an embassy official said the bomb was in a car parked outside. Mr Menem blamed the attack on an international terrorist group helped by Argentine terrorists, although he said there was no prime suspect. He denounced the blast as a 'vestige of Nazism' in Argentina, which has 300,000 Jews - the biggest Jewish community in Latin America. Mr David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, said in Jerusalem: 'Israel will know the way, or ways, to punish those responsible with all severity.' He said the perpetrators of the blast were still unknown, but he went on to accuse a 'Tehran-Damascus axis' of supporting recent attacks on Israelis. He denounced the Iran-Syria link as an 'axis of blood'. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, said the bombing was part of a war of terror against Israel, but claimed his government would continue to work for a peace settlement with its Arab neighbours. Forty people were in the embassy at the time of the explosion. Four of those known to have died in the building - described by its officials as 'like a fortress' - were said by the Israeli foreign ministry to be Argentine electric company employees. The blast damaged buildings hundreds of yards away and Mr Menem estimated 20-40 kg of explosives blew up. Traffic came to a virtual standstill in the city centre as ambulances ferried the injured to hospital. A witness said: 'All over the place there were people injured from shattered glass - women, children, pregnant women, old people. I could never imagine a scene like this.' Many of the injured were in a church shelter for the elderly across the street. A teacher at a nearby school said: 'I felt the ground moving under my feet. Several children were taken to hospital.'</p>

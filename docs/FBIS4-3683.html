			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng arrived here this evening for an official visit to  Kyrgyzstan, the third stop of a five-Asian-nation tour.    Li Peng, the first top Chinese leader to visit this country,  was greeted at the airport by President A. Akayev and Prime  Minister Apas Dzhumagulov, along with other senior Kyrgyzstan  officials.    In the coming days, Li is expected to hold talks with  leaders  of Kyrgyzstan on bilateral, regional and international issues.    In a written statement, the Chinese premier called China and  Kyrgyzstan friendly neighbors, who share more than 1,000  kilometers of common border and whose contact dates back 2,000  years to when the "Silk-Road" linked China with countries in  central and west Asia.    Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China-Kyrgyzstan  relations have enjoyed good development, Li said, adding that  president Akayev's visit to China in 1992 served to propel the  expansion of friendly cooperation for mutual benefit.    Li expressed the conviction that his visit will further  enhance mutual understanding, deepen friendship and expand  cooperation between the two countries.    Before arriving in Kyrgyzstan, the Chinese premier visited  Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The two-week-long tour will also  take him to Kazakhstan and Mongolia.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Investment to rise in E Europe bourses Foreign capital flows into booming east European stock markets look set to rise further following the launch of a Dollars 200m (Pounds 133.3m) investment fund for buying shares in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. The fund is being announced today by CS First Boston, the London-based investment bank, and Cazenove, the London stockbroker. It will be the largest so far for institutional and private investment in listed companies in central and eastern Europe. Several analysts yesterday voiced concern that eastern European shares may be overpriced. The Warsaw, Prague and Budapest stock exchanges rose 800 per cent, 96 per cent and 28 per cent respectively in dollar terms last year. Following a further 58 per cent increase in the Budapest stock market index in January, an executive at a Budapest investment bank said yesterday: 'The market is already overblown and we are already very concerned about it.' Creditanstalt, a leading Austrian bank, recently warned that Czech share prices had been driven excessively high by speculative foreign buying. However, Mr Charles Harman, a CS First Boston managing director, said he was 'optimistic' about subscriptions to the fund. He expects particular demand from international institutional investors seeking new methods of increasing their exposure to emerging stock markets. The fund amounts to about 1 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the Prague, Warsaw and Budapest stock exchanges, respectively Dollars 14bn, Dollars 3bn and Dollars 1bn at the end of last year. A total of Dollars 150m is expected to be raised through marketing the fund to international institutional investors from next week, with the balance of Dollars 50m coming from private investors. Shares in the fund and accompanying warrants are expected to be listed on the London stock exchange from mid-March. CS First Boston has been one of the most active investment banks in central and eastern Europe. It has managed the sale of the Hungarian airline Malev. In spite of high foreign interest in central European stock markets, there are few UK investment trusts focused on the region. The Baring Emerging Europe trust, which raised Dollars 124m at the end of last year, splits its investments between Mediterranean countries and eastern Europe.</p>

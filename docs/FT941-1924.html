			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Try in the red and calls for Pounds 5.6m Try Group yesterday became the latest company to announce a rights issue to finance land purchases and take advantage of the housing market recovery. The company is seeking to raise Pounds 5.6m via a 3-for-5 share issue at 23p apiece. Try, at the same time, announced a Pounds 2.17m pre-tax loss for the year to end-December after property and rationalisation provisions of Pounds 1.74m. This compares with a restated loss of Pounds 810,000 for 1992. The scale of the losses and provisions had been signalled by the company earlier this year, and the shares fell 3p to 30p. Because it has taken Pounds 6.7m of accumulated losses from the housing division onto the group balance sheet, the company has insufficient distributable reserves to pay a final dividend leaving the total pay-out for the year at 0.5p (1p). In order to resume dividend payments Try is seeking shareholder and court approval to reduce its share premium account by the appropriate amount. Mr Peter Howell, chief executive, said it was the company's intention to pay a total net dividend of 1p for 1994. Losses per share were 5.12p (4.23p). Group turnover rose to Pounds 124m (Pounds 118m). The contracting division made an operating profit of Pounds 1.24m on sales of Pounds 116m. Two thirds of a record Pounds 126m order book was negotiated work which tended to command higher margins than work won on competitive tender, said Mr Howell. Housebuilding incurred an Pounds 890,000 loss, mainly because of the timing of developments on more expensive land bought by the group during the late 1980s. The number of homes sold also fell, from 201 to 152. The rights issue has been underwritten by Lazards. COMMENT Try's decision to expand housebuilding, closing operations in East Anglia and Scotland and concentrating in south-east England, looks a little belated compared with others in the sector. It is a good contractor achieving better than average profit margins throughout the recession. Its record in residential and commercial property is less impressive. The rights price, however, is at a sufficient discount to make this a worthwhile investment if the new housebuilding team performs, but it is a risk. At an ex-rights price of 29p the company is on a prospective p/e of almost 20 on pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m in 1994 and a p/e of 11 on Pounds 2m in 1995.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- The Ministry of Justice has  urged organizations and bodies connected with international law  and the defense of human rights and freedoms to work toward  lifting the unjust embargo against Iraq.    In cables to these organizations, the Ministry of Justice  said Iraq has fulfilled its obligations under Section C of  Security Council Resolution 687. The Security Council should  therefore implement Paragraph 22 of this resolution and lift the  embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. The ministry noted that  the continuation of the embargo is a blatant violation of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions.</p>

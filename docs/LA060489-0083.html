			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> BOMB KILLS 6 PERU SOLDIERS  </P> <P> Leftist guerrillas bombed a bus carrying Peruvian government palace guards  through downtown Lima, killing at least six soldiers and a police officer and  wounding 24 other people. A car blocked the bus while it was en route to the  palace, and two people maneuvered a pushcart loaded with explosives under the  back of the vehicle and then detonated them, police said. The guards opened  fire, but the suspects escaped. The government of President Alan Garcia, who  lives at the palace, is fighting two leftist guerrilla organizations, the  Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement.  </P></p>

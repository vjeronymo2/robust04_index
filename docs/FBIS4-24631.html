			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By MING PAO special reporter Liang Kuo-jen (2733 0948 </F> 0088): "Beijing Orders Nipping Unrest in the Bud; Senior Cadres'  Children in the United States Told Not To Return Home for Time  Being"]    [Text] The atmosphere in Beijing remains tense two days  ahead of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident. In a  document distributed throughout the country a few days ago, the  top CPC level said that all kinds of measures will be adopted to  maintain the stability of the situation and "to nip unrest in  the bud." Armed police and anti-riot forces nationwide, as well  as mechanized troops in the military regions, have been on level  one alert since the middle of May.    According to a source in Beijing, although there is nothing  out of the ordinary among Beijing residents, many insiders are  worried about the externally relaxed but internally tense  atmosphere. A reliable source disclosed that a number of  children of senior CPC officials studying in the United States  had originally planned to return to Beijing by the end of May  and early June to meet relatives or do business. However, they  recently received calls from home urging them to postpone their  trips.    As Chinese-American Larry Wu has entered the mainland on  numerous occasions with false identity papers, shooting  documentaries which slandered the authorities, it is said that  the Ministry of Public Security, Immigration Management Bureau,  Armed Police Headquarters, and Ministry of State Security  jointly sent a message a few days ago to all border posts urging  them to keep a close watch over foreigners, Chinese students  returning from abroad, and, in particular, foreigners of Chinese  origin on the eve of 4 June.    In a document for internal circulation distributed  throughout  the country, the source disclosed that the top CPC level had  stressed that stability is the overriding task at present.  Party committees and governments at all levels must try by  every means to adopt all sorts of measures to maintain social  stability. It is a Chinese tradition to mark 5th and 10th  anniversaries of events, the document pointed out. As the fifth  anniversary of the 1989 Beijing political disturbance (referring  to the 4 June incident) falls this year, hostile forces at home  and abroad have threatened to launch a series of sabotage  activities. Therefore, all localities should take precautions  on the eve of 4 June and "nip all sorts of unrest in the bud."  The document said that the central authorities are ready for  any eventuality and have taken precautions. It is said that  public security, armed police, and special anti-riot forces  nationwide, even mechanized troops in the military regions, have  been on level one alert since the middle of May.    The general office of the CPC Central Committee and State  Council notified departments at all levels a few days ago,  asking central, provincial, and ministerial leaders who are on  inspection tours to return to their posts before early June,  personally be on duty, and to be prepared at all times for any  contingency.    The externally relaxed but internally tense precautions  adopted by the authorities have exerted great pressure on  government officials and intellectuals. Outspoken intellectuals  and dissidents in Beijing have been very careful while receiving  telephone interviews from abroad. They almost spoke in unison:  "I dare not say that. It is not convenient to say that." A  pro-democracy activist living in the home of a friend explained:  "They are afraid of getting other people involved." Another  writer, who ended his life in exile and returned home not long  ago, cried out in alarm: "How can they make phone calls at such  a moment!"</p>

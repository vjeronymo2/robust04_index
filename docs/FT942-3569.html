			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Government welcomes reform plan for universities A package of radical reforms put forward yesterday by university managers to ensure that quality does not suffer in the wake of university expansion was welcomed by the government. Mr Tim Boswell, higher education minister, said he would take 'very seriously' the proposals for students to be given vouchers to pay for education wherever they wished and for universities to be paid according to units of education they provided to students. Other recommendations on the agenda are a new vocational 'associate degree', which could be a stepping stone to a full honours degree, and a national system of academic credits. This would be transferable from one university to another, and backed by a uniform national credit 'transcript', in which standardised details of students' performance would be entered regularly. The reforms have been proposed by the Higher Education Quality Council, a group set up by university vice-chancellors with government backing. It said they were essential if the UK higher education system was to adapt to modern needs. Over the past five years, the proportion of 18-year-olds going to university has doubled, while the number of mature students has also increased. Without reform, the system could not accommodate students taking career breaks or combining a career with their degree, the council said. Professor Peter Toyne, vice-chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University and chairman of the council's credit and access group, said: 'We are at an important point in history where we are struggling to keep a system afloat which is based on past assumptions. If it's going to go further forward, reform has got to be radical.' Mr Boswell said the plan for transferable academic credits was in line with the government's higher education charter. He promised that both the government and the higher education funding councils would take the funding proposals 'very seriously'. He also ordered a report from the Higher Education Quality Council into growing unease that franchising arrangements used by universities to allow foreign colleges to award their degrees might have diluted standards. Mr Boswell said: 'There must be no reduction in standards.' The council will consult universities and employers on the report until September 30 this year, with a further report due by the end of the year.

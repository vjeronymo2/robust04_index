			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Indian quake toll may top 28,000 THE death toll from Thursday morning's earthquake in Maharashtra state rose yesterday, as Indian rescue teams extricated more bodies from the debris. Rescue had been disrupted when power and telecommunications collapsed on Thursday. These were restored early yesterday. State television reported the death toll as 21,000 but officials said it could total 28,000 once the rescue operations had reached the entire area. Survivors - especially in the Killari and Latur regions, where entire villages were flattened - performed mass burials of the dead with whatever firewood they could find. Thousands of villagers, many of them suddenly left without family or belongings, joined in the relief operations, disposing of bodies of men, women and children, some of them huddled together. A downpour in the region hampered the work. Mr S B Chavan, home minister, who surveyed the area yesterday, said immediate problems faced by the administration included the need to bury the dead, and the lack of clean drinking water. He said a special team would tackle these issues. The cabinet, which held an emergency meeting in New Delhi yesterday, told the agriculture ministry to make available tractors, agricultural implements and seeds to enable farmers to salvage crops in the sugar-cane and cotton Marathwada region of Maharashtra, which has been affected by the quake, but not devastated as the Osmanabad and Latur regions have been. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who said on Thursday that he did not want VIP movements to disrupt relief operations, will visit Killari and Latur today to review relief operations. The government was criticised by the opposition Bharatiya Janata party, whose leader, Mr Lal Krishna Advani, abandoned campaign preparations for the state assembly elections in November to rush to the area on Thursday. Mr Advani said the government had failed to take action in villages in the Killari area, despite representations from village heads pointing out that the region had experienced 1,500 tremors in the past year.</p>

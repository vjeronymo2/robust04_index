			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: EL DEBARGE "GEMINI." MOTOWN ***: POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF  FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * AIN'T  THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> "If we pray together, maybe we can stay together," El DeBarge earnestly sings  on one track in a manner that recalls Marvin Gaye's classic "What's Going On."  The Gaye influence has always been obvious in this singer-songwriter's music,  and "Gemini" sounds like Gaye-meets-Guy, especially on the aggressively sexy  "Real Love" and the even more blatantly amorous "Make You Mine." Where there  once was an element of boyish sweetness to DeBarge's delivery, there's some  very adult-sounding regret and resolution to his voice on such tracks as "Turn  the Page" and "Broken Dreams." The religious references on the latter cut may  be there in order to defuse -- or excuse -- the raw sexuality that appears  elsewhere on the album. But, of course, it's precisely that type of  contradiction that always made Gaye such a complex and interesting artist.  Connie Johnson  </P></p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Mayflower to take over car designer MAYFLOWER, the specialist UK automotive engineering group, is to take over the business and assets of IAD (UK), one of Europe's leading automotive design and engineering consultancies, which collapsed into administrative receivership less than two weeks ago. The deal will increase Mayflower's annual turnover by 60 per cent to about Pounds 110m. It will create a significant force among the world's automotive design and engineering groups capable of rivalling the long-established Italian automotive design houses such as Pininfarina, Italdesign and Bertone, and Germany's Karmann. Mayflower already owns Motor Panels, the Coventry-based automotive engineering group, which operates in fields from vehicle engineering design and development to tooling and manufacturing. Mayflower is to pay Pounds 3.25m in cash to acquire IAD from the receiver and the shares of IAD's overseas trading subsidiaries, which did not go into receivership. Mr John Simpson, Mayflower chief executive, said the combination of IAD and Motor Panels would provide 'a world-class capability in automotive design and engineering'. Mayflower is already expanding rapidly and is in the midst of its second rights issue in less than two years. It is raising Pounds 34.6m through a one-for-one rights issue to finance its existing expansion in the UK and the US. This includes a project to supply the bodies for a new MG sports car being developed by Rover, the UK carmaker. Mayflower bought Motor Panels for Pounds 14.75m out of the receivership of the parent company, CH Industrials. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.7m last year on a turnover of Pounds 67.8m and has a worldwide workforce of nearly 1,000. IAD made a loss of Pounds 105,000 on a turnover of Pounds 62m for the year to the end of April 1991. Mr Godfrey Harker, IAD group finance director, said IAD was expected to make a loss of Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m on a turnover of Pounds 51m to Pounds 52m in the year to the end of this month. IAD turnover has fallen sharply since mid-1992. The company, previously owned 77.5 per cent by Mr John Shute, chairman and managing director, and family interests, and 22.5 per cent by Cinven, the venture capital investor, has been under growing financial strain for the last two years. Mr Simpson said that Mr Shute would remain as chairman of IAD responsible for strategy, sales and marketing. Mr John Fleming, Mayflower operations review director, would become IAD chief executive with immediate effect.</p>

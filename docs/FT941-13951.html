			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Cyclical stocks push Dow over 3,900 Wall Street Cyclical issues powered the bellwether US stock index over the 3,900 mark for the first time yesterday, but the broader market sagged under the weight of profit-taking and higher bond yields, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 22.52 ahead at 3,914.48, but the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ebbed 0.25 to 474.73. The secondary indices were mixed, with the American SE composite slipping 0.07 to 484.74 and the Nasdaq composite climbing 1.25 to an all-time high of 794.28. Activity on the NYSE was heavy, with about 345m shares exchanged. Volume was lifted by late trading related to the 'double witching' expiration of options on individual issues and some stock indices. Political uncertainty in Japan had little direct impact but an unfavourable reaction in the bond market brought a restrained tone to early activity. Late in the session, the yield of the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond had edged up to 6.278 per cent amid concern that the failure of a reform package to win parliamentary approval would cause Japanese investors to unload securities. On a day when no fresh economic data was scheduled for release, the quarterly earnings of a few pivotal companies were in sharp focus. Most notably, Caterpillar gave a big boost to the Dow when investors reacted enthusiastically to its performance in the final reporting period. The stock was marked up Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 98 5/8 , a new 52-week high, after the heavy equipment maker announced net operating income of Dollars 1.46 a share, against small loss a year earlier. Other stocks whose performances are closely tied to macroeconomic trends gave a lift to the blue-chip barometer, which topped 3,800 just two weeks ago. Boeing climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 , improving on its previous zenith, while Bethlehem Steel hit a new peak of Dollars 23 5/8 , up Dollars 1 1/8 . 3M climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 112 3/8 and DuPont Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54 7/8 . Some large-capitalisation computer stocks somewhat offset the cyclicals' unflagging strength. Computer Associates shed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 38 in a further reaction to the company's moderating growth in the last three months of 1993. By contrast, new technology issues on the Nasdaq continued to rebound from losses early in the week. Apple, up Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 33 3/8 , set the tone after several Wall Street analysts upgraded the stock. At the close of the previous session, the company posted a 75 per cent plunge in net income. Canada Toronto stock prices closed sharply lower in busy trading, as plunging gold and mining stocks helped fuel the retreat. The TSE-300 composite index tumbled 40.44 points to close at 4,501.94. The decline points to a market correction following the late-1993 rally that carried strongly into 1994.</p>

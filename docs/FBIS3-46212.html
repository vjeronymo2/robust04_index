At the meeting and during lunch, Mayor Huang Ju talked a lot  about Shanghai's tremendous changes in the last two years and  its situation of economic development in 1993. He said: In  1993, Shanghai met the requirements Deng Xiaoping set forth at  the beginning of the year. Shanghai has been advancing steadily  by braving winds and waves and overcoming difficulties, and has  moved onto a higher development stage.    Huang Ju said: An advantage Shanghai enjoys is that its  leaders can directly talk by telephone with the central leaders  of the older generation and the incumbent central leaders of the  third generation, so Shanghai is well-informed. Anyhow,  Shanghai's development should still mainly rely on its own  efforts, the efforts of the Shanghai people.    He said: A major change in Shanghai last year found  expression in the establishment of large markets. Now, there  are 11 state- level large markets in Shanghai, and the total  yearly business turnover reached 1 trillion yuan. A loan market  covering the whole Chang Jiang valley and the Chang Jiang delta  area has taken form. While China's financial management center  is located in Beijing, the transaction center is located in  Shanghai.    Huang Ju said: Last year, the amount of foreign funds used  by Shanghai doubled that in the previous year, reaching $7  billion. The rate of fund use [zi jin jin du dai wei lu 6327  6855 6651 1653 0451 0143 3764] reached 99.5 percent. Twenty-six  of the 100 largest transnational enterprises in the world have  opened offices in Shanghai. They mainly come from Europe and  America. In terms of the fund sources, Hong Kong and Macao rank  first among other places. Therefore, we attach great importance  to Hong Kong. Hong Kong and Shanghai have their respective  advantages, so they should complement each other and seek common  prosperity. China has only one Hong Kong, and that is not  enough. Hong Kong has a very good foundation. It is believed  that it will better play a role as a window in the 1990's.    Huang Ju said: The year 1994 is a decisive year for meeting  Deng Xiaoping's requirement of "making changes every year, and  making substantial changes every three years," and for  maintaining the momentum of healthy economic growth. This year,  the target is to increase GNP by 12 percent, and we shall strive  to achieve the growth rate of 15 percent, thus laying a solid  foundation for Shanghai's economic development and comprehensive  strength. Huang Ju said: "We are facing a good opportunity and  also enjoy favorable natural, geographical, and social  conditions, so it is absolutely possible for Shanghai to  maintain the favorable momentum of economic growth in the new  year."    Attending the meeting and luncheon also were Chen Zhili,  deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; Jin  Binghua, member of the Standing Committee of the municipal party  committee and director of the Municipal Propaganda Department;  Cai Laixing, deptuy secretary general of the Shanghai Municipal  People's Government;, and Jia Shumu, deputy director of the  Municipal Propaganda Department and director of the Municipal  Information Office.    The WEN WEI PO delegation, composed of Director Wang Guohua,  Editor-in-Chief Zeng Decheng, and General Manager Feng  Zhongliang, left Shanghai for Hangzhou this afternoon. During  their visit to Shanghai, they arranged an interview of Wu  Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and  secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, and visited  Shanghai's subway, bridge, and Bund reconstruction projects.</p>

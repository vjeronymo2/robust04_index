			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Motoring: Saab increases the cylinder count - Stuart Marshall tests a new range of executive models designed to satisfy the engine snobs In the business car pecking order, Saab has always occupied a niche somewhere above Ford and Vauxhall (Opel to mainland Europeans) but just below BMW and Mercedes. Saab's niche-fellows have been sporty, individual cars such as Alfa Romeo and Lancia. So, why has a significant minority of business users in Britain, with freedom to choose any car, gone for Saabs? Perhaps because they are so enjoyable to drive that you feel the company's managers must be enthusiastic motorists, not corporate bean-counters obsessed with cutting costs and raising margins. Second, Saabs are produced by an offshoot of Sweden's only aircraft-maker. Knowing this evokes the right responses on technical merit, safety, durability and environmental acceptability. And, third, Saab's badge has never been put at a disadvantage by being seen on small, cheap cars such as Fiestas and Corsas. As a low volume car-maker - under 100,000 a year - Saab could never afford the luxury of a range of engines. For two decades, it had just one; a four-cylinder conceived in the early 1970s by Triumph at Coventry, in the English midlands. Over the years, it has been modified extensively and turbo-charged, fitted with highly sophisticated ignition systems and, ultimately, enlarged to a 2.3-litre with twin balancing shafts. Driving a turbo-charged and inter-cooled Saab 900 or 9000 has always been one of motoring's better experiences. The cars exude integrity; their engines are flexible at low speeds, exceedingly vigorous when needed, and run smoothly at all times. But they have only four cylinders. Many status-conscious business drivers dream of at least eight cylinders, although most have to settle for six. Now, they will no longer need to reject a Saab 9000 because it has too few cylinders. Two flagship models will be in the showrooms next month powered by a three-litre V6. (I have not forgotten the 900 V6, which has been around for some months. What I am talking about are big cars for senior managers.) Heart of the latest, range-topping Saab 9000 Griffin saloon, and the slightly less elaborate 9000CSE V6 five-door, is a General Motors engine. This 215 horsepower unit is also used in the Vauxhall (Opel) Omega, just as the Saab 900's 2.5-litre, 170hp V6 is shared with both Omega and up-market versions of Vauxhall (Opel) models such as the Cavalier (Vectra) and Calibra. GM rode to Saab's financial rescue three years ago but is keeping the Saab marque quite separate from its mass sellers. Smaller capacity, four-cylinder 9000s continue to be available. Most potent of them all is still the turbo-charged and inter-cooled 2.3-litre, 230hp Aero, which more than matches the V6's pulling power (torque) and, on paper, offers slightly better fuel economy. Yet, when I drove them in northern France last week, I thought the V6 9000s, if a mite less fiery, had all the performance for which any business motorist could reasonably ask. Their ride is excellent, their handling nimble and reassuringly secure. Automatic transmission is standard. At Pounds 31,995 list, the 9000 Griffin - and, to a lesser extent, the Pounds 29,995 9000CSE V6 - will face fierce competition, including the Vauxhall Omega Elite (Pounds 27,385). This has the same power train and similarly lavish equipment. Saab, however, is banking on charisma and exclusiveness to persuade buyers to get behind the wheel of a Griffin rather than the poshest Omega or Ford Scorpio.</p>

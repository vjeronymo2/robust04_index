			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A new millennium - and not a traffic cone to be seen Sir, With regard to celebrating the millennium ('Wanted - wonder of the age', October 1), I think the government should pledge to remove every single traffic cone from every road in the kingdom by 4.30pm on December 31 1999. In order to placate all those who believe that celebrations should only take place in December 2000, I suggest that, during the intervening year, all the cones gathered should be given to a number of sculptors, who can each create a fitting memorial to the 'last' century. These sculptures should be placed at various points around the country, to be seen from our motorways, rather as Stonehenge is viewed from the A303. This pledge, incidentally, should be put on the statute books so that any other incoming government must abide by it too. Thus, future generations will gain from finished roads, no more road works, and the disbanding (and financial saving) of the cones hotline. A Lister, 54a The Avenue, Hatch End, Middx HA5 4HA</p>

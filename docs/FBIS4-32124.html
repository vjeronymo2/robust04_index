			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(vrs)": "The Damage Caused by the Soviet Army </F> Will Cost Quite a Lot"]    [Text] Prague--The state will provide more than 140 million  korunas [Kc] this year to clear up the damage caused by the  former Soviet Army. This works out at Kc14 for each citizen.    First and foremost, it is essential to clean up the  underground waters and the parcels of land contaminated by fuel  and to dispose of the unexploded munitions the Soviets left  behind. "The source of the damage, which is deemed to be  Russia, has not spent anything on rectification, and it is not  envisaged that anything will be spent," said Jaroslav Ruzicka,  an Environment Ministry expert.    Clearing up the damage left behind by the former Soviet Army  has already cost almost Kc400 million in the years 1991-93; this  is roughly one-fifth of what, according to estimates, will have  to be spent as a whole.    Ruzicka said that a lot of unnecessary damage was done to  the  environment because the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from the  Republic was very sudden. "In Germany, the Russians' withdrawal  has been staggered over a period of several years, and so it is  under greater control," he said. Ruzicka commented, however,  that the damage caused by the Czech Army is, to say the least,  the same.</p>

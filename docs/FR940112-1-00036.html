The California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted these revisions to EPA on April 6, 1993, and June 19, 1992, respectively. The revisions concern SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. SMAQMD's Rule 454 controls volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from metal parts cleaning procedures, while SBCAPCD's Rule 331 controls VOC emissions from equipment leaks at sources such as petroleum refineries. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> : Comments must be received on or before February 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A.

Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Sacramento Metro Area is classified as serious and Santa Barbara County is classified as moderate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; therefore, these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The Sacramento Metro Area and Santa Barbara County retained their designations of nonattainment and were classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 22, 1991, EPA, Region 9, notified the State of California that EPA had not received by the May 15, 1991 deadline all required VOC rule corrections under section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA. The finding letter identified six districts in California, including SMAQMD and SBCAPCD, that had failed to submit required rule corrections. The official finding notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 22, 1991 (56 FR 54554). SMAQMD's Rule 454 and SBCAPCD's Rule 331 were listed in that finding notice. As a result, both SMAQMD and SBCAPCD had 18 months to submit the rules to EPA before a sanction under section 179(a) of the Act would be imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on April 6, 1993 and June 19, 1992, including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. SMAQMD's submitted Rule 454 and SBCAPCD's Rule 331 were found to be complete on April 28, 1993 and August 27, 1992, respectively, pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and both rules are being proposed for approval into the SIP. The State's complete submittal of SMAQMD's Rule 454 and SBCAPCD's Rule 331 satisfies the deficiency for which the finding of nonsubmittal, dated October 22, 1991, was made and stopped the sanction clock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SMAQMD's Rule 454 controls VOC emissions from equipment used to clean (degrease) metal parts, while SBCAPCD's Rule 331 controls leaks of VOCs from equipment used in petroleum refining and associated operations. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA's interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The CTG applicable to SMAQMD's Rule 454 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Solvent Metal Cleaning,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;022. The CTG applicable to SBCAPCD's Rule 331 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from Petroleum Refinery Equipment,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;036. Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SMAQMD's submitted Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The definition section has been expanded by 13 terms, which helps to clarify the rule and makes it easier to enforce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The applicability of the rule to solvents is now based on the initial boiling point rather than on solvent vapor pressure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Control Officer discretion for the use of unspecified control equipment has been deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The overall (capture and control) efficiency of control equipment has been set at not less than 85%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Records for solvent usage amounts and for maintenance are now required, making the rule more enforceable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Test methods for determining compliance, not identified in the existing SIP rule, are now specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBCAPCD's submitted Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The definition section has been expanded by 28 terms, which helps to clarify the rule and makes it easier to enforce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The rule now requires replacement of components that require five or more repairs in one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The rule now specifies that major leaks (as defined in the rule) be fixed within 5 calendar days, minor leaks within 15 days, and liquid leaks within 24 hours. Also, the leaking component must be tightened (minimized) within one hour of discovery of the leak. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Recordkeeping requirements have been expanded to include not only tags on equipment, but diagrams of component location, inspection logs, and maintenance records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The rule has been significantly strengthened by the identification of test methods to use to determine compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. Therefore, SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance, are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.

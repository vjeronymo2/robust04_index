			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Ports sold off short, say MPs The government was criticised by an all-party committee of MPs yesterday for allowing the resale of a leading UK port to deprive a large part of its workforce of the full value of their shareholding. The port of Medway was acquired by its management and workforce in 1992 for Pounds 29.7m and sold 18 months later to Mersey Docks for Pounds 103m. The trust ports of Tees and Hartlepool, Clyde, Forth, Medway and the Port of London were sold for Pounds 380m of which Pounds 169m went in the form of a levy to the government. In the period up to the second sale the Medway workforce was reduced from 688 to 260 in spite of an earlier promise from its management that it would maintain the terms and conditions of the employees at the existing level. More than 250 of the employees who lost their jobs were required to sell back shares worth Pounds 35 for only Pounds 2.50. 'We are surprised that the resale value of the shares was not covered in the sale agreement,' the committee said. It urged the government consider ways of inserting binding undertakings into agreements reached for any future sales to ensure that bidders stood by promises made to workers. It also called for the government to consider introducing a clawback on increases in the value of shares where the increase resulted from the buyer's failure to meet undertakings given at the sale time. The reduction in the size of the Medway workforce and the forced sale of employees' shares made a significant difference to profitability. The committee was also critical of the government for failing to obtain the best price for the five ports. It said that it was 'particularly concerned' at the price difference between the first and second sales of Medway. The port fetched little more than three quarters of the lower benchmark valuation when it was first sold to its workers but more than three times as much 18 months later. This second sale led to the management and their backers making a far greater profit than the Pounds 13m received by the taxpayer on the initial privatisation. The committee said it was concerned that in two of the five sales the price reached was below the lower benchmark valuation which had been made. The upper benchmark was achieved in only one of the sales. Department of Transport: The First Sales of Trust Ports. HMSO Pounds 8.95.</p>

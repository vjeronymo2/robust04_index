			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADS AT THE MOVIES  </P> <P> After recently moving from Jacksonville, N.C., where movie tickets cost $4.50,  I was shocked by the prices here -- $6 to $7. But what disturbs me the most  about Los Angeles-area theaters is that many show commercials. If I wanted to  see commercials I would stay home and watch TV, without buying any ticket.  </P> <P> A final note: The commercial I see the most is an obnoxious one that makes no  sense. Only at the end do we find out who it is for -- the L.A. Times.  </P> <P> ROBERT A. SCARPATO  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

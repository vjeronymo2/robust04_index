			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: The Opening - Ballet Any evening in the dance theatre that ends with Maurice Bejart's Rite of Spring comes with a guarantee of impending doom, as we await the rutting animal capers that will bring the curtain down. But Wednesday night's triple bill by the Berlin Ballet was hell-bent from the first. To start a programme with Bill T. Jones' The Opening is to offer the most miserable activities as portrait of a company. Purporting to deal with the Ballet after the destruction of the Berlin Wall, its only connection with that event is to show choreographic rubble as a parallel with the Wall's fate. There is a sound track (compiled by John Oswald) in which recordings of music used for dance at the Deutsche Oper are turned into a confetti of single bars, notes, phrases, that are, in certain super-brutish instances, layered one on another. It is a profoundly tasteless assemblage. On a bare stage - with a golden figure from one of Berlin's monuments as back-drop - twenty-seven dancers wear a rag-bag of costuming from the theatre's wardrobe. They run, posture, trudge through snippets of their repertory as scrappy and insolent as the sound-track. Of choreographic scheme, invention, sense, I could discern no trace. A man and a woman indulge in a running fight. Fatuity rules. The piece is an affront to the Berlin artists and to the history of the company. How welcome and valuable would have been the revival of a work by Tatiana Gsovsky, an important and neglected choreographer who was the architect of the Berlin Ballet's rebirth after the war. There followed Christopher Bruce's Swansong. This portrait of a man under interrogation - though Bruce has advised us that it might also be about the ardours of a dancer's life - is very popular with audiences. Its great merit is in the stunning role it has given Koen Onzia as the victim, and in a guest appearance, he repeats his customary triumph. It is a reading of dazzling physical resource, the ideas of terror and anguish marvellously exact in expression. There is little that remains to be said about the Bejart Rite of Spring, which has been lumbering across the world's stages for the past three decades, save that it is a cleverly packaged sex-act which combines Disney-ish anthropomorphism with emotional blatancy. The boys are on heat; the girls are tremulously expectant. They meet. They couple. (The piece should be subtitled Congress Dances). The Berlin artists bounce and leap with a will, and behave as if it mattered. A programme note announces that these will be the last London performances of Bejart's Rite, since the maestro has decided to withdraw the work from the stage. Who says prayer goes unanswered? The Berlin Ballet is at The Coliseum until July 4, with varied programming. Support for the season comes from Montblanc (UK).</p>

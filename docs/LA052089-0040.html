			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ATTEMPTS TO OUST GEN. NORIEGA  </P> <P> Congratulations for your editorial "Unnecessary Deployment" (May 12), which not  only pinpoints the overreaction of the Bush Administration to the political  crisis in Panama, but also reminds the readers of your newspaper that the  intervention of U.S. forces into Latin American countries is a "sensitive  issue" to their people.  </P> <P> There is more to this recent Panamanian crisis, however, than what The Times  has reported so far. For one thing, it is necessary to keep Gen. Manuel A.  Noriega's former ties to U.S. intelligence services in the consciousness of the  American people. Apparently, Noriega agreed to the training of Contra forces in  Panama in exchange for the freedom to engage in narcotics traffic to the U.S.,  which is a part of the still unsettled Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> For another thing, the "opposition" to Noriega appears to be composed of the  same "fat cats" who the U.S. government generally supports in Third World  countries. When you juxtapose a picture of the obviously well-fed Guillermo  Endara, bloodied face notwithstanding (Part I, May 11), and mention his being  from an affluent neighborhood of Panama City, to the trim Noriega with his  pockmarked face (testimony to his humble origins), the impression that surfaces  is that nothing much would change if the one replaces the other.  </P> <P> If the U.S. government doesn't use tough soldiers to see after its interests in  the Third World, it's the rich and well-born, with their very narrow concerns,  who are employed, and therein lies a good deal of the problem with U.S. policy  toward these poor countries.  </P> <P> ANTHONY GARAVENTE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Sino-British negotiators adjourned talks on the  handover of military sites yesterday for the second time. The  meeting will be continued on Thursday -- the day after the  Legislative Council [Legco] vote on the territory's democratic  reforms.    Yesterday's Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG] talks  followed an inconclusive three-day session of the JLG last week,  during which the two sides failed to finalise a deal on the  handover of defence sites. Further delays in ending the  seven-year wrangle sparked speculation that China was attempting  to block a deal until after the Legco debate on Governor Chris  Patten's reform tomorrow.    Independent legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing said: "This sort  of action would send a signal to Hong Kong and to the world,  that `now I (China) am watching you, so you'd better behave, and  you'd better vote the way we want, otherwise there could be  serious economic consequences.' If you vote against Mr Patten's  proposal, you would be rewarded and if you don't, you could be  punished," she said.    However, British officials denied a link between the Legco  debate and the defence talks. Officials maintained there were  no fundamental differences between the views of the two  governments.    Speaking after yesterday's meeting, China's chief negotiator  at the JLG, Guo Fengmin, said: "Our experts have accomplished  significant progress but some technical issues remain to be  dealt with."    Before the talks, British chief negotiator Hugh Davies had  said he hoped the JLG session would be completed at the meeting.  Later, he said: "Until we have an agreement I'm not counting my  chickens." He said the meeting had been adjourned "to allow us  to complete work on the defence lands and on the remaining  issues on the agenda."    It is understood experts from both sides had round-the-clock  discussions at the weekend on the draft agreement on the  handover of military sites.    Both Mr Guo and Mr Davies said they expected they could  finalise the agreement on Thursday.    In separate talks on the draft agreement on how to finance  the Chek Lap Kok Airport, experts from the two governments met  yesterday morning to tackle outstanding differences. Officials  said they had no idea when the deal could be finalised but  indicated there were no major obstacles.    Sources close to the negotiations said the Chinese had made  no new demands on their British counterparts about a completion  date for the airport project.</p>

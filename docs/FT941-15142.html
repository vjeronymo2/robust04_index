			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Wrapped in a mutual embrace / A look at progress towards economic integration in Latin America When the presidents of Brazil and Argentina meet in a tiny Uruguayan colonial town today, long-running arguments are likely to be heard around the table. Brazil and Argentina are at loggerheads over Argentine complaints that it is a dumping ground for cheap Brazilian industrial products. But the two presidents might pause and contemplate how much has already been achieved in integrating their two economies in Latin America's largest free-trade area. After decades of virtually ignoring each other as export markets, largely because of trade barriers and a preference for selling to Europe and North America, the two countries are discovering their mutual attractions. The free trade initative, known as Mercosul in Brazil and Mercosur among its Spanish-speaking neighbours, was signed in March 1991 between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. It called for the free movement of capital, goods and services between the four countries, and for the establishment of a common tariff system for trade with non-Mercosul countries by the end of this year. Tariffs on goods ranging from Roquefort cheese to metal doors have already been cut by up to 80 per cent. But trying to set up in four years what took the European Union nearly 40 has led to problems. Brazil and Argentina, which account for more than 95 per cent of Mercosul's GDP, have been arguing since the middle of last year about which industries should enjoy special protection. They are now expected to announce a list of goods, for example Brazilian telecommunications, which would retain local rather than common external tariffs until the end of the century. This would protect sensitive sectors from more efficient foreign competition. Because of such exclusions, the original intention of totally free trade is unlikely to be met by 1995, and will probably have to wait until later in the decade or perhaps the next century. But businesspeople in Brazil and Argentina say they are realising the advantages of closer economic ties, despite the diplomatic disputes. Trade is growing rapidly and looks set to continue to accelerate even if the free-trade agreement does not meet its deadline. Trade between the two countries increased 63 per cent to Dollars 4.93bn (Pounds 3.33bn) in 1992, helped by falling tariffs. In the first quarter of last year, the latest figures available, trade between the two grew 57 per cent to Dollars 1.34bn over the same period in 1992. The growth, from a low base, has mainly come from Brazilian exports of industrial products ranging from cars to chemicals and Argentine exports of agricultural goods and oil, reflecting the two economies' relative strengths. Foreign and domestic companies are starting to look at Brazil and Argentina as a single market. Autolatina, the holding company for Volkswagen and Ford's combined operations in the two countries with an annual turnover of about Dollars 8bn, last year completed a three-year programme to standardise all products and parts for both markets, which were previously treated separately. A new factory in Cordoba, Argentina, is now supplying about 90 per cent of the transmissions used in the company's Brazilian-built mid-sized cars. 'These sorts of product decisions show our confidence in Mercosul. You don't move production unless you are confident,' says Mr Pierre-Alain De Smedt, president of Autolatina. Food companies are making similar moves. Sadia, one of Brazil's largest food companies, recently set up a joint venture in Buenos Aires with an Argentine company to oversee distribution of its products. Carlos Eduardo Sant'Anna, the Sadia director responsible for the joint venture, says: 'Argentina is not just another foreign market, but the foreign market for us. We see a belt that goes from Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, southern Brazil and Buenos Aires to Santiago (the Chilean capital). Here you have 65 per cent of South America's GDP.' Growth in trade has been rapid partly because Argentina and Brazil are complementary economies. Argentina is rich in energy, Brazil is not. Argentina last year became Brazil's second-largest oil supplier behind Saudi Arabia. Most of Brazil's electricity is produced by hydroelectric dams, whereas Argentina has a large thermal system. Moreover, Argentina has big grain surpluses, while Brazil is a net food importer. Argentina's industry is obsolete. If it is to grow, it needs the economies of scale which free access to the much bigger Brazilian market can provide. Brazilian industry is more competitive than Argentina's and is attracted by the prospects of adding 33m Argentine consumers to the 150m in Brazil. Cross-border links are not just a corporate phenomenon. For example, tourism is developing and about 700,000 Argentine tourists are expected to take their holidays in Brazil this summer. Argentines travelling to Brazil have brought back some of their neighbour's consumption habits, such as a passion for ice-cold beer. Brahma, Brazil's biggest beer company, last year began trucking bottled beer 1,000 miles from one of its breweries in southern Brazil to Buenos Aires, aiming for a 3-4 per cent share of the Argentine market over the next two years. Now it is planning a brewery near Buenos Aires. Such links are fuelling tensions as well as growth. Some Argentine industries, especially textiles, paper and steel, have complained of a flood of cheaper Brazilian imports as tariffs have come down. In response, Argentina started in 1992 imposing a number of protectionist measures, such as anti-dumping measures against Brazilian farm machinery and spark plugs. There are concerns in Brazil, too. In the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, which borders Argentina and Uruguay, farmers are worried that they will soon have to compete with products from across the frontiers, where land is cheaper and the soil more fertile. 'Rio Grande do Sul is perhaps the state most threatened by Mercosul, especially our products like jams, vegetables and wines, and these employ a lot of people,' according to Mr Dagoberto Lima Godoy, president of the state's federation of industries. Companies on both sides say there are limits to how far integration can go. Cultural differences are one reason. Brazilians prefer two-door cars while Argentines prefer four-door models; and emission standards are higher in Brazil. Economic differences have also led to problems. Argentina boasts a growing economy, with inflation running at an annual rate of 7.4 per cent last year, but an overvalued peso. Brazil is plagued by annual inflation of 2,500 per cent and an undervalued currency. This has led to Argentine claims that Brazil is dumping products, an accusation hotly denied by the Brazilians. Trade in services is still underdeveloped and faces restrictive government rules which hinder foreign access to markets. A body to resolve trade disputes, perhaps similar to the European Court, has been delayed because it raised the sensitive issue of diminished sovereignty. A very poor communications infrastructure is also a constraint. There are no rail connections because each country has a different gauge. Goods therefore have to be moved via often poor road networks, especially on the Argentine side, and bureaucratic customs procedures. Lorry drivers usually have to wait at the border for a day for paperwork to be processed. Because of different rules on truck sizes, haulage companies have to swap trucks at the border. As with the free-trade agreement, progress towards tackling these constraints is likely to be slow. Nevertheless, businessmen such as Mr De Smedt of Autolatina are optimistic that solutions will emerge in the long term and free trade will blossom. 'There is a positive trend. We feel there is a willingness at government level to make it happen. The timing is not certain but let's hope they manage it by the deadline,' he says.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Deficient targeting Politicians established the rules, now politicians must play by them. In a little over two weeks, European finance ministers must establish the fiscal qualifications for entry to Europe's fast-track to economic and monetary union. The Maastricht Treaty provides them with two reference numbers, and a good deal of scope to fudge both. Given the EU's current state of fiscal disarray, one of the targets may well be dropped. The signs, however, are that it will be the wrong one. From an economic standpoint, the arguments for imposing fiscal rules for entry to European Monetary Union were always quite weak. Once individual governments have handed over independent control of monetary policy, so the fear goes, they will have an incentive to overcompensate on the fiscal side, running up unsustainable public budget deficits. Investors might not believe that the EU would allow a member to suffer a default. In that case, Europe as a whole would bear the cost, in the form of higher European interest rates. In principle, the 'no-bail-out' condition written into the Maastricht Treaty solves this problem. In truth, however, the threat might never be credible. The best reason for additional, numerical, fiscal constraints was that, by only admitting countries with a proven record of sound fiscal policy, there would be less chance that this commitment would be tested, particularly in the early, politically sensitive stages of EMU's history. Two arbitrary indicators were chosen: a public budget deficit of no more than 3 per cent and national debt not exceeding 60 per cent of GDP. Neither is a particularly cogent indicator of a country's ability to pursue sensible fiscal policies. Certainly, few EU member states are likely to satisfy both by 1997. The European Commission appears to have decided to apply the deficit criterion rigorously, while casting a benevolent eye over the level of a country's debt. This is not surprising, since the Commission wants as many countries as possible to qualify and knows that it is easier to meet a target for a deficit (which is an annual flow) than for the debt stock. In addition to Luxembourg, the only country already meeting both targets, it decided not to recommend Ireland as a potentially divergent country, a decision which the EU finance ministers, rather more surprisingly, accepted on Monday. Both can justify their decision by pointing to the impressive reduction of the Irish debt ratio, from nearly 120 per cent in 1987 to the current 90 per cent of GDP. But it sets a dangerous precedent. Regardless of the current stance of its fiscal policy, a country with a high debt ratio has a greater risk of encountering debt service problems than a country with a relatively low level of debt. The Maastricht Treaty's chosen 'safe' ratio may be arbitrary, but debt is the more justifiable and the more important of the two criteria. Some room for manoeuvre around the 60 per cent figure is required, but effectively deciding to ignore it, by exempting countries with ratios of 80-90 per cent, could prove damaging. Such a decision may have been necessitated by the need to offer hope to Belgium, whose debt ratio is far higher still. But the end result will be the effective obliteration of the only fiscal criterion that made an iota of sense.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead BRITISH Telecommunications is expected to report on Thursday a drop in pre-tax profits for the year ended March to about Pounds 2.5bn from Pounds 3bn a year earlier. The fall will be, however, after redundancy payments of about Pounds 500m and exceptional costs of around Pounds 200m for restructuring, redemption of bonds and other items. Underlying profit growth last year was therefore around 2 to 3 per cent. Inland call volumes rose, helping to offset lower tariffs. Further redundancy costs are expected this year with the market looking for profits in the Pounds 3.2bn-Pounds 3.5bn range. J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, is forecast to report on Wednesday a hefty increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended March to around Pounds 740m from Pounds 628m a year earlier. Unlike its arch-rival Tesco it has managed to maintain its growth momentum on sales volume while retaining a tight grip on costs. Grand Metropolitan is expected to report first half pre-tax profits of Pounds 400m to Pounds 413m on Thursday, 2 to 3 per cent ahead of last year's result, excluding exceptionals. Trading profits from the IDV spirits business will be boosted by currency translation but the favourable exchange rate is unlikely to compensate entirely for lower dollar profits from the US food operations. Royal Dutch Shell group will announce its first quarter results on Thursday with analysts forecasting a wide range of income figures of between Pounds 600m and Pounds 800m on a replacement cost basis which strips out stockholding losses and gains. The company reported a profit of Pounds 770m in the same period last year, but this was buoyed by one-off exceptional items. Shell's first quarter results will signal how successful the company has been at cutting costs and maintaining its profits against a background of falling oil prices and deteriorating sales margins. Body Shop is forecast to report on Wednesday a drop in pre-tax profits for the year to February of about 20 per cent to around Pounds 20m. While international expansion continues apace, UK prices and margins and slipped while volume growth has faltered.</p>

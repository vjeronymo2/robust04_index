			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Emess ahead as 'markets emerge from recession' Pre-tax profits at Emess, the UK's largest lighting company, rose 45 per cent from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.6m in the first half of 1994, as the consumer and commercial lighting markets 'emerged from recession'. Turnover grew organically by 8 per cent to Pounds 64.5m (Pounds 59.5m) and Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, ascribed the margin improvement to 'stringent cost control'. Also, productivity rose with sales per employee up 15 per cent. Trading profits rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.1m). The shares eased 2 1/2p to 34p yesterday. Trading profits from consumer lighting were up at Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 200,000) on turnover at Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 34.8m). Profit and turnover advances were less dramatic on the commercial side at Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.9m) and Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 24.7m) respectively. The overseas companies lifted their proportion of turnover by 1 percentage point to 57 per cent. Profits from the UK were unchanged at Pounds 3.4m, but this time there were no losses from Germany, against Pounds 600,000 last time. Losses from the US deepened to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 300,000). Fully diluted earnings increased to 0.8p (0.5p) per share and again, 'in line with recent practice', there is no interim dividend.</p>

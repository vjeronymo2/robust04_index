			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / HK business group asks Patten to renegotiate reforms AN INFLUENTIAL group of Hong Kong business people yesterday called on Mr Chris Patten, the governor, to drop his proposals for democratic reform in the colony and to negotiate fresh plans with China. The Business and Professionals Federation, a powerful conservative think tank, said the impasse between London and Beijing must be resolved by dialogue and consultation. It is the first heavyweight organisation openly to oppose the governor, who has found general support among the public. A test of Mr Patten's support in the local legislature will come tomorrow when it debates his proposals. Mr Patten's plans for greater democracy in Hong Kong have been rejected by China. It has said it will not discuss the matter further until the governor backs down. Beijing has threatened to reverse any changes he introduces without its agreement when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. Mr Vincent Lo, the business group's chairman, said the federation supported many of the governor's plans, but 'to run the risk of developing a political structure which will be dismantled in 4 1/2 years' time is just not acceptable to us'. He said that any plans for Hong Kong's political development should be compatible with the Basic Law, the colony's post-1997 constitution passed by the Chinese parliament in 1990. By backing Communist China instead of Mr Patten, the group threatens to dilute a local mandate for greater democracy in the increasingly strident war of words between China and Britain over Hong Kong's the future. Mr Lo, chairman of Shui On, a leading property developer in the colony, is one of the businessmen tipped to become Hong Kong's first chief executive, or governor, after China takes over. He was flanked at the press conference by Sir David Akers-Jones, a former chief secretary of Hong Kong and now head of the housing authority, and Mr David Gledhill, a former head of foreign business in the colony. Many businessmen, long accustomed to considerable leverage over the colonial government, are wary of the democracy plans due to their heavy investment in China's increasingly market-oriented southern provinces. The federation's stance bears a strong resemblance to Beijing's position, which has said Mr Patten should withdraw his proposals and negotiate on the same basis that Britain was contemplating in late 1989 and early 1990. Over the weekend Mr Patten said he was sure the business community 'would want to avoid seeing a gap opening up between what some businessmen had to say and what clearly the community wants'.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from </F> Severodvinsk by Valeriy Anuchin]    [Text] To date around 100 nuclear submarines have been  withdrawn from service in the Russian Navy. More than 10 very  outdated submarines have accumulated at a division for  dismantling submarines at the White Sea Naval Base in the  roadstead of Severodvinsk port. Some of them have been there  for more than 15 years, waiting to be dismantled. Yet not even  the fuel from their nuclear reactors has been unloaded yet.  There is simply nowhere to put it. Nuclear waste storage  facilities in Murmansk and Severodvinsk are full to capacity.  Because of the Northern Fleet's lack of money, the dismantling  of the reactors and subsequent storage of the nuclear waste have  been postponed for many years. Meanwhile considerable sums of  money are having to be spent to keep these submarines afloat.    [V.P. Shempelev, White Sea Naval Base chief of radiological,  chemical, and biological defense] These submarines have been in  service for a great many years and there is therefore a  potential danger that the radiation situation will deteriorate.  So painstaking ecological monitoring of the radiation situation  in the area where these submarines are located is essential.    [Anuchin] But how are the White Sea Naval Base specialists  of to carry out such monitoring when the Akademik Vavilov -- the  only vessel in the North equipped for monitoring radiation and  ecological safety -- is being withdrawn by its owner, the  "Krasnoye Sormovo" shipyard in Nizhniy Novgorod, despite the  fact that the Northern Fleet is prepared to sign a long-term  lease?</p>

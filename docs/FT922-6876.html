			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Assurances sought on EC access SIXTY-FOUR developing countries which have a trade and aid treaty with the European Community will seek further assurances of continued preferential access to the Community for important commodities when both groups meet in Jamaica today. They will also be seeking more EC financial assistance. Ministers representing the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group and the EC will examine ACP concerns about the effects on trade and aid of the creation of a single European market next year, and the move towards deregulation of international trade under current Gatt proposals. Mr Ralph Maraj, Trinidad and Tobago's foreign minister and president of the ACP ministerial council, said the Lome Convention, the treaty between the ACP and the EC, will have to be re-examined in the light of global changes such as the dismantling of centrally-planned economies, the collapse of apartheid, the 're-emergence of South Africa on the world stage', and the 'current international bloc politics portrayed by the Ecu, yen and dollar zones'.</p>

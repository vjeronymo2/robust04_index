			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taiwan June 17 (CNA) -- The Supreme Court on Friday  [17 June] turned back the second appeal of Chang Win-lung who  was sentenced to nine years for hijacking a passenger aircraft  from Mainland China to Taiwan last year.    Chang hijacked a Boeing 737 with 63 passengers and nine  crewmembers on board to the island on June 24 with a toy gun and  a knife. He immediately surrendered to police upon landing at  Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.    Chang was sentenced to 12 years in jail but had his prison  term reduced to nine years in his first appeal to the High Court.    Taiwan is currently holding 15 mainlanders who have forced  airliners to Taiwan since April 1993. Fourteen have been given  jail terms of up to 13 years. The 15th is still on trial.    Twelve mainland Chinese airliners have been hijacked to  Taiwan since April last year, with the latest occurring when a  man forced a Boeing 737 with 131 passengers and eight  crewmembers on board to Taiwan on June 6.    Taipei has charged Beijing of deliberately allowing the  hijackings to take place, likely in a scheme to test Taiwan's  air defenses.</p>

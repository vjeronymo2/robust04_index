			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Brussels wants US treaties modified - Commission seeks to be sole trade negotiator THE European Commission has asked seven member states to modify bilateral friendship treaties with the US, in a move aimed at restoring its authority as sole trade negotiator of the EC. The Commission's proposal is a further challenge to the informal US-German 'non-aggression pact' in which each side agreed to exempt the other from trade sanctions in the US-EC dispute over public procurement. Germany has come under renewed pressure to implement EC trade sanctions against the US in the transatlantic row over government telecommunications contracts. Germany maintains that a 1954 trade treaty with the US prevents application of Article 29 of the EC's Utilities Directive which establishes a preference for EC companies on procurement contracts. So far, Bonn has refrained from exchanging letters to confirm the deal with Washington. The Commission's latest move may inflame matters; but Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible for external economic relations, is ready to take Germany to the European Court of Justice if necessary, according to EC officials. The Commission has proposed that Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands give one year's notice to the US that they intend to modify bilateral friendship, commerce and navigation treaties to accommodate Article 29. Only Germany considers itself exempt from Article 29, because its treaty with the US predates the Treaty of Rome. Commission officials said they were taking a hard line, in case member states with similar treaties further undermine the EC's united trade policy. On the Uruguay Round Gatt negotiations, Sir Leon assured the European Parliament yesterday that television broadcasts, films and other audio visual products needed special treatment. Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said the EC should not be the 'victim of a naive and free trade liberalism'. But Mr Claes made clear he was not in a hurry to reach agreement on proposals which would make it easier for the Commission to impose anti-dumping measures. This issue has divided the EC between protectionist-minded countries and free traders. Mr Claes said it would be better to wait until after an outline agreement in the newly-resumed Gatt trade talks in Geneva. Japanese officials have agreed that Japan's car exports to the EC this year should be lowered further from the earlier agreed levels, to take into account the fall in EC demand, a European Commission source said yesterday.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen breaks new records THE Japanese yen continued its sharp upward progress against the dollar yesterday, touching a new high and defying several rounds of intervention from the Federal Reserve, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks the yen has been well underpinned in the run-up to the next round of trade talks between the US and Japan, and the summit next month of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The US administration is expected to call for a strong yen at both meetings to help reduce Japan's overwhelming trade surplus with the US. Yesterday's moves came in spite of the lack of any fresh news in the market. However, the absence of any Fed intervention on Monday had surprised the market, and tempted dealers to buy the Japanese currency yesterday. The yen hit a post-war peak of Y105.90 per dollar in early US trading, prompting the Fed to intervene. It later closed at Y106.35 in London (from a previous Y107.30) and in New York at Y106.40. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, continues to believe that 'the dollar has Y100 written all over it'. He believes that this week's tankan report on the Japanese economy is likely to show the yen's appreciation continuing to hurt Japanese exporters, raising speculation about the need to introduce a third fiscal stimulus to the economy. The dollar's plunge against the yen contrasted with another comparatively good performance against the D-Mark, which was in the throes of all-round weakness. Part of the reason for the dollar's rise against the German currency was a comment from Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, who said the central bank's goal was to keep inflation down. This raised speculation that the US might raise short-term interest rates later this year, narrowing the differential between US and German rates. The dollar closed  1/2 pfennig up at DM1.6235. In New York it ended at DM1.6260. The D-Mark was also weaker in Europe, partly as a by-product of the peseta's strength in the wake of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's general election victory. The German currency slipped to a close of Pta76.51 from a previous Pta76.84. It also lost ground to the Italian lira, ending at L909.1 from a previous L915.2. Sterling failed to gain from the general strengthening against the D-Mark, closing unchanged at DM2.4650. The D-Mark's softness came in spite of the strong view in the market that the Bundesbank would either leave its repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent in its weekly intervention today, or cut it by 1 or 2 basis points. The high level of German bond yields makes it unlikely that the Bundesbank will ease policy quickly. Ten-year German bond yields were yesterday at 6.85 per cent to 6.90 per cent, having been as low as 6.4 per cent earlier in the year.</p>

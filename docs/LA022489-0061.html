			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Residents of the Soviet autonomous republic of Kalmyk, where more than two  dozen children were infected with the deadly AIDS virus, have been the objects  of abuse by fearful neighbors, a newspaper reported. Writing in the government  newspaper Izvestia, poet David Kugultinov said residents of nearby areas have  begun throwing stones at cars bearing license plates from Kalmyk, located  between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, "as if the cars are spreading AIDS."  Kugultinov urged the Soviet Union to adopt measures to prohibit discrimination  against victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P></p>

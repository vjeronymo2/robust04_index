			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY MAY HELP FUND GRAD NIGHT PARTIES  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday night is scheduled to vote on a proposal to give  $1,000 each to four city high schools to help fund their drug- and alcohol-free  grad night parties.  </P> <P> Grad night celebrations are held at high schools on the evenings of high school  graduation.  </P> <P> The all-night parties, staged by parents, are designed to keep the new  graduates from driving back and forth to numerous private parties, many of  which might offer alcohol and drugs.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol has praised grad night events, saying they have  helped reduce fatal accidents.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Grace Winchell asked the city staff to look into the possibility  of the city making a donation to grad night events. Winchell made her motion  after Trudee Christensen, co-chairwoman of the Huntington Beach High parents'  committee for grad night, spoke to the council last month.  </P> <P> In addition to Marina and Huntington Beach High, the other two regular high  schools in the city are Ocean View and Edison High. All four have grad night  events. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

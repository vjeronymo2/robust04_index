Vasilyev, president </F> of the Selkhoztrast joint-stock company and president of the  Russian Agricultural Exchange, by SELSKAYA ZHIZN correspondent  Mikhail Sharov, under the rubric "Interview of Current  Interest"; place and date not given: "Futures Are Advantageous  to All"]    [Text] We have already reported that a conference on  the issues of organizing a grain futures market has been held at  the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation. The main  developer of this program, Doctor of Commerce A.V. Vasilyev,  president of the Selkhoztrast joint-stock company and  simultaneously the president of the Russian Agricultural  Exchange, has answered questions put by SELSKAYA ZHIZN.    [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, organization of the grain  futures market is a completely new endeavor both for commodity  producers and the state as a whole. We would like you to discuss  it because many readers do not know what futures are.    [Vasilyev] Translated into Russian, futures means the  future,  transactions concluded for the purchase of future products.  Exchanges in Russia had not previously engaged in futures  trading; however, they had advanced to the level of a highly  organized wholesale market for grain. Exchanges set prices for  grain that were published in all the newspapers. Peasants knew  precisely what grain cost on the market. Meanwhile, in our  country, the general customer (the Roskhleboprodukt [Russian  Federation Committee for Grain Products]), the Ministry of  Agriculture of Russia, the AKKOR [Association of Peasant Farms  and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], and the Agrarian Union  get together at the beginning of the year and set the price, and  the government subsequently confirms it. Is this not theater of  the absurd?!    We have now begun to foster a new wholesale market, which  consists of two main elements: these are the market for real  goods and the market for the sale of the right to goods. The  latter is the futures market. It may also be called a term  contract market, that is, a market of contracts for a definite  period. A peasant may sell his grain three, six, nine, or 12  months in advance.    [Sharov] Grain that has not yet been grown? That has not  even  been planted?    [Vasilyev] Precisely. Having sold a contract for a certain  amount of grain at a price projected for the next year, he  receives money for this grain, which has not yet been grown (and  this is very important!) in order to buy fuel, good seeds,  fertilizer, and machinery. Therefore, the commodity producer is  a winner, and the state also has an advantage; after all, the  buyer pays for grain, and funds from the budget are not spent to  this end.    Buyers in Western markets are speculators pure and simple,  and in the genuine, favorable sense of the word, rather than in  ours. So, two speculator-buyers meet on the exchange. One of  them believes that grain will be expensive because its gross  production will fall due to poor weather conditions. The other  one believes that on the contrary, the cost of grain will be  reduced because the crop will be large. That is, two contrary  opinions are apparent. One speculator says: I will stock up on  grain, whereas the other one says: I will sell it. These  interests are reflected, in monetary terms, in sales and  purchases on the exchange. Those playing for a rise are called  "bulls," and those playing for a fall are called "bears." The  peasant stays on the sidelines, looks at them fighting on the  exchange, and is plainly happy. This means that the price for  grain is being stabilized. If any one of them is winning, the  peasant understands that yes, indeed, the grain situation at  present is bad. Apparently, contracts need to be bought out in  order to hedge against a fall in value. Or else, on the  contrary, try to sell as many contracts as possible, because  prices for grain will go up.    [Sharov] At present, there are a great many insinuations of  all kinds concerning grain prices. They say that the prices have  been unjustifiably overstated....    [Vasilyev] As early as January of this year, we projected  for  September a grain price of approximately 90 rubles [R], with the  value-added tax included.    [Sharov] You mean price per kilogram....    [Vasilyev] Of course. So had a peasant sold grain at this  price at the beginning of the year and received money as early  as January, I am convinced that his mood would be good now, and  the crop would have certainly been harvested in its entirety.  Meanwhile, this is what it has come to: a tiller cannot buy what  is necessary to till the land, grow the crop, and bring it in.    [Sharov] Is this, in essence, an interest-free loan?    [Vasilyev] Essentially so. It would vindicate the peasants  from all unjustified and malevolent accusations.    Of course, there is a risk factor involved here. It is easy  to understand a peasant if deep down he harbors the thought that  he will be cheated about the price being precisely R90.    [Sharov] However, these apprehensions are not groundless.  The  risk factor indeed exists. Imagine that early in the year a  peasant sells grain at a high price, and in September it becomes  cheaper....    [Vasilyev] Yes, in this case, the peasant loses. What should  he do? He either leaves the sold contracts open for sale, or  buys them out and sells grain at its actual price on the  exchange.    This is where one more aspect, a very powerful aspect of the  futures exchange, comes in: it is so-called hedging or, in other  words, insurance against unfavorable changes in prices.    If insurance exists, the peasant will get the price for  which  he sold grain on the exchange in any event--in any event if his  grain is purchased.    [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, when the issue was being  discussed at the Ministry of Agriculture, you illustrated your  arguments with a chart that vividly showed the mechanism of  operation of the grain futures market.    [Vasilyev] What is the most fundamental provision with  regard  to price setting for grain? It is that nobody knows how much  grain will cost 12 months from now, because the futures market  is not yet in operation in our country. This is why we  approached this from a scientific point of view and established  that in October of the next year, 1994, the cost of grain may  range between R180 and R250 per kilogram.    According to our calculations, these fluctuations in  December  will already be within the range of R190-R260. However, let us  discuss the October prices for which R180 is the minimum price  limit and R250 is the maximum price limit. A peasant takes a  look at the chart and decides to put up his grain at the maximum  price. He is told: "Go ahead, but you will get only 50 percent  down." This variant may not satisfy him, and he will wish to  receive all of 90 percent (we cannot pay 100 percent, because we  would like to build up reserve stocks of grain out of the 10  percent). He is told once again: "Go ahead, but in this case you  must put up the merchandise at R180, that is, at the lowest end  of the scale" (final settlement will be effected at the time of  actually turning in the grain). At this point, the peasant  begins to think: Let me take the golden mean, R200, and receive  80 percent down. This price satisfies the peasant--he was the  one to set it.    [Sharov] Does this important endeavor take into account the  role of the state and public organizations representing the  interests of the peasantry?    [Vasilyev] Definitely. The chart we are talking about should  be approved by the government after a thorough discussion at the  Ministry of Agriculture and the Agrarian Union. In the process,  the state will retain a regulatory function--after all, bread is  at stake!    Imagine that grain prices have exceeded the maximum limit.  What does the state do? It releases onto the market a large  amount of grain from reserves. Since more of it appears on the  exchange, it means that prices for grain will fall. Once again,  this chart is brought into conformity. However, the opposite  situation may also occur, whereby they begin to sell grain at  R160 rather than at R180. In this case, the state dumps a large  amount of money on the grain market and purchases the grain to  meet state needs. This means that prices will return to those on  the chart once again.    [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, everything is always  impeccably smooth in theory.... What about reality?    [Vasilyev] Indeed, in practice everything is considerably  more complicated. The most difficult issue in this instance is  that of the buyer.    For example, who will now buy grain at R250 per kilogram if  it is suddenly put up for sale? There will be no takers, because  cattle breeders who need this grain are beggars now. Private  farms will not buy at this price either, nor, perhaps, will mill  operators. So we started thinking about how to cut this Gordian  knot. The following thought occurred to us: What if these  contracts are sold at 10 percent of the value, or even five  percent, that is to say, one-tenth to one-twentieth of the  contract rather than at full value? An opportunity will appear  to sell this grain to a larger circle of consumers.    Peasants need manufactured feed concentrates rather than  grain in order to raise farm animals. Esteemed buyers of futures  contracts, we propose to replace grain with any manufactured  feed concentrate, and then at your manufactured-feed plants  located nearby. We have signed an agreement with the  Roskombikorm association, which has been set up by these  manufactured-feed plants. You may buy manufactured feed  concentrates from them towards a grain contract. At present, we  specify the values of one-tenth or one-twentieth of the cost on  only one condition, that of the opportunity we will have to  build an insurance reserve of grain. If contracts are sold for  one-tenth of the cost, we will need to place no less than 1  million tonnes of grain in reserve stocks. If they are sold for  one-twentieth, we should place no less than 2 million tonnes.  Everything depends on what arrangements we make and where we  find the money to purchase this segment of the emergency fund at  present. Everyone who makes a purchase under a contract should  be sure that the delivery to himself of grain or manufactured  feed concentrates is guaranteed. We will be able to guarantee it  when we have a reserve stock.    [Sharov] Do you mean the amount of grain that is necessary  in  order to set in motion the mechanism of the futures market  itself next year? Is it realistic to be discussing it already?    [Vasilyev] Yes, it is realistic. We have prepared virtually  all documentation, refined the contract itself, and refined the  implementation program. To be sure, at present we will not be  able to do this in all regions of Russia. For now, we will only  use a few grain-producing and grain-consuming oblasts in which  we will refine this mechanism. As soon as it gets going, we will  extend it to all of Russia.    However, this will happen tomorrow, but today we badly need  support from the mass media in explaining the very mechanism of  the futures market. This is a very, very complicated business.  The main point is for the people to understand that if they buy  contracts for grain, the latter will be delivered in the  necessary amount and on schedule--a tonne in December, a tonne  in January, February, and so on, that is, at a rate that  supports, on a monthly basis, the technical cycle of production  or animal feeding. The state should provide assistance in  setting this mechanism in motion, if not in funds, then in  grain. We should be told: We are allocating 1 million tonnes for  the futures mechanism to the five or six exchanges in which they  have confidence now, and guarantee that this grain will be  provided from state reserves in any case. Our farmer or peasant  may suddenly fail to get the crop. In this case, all of us are  bankrupt and unable to honor commitments made under the  contracts. Support from the state and a reserve fund are needed  to ensure that this does not happen.    To be sure, Americans propose to give us the necessary  amount  of grain as charitable aid. However, frankly, I would not want  it, because we will thus punish our own commodity producers.  When charitable-aid grain was dumped in March on the Saratov  exchange, its price fell from R35-R40 to R27 right away. This is  what the infusion of a large delivery of grain means.    Generally, my notion is that purchasing grain abroad is just  a catastrophe for Russia. Why? Because we ruin the domestic  commodity producer in this manner, paying him for grain three to  four times less than a Western grain producer. Would it not be  better to purchase elite grades of seeds, of which we do not  have enough, and various kinds of defoliants and herbicides,  that is, everything that improves the grade and quality of the  crop? This would be a statesmanlike approach!</p>

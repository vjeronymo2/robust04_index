			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Privatisation testifies to Amato's resolve: The Italian government has launched itself boldly on the path of reform THE Italian government's efforts to kick-start a privatisation programme, promised for years but barely delivered until last Friday's upheavals, have revealed a rich mixture of drama and political manoeuvring. Now, the four biggest public-sector groups, IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA, are to be transformed into joint stock companies, and their bloated, politicised boards of directors slimmed to just three members. Only last month, sceptics still doubted whether the government of Mr Giuliano Amato would be willing, or able, to adopt unpopular measures to cut the budget deficit by reducing spending and raising revenue through such unorthodox methods as big privatisations. Mr Amato's key economics team - Mr Piero Barucci at the Treasury, Mr Franco Reviglio at the Budget Ministry and Mr Giovanni Goria at Finance  - smacked too much of political placemen. Though Mr Barucci and Mr Reviglio were presented as apolitical 'technicians', both owed their recent careers to Christian Democrat and Socialist links respectively. But instead of maintaining the status quo, the government has surprised Italians by initiating a string of innovations within its first month of office. Efim, the heavily loss-making and disastrously managed state holding company, is being liquidated; the scala mobile wage indexation system is being laid to rest; pensions are set for reform; and privatisation is now under way. Observers are right to remain cautious. The speed of change has been partly dictated by a foreign exchange crisis, which saw the lira plummet against the D-Mark last month and obliged Mr Amato to demonstrate firm action on the deficit. Moreover some mistakes have been made: The Efim closure was poorly presented and creditor banks may still have some nasty surprises in store. Details of the system to replace the scala mobile will not be discussed until September, when workers may take to the streets in protest. Changes to the pension system, too tame for many economists, are in danger of being watered down. And some politicians are still fighting a rearguard action to limit privatisation. That ingrained resistance to change may explain why so many of the government's policies have appeared hurried and been badly presented, or, in the case of the original privatisation plan, overturned. With widespread opposition to change among the Socialists and especially the Christian Democrats, Mr Amato has had to use surprise. The original concept of two 'superholdings' is believed to have been deliberately tossed into the closing minutes of a Friday night cabinet meeting virtually as an afterthought. Scribbled on a couple of scraps of paper just before the meeting, the superholdings were given the go-ahead before many ministers knew quite how much was at stake. Although the format has been scrapped, it is now too late to stop the privatisation ball rolling. The proposal to close Efim, which has debts of almost twice its annual revenues, was also presented to the cabinet as a surprise. 'Do you really think that, after so many false starts, it would have got through this time if it had been presented formally, discussed in the cabinet and passed on to the parties for comment?' asks one senior official. Even Friday's shareholders' meetings of the big four state companies verged on farce, as the assemblies were convened, postponed until the afternoon, then re-opened and put off once more as the four chairmen were summoned to the Industry Ministry. Some ministers admit the government is walking a tightrope in taking controversial measures which could provoke a defeat in parliament. However, Mr Amato, whose government is based on a wafer-thin 16-seat majority in the lower house of parliament, has deftly played the card of new elections to strengthen his hand. Bringing down Mr Amato would probably lead to a new, interim government, headed by an institutional figure such as Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the veteran leader of the Senate, followed by new elections in a few months. Few MPs relish the prospect of new polls. In northern Italy, the populist Leagues are poised to increase their share of the vote at the expense of the Christian Democrats and Socialists, who have been tainted by revelations of political corruption in Milan and other cities. The scandal has also closed illegal sources of funds which many politicians have come to rely on. 'I appreciate the government may not last until Christmas,' one minister said last week. 'But don't you think we've achieved a lot already? We've done more in four weeks than others in years.' The process has already shed light on corners of the public sector where transparency has been lacking. Transforming IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA into joint stock companies has revealed many anomalies. IRI's consolidated debt, exposed by its change in legal status, is now so high as to threaten its ability under Italian law to issue further bonds. The problem should be overcome by a revaluation of its portfolio of subsidiaries and possibly by the transfer of some debt to the Treasury, but the blow to IRI's prestige has been severe. The transformations also require salaries to be set for the chairmen. The big state holding companies are wary of disclosing how much chairmen earn. Publication of the salaries of IRI's Mr Franco Nobili and ENI's Mr Gabriele Cagliari in the Official Gazette reveals only a modest income. However, the official figures reflect only part of the total packages, with the remainder made up of a variety of benefits, including expenses. Preliminary inquiries by the Treasury before setting the new levels were frostily received by the state-sector groups. It is rumoured that only when the Treasury threatened to take the official figures for adoption in the companies' new statutes were the full packages revealed. Such vignettes give a taste of the problems facing Mr Amato and his team. Last week's changes to the public-sector groups shows that, slowly, some are being resolved.

In the aftermath of the St. Kitts-Nevis labour  party-organised demonstration, police confirmed numerous reports  of damage to property due to fire and other causes. The damage  includes some 20,000 tons of sugarcane destroyed by fire in the  island's sugar belt.    Desmond Mallalieu, general manager of the St. Kitts Sugar  Manufacturing Corporation (SSMC), said with harvesting of the  1994 crop not yet underway, some of the burnt cane will be lost  due to spoilage. Fire also gutted an unoccupied wooden building  -- the property of the National Caribbean Insurance Company --  close to government headquarters, scene of the demonstration. A  primary school, run by the Methodist Church, was also burnt.    Informed sources have indicated that damage to government  headquarters itself where several windows were smashed, could be  in the region of 3,000 dollars (one EC dollar = 37 cents U.S.).  The state car used to transport the governor general suffered  damage to the extent of 10,000 dollars, officials said. The  vehicle was extensively damaged while it was parked in the  garage at government headquarters. Police investigations are  continuing.    Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy Simmonds has termed the  demonstration a "disgrace and a discredit" to all those who  participated in it. Simmonds said it is clear from last month's  experience that such lawlessness can do great harm to the  economy and affect the lives and livelihood of people in every  sector of society. A state of emergency was imposed here on  December 2 after opposition supporters rioted following the  installation of the Simmonds-led coalition which won five of the  11 parliamentary seats in general elections on November 29.    Simmonds said he was pleased that his party supporters who  came out to cheer their representatives, had behaved admirably,  had obeyed police instructions, and did not get into any  confrontation with Labour Party supporters or the police.</p>

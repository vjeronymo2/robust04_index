			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHUDDER BUG;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM PHOTOGRAPHER EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF LIGHT SOURCES TO CREATE  OFTEN-HAUNTING COLOR IMAGES  </P> <P> John Hesketh's photographs can give you a very eerie feeling.  </P> <P> By day, the 34-year-old Anaheim resident puts together audio-visual slide shows  for conservative Orange County businesses.  </P> <P> But by night, he creates strikingly bizarre color images, using light sources  that range from fluorescent fixtures and late-model television tubes to  camp-store flashlights and open fires.  </P> <P> Using a 1950s Speed Graphic press camera mounted securely on a bulky tripod, he  leaves the shutter open for time exposures of more than an hour as he walks in  and out of the area framed by the lens, using his various light sources to  illuminate -- or "paint" -- various props.  </P> <P> The different kinds of light leave different imprints, or "strokes" (he uses a  laser light to do fine detail work). He varies the colors by using different  filters.  </P> <P> The props themselves tend to be simple things: an old ladder, a white picket  fence, a rusty blue chair. But the 16-by-20-inch prints that result can be  unsettling. One of the most graphic shows a face (actually one of Hesketh's  neighbors) in a deathly pose, partially covered by a white cloth, "emerging"  from a dark green pool table.  </P> <P> "The images come off more threatening than they really are," Hesketh insists.  "When you get close to them, they start to soften up. You can start identifying  with them."  </P> <P> (He also said he has found that people gain more appreciation for the work once  they realize that the images weren't created in a darkroom, but right in front  of the camera.)  </P> <P> Still, he continues, "I'm really surprised by how people are affected by them.  Or what people bring to the pieces. They bring a lot of their own experiences  to them. In fact, they will actually interpret things into them that I have  never thought of."  </P> <P> Not that hidden meanings are never intended.  </P> <P> "Ascension," one of several works on view at the Cypress College Photo Gallery  through Sept. 15, is a ghostly image of a wheelchair with an empty pair of red  shoes and a series of feet making their way to a ladder. A shadowy figure lurks  in the background.  </P> <P> " 'Ascension' came out of an inspiration where I had the passing of an aunt who  was basically like my grandmother," Hesketh said.  </P> <P> "I had stored her wheelchair away at my home. In one of those moments of trying  to figure out things to do, I pulled out the wheelchair and ladder."  </P> <P> He already had done some preliminary work involving the idea of feet going up a  ladder and had come to think of it in terms of death and ascension.  </P> <P> "People see the wheelchair (in the finished work) and say they have relatives  who are wheelchair-bound and that's the only way they are going to walk through  this passage of death."  </P> <P> Another ghostly image at Cypress is "Self Portrait," a simple chair that, when  starkly lit from above, takes on the appearance of an electric chair. Hesketh  used his light source to "paint" his arms and feet into the image.  </P> <P> Hesketh's work is not without humor, however. He takes pokes at suburbia with  such pieces as "A Visit With the In-Laws," which shows a patio chair, a  barbecue and two old-model television sets, and "Anxious Flamingo," a view of a  bright pink flamingo poised in front of a white picket fence.  </P> <P> Still, let the viewer beware.  </P> <P>  "Dangerous Images," a collection of photographs by John Hesketh, remains on  view through next Friday at the Cypress College Photo Gallery, Technical  Education I Building, 9200 Valley View St., Cypress. Hours: 8 a.m to noon  Friday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Admission: free.  Information: (714) 826-2220, Ext. 244.  </P> <P>  Seven new works by Hesketh will be included in the "Outside Influences," an  exhibit opening Thursday at the John Thomas Gallery, 602 Colorado Ave., Santa  Monica, and continuing through Oct. 28. Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays  through Saturdays. Admission: free. Information: (213) 396-6096.  </P> <P> </P></p>

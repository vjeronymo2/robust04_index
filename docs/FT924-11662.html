			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: A Pre-Raphaelite abroad AMONG casualties in the great shift against Victorian taste early this century, Burne-Jones was a spectacular artistic victim. 'Love and the Pilgrim', now in the Tate Gallery, sold for Pounds 5,775 in 1898, Pounds 210 in 1933 and was bought in at Christie's in 1942 for Pounds 21. Yet when the English tide was already turning against him in the 1900s, Burne-Jones was still lauded in Europe. Of the Victorian painters, he set himself most apart from the naturalistic school, and his symbolic forms and sometimes near-abstract motifs appealed first to French and Belgian symbolists, then to European art nouveau designers, and later had an important effect on Picasso and Kandinsky. His biggest literary fan was Proust, whose characters in Jean Santeuil plastered their walls with Burne-Jones reproductions. It is the European connection that the British Council celebrates in its touring exhibition of the artist's drawings, the first solo Burne-Jones show ever seen outside the UK. It opened in Nantes to coincide with a Burne-Jones acquisition; at Charleroi, outside Brussels, it emphasised the symbolist links with comparisons of drawings by Burne-Jones and Belgian symbolist Fernand Khnopff; and at Nancy, art nouveau capital of France, where the show has just arrived, it trumpets the influence on art nouveau architecture and interior design. Like many Victorians, Burne-Jones reacted against his times. 'Then science became materialist, and then I painted angels,' he said. But while artists such as Leighton escaped into paradisical fictions, Burne-Jones depicted contemporary conflicts in symbolic language. His mythological figures are desperate, contorted creatures; in the drawings they are running, fleeing, cowering in terror. In an Aenead illustration, shipwrecked women, bodies, legs, gowns, hair hurtle across each other in panic. In the Merlin studies, the convoluted, swirling movement of robes and drapes conveys the agony of the half-drawn bodies beneath. Repeatedly, in sketches of Dido, of Chaucer's heroines, figures twist away, heads turn from the viewer, looking down, out of the picture; one is blindfold. Where there counterparts in oil remain remote, ethereal, the pencil and chalk portraits are intimate, suggestive of personality, tenderness. In one, Burne-Jones mistress Marie Zambaco as Chaucer's Phyllis, swerves from our glance in a deliberately distancing pose even as her elusive melancholy tempts us back. The head of the pilgrim in a study for 'Love and the Pilgrim' has fleshy androgynous features, the averted eye wide open and confused. The inner mood is hinted at; here is a human type rather than the black-clad allegory in the painting. Khnopff, who sought to paint the 'invisible' admired above all Burne-Jones precise expression of myth and sentiment. The most potent drawings date from the 1870s when Burne-Jones developed the 'quattrocento' style of highly wrought, multi-toned pencil works such as the studies for Merlin and the Mirror of Venus here. Several display his obsession with Renaissance hairstyles, locks tensely plaited, twisted, swathed about the head, which he copied from Leonardo and Michelangelo. (He once took opera glasses to the Sistine Chapel, 'folded his railway rug thickly, and lying down on his back, read the ceiling from beginning to end.') By the 1890s, the lines are broader, there is a new softness in the head studies, especially those in red chalk. One of the plums at Charleroi is a dreamy late 'Study of a Woman' from a private collection, inscribed to Khnopff, shown alongside Khnopff's similar 'Study of a Sphinx' dedicated to Burne-Jones. Khnopff called himself a 'co-reveur des pre-Raphaelites anglais'. This show casts a doubly illuminating focus on Burne-Jones. A spotlight on the drawings, more stylised and decorative, less dynamic, than the paintings, goes to the heart of the artist's aims and vision, giving a closer insight into his personality. Second, seeing the drawings in a foreign context in which they were influential, raises questions about the Victorian role in European art history and suggests that had Burne-Jones and the pre-Raphaelites been appreciated at home early this century, rather than seen as an aberration of the 19th century psyche, the British might have more easily welcomed the European modern movement. At the Musee des Beaux-arts, Nancy, October 20 to December 21.</p>

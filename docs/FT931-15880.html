			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / US carmakers attack Japan's quota freeze US CARMAKERS yesterday launched a fierce attack on Japan's decision not to reduce the number of cars it exports to the US under a voluntary restraint agreement. Tokyo's announcement that it would freeze the quota at last year's level of 1.65m units showed it was 'not very concerned' about lowering its trade surplus with the US, said Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of Ford. In a joint offensive with the chief executives of General Motors and Chrysler, Mr Poling said the US was facing 'a critical time for our nation'. The world trading system could not survive if one country 'sought to achieve economic superpower status at the expense of other countries', said Mr Poling. The quota announcement coincided with the release of a US Commerce Department forecast that the US is likely to see a 9.5 per cent increase to Dollars 21.9bn (Pounds 14.4bn) in the deficit this year in car and car parts trade with Japan. Japan reduced the quota from 2.3m units to 1.65m units in 1991 but the US car industry has been looking for further cuts, arguing that the figure had become meaningless as it did not take into account the US production capacity of Japanese makers. US car industry leaders were encouraged by meeting President-elect Bill Clinton this week and believe his administration offers a great opportunity to intensify pressure on Japan to reduce the US trade deficit. They urged the US to take moves to: Demand equal access to foreign markets for US-made goods and services, and take action if this access is denied. Implement laws to prevent 'predatory practices by foreign competitors'. Co-ordinate economic and regulatory policies to assure the competitiveness of US industries in world markets. Mr Poling called for Japan to take action to reduce its trade surplus with the US from Dollars 43bn now to Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn over the next five years. Automative trade alone presently accounts for around Dollars 33bn of the Japanese surplus. Excess capacity in the world vehicle industry now stood at around 11m units, claimed Mr Poling, while production capacity in Japan exceeded home market demand by more than 100 per cent. Japan and the European Community had agreed to limit Japanese market share increases in Europe, warned Mr Poling, so excess world capacity would be 'directed towards the US market at the further expense of US jobs' if the US market continued to be the 'most open market in the world'. Japan's open markets remained among the most closed in the world, he said. The Japan Automobile Importers' Association said imported vehicle sales fell 7.7 per cent last year to 184,615 units, the second consecutive year of decline, Robert Thomson writes. Total sales in the Japanese market fell 7.2 per cent to 5.3m units. Sales of US-made cars rose 23.1 per cent, but the largest increase was in imports of Japanese makers' vehicles. Ford Motor sales rose 15 per cent and Chrysler's 7.4 per cent but GM's sales declined by 1.9 per cent.</p>

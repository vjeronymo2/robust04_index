Moravcik, who was yesterday entrusted by President Michal  Kovac with the creation of a new government, said he expected  that the new Slovak government would be made known "by Thursday  at the latest."    He emphasized that the new government would have to  concentrate on the decisive area of the economy. "In the economy  we have to ensure that an end is put to some negative trends,  which are not yet appearing, and to lay the foundations for the  new government, which after the elections will be able to  develop these foundations," Moravcik said.    He also indicated that his government would have to take  several unpopular measures. "We have to introduce a realistic  picture of Slovakia, especially of the economy. When people  take such a picture as the reality, they will understand the  measures which are unavoidable to ensure the development of a  society with good prospects after the new elections," Moravcik  said.    Moravcik declined to give the names of the candidates for  the  ministries, because talks with them were not yet over and it was  necessary to give the president space to decide and confirm the  nominations. "Publishing the nominations would be a form of  pressure on the president," he said.    "Nothing of good quality is born easily and simply, and thus  the composition of the government, too, will be the result of  fairly complicated talks," Moravcik said about the course of  negotiations between the five parties which decided the fall of  Meciar's government. At the same time he announced that the new  coalition had already decided on the foreign minister, but did  not reveal his name.    Moravcik said that during the creation of the government the  emphasis was being put on the expertise of its members. The  nascent government coalition did not intend to correct the "very  unusual" decision made by Meciar to recall all the state  secretaries, but it did intend this week to prepare nominations  for these posts.    The next premier also admitted that there would be further  changes. "At lower stages of the state administration, too, we  are interested in respecting expertise, and from this point of  view we have to make some changes, of which there might be quite  a few," he said.</p>

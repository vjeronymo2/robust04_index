			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Afik Velimetov, chief economist of the </F> Azerbaijan Publishing House, by Rustam Aliyev, BAKINSKIY  RABOCHIY correspondent; date and place not given: "Improvements  Have Been Noticed; Problems Remain"]    [Text] The Azerbaijan Publishing House, the  republic's largest printing facility, has recently been  experiencing very difficult times. The severance of economic  ties; the sharp jump in prices for printing materials imported  into the republic, primarily from Russia; and other  market-related expenses have created quite a few problems. As a  result, the regularity with which many newspapers are published  has been disrupted, prices for publishing services have  increased almost every month, and the printing rendition and  quality of the printed product have sharply fallen. The subject  of the interview "How They Have Robbed 'Azerbaijan,'" with the  publishing house's general director, which was published in  BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY and KHALG GAZETI on the first of April of  this year, concerned these and many other aspects of the  publishing house's activity.    "How are things today with the publishing house? What  has changed since its transfer to management by the  Administration of Affairs in the president's staff?" The  conversation of our correspondent with Afik Velimetov, chief  economist of the Azerbaijan Publishing House, began with these  questions.    [Velimetov] In my opinion, this year should be the decisive  one in the publishing house's emergence from its protracted  crisis. The first quarter results inspire optimism and are  witness to the fact that, in the main, the path selected to  overcome the combination of problems is the correct one. I will  not make unsubstantiated statements; I will cite concrete facts.  Thus, the profit that remained at the publishing house's  disposal during that quarter is almost twice as much as that  which all of last year brought us. Whereas our debt to the bank  was 70.1 million manats on 1 January, it does not exceed 18  million manats today, despite the enormous inflation and the  increase in bank interest for loans.    [Aliyev] How have you managed to achieve these changes?  Perhaps the delivery of printing materials has been normalized?    [Velimetov] No, it is just the opposite. Deliveries have not  only been reduced, but the prices for these materials have  increased sharply. Moreover, as before, questions connected with  exchanging the manat for rubles have not been solved, and  transportation expenditures and customs duties have increased,  in particular, for products imported into the republic from  Russia. As I have already pointed out, however, a certain  improvement is being observed in the publishing house's  financial and economic activity. The fact that we were able to  forecast future difficulties awaiting our printing trade has  helped us prepare somehow for them.    First, we oriented and mobilized the collective and our  printing capabilities to the production of so-called cultural  and personal goods and consumer goods. In particular, we  expanded publication of the products list of goods absent in the  market. In particular, we organized the production of school  notebooks and textbooks. An increase in management and  production discipline helped us establish economic effectiveness  for each order more carefully. This decreased expenditures per  one manat of commodity output from last year's level of 96  gyapiks to 61 gyapiks by the end of the first quarter. In  addition, we organized businesslike and mutually beneficial  relations with the republic's book publishers.    [Aliyev] Did not all of this reflect adversely on the  publication of newspapers?    [Velimetov] I ask that you direct your attention to the fact  that our prices for printing newspapers and for newsprint has  not changed since January, that is, we were somehow able to  stabilize the prices for the publishing house's main type of  activity--providing typographic services for newspaper  production, which occupied approximately 80 percent of our total  commodity volume for years. Now, the percentage of newspaper  production does not exceed 50 percent.    [Aliyev] Perhaps, it has become unprofitable for you to  publish newspapers?    [Velimetov] I would not say that.... The drop in the  percentage of newspaper production is connected with the  reduction in the circulation of periodicals; this is  unprofitable and inefficient from an economic point of view.  That is why we are introducing practical adjustments in the list  of published products. This is a demand of the times and the  meaning of market relations--for example, having analyzed the  situation, we increased our attention toward the production of  book items.    [Aliyev] It is rumored that a new landslide-type increase in  prices for the publishing of newspapers is coming in the near  future--as has previously occurred repeatedly....    [Velimetov] I think that a landslide-like increase in prices  will not occur, although there is still no complete guarantee of  this. We are following a reasonable pricing policy, as the  market demands. In cases where the publishing house's  capabilities permit stable prices for the publication of  newspaper products to be maintained, prices will remain the same.    If the trend toward further increasing prices for printing  materials is maintained, this naturally will force us also to  increase their wholesale cost, since it is impossible to forget  about the interests of the publishing house and its collective,  which we are obliged to protect. However, there are factors that  are independent of us; these are an increase in energy rates,  raw material imported from Russia, and so on.    [Aliyev] Many newspapers are today not being published in  general. Is this not connected with the toughening of the  publishing house's economic policy?    [Velimetov] For a long time, quite a few newspapers were  published....on credit, violating the production contract with  the publishing house. It came down to the fact that the  editorial boards' total incurred debt to the publishing house  reached the half-billion (in rubles) mark. This put the normal  existence of the publishing house itself in doubt. It was  necessary to toughen the economic interrelationships with the  debtor editorial boards, since it was simply impossible for us  and for them to work this way any longer. Of course,  dissatisfied people appeared, but we withstood the pressure.    Incidentally, thanks to this completely fair policy, we are  managing to raise wages and, at the same time, distribute them.  Moreover, many other social problems, whose realization is more  than an enterprise can afford today, are being solved--for  example, we are planning to lay the foundation of a nine-storey  apartment house for our workers this year. We are planning to  repair the main building of the publishing house, and much more.  A preliminary plan for establishing a vacation area in  Absheronskiy Rayon for printing workers exists. As they say,  Allah will smile as soon as the war ends....    [Aliyev] In your view, were the first quarter's positive  results achieved exclusively thanks to the toughening of  relations with your partners?    [Velimetov] Of course not. This is the beginning of the  implementation of a long-term program based on the effective use  of the experience acquired by the collective, efficient  operation of equipment, savings in expenditures of raw material  and materials, strict production and management discipline, and,  the most important thing, the accurate construction of relations  with partners and customers--in a word, the realization of all  components making up normal market relations.    I will also talk about something else in this connection. A  joint enterprise with Russia, which will supply the publishing  house with printing materials, is now in the founding stage; we  hope that it will start operating in the very near future. Let  us say right out that we are placing rather large hopes on this  joint enterprise.    In addition, we have established a motor transport  enterprise, which engages in all repair and maintenance work and  provides services to the population, on the basis of the  publishing house's garage. Incidentally, we would like to report  that the publishing house allocated R96 million last year to  cover the financial losses connected with motor transport  servicing of the editorial boards. One cannot resign oneself to  this situation in the future; that is why we have established an  independent enterprise having the rights of a juridical person,  which will be financed through its own activity. In the future,  the publishing house will receive a percentage of its profit.    [Aliyev] It is known that many enterprises have not been  distributing wages for months, that some are completely idle,  due to a lack of materials and raw materials and, moreover, that  they have recently resorted to such actions, which you know  about, as a reduction in workers. Will this not apply also to  the publishing house?    [Velimetov] Considering the present slump in production  everywhere, perhaps a reduction in production and management  personnel should follow in accordance with the severe laws of a  market economy. However, we are not pursuing such a goal, since  we are trying to carry out market reforms with consideration  given to the human factor. Moreover, as I have already pointed  out, despite all difficulties, we are finding capabilities to  increase wages regularly, pay a 13th wage, and so on.    [Aliyev] In conclusion, let us return to the recent  interview  "How They Have Robbed 'Azerbaijan,'" with the publishing house's  general director. In particular, it was pointed out there that  up to 25 commercial structures, which have practically not  yielded any returns, were functioning in the publishing house in  an incomprehensible manner.    [Velimetov] Since that time, we have been able to free  ourselves from many commercial organizations that were  unprofitable for the publishing house. In particular, we parted  with ones like the Milli Dastan Theater, Topaz, Tidzharet,  Ulduz, the Torpag Store Fund, Gyulzar, Elzar, Agdam, Araz-9,  Karvan, and Khazar-1. Legally sound documents to cancel  contracts are still being prepared for some, in order to use the  areas occupied by them more efficiently.    It seems that if we should, for example, delay for half a  year the implementation of the mentioned measures, the  Azerbaijan publishing house would "fall ill" for a long time....  Naturally, it is very difficult to solve in a short time all the  problems that have accumulated; of course, time is required to  do this. I would like to believe that it will work for us and,  consequently, for the good of the republic also.</p>

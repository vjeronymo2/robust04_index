			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Roch Marc Christian Kabore today  gave an answer to labor unions' counterproposals. The  government said that it was unable to meet the demands made by  the unions. Here with the details is Newton Ahmed Barry:    [Barry] The demands made by the labor unions in response to  the 5 April government responses are threefold:    The first group, including 13 labor unions, reduced their  demands. Regarding salary increases, Group-13 is proposing a 15  percent increase instead of the previously demanded 40-50  percent. Regarding the price of rice and fuel, this group is  asking for a 10-percent reduction. Group-13 supports the  exemption of the value added tax on water and electricity  consumption -- up to 50 cubic meters for water and 150 kw for  electricity -- as proposed by the government, but expressed  concern with the increase in the price of a cubic meter of  water. Therefore, the group still demands that FASOYA  [expansion unknown] be reactivated and that the crisis facing  small-scale businessmen be solved. Group-6, which is led by the  TGCB [expansion unknown] maintains its demands in their entirety  -- a 50 percent increase in salaries, the reestablishment of  pre-CFA devaluation prices for rice, fuel, gas, and drugs.    The only labor union that did not answer the government's  call for counterproposals was the CSP [expansion unknown]. The  prime minister stated that he was safisfied with the labor  unions quick answer to the proposals, but regretted that because  of budgetary constraints, the government was unable to meet any  of the demands. The dialogue has not been disrupted, other  avenues are still open, and the government will hold  consultations with social partners over the coming days.  [passage omitted]</p>

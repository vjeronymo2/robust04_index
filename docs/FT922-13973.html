			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Frustrated US senator to quit GROWING frustration with the deadlock that afflicts the US government has driven another senator to announce that he will not seek re-election in November. Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado said yesterday he would retire from Congress, where he has sat for 12 years in the House of Representatives and another six in the Senate. He said his decision was prompted by personal anger and frustration at the stalemate between a president who he believed would not lead and a Congress which he found to be stymied by short-term political manoeuvring. Seven other senators will be leaving Congress after the November elections. Some have been forced out - Senator Alan Dixon of Illinois was defeated in a primary; Senators Alan Cranston of California and Brock Adams of Washington faced attacks on their ethics. But others, including the widely respected Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, have given up the struggle for the same reasons as those mentioned by Mr Wirth.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1615 GMT on 28 February carries a 30-minute  documentary entitled "Being a Foreigner." This is the first  installment of a three-part documentary series on Soviet  intelligence agents working abroad. Part one is labelled "Line  N."    The program begins with an interview with G. M.  Nechiporenko,  a former KGB colonel, who spoke about his 40-year career in  intelligence work. He says that in the Soviet era, illegal  intelligence activities were called "Line N," and the methods  used were always the same, that all intelligence operatives  carried out the tasks given to them by "the state machine."    The program next shows the shadowy figure of a man seen in  profile, speaking in accented Russian about his career. A  caption on his image says that former Soviet intelligence agents  were filmed for this program.    The documentary next gives some historical background on  Soviet intelligence operatives employed under Stalin, and gives  the histories of several, including Rudolf Abel, who worked in  the United States, a man with the pseudonym "Ben", who spied on  the British nuclear submarine program, and "Sam" and "Julietta",  a married couple working abroad.    Yuriy Drozdov, a major-general in the KGB and the former  head  of illegal intelligence, is interviewed next. He discusses the  types of people who worked for him, and he says that one person  was "even a foreign ambassador in another foreign state." Next  there is a clip from an interview with George Blake, who is  captioned as a "former agent for British, then Soviet  intelligence." Later, there is a profile of Pavel Sudoplatov,  who was the former head of the KGB's Fourth Directorate in  charge of sabotage.    The next section of the documentary concerns the  assassination of Trotskiy by the First Main Directorate of the  NKVD, the former Soviet intelligence organization. This is  followed by Colonel Nechiporenko talking about his work in  Leipzig, and he claims that the KGB would use Leipzig as a ford  for getting spies into the West, and that Germany was used as a  training ground. This is followed by Abel, "Sam," and  "Julietta" discussing their history and their methods of  tradecraft.    At 1605 GMT on 9 March, Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian shows part two of the "Being a Foreigner" documentary  series. This 30-minute part is called "Born in the Cemetery."    At the start of this program, KGB Colonel Gleb Nechiporenko  speaks about the need to provide a spy with a complete false  background identity including date of birth, place of birth,  schooling, education, marriage, relatives, etc. This  information is gleaned from old newspapers, library records, and  gravestones. The narrator then goes on to mention briefly the  false identities used by various Soviet illegals. Abel used the  identity of the American Emile Goldfus; "Ben" used the identity  of a Canadian Gordon Lonsdale; Peter Kroger obtained his  identity in a New Zealand cemetery; "Sam" and "Julietta" changed  their places of residence and birthplaces several times. Only  the mysterious (?Ramzay), the code name for Richard Sorge, was  born in the actual place where he claimed to be.    Next, there are brief interviews with Boris Gudz, a former  counter-intelligence agent, Major-General Mikhail Ivanov, and  KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Popov who recall the case of the Soviet  illegal Richard Sorge. Footage shown of decoded messages to the  Red Army from Richard Sorge signed "Ramzay". Sorge had been  trusted by the Germans despite the fact that he did not conceal  that he was born in Baku and had worked for the Comintern. Nor  was Sorge suspected by the Japanese, since he was working for  their fascist ally. The operation involving Richard Sorge's  work as an illegal had been carefully planned in advance,  including the fact that his name had not been changed.    Brief screen interviews follow with Mikhail Fedorov, "Sam",  and Galina Fedorova, "Julietta", who claim that their activity  is not immoral. Next, Gleb Nechiporenko's younger brother, Oleg  Nechiporenko, who is also an intelligence operative, is  profiled. The narrator says that he was once regarded by the CIA  as one of the best KGB operatives in South America. The  narrator also says that shortly before the assassination of  President Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Soviet Embassy  and sought permission to leave Mexico for the USSR and that Oleg  was one of the last diplomats to see Oswald. Historical  information on Oswald is presented.    To conclude the second part of the series, several KGB  officials discuss tradecraft, especially false documentation.    The third and final part of the documentary series "Being a  Foreigner" is broadcast by Moscow Russian Television in Russian  at 1615 GMT on 11 March. This 30-minute part is entitled "After  the Legend."    To open, a pipe-smoking figure shown in profile says that  simple things like the way one cooks are used to convince people  that you are the nationality you claim to be as an illegal. He  adds that it is a very rare thing for people to speak a foreign  language without some kind of accent. Gleb Nechiporenko then is  shown, and he displays various airport stamps used in forging  documents. He shows examples of various airport stamps and a  forged GDR passport visa. He is shown practicing the forgery of  a signature.    Nechiporenko says the intelligence services were engaged in  the aftermath of the 1956 events in Hungary. Throughout the  world footage and photographs of those events by Western  journalists were studied closely to bring culprits to book.  Nechiporenko denies any idea that this was an improper task for  intelligence services to be engaged on.    The documentary then returns to the subject of tradecraft.  This includes brief interviews with the Fedorovs, "Sam" and  "Julietta". It then shows that Gleb Nechiporenko served as a  vice consul in London, where he was also worked in intelligence.  His tasks could include purchasing several English hats, for  instance, for use by illegals. Asked what kind of person he  would want to send to Britain to work as an illegal,  Nechiporenko said he would not send someone to pose as an  Englishman. That would be too risky. He would send someone  with excellent English but whose accent would not be suspect.  For instance he could be a person with an American passport  hailing from Latin America, for whom a slight accent would be  natural.    Next, further historical background in given on the case of  Rudolf Abel. Pavel Sudoplatov is shown in a cemetery viewing  Rudolf Abel's gravestone, which also bears his other name  "Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher". Evelina Fisher, Rudolf Abel's  daughter, is briefly interviewed.    KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Popov explains that illegals were  dispatched to America during the fifties to be there in case  there should be a war. KGB Maj.-Gen. Yuriy Drozdov, who was  formerly the head of illegal intelligence, recalls how Abel was  betrayed and arrested. Next, Western footage of various arrested  Soviet illegals, including Klaus Fuchs, is shown. Evelina  Fisher, Abel's daughter, says that her father considered a long  absence when he was recalled to the Soviet Union in 1955 as one  of the reasons for his downfall. He regarded a second return to  America as dangerous in itself. Sudoplatov says that the mistake  was that Abel returned to his studio for money. The 1962  exchange of Abel for Gary Powers in Germany is then discussed.  Drozdov recalls how the actual exchange took place.  Afterwards, exchanges were handled differently, and footage  shows the Krogers boarding an aircraft. One big difference with  this exchange was in the publicity given in the West and East.  The Krogers's departure was extensively covered in the West, but  no photographers were around to cover their arrival in Moscow.  Greville Wynne's arrival by air in the West was widely  publicized, but the arrival of Lonsdale, or Molody,as he was  also known, went unpublicized in Moscow.    The next part of the documentary deals with how the  technology has changed, but the tasks remain the same. Gleb and  Oleg Nechiporenko speak about hidden weapon caches. The  narrator recalls the details of the Lonsdale spy case in which  Houghton and others passed on top secret British naval data to  "Ben", otherwise known as Lonsdale and Molody. KGB Colonel  Yuriy Mostinskiy explains that after the return home of  ex-illegals, attention is paid to their spiritual welfare and  efforts are made to make use of the knowledge they have of the  opponents' counterintelligence methods. The narrator says that  very often these illegals pay a high price for being engaged in  their work. Sorge was hanged, and others have undergone lengthy  terms of imprisonment. The documentary concludes with the  narrator saying that despite this, none of them have regretted  their work as illegals.</p>

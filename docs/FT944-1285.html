			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / People: Ivory &amp; Sime splits board responsibilities Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, is to reorganise its board, separating responsibility for the overall management of the company from responsibility for investment management. The split, involving the departure of six directors from the main board, follows the arrival as managing director designate of Colin Hook. Hook joined Ivory &amp; Sime last month from Caledonia Investments, the holding company controlled by the Cayzer family, which took a 29.9 per cent stake in Ivory &amp; Sime in July. He will formally replace Allan Munro as managing director on January 1. 'We want investment managers to be able to focus purely on fund management without having to worry about running a quoted company,' Hook says. The six departing directors will join Ivory &amp; Sime Investment Management, a hitherto dormant subsidiary. They are James Anderson, Richard Muckart, Richard Ramsay, Michael Woodward, Mark Tyndall and Ian Paterson Brown, each of whom supervises different investment sectors. That will leave a board of eight people, six of whom are non-executive, under David Newbigging, chairman. Munro will remain on the main board, though concentrating on fixed interest securities. Sir David Kinloch, a director of Caledonia Investment, joined the board in September.</p>

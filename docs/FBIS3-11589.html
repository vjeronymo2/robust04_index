			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luis Garasino: "Where is the Enemy?"] </F>   [Text] A seasoned foreign diplomat summed up the final  document of the OAS experts meeting -- the starting point for  the reformulation of the hemispheric security system -- held in  Buenos Aires last week in the following terms: "Modest, but  realistic."    The modesty and realism of the six recommendations drafted  by  diplomats and military from the Americas can be put down to the  nefarious legacy of the past, which consisted of a continental  security system designed on the basis of the existence of a cold  war and the division of the world into two blocs.    Many nations of the hemisphere, especially those having  democratic governments, cannot forget that the United States'  interventionist hegemony was enshrined in the region in the name  of anticommunism, and that to this effect, dictatorships of  different leanings were supported and coups d'etat by the  military encouraged.    Another sad heritage from those decades is the idea that the  OAS simply rubber stamps and follows Washington's policy  dictates. This explains the great reluctance evinced by some  delegations to approve any multilateral security program that  entails a limitation of their decisionmaking power.    It is an open secret that Brazil, for example, accepts  collaboration in aspects pertaining to bilateral and regional  security, but takes a stand against any scheme that seeks to go  beyond these limits.    Hernan Patino Mayer, Argentine ambassador to the OAS and  chairman of the Special Commission for Hemispheric Security,  played a crucial role, but his presentation propounding "an  all-encompassing" scheme was slashed to the necessary minimum  limits for reaching consensus.    Proposals for holding periodic meetings between defense  ministers from the hemisphere, turning the Inter-American  Defense Board into an advisory body to the Council, or  establishing a permanent center for solving conflicts, therefore  came to nothing.    One of the six recommendations that were finally approved  urges member countries "to regularly inform the appropriate OAS  organs about the implementation of measures to foster trust."    It seemed evident that the "intercourse" between Argentina  and the United States -- as well as the fact that the former's  Armed Forces are those that are most subordinated to the  political power of any in the region -- placed our country in a  special situation.    Nevertheless, there are those who think that an essential  stimulus is lacking for establishing a new security system --  the existence of a new common threat to the countries of the  Americas, an enemy whom at present nobody is in a position to  define.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Energy Policy: Energy Council To </F> Set Priorities for Future Action"; as released by Brussels  Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] Work proceeds apace towards the inclusion in the  Treaty of Maastricht of an explicit article on European energy  policy when the Treaty is reviewed in 1996. The EU [European  Union] Member States' energy bosses will be meeting officials  from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy  (DGXVII) on April 22 to study a text which will form the basis  of a Communication to be submitted to the EU Energy Council on  May 25, with the aim of feeding the energy policy debate. Their  deputies will be in Brussels on March 24 to go over an informal  version of the document with DGXVII. On the basis of the  Communication, the May 25 Council will strive to establish  energy policy priorities, on the basis of which the following  Energy Council, held under the German Presidency of the Council,  will be able to adopt working guidelines and energy policy  objectives for 2005. The next step will be to prepare a text  for inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty. DGXVII also expects to  publish its Annual Energy Review, analysing energy trends  throughout the world region by region, possibly as early as  April.  <H5>  De Facto Liberalisation </H5>   The forthcoming meetings with the top national civil  servants  working in the energy field are the first since September 30  last year, when the Commission, believing the Member States'  Directors-General for Energy had realised the international  energy market would not let them move in any direction other  than towards greater liberalisation, flexibility and  competitiveness, invited them to engage in informal talks  outside the framework of the routine attitudes customarily  expressed on energy matters.    This led to a debate centred on a macroeconomic and  policy-oriented discussion paper entitled "The European  Community: New Orientations in Energy -- The Economic  Foundations." The aim now is to conduct a much more analytical  examination of the supply side of the equation.    During the preparation of the Maastricht Treaty, the  proposed  text for an energy policy chapter was thrown out by the Member  States. This was due in part to a certain amount of last-minute  horse-trading but also stemmed from the Member States' belief  that the energy policy objectives set out in the draft text  submitted by DGXVII were too "irresponsible" to be acceptable.  Over the last two years, events have moved on, Commission  energy experts now believe, and while the Member States may not  yet accept wholeheartedly the need for competition on the EU's  captive Internal Market, they have generally acknowledged the  contradiction of playing their ultra-liberal cards abroad and  resisting liberalisation at home. In addition to changes in  their own domestic energy set-ups, European producers are  increasingly looking to invest in non-EU energy markets,  particularly in East Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where  they are forced to compete with other giants like the United  States and Japan at prices much closer to cost.    With the EU now much further along the Single Market road  and  the Delors White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment  providing an impetus to boost Europe's competitive position,  there is now a much clearer political base on which to attempt  the construction of a specific, coherent European energy  strategy.  <H5>  Investment Implications </H5>   The discussion paper on which the current round of talks is  based hammers home the point that the Union's energy demand  continues to grow and that its dependence on conventional  thermal power plants is likely to continue well into the 21st  century. In view of the long lead-times required to bring new  plant onstream, the implications for investment are important.  Investment decisions taken during the 1990's, particularly in  respect to electricity generation, will affect the energy sector  for the next 20-30 years. These effects will be very difficult  to reverse without enormous cost, the Commission warns.  <H5>  EU Energy Priorities </H5>   EU energy priorities, as DGXVII sees them, revolve around  the  need:     -  to get the white paper plans for major trans-European  energy networks on the rails;    -  to use the energy potential of the  Union's peripheral regions to best effect through greater  cohesion;    -  to sustain and develop European technological  expertise and more rational energy use, through such initiatives  as the Thermie demonstration programme;    -  to respect the EU's  environmental commitments, while continuing to guarantee the  security of energy supplies;    -  to diversify sources of supply away  from heavy dependence on the Middle East; and    -  to fulfill the  EU's responsibilities beyond its borders, particularly as  regards the economic and political stability of the transition  economies of East Europe. The completion of the pan-European  Energy Charter, whose next week-long plenary session begins on  March 7, is seen as a crucial element in this respect.  <H5>  Open Questions </H5>   While circumstances may now be more propitious to the  fully-fledged revival of the EU energy policy debate than they  were two years ago, the horizon is far from clear. The current  Commission's term of office is drawing to a close, as is that of  the European Parliament, whose say in energy matters increased  with the extra legislative powers brought by the Maastricht  Treaty. It also remains to be seen exactly on what terms  oil-rich Norway and the other three accession candidate  countries join the Union.    Security of supply remains a major bone of contention. In  fact, part of the Commission's thinking in establishing informal  top-level discussions with the Member States was to avoid  conducting the talks, for the time being, through the Council  Energy Working Group. The latter has a reputation for beginning  any debate on energy policy with the matter of security of  supply and then getting bogged down in interminable discussions  over how this relates to the principle of subsidiarity.    In this context, the question of specific EU-wide  arrangements for crisis management within the framework of  International Energy Authority action, still has to be  addressed. Discussions appear to be getting nowhere and the  subject has not figured on recent Energy Council agendas.  DGXVII officials are now saying former Energy Commissioner  Antonio Cardoso e Cunha was "mistakenly" understood to be  pressing for Community ownership of basic fuel stocks rather  than Community management of supplies. They acknowledge that to  be palatable to Member States, provisions for a distinct Union  safeguard mechanism will probably have to come out of the  proposal. On the other hand, the "U.S.-dominated" IEA has since  declared itself in favour of Union membership, somewhat tipping  the balance towards such a development. The trick now will be to  strike a happy medium between areas of Union and national Member  State competence.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: GEC active Turnover of 13m shares in GEC kept attention firmly fixed on the VSEL takeover saga, where the cash-laden electronics giant is a declared potential counter-bidder to the agreed offer made by British Aerospace for the submarines group. But most of the activity in GEC turned out to be tax rather than bid related, and the shares dipped 3 to 284p. A bed and breakfast deal involving 11.3m shares passed through the market at 278p. VSEL itself moved down 15 to 1300p while BAe lost 6 to 478p.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SYMPOSIUM SPOTLIGHTS U.S. HIGH-TECH DECLINE  </P> <P> Some of the most famous names in American engineering have spent the past two  days here debating a problem that has bedeviled policy makers for nearly a  decade: how to reverse the relative decline of America's high-technology  industries.  </P> <P> The occasion was a symposium marking the 25th anniversary of the National  Academy of Engineering, a privately funded, federally chartered organization  that is struggling to emerge from the shadow of its older sibling, the National  Academy of Sciences.  </P> <P> The NAE is currently working on a study of how the engineering community should  adapt to the globalization of technology, and this week's meeting at the Arnold  and Mabel Beckman Conference Center was designed to provide input for that  project.  </P> <P> But much of the discussion among the impressive array of industry, government  and academic leaders present focused specifically on how the United States can  stop the steady erosion of its leadership position in science and technology.  </P> <P> Thomas J. Murrin, deputy secretary of commerce, set the tone in his keynote  address, declaring that while international cooperation and free trade were all  well and good, "if our country wishes to assure both its economic and military  security, we have no choice but to make our own national interests our top  priority." While stopping short of specific recommendations, Murrin implied  that a more nationalistic approach to high technology should be incorporated  into trade and science policies.  </P> <P> Much of the early discussion, indeed, was focused on how to secure the elusive  "level playing field" that would allow U.S. industry to compete effectively  with the Japanese. The one point on which most participants agreed was that  something should be done about the high cost of borrowing money in this country  -- which would require the type of massive cut in the federal budget deficit  that has proved beyond the reach of policy makers.  </P> <P> Lewis M. Branscomb, director of the science, technology and public policy  program at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, addressed the  tension between national interests and corporate interests in the age of the  global economy. For example, a foreign company that manufactures many of its  products here may make a greater contribution to the U.S. economy than a  U.S.-based firm that builds most of its products overseas. In developing a  technology policy, Branscomb noted, government must take that paradox into  account.  </P> <P> And with prominent industrialists such as Hewlett-Packard Chairman David  Packard, Intel Corp. Chairman Gordon Moore and retired Unocal Chairman Fred  Hartley looking on, several speakers from industry then demonstrated just how  little consensus there is on what the United States should do about the  Japanese challenge.  </P> <P> Mary L. Good of Allied-Signal Inc. called for aggressive government-industry  action in countering Japanese competition, while Philip M. Condit of Boeing  Corp. emphasized that the United States can't win by "hiding behind trade  barriers or by attempting to protect highly perishable technologies."  </P> <P> There was more agreement on the second day of the meeting, when the discussion  turned to education and research and what the United States should do to make  its schools and universities more effective. National Science Foundation  director Erich Bloch pointed out that contrary to popular belief, expenditures  for scientific research at American universities continue to rise. Bloch said  that the budget squeeze being felt in many areas is due to increased  competition for existing resources, and that the complexity of contemporary  science demands more money and coordination.  </P> <P> "With the increase in scale of much research, especially inter-disciplinary  research and and university-industry research, there is great pressure to share  the costs of equipment -- and cooperation is cumbersome and time-consuming,"  Bloch said. He also criticized universities for putting too much emphasis on  research and not paying enough attention to undergraduate education.  </P> <P> University of California President David Gardner rejected criticism of the high  number of foreign students enrolled in university graduate programs in science  and engineering in the United States, and also defended the growing number of  university research programs that are sponsored in part by Japanese or other  foreign companies. "The focus of our concern," said Gardner, "should not be on  creating artificial barriers -- they won't work anyway -- but on fostering  cooperation between universities and their sponsors."  </P> <P> Gardner called for more emphasis on long-term research efforts, and said the  criterion for industry participation in university research should be the same  for foreign or domestic firms: all research results should be public, and the  university should own any research that emerges from joint projects.  </P> <P> And while all the speakers agreed that improving the overall quality of  education at all levels was critical to the nation's future, University of  Michigan President James J. Duderstadt focused specifically on the challenge  posed by the racial and ethnic changes in the makeup of the American  population.  </P> <P> He noted that universities were responsible for "reflecting the diversity of  the population and building models of pluralistic communities." He cited  statistics showing that the overwhelming majority of university graduates in  coming years would be minorities and women, and engineering and science  education in particular would have to adapt to that.  </P> <P> That observation was rather pointed, made as it was to a roomful of white men  representing the nation's science and engineering elite. The audience could  only nod in acknowledgement.  </P></p>

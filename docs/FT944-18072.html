			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Gotcha] Mirror Group lures MacKenzie to cable channel The Mirror Group nabbed Kelvin MacKenzie yesterday, hauling on board the former Sun editor who revelled for years in being rude about his tabloid competitor. Mr MacKenzie, with only seven months' television experience under his belt when he quit BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, in August, is joining the Mirror Group to head its budding television interests. They consist of a 20 per cent stake in Scottish Television and the promise to launch Live TV, a new cable channel, next year. The man famous for the 'Gotcha' headline on the sinking of the Belgrano during the Falklands war will report to Mr David Montgomery, Mirror Group's chief executive and a man over whom he has poured volumes of vitriol since they parted company at The Sun 13 years ago. The last time they worked in close proximity was at the Wapping headquarters of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International group, where they edited sister newspapers. Neither man was available for comment yesterday but they did contribute consecutive quotes to a press release: 'Kelvin is a major force in the British media and with his unique background and recent broadcasting experience will add dynamic leadership to our now well-developed framework for TV entry,' said Mr Montgomery. Mr MacKenzie, a man of famously pithy and often unprintable epithets, said: 'This is a terrific challenge and I can't wait to get on with it.' But forget the tele-strategy and synergy. Did Kelvin fire David 13 years ago at The Sun? Mr Sean Bellew, for the Mirror Group, said: 'David says that is simply not true. He was offered the assistant editorship of The People, so he left.' So why is Mr MacKenzie joining the Mirror? 'Kelvin has told me there is only one reason for life,' said Mr Roy Greenslade, former Sun assistant editor. 'Get Sam Chisholm.' Mr MacKenzie blamed his departure from BSkyB on a personality clash with Mr Chisholm, its chief executive. Mr MacKenzie was managing director and, according to colleagues, thought he would head BSkyB when Mr Chisholm assumed a broader role in Mr Murdoch's television empire. Given a common enemy, Mr MacKenzie and Mr Montgomery might be able to work together, a friend of both said yesterday. 'Kelvin does have a grudging respect for what David's done at the Mirror,' he said.

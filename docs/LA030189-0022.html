Oslin, who won two Grammys last week, kept the momentum going Tuesday when  she was nominated five times in the 24th annual Academy of Country Music  Awards. The singer-songwriter is up for "Hat" awards for female vocalist, album  of the year, single of the year ("I'll Always Come Back") and video of the year  (where she was named twice). George Strait, Kathy Mattea, Ricky Van Shelton,  Tanya Tucker, Dwight Yoakam, Reba McEntire and Hank Williams Jr. matched  perennial Grammy favorite Randy Travis with three nominations each. The Judds  and Alabama join Strait, Williams and Travis in the entertainer of the year  competition. Winners in the 11 categories will be presented in nationally  televised ceremonies on NBC from Burbank and Disneyland on April 10. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

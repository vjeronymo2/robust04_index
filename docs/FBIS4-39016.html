			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev report under the "Peacekeeping" rubric: </F> "Deputy Zatulin Pained at Federation Council's Abkhazia  Decision. Senators Have `No Details Explained' to Them"]    [Text] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma committee  for CIS affairs, had "nothing left but to express regret" at the  fact that President Yeltsin's call about the need to send to  Abkhazia a Russian peacekeeping contingent found no support in  the Federation Council on 2 June. At a specially called news  briefing yesterday, Mr. Zatulin discussed this regret and his  hope that this decision will not lead to an escalation of the  Georgia-Abkhazia conflict.    The Duma committee head, who on Thursday attended the upper  chamber sitting to discuss the president's call, said that  senators who voted against were guided mainly by three motives.  First, in Mr. Zatulin's words, many "were especially agitated  about sending Russian soldiers" to a zone of armed standoff (the  motive was called illogical, incompetent, and populist because  the participation of a Russian contingent in the peacekeeping  operation in Bosnia had been approved at one time). Second, the  senators feared additional outlays that may run to between 3-9  billion rubles. (Mr. Zatulin was told that the Federation  Council approved that same Thursday a proposal to increase the  budget expenditure side, and "why cry over spilt milk....")  Third, and which also played its role, was the fact that the  presence of soldiers even on Russia's territory -- the emergency  situation zone in Ossetia and Ingushetia -- has so far not been  very helpful in solving the crisis there. (Brushing aside this  argument, Mr. Zatulin said that had there been no troops, this,  as in fact any such conflict, would have been "even much more  bloody").    According to Konstantin Zatulin, an alternative to sending  CIS peacemaking forces to Abkhazia is the presence there of an  international UN contingent, for the participation in which  Turkey, Uruguay, and several more countries have already  applied. This, however, the committee chairman thinks, would  lead to Russia's losing influence in the region and the  declining authority and prestige of our country on the world  scene. Generally, Mr. Zatulin said, it is bad that the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs or the president's staff, who obviously  continue to regard the Federation Council as a chamber "loyal"  to the president, paid no due attention to the question and did  not properly explain everything to the senators. Mr. Zatulin,  however, is confident that following a recess in the chamber's  work, the senators will after all support the peacemaking  initiative of not Moscow alone but of also of Alma-Ata [Almaty],  Bishkek, Tashkent, Dushanbe, Yerevan, Baku, and even Tbilisi.</p>

Documents which shall be declassified date back to the  period  from 1940 to 1941 and from 1944 until March 11, 1990 when the  Lithuanian national statehood was restored.    The resolution says that documents containing Lithuanian  state secrets and which were listed separately, will not be  declassified for some time. Such documents concern former KGB  agents, KGB intelligence activities and some data pertaining to  communications, geodesy, civil defence and some other spheres.    The majority of documents, numbering around 520,000 and  which  are no longer secret, are kept in the archives of the former  Lithuanian Communist Party. Lithuanian ministries and  departments have been instructed to declassify documents in  their possession until may 1, 1994 and submit lists of these  documents to the board of the Lithuanian central archive.    Declassified documents will be available to anyone who  receives a corresponding letter of permission from the  organisation to which one belongs.</p>

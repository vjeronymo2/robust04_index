			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PIANISTS, BASSOONISTS FEATURED IN CHAMBER CONCERT AT GINDI  </P> <P> The slight variation from traditional programming that marked the third concert  of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society series on Monday night  was more an oddity than a genuine novelty.  </P> <P> The composer was one Arcady Dubensky, a Russian born in 1890 but dwelling in  New York for the most part of his life and scarcely known to fame.  </P> <P> But Dubensky had a propensity, if not exactly a great talent, for writing music  for unusual combinations of instruments. Thus, the piece that brought him to  light on this occasion, in Gindi Auditorium of the University of Judaism, was a  Prelude and Fugue for four bassoons, maybe the only known example of its kind.  </P> <P> If it has competitors for the distinction it does not matter much, for the  piece adequately served as a present exercise for David Breidenthal, Walter  Ritchie, Patricia Kindel and Alan Goodman, an ensemble expert both individually  and collectively.  </P> <P> There was more substance but not necessarily more weight to Arensky's Piano  Trio in D minor, Opus 32. The work was composed in 1894 and shows its age as a  relic of light-hearted Romanticism. Its main purpose seemed to be to provide a  comprehensive exhibition of the talents of the pianist, a chore lightly and  zestfully disposed of by Zita Carno. Richard Leshin on violin and Howard Colf  on cello successfully supported Carno.  </P> <P> Antonin Dvorak's Quartet in E-flat, Opus 87, likewise starred a pianist, this  time a guest in the person of Armen Guzelimian.  </P> <P> Dvorak, whose star seems at times to decline but never actually sets,  challenges the pianist with a part of concerto dimensions. Guzelimian never  pushed himself out of the ensemble frame, but within those limits he gave a  reading of splendid scope, ornamented with glitter and constantly disposed  musically in the firmest ensemble terms.  </P> <P> It was a rousing performance and the participants were repeatedly recalled.  String players were Elizabeth Baker, violin, Ralph Fielding, viola and Barry  Gold, cello. ALBERT GOLDBERG  </P></p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Leading Article: US boxed in over Japan At first sight, last weekend's US threat of unilateral trade sanctions against Japan may look like an attempt to use American strength to browbeat Tokyo into concessions. On closer inspection, however, the evidence suggests that it is Washington which has boxed itself into a corner and urgently needs an escape route. The promise that he could do better than the Bush administration in opening Japanese markets was one of the pledges on which President Bill Clinton came to office. Yet, with the arguable exception of an agreement covering sales of Motorola mobile telephones, his administration's 'results-oriented' approach has been conspicuous for its failure to deliver its intended results. Successive Japanese governments have, rightly, resisted US demands to commit themselves to 'measurable progress indicators' for judging the effect of market opening. Washington's insistence that these are not numerical targets, which the Japanese government would be expected to meet by intervening in its domestic market, carry little conviction. The US objective is managed trade under another name. Its determination to pursue it has not advanced - and may have hindered - those political forces in Japan committed to the genuine liberalisation which Washington says it is eager to promote. At the same time, the administration's stance has earned widespread condemnation among its main trade partners, above all in Asia, the region where the US insists that the economic future lies. Its fractious relationship with Japan, combined with its equivocal attitude towards China, raises doubts about whether Washington knows what it wants. Political weakness Recently, two other factors have strengthened the impression that the administration has lost the initiative and is negotiating from political weakness. One is the renewal of its Super-301 trade sanctions mechanism after the collapse in February of the trade talks between President Clinton and former Japanese prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. This appears to have been a delaying tactic, designed to fend off political pressures in the US while efforts continued to reach a bilateral framework trade agreement. However, by imposing an autumn deadline for a deal, Super-301 has placed successive Japanese governments in a position of negotiating under duress, making it still harder for them to justify domestically concessions the US wants. The second factor is the administration's recent confusion about the state of the dollar. It has forsworn a policy of encouraging further yen appreciation - a course which in any case might have little impact on the bilateral trade balance. Equally, concern about the dollar requires Washington to weigh seriously the potentially negative effect which trade sanctions against Japan could have on currency markets. Calm response Tokyo's relatively calm response to the weekend's developments suggests it perceives Washington's options to be increasingly limited. It is no doubt emboldened by the administration's past record of retreating from confrontations - most notoriously over its threat to deny most favoured nation treatment of Chinese exports. However, there is still a danger that Tokyo will feel tempted to appease Washington with a symbolic purchase of US exports. That would play into the hands of the US managed trade lobby and discriminate against other trade partners. Instead, Japan should encourage the US to pursue its complaints multilaterally, preferably through the Gatt, or in the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. On any rational assessment, Washington must recognise that such an outcome is in its best interest. Its myopic obsession with Japan's trading practices far exceeds the importance of the bilateral trade deficit to US economic prosperity. In stubbornly making demands which Japan is unable to meet, it has unnecessarily antagonised an important ally, incurred international opprobrium and diverted valuable government resources from more urgent priorities. It is time for the US to put this narrow dispute behind it and concentrate on reasserting its traditional leadership in global trade and economic policy.</p>

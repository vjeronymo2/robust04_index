			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAME EAST GERMAN TALENT, NEW APPROACH;  </P> <P> GYMNASTICS: POLITICAL CHANGES HAVE OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE TEAM'S FIRST VISIT  TO THE UNITED STATES IN 11 YEARS.  </P> <P> When East German gymnasts were told they were going to the United States, they  said they envisioned skyscrapers. Instead, they got the suburbs of Memphis.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the fact that the East German gymnasts are here for the first  time in 11 years, for a dual meet against the United States, signifies the  political changes taking place in their country.  </P> <P> This meet -- the women compete today and the men Sunday -- may be among the  last times East Germany will compete internationally under its own flag. By  1992 East and West Germany are expected to reunify and compete as one.  </P> <P> Probably more significant of the changes, however, is who's not here.  </P> <P> Andreas Wecker, one of East Germany's top male gymnasts, stayed home partly  because of an injury. That injury, though, is not keeping him from commuting to  West Germany to help train athletes. The West Germans may even hire Wecker,  even though he would still compete for East Germany until reunification.  </P> <P> "Seen from yesterday's point of view, this would not be OK," Klaus Heller, the  general secretary of the German Democratic Republic Gymnastics Federation said  Thursday at the Mid-South Coliseum, where the meet will be held. "But this same  thing, seen from tomorrow's view, yes."  </P> <P> For years, U.S. Gymnastics Federation officials have asked the East Germans to  come to the United States, but the requests were denied. The GDR had not sent a  gymnastics team to the United States since 1979, for the World Championships at  Ft. Worth.  </P> <P> "We have had a good rapport and always felt a warmth from the East Germans, but  often we could not get into their country and, certainly, they never came  here," said Robert Cowan, a USGF official. "But after the Wall fell (in  November), it was easy."  </P> <P> So here they are, in the city of the king -- Elvis -- of whom even these  gymnasts say they have heard. But Graceland will have to wait until Monday. The  East Germans are working out here twice a day, once with the Americans, once in  a private gym. And this competition is merely an exhibition.  </P> <P> U.S. gymnasts conducted interviews between workouts Thursday, but East German  officials said their gymnasts could not talk until the workout was over. Then,  as soon as they finished, they were hurried out the door and into a waiting  van. Officials said their gymnasts were through talking for the day. But they  had never talked at all. And this happened on media day.  </P> <P> But Heller says these training methods set the East Germans apart and will be  of help to the West Germans, who did not qualify in gymnastics for the 1988  Olympics. East and West German gymnasts will begin working out together in May  in East Berlin and in Frankfurt.  </P> <P> "Our gymnasts practice about five hours a day, the same as West Germany, but  our method and intensity is different," said Heller, speaking through an  interpreter. "It is the same quantity, but the quality is different."  </P> <P> East German gymnasts don't appear to be worried about the increased  competition.  </P> <P> "West Germany can't catch up with us," said Baerbel Wielgoss, one of East  Germany's top female gymnasts.  </P> <P> In comparison, U.S. women gymnasts also practice about five hours a day. They  finished fourth at the 1989 World Championships, one place ahead of the East  Germans. And at the 1988 Olympics, a technical error by the United States gave  East Germany the bronze medal. That technical violation was called on the  United States by an East German judge.  </P> <P> The U.S. men, because of college demands, train about three hours a day. In  comparison, Cowan, who recently returned from East Germany, said the men there  train twice a day, about three to four hours each time, and attend school in  between training sessions.  </P> <P> At the 1989 World Championships, East Germany finished second to the Soviets.  The United States tied for eighth.  </P> <P> "Our men can't train that many hours," Cowan said. "In East Germany, the focus  of their athletes is gymnastics, and their lives are built around that. In the  United States, the men's focus is college, or school, and gymnastics is built  around that. Their kids don't work any harder than ours, they just work longer,  more hours."  </P> <P> East Germany also draws from a much larger pool of elite gymnasts. Its program  has about 1,000 male and female elites, with 400,000 gymnasts overall, and 250  coaches. The United States has about 100 male and 100 female elites.  </P> <P> The methods employed by the East German sports system, the so-called miracle  machine, are often criticized by Western countries. Its talent development  program identifies young athletes and assigns them to government-run sports  clubs for training. That helps explain how a country with a population of fewer  than 17 million could become a medal factory.  </P> <P> Since 1968, only the Soviet Union and the United States have won more medals.  And in the medal count for both the 1988 Winter and Summer Olympics, East  Germany was second to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Heller, secretary of the gymnastics federation for six years, said he would  like to dispel the idea that athletes must compete against their will, and that  children are taken from their homes against their parents' wishes.  </P> <P> He admits that talented young gymnasts are identified and moved to  government-operated sports clubs, usually at age 10, but he says they have a  choice. He says that only half the athletes live away from home. The others  stay with their parents because they have clubs in their cities.  </P> <P> Wielgoss, 17, says there is a club in her hometown of Rostock, so she has  always lived at home with her parents.  </P> <P> Also, Heller says, elite gymnasts or their families do not benefit from  material or economic gain -- unless they win. Then they can receive about  $20,000 per gold medal. Furthermore, Heller says gymnasts can even quit -- and  always could -- with no ramifications.  </P> <P> For example, Heller said Doerte Thuemmler, one of their top women, quit last  year at 17, before the new government took over. And Anke Wilkenloh, 18,  another star, quit four weeks ago.  </P> <P> "(Anke) told me, 'I quit, I am finished,' " Heller said. "I told her the  advantages of staying, that she would get a three-week vacation in the United  States with her parents after the Goodwill Games. Still, she said no."  </P> <P> What lies ahead for East German sports is uncertain. Seemingly, the new  government doesn't care as much about developing athletes. The centralized  system of long-term planning, which has been so effective, is now being  criticized by supporters of the new government.  </P> <P> Then-East German prime minister Hans Modrow said in a speech in December that  the country will place as much emphasis on recreational sports for all citizens  as it does on developing elite athletes for international competition. That  means less money for the sports federations.  </P> <P> Heller thinks that the number of elite athletes may stay the same, but the  number of coaches may be cut in half. So, while the changes are met by East  German officials with joy and expectation on one hand, there are economic  concerns on the other.  </P> <P> The positive changes, Heller said, are certain to be a better opportunity for  travel and perhaps even better nutrition for the athletes.  </P> <P> "For now, things are the same," Heller said. "But there will be a new situation  in July."  </P> <P> At that time, West Germany's Deutsch mark will also become East Germany's  currency.  </P> <P> Added Heller: "(Up) to now, there was no unemployment in the GDR, not only in  sports, but in any industry. That is not so well known by others.  </P> <P> "We will see. We wait."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Rudolf Gladkikh] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 May -- Today Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev expressed gratitude to the Government of Pakistan  and to Afghan leaders for their specific action to implement  accords reached between us during visits to Islamabad and Kabul.  The matter concerns the handing over on 16 May in the residence  of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of two former Soviet  POW's seized by a group supporting Golboddin Hekmatyar during  the war in Afghanistan.    After many years of imprisonment and deprivation in camps  run  by the Afghan opposition, the two Russian men, Yuriy Stepanov  from Bashkiria and Aleksey Olenin from Kuybyshev Oblast, have  been allowed to return home.    I welcome the release from captivity of Aleksey Olenin and  Yuriy Stepanov, the Russian foreign minister said today. Their  return home was made possible by the constant attention of the  Russian leadership to the problems of finding and freeing former  Soviet POWs captured in Afghanistan, and to the joint efforts in  this area of the Foreign Ministry, other Russian departments,  and the Committee for Affairs of Soldiers Serving Abroad, the  Russian foreign minister said.    Kozyrev expressed hope that constructive interaction between  the leaderships of Russia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan will  continue, in order to solve the humanitarian problem of POW's as  soon as possible.    According to Russian Defense Ministry figures there are 290  of our soldiers missing in Afghanistan. It is known that 60 or  70 of them are alive. Leonid Biryukov, head of the section for  the finding and freeing of missing soldiers of the Committee for  Affairs of Soldiers Serving Abroad under the council of CIS  heads of government, who cited these figures to the ITAR-TASS  correspondent, expressed confidence that all the Afghan war  veterans who had been separated from their homeland would  certainly be reunited with it. The complex work to rescue our  soldiers captured in Afghanistan will continue.</p>

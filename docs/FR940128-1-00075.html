			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Oven temperatures for hot processing ranged from 90 to 240  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (32 to 116  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) and from 38 to 125  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4 to 52  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) for cold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing. Water-phase salt content in hot-process products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranged from 0.88 to 27.5 percent and in cold-process products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 1.33 to 18.1 percent. Twenty-eight firms (43.7 percent)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vacuum packed cold-process products, but 60.7 percent of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms did not test final products for water-phase salt content or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for residual sodium nitrite. Twenty-five firms (39.1 percent)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vacuum packed hot-process products, but 68 percent of those firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not test final products for water-phase salt content or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual sodium nitrite. Seventy-five percent of the firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyed did not test final products for water-phase salt content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or for residual sodium nitrite, where used. Since this survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was conducted, the frequency of FDA inspections of smoked fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishments has been increased over 50 percent each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FDA is providing guidance on the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters for processing smoked fishery products in Appendix 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidance addresses critical control points that apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these products as a class and that will typically be identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the HACCP plans of most processors of smoke and smoke-flavored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. The guidance also addresses ways of controlling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards at these critical control points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The key processing parameters that must be controlled to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the safety of these products involve time, temperature,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and salinity. While a range of time-temperature-salinity (TTS)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values will provide a safe product, there are now known safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimums for these values that have been developed through years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of research. Processors whose TTS values fall below these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimums do not produce a safe product and shift much of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden of preventing botulism toxin outgrowth to those who take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession of these products after they leave the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant, including the ultimate consumer. This burden includes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among other things, maintaining strict temperature control at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F or lower even though it is known that many commercial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home refrigerators are unable to maintain this temperature (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These TTS minimums are known to produce a marketable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, because there are processors that operate in conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with them. Moreover, because they are minimums, these values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for the production of a variety of products, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different types of lox with varying amounts of saltiness, to suit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different tastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These minimum TTS values provide the only scientifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid way developed to date of ensuring that no botulism toxin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be produced over the shelf life of the product under proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration conditions or under conditions of moderate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature abuse. The minimum values, coupled with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation practices proposed in this document, should also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure against the presence of detectable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These minimum TTS values are being issued at this time as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed guidance to ensure maximum flexibility. If these values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are reflected in the HACCP plans that are required by proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, and are being effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented by the processor, the agency is likely to find that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plan and its implementation are adequate with regard to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical limits and critical control points. The same holds true  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the other types of controls recommended in the guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is requesting comment on this approach, and on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following alternatives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Issue all or part of the materials relating to smoked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 as regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than guidance. Given the public health concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with these products and the scientific basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TTS minimums, it may well be appropriate to issue them as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Such regulations would take into account advances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in knowledge and technology by allowing processors to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative processing parameters so long as these alternatives were scientifically demonstrated to produce an equivalent level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of safety. (Section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 contains such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Issue a performance standard as a regulation, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaving the materials in Appendix 1 as guidelines on how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors could meet the performance standard. The likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance standard would be, as suggested above (and included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and smoke-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flavored fishery products in Appendix 1): (a) for botulism, zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxin production in the product during a time period through_and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slightly beyond_the shelf life of the product, demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through inoculated pack studies under normal and moderate abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions; and (b) no detectable L. monocytogenes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Maintain the guidance relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products in the FDA Fish and Fishery Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hazards and Controls Guide and control safety through the HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for all seafood in proposed subpart A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA requests comment on which of these alternatives is most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to ensure that smoked fish will be safe and is most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the agency's obligations under the act. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of a regulation or guideline, how can the agency best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the results of the research that it has conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be available for use by the industry? FDA solicits comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on these and the matters raised above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> N. Verification Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in section IV.A. of this document, one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NACMCF's seven HACCP principles involves verification that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP system is working. NACMCF recommends that HACCP plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include procedures for verification of the HACCP system (Ref. 34,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. 200). FDA advises processors to consider adopting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation, but has not proposed to require it because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency expects verification to occur through: (1) A firm's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency with the controls and limits to be provided by FDA in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HACCP guidance described in section VII.C. and M. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document; (2) third-party technical assistance provided through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade associations, universities and government agencies; and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of all HACCP monitoring records by trained individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before distribution of product (see proposed &sect;123.8(b)); the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed corrective action requirements (see proposed &sect;123.7),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially the provision for assessment of HACCP plans as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequence of deviations (&sect;123.7(a)(4)); the recommended use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process authorities for cooked, ready-to-eat products (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A); the proposed general training requirements (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.9); and inspector review during routine agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections. FDA invites comment on whether this approach is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate to ensure that the NACMCF verification principle is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being properly addressed, both for individual firms and for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall HACCP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For individual firms, NACMCF specifically discourages the sole reliance on end-product sampling for verification purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 34, p. 201). FDA also has questions concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficacy of end-product sampling as the only way to measure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> success of HACCP. These caveats notwithstanding, FDA invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on what tests should be used to measure success, both in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of individual firms and the program as a whole, and how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently such tests should be administered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Other Approaches to HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This preamble has described in great detail the HACCP system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is being proposed and the reasoning behind each proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision. While the agency is inviting comment on the merits of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each provision, FDA also invites comment on the overall system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including whether some other approach to HACCP or some variation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed approach might be preferable. Variations on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed approach include, but are not limited to: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring HACCP only for higher risk seafood products; (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempting small firms from HACCP requirements; (3) staggering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date for implementation based on size of firm or risk;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (4) deleting or altering some of the requirements in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal in order to facilitate implementation and lower costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A brief discussion of each of these variations follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Higher Risk Only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An alternative to requiring HACCP for all commercial seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products would be to require it for products or processes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been linked to significant numbers reported seafood-borne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses. As section II.B. of this document explains in detail,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many of the reported illnesses from seafood involve raw molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish and certain species of finfish that can accumulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin. Other seafood products cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illness but are not as commonly reported. FDA invites comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether this proposed regulation should apply only to molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish and the species responsible for scombrotoxin and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ciguatoxin poisonings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A variation on this approach would be to have the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation apply to those species and processes with a higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for harm, even if actual illnesses from them cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented from the foodborne illness reporting system. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described earlier in the preamble, the fact that the system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not recording illnesses from a particular food does not mean that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses are not occurring. Also, potential for harm need not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always be measured in terms of the number of illnesses that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually occurring. For example, some problems, like botulism,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may occur infrequently, but when they do, the consequences can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devastating. Based on the potential for harm, other candidates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for inclusion would be: (1) Hot-process smoked and hot-process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke-flavored fish, cold-process smoked and cold-process smoke-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flavored fish, because of the hazards of botulism and listeria;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) cooked, ready-to-eat products, because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microbiological hazards associated with products that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to be cooked by the consumer; (3) low acid canned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods, because of the hazard of botulism and general complexity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the processing operation; (4) raw, ready-to-eat products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the risk of parasites; and (5) species that require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgment as to appropriate location of harvest to avoid unsafe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticide or industrial contaminant levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Liquidation agreed for Danish group A CONTROLLED liquidation of Commercial Holding, a leasing and property investment group, has been agreed by Danish banks, but their British counterparts have still to approve the plan, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Share quotations for the group's four companies, Commercial Holding, Commercial Leasing, Ballin &amp; Herz and Brandt's Klaedefabrik, have been suspended in Copenhagen since the end of April. The group's equity capital was a negative DKr617m (Dollars 96m) at the end of 1992, according to a stock exchange statement, compared with a positive DKr452m at the start of last year. Danish creditors have agreed to convert DKr700m of their claims to equity capital to allow assets to be sold over a period of two years. But the group has lost about DKr600m through leasing operations in the UK, and British bank creditors have still to approve the liquidation plan, the statement said.</p>

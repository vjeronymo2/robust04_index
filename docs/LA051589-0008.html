			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Solidarity founder Lech Walesa raised the possibility that his union might  support its longtime foe, Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, as a candidate for  president in upcoming elections. Addressing a rally of about 3,000 people after  a Mass in St. Brygida's Church in the seaport of Gdansk, Walesa said he  believes Jaruzelski has changed since his government banned Solidarity in  October, 1982. "I see Jaruzelski as a different man following our meeting on  April 18," Walesa said. "I cannot be guided by emotions and I must be a cool  politician now." The April 18 meeting, called to review the  government-Solidarity accords restoring legal status to the union, was the  first face-to-face session between the two since Jaruzelski imposed martial law  in December, 1981.  </P></p>

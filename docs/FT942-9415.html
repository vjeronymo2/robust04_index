			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Atlantic Richfield loses on derivatives Atlantic Richfield, the US energy company, has confirmed press reports that investments in derivative securities led to steep losses last month in an employee investment fund it manages. Arco is the latest of several large US companies, including consumer products group Procter &amp; Gamble, to acknowledge suffering significant losses in derivatives due to volatility of markets. Losses have reinforced pressures in Congress for regulation of derivatives markets, which critics argue are poorly policed, badly understood and could pose a systemic risk to the financial system. Mr Al Greenstein, an Arco spokesman, told Reuter the group's Money Market Plus Fund lost Dollars 22m (Pounds 15m), or 5.3 per cent of its principal in April, and all the losses were associated with derivative securities with principal risks. He said the company had since liquidated all derivative securities in question, and changed strategy to avoid such investments. Mr Greenstein added Arco had informed investors in the fund that it wants to 'make good' on the losses. He said it was consulting the Internal Revenue Service to work out 'highly complex' tax issues involved with a reimbursement. It was not Arco's policy to reimburse employees for fund losses, but it wanted to do so for investors of the Money Market Plus Fund since they 'had the expectation that their money was not at risk'.</p>

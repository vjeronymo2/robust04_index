			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Measuring the depth of recession Sir, By arguing that it is premature to suggest that the present recession has been the longest since the Second World War, Andrew Sentance (Letters, February 29) neglects to take account of the fact that the recession is, of course, not yet over. If we use the definition put forward by Professor Douglas McWilliams (economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry), that the length of the recession is represented by the period of time taken for the economy to reach its previous peak in output, the 3.9 per cent drop in economic activity since that previous peak will need to be made good by the third quarter of 1993. However, not even the CBI is forecasting growth on that scale over the next 18 months, and some hefty subsequent revisions in the official data will be needed to reduce the length of the recession to within that experienced in previous post-war recessions.

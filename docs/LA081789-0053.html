			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: NUPTIALS  </P> <P> KCBS-TV's onscreen twosome, co-anchors Bree Walker and Jim Lampley, have  reportedly been a twosome offscreen ever since they paired up on Channel 2 in  October. Now the Herald-Examiner reports that the two have told co-workers that  they plan to marry as soon as both of their divorces are final. The pair, who  anchor the 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts Mondays through Thursdays and the 6 and 11  p.m. segments Sunday, could not be reached for comment. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

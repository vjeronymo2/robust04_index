			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Ruling today on BCCI pay-off SIR DONALD NICHOLLS, the vice-chancellor, will rule in the High Court today on whether the Pounds 930m settlement negotiated by liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International can go ahead. Touche Ross, the liquidators, are asking Sir Donald to give the go-ahead for the deal to be offered to creditors. The deal, which is estimated to give creditors a return of 30 per cent to 40 per cent, involves the injection of about Pounds 930m by the Abu Dhabi authorities - the bank's majority shareholders. The liquidators say that, if the deal was rejected, the only alternative would be costly and risky litigation lasting to the end of the century. A 7-1 majority of the BCCI UK creditors' committee has already voted to recommend rejection and is opposing the liquidator's application for the court to sanction the agreements. The committee wants an amount equal to the Pounds 2.2bn promised by Abu Dhabi in its unsuccessful attempt to persuade banking regulators not to withdraw BCCI's banking licences last July. Some overseas creditors outside the committee have given it their support. Former bank staff are pressing for a four-month adjournment to give time for the conclusions of the Bingham inquiry into the BCCI affair to be taken into consid eration. The liquidators argue that the deal offers creditors the only realistic prospect of any worthwhile return this century. In order to go ahead the package also needs approval from courts in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands at hearings later this month.</p>

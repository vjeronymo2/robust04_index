			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Granada chief may quit as price of Pounds 150m cash call GRANADA, the leisure and television group, is expected to announce today a Pounds 150m rights issue and the departure of its chief executive, Mr Derek Lewis. The announcement will follow weeks of pressure and speculation that Granada's financial adviser, S. G. Warburg, was seeking Mr Lewis's resignation as the price of going ahead with a rights issue designed to reduce the company's debt. Several non-executive directors and a range of institutional shareholders believed top-level management changes were needed following difficult diversifications into electrical retailing and business services, and growing levels of borrowing. Those who were critical included Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief executive of Reed International, who is expected to resign from the Granada board soon after the rights issue has been completed. Although Mr Lewis will announce his intention to leave, he is expected to stay until a successor is appointed. Granada's new financial package is likely to include a dividend cut. Despite accepting Warburg's arguments that Mr Lewis must go, there is no sign that Granada plans significant changes in strategy. Support will continue for the two high-risk ventures that have increased pressure on Granada's balance sheet - the Pounds 232.4m commitment to British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, and the Pounds 200m investment in business services which has only just moved into modest profit. Mr Lewis has admitted that Granada was slow to integrate its computer servicing acquisitions into the main business, which delayed profitability. Questions are likely to be raised about the apparent decision to sacrifice Mr Lewis for policies that had the support of the board and are likely to continue. The uncertainty comes at a particularly sensitive time. By noon next Wednesday, Granada Television has to submit its bid for a new 10-year commercial broadcasting licence. The Independent Television Commission has not ruled out takeovers of bidders while franchise bids are being considered. However, once the franchises are awarded there is a moratorium on takeovers until 1994. In December Granada announced a 26 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 121m.</p>

Upon completion of the project, the two-time Academy Award  winner (who was born in East Los Angeles) treks to New York for his Oct. 21  one-man painting/sculpture exhibition.  </P> <P> A gala, star-studded ceremony was the setting for the TV y Novelas Awards,  honoring the most popular Spanish-language soap operas. Nominees were selected  by the viewing public via write-in ballots.  </P> <P> Among this year's winners were Univision's "Encadenados" (best series), with  its star Humberto Zurita receiving the leading actor award.

"Many of  America's streets could be known as the 'Walk of Shame' because of the 4  million homeless people residing in them."  </P> <P> Mexican songstress Yuri admits that although she is happily married, she does  not plan to have children for a few years, claiming that . . . "for the time  being, my career is top priority."  </P> <P> Short takes: Now in its ninth season, look for changes on CBS's "Falcon Crest"  as it focuses even more attention on Lorenzo Lamas . . . Mexico's "Prince of  Song," Jose Jose, has sold his Los Angeles house and bought one in Miami . . .  Jose Luis (El Puma) Rodriguez, is at the Universal Amphitheatre Oct. 13 and 14.  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover, break a four-day downtrend Wall Street, a carnival atmosphere in Germany and technical recoveries in Sweden and Switzerland helped bourses break a four-day downtrend yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT celebrated carnival with an afternoon upsurge. A tepid session saw the Dax index ease 0.39 to 2,115.62, up 13.69 from the previous afternoon's Ibis-indicated close; but then share prices followed the futures market and ended at 2,130.71, 28.78 or 1.4 per cent higher over 24 hours. Turnover, affected by the holiday, moved up from DM5.1bn to DM6.7bn. There was talk of interest rate hopes after lunch, although most professionals expected nothing from the Bundesbank earlier this week and in Washington Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said that he did not expect an interest rate cut in the near future. The Dax future moved faster still, closing 45.5 higher at 2,146.5. Mr John Blackley of James Capel said that the day's moves almost defied logic, especially given that the bund future, which drove the equity market last week, was down by 25 basis points and there was concern over the prospect of more metalworkers' strikes tomorrow. Short covering lifted BMW, blue-chip star of the day at DM827, up DM10.50 and rising another DM2 in the aftermarket. Generally, dealers saw the prospect of added volatility later in the week with stock options, and options on the Dax future expiring on Friday. PARIS speculated on which direction to move before deciding on an upward course and the CAC-40 index closed up a modest 14.81 to 2,257.97, after a session high of 2,264 and a low of 2,229. Turnover, at FFr5.4bn, was slightly stronger than on Monday. A high proportion of the day's turnover was seen in Elf Aquitaine, the shares adding FFr9 to FFr424 after the government announced the institutional offer price: at FFr403, it was slightly lower than expected, while the tranche size has been scaled down by some 20 per cent. The allocation of shares for private investors was scaled down, the government also announced yesterday. Canal Plus gained FFr7 to FFr1,039 on news that the chairman and founder of the pay television network, Mr Andre Rousselet, had resigned. This followed last week's news in which Havas, the leisure group, raised its shareholding in Canal Plus, forcing the resignation of Mr Rousselet from its board. Havas slipped FFr1.20 to FFr465.70. AMSTERDAM managed a modest advance, helped by a positive rise in Elsevier, up Fl 2.70 to Fl 185.50 after a German bank raised its recommendation. The AEX index put on 1.12 to 429.90. Fokker, down Fl 1.40 at Fl 21.50, continued to attract sellers following its announcement on Monday of job cuts while KLM, the airline, was depressed by news that the government might restrict its participation in the planned Fl 1bn global share offering to some Fl 300m, less than had been expected. The shares drifted down 60 cents to Fl 51.80. ZURICH saw short covering, and futures-related trading as investors reacted to a 6.4 per cent fall in the blue-chip, SMI index since the beginning of February. The SMI rose 43.2 to 2,990.3 with Roche and Nestle in the lead, Roche certificates rising SFr165 to SFr6,990 as the most active stock of the day and Nestle following with a gain of SFr19 at SFr1,325. Banks saw respectable gains and insurers did better, with Zurich Insurance up SFr30 at SFr1,490, Winterthur another SFr15 higher at SFr1,490, and Swiss Re SFr15 to the good at SFr695. Gains lower down the size scale were more moderate, with the all-share, SPI index rising 21.62 to 1,902.91. MILAN reflected a generally lower tone with Monday's strong performers, Gemina, Generali and BCI, continuing to rise against the trend. Suggestions that the first two companies might gain from the forthcoming privatisation of BCI helped their prices, which closed respectively L29 and L766 higher at L1,590 and L41,490. BCI put on L56 at L5,670. The Mibtel index fell 60 to 10,732. Elsewhere, Fiat declined L83 to L4,708 on the expected resumption of talks between management and unions over job cuts. Sip, the domestic telephone operator, lost L33.70 to L724, in line with the market, in spite of forecasting better than expected 1993 results. STOCKHOLM was lifted by index heavyweights, and a 2.8 per cent gain in banks and insurance as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 18.0 to 1,534.2 in high turnover of SKr2.49bn. Astra A put on SKr6 at SKr178, and Volvo SKr12 at SKr669. WARSAW moved into record territory as some confidence returned to the market following sharp declines last month. The WIG index rose 739.4 or 4.1 per cent to 18,799.3 in turnover of 3,300bn zlotys. ISTANBUL matched Monday's rate of recovery, the composite index putting on another 8.9 per cent to close at a provisional 16,433.49, up 1,337.46 on the central bank's aggressive defence of the lira against the dollar.

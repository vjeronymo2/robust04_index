			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Unit trust sales up 50% to Pounds 722m Unit trusts sales of Pounds 722.4m last month were almost 50 per cent higher than in January and compared with Pounds 580.5m in February last year, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. Retail demand has again been heavy, with almost three quarters of last month's net sales - Pounds 530m - made by private investors. Many savers have been turning to equities as an alternative to building societies at a time of relatively low interest rates. Last week the Building Societies Association reported net outflow of funds of Pounds 404m after a net outflow of Pounds 265m in January. The most popular sectors with private investors were the five UK equity fund sectors which attracted a net Pounds 335m of investment. UK and European funds qualify for full Personal Equity Plan allowances, which allow individuals to invest in equities tax-efficiently. The best-selling sector among private investors were the international growth funds. Institutions favoured Japan and there was a shift away from the 'Far East excluding Japan sector' into 'Far East including Japan' funds.</p>

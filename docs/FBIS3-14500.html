			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The joint command of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has denounced U.S. President Bill  Clinton's position on Jerusalem as a provocative position. The  two fronts believe this provocative position reaffirms that the  U.S. Administration is continuing to completely take the side of  Israel.    In a statement, the joint PFLP-DFLP command added that,  therefore, Washington is not qualified to play a neutral role in  settling the Arab-Israeli dispute. It called on all concerned  Arab parties to end the current talks because the U.S. position  undermines the pillars of the peace process.</p>

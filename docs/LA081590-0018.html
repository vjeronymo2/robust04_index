			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: 2 EXECUTIVES WILL HEAD GOLDMAN SACHS  </P> <P> Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., a giant investment bank and brokerage, will install a  pair of executives to replace John L. Weinberg when he steps down later this  year as senior partner and chairman.  </P> <P> Weinberg, 65, plans to retire after 14 years as senior partner and chairman of  the management committee at the end of the firm's fiscal year Nov. 30.  </P> <P> The firm said its co-vice chairmen for the past three years, Robert E. Rubin  and Stephen Friedman, will share Weinberg's titles after he retires.  </P> <P> Naming a pair of executives to head a firm is becoming more common as the  complexity of running businesses has escalated.  </P> <P> The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, for instance, named co-chief executives,  William A. Grant and Robert J. Kelly, after the merger of the firms Arthur  Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney last year.  </P> <P> The media and entertainment giant Time Warner Inc. also is run by co-chief  executives, Steven J. Ross and Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. The firm was created in  a merger earlier this year of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.  </P> <P> Weinberg shared the job of chairman of the management committee when he was  appointed to it in 1976 with John C. Whitehead.  </P> <P> Weinberg has been the sole chairman since November, 1984, after Whitehead  retired and later became deputy secretary of state.  </P> <P> Goldman Sachs is one of the last major privately held investment firms on Wall  Street and has about 6,400 employees worldwide.  </P> <P> It ranked third among investment firms behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and  Shearson Lehman Bros. in terms of capital at the start of the year, according  to the Securities Industry Assn. The firm has a solid reputation in mergers and  acquisitions, equity underwriting, corporate advisory services, trading and  research.  </P> <P> Weinberg cited both the pressures of the job and his desire to pursue private  interests as reasons for his decision to step down from a post he called "the  greatest job in the world."  </P> <P> The senior partner's position "is a seven days a week, 52 weeks a year  responsibility and it requires a total commitment. The pressures are often very  intense," he said in a statement.  </P> <P> Weinberg said the firm is in excellent condition with a strong capital position  and earnings running somewhat ahead of last year's. He said its prospects for  growth were bright.  </P> <P> During his tenure at the top of the firm, Weinberg said its annual profits rose  about tenfold and its equity capital grew to $2.3 billion from about $80  million at the end of 1976.  </P> <P> Weinberg will continue as senior chairman of the firm, responsible for client  relationships and other unspecified activities.  </P> <P> In a joint statement, Rubin and Friedman said they "look forward to continuing  on the course that we have set and followed together."  </P> <P> Weinberg joined Goldman Sachs in 1950 and became a partner in 1956. He was  named senior partner and co-chairman of the management committee in 1976.  </P> <P> Rubin, 51, joined Goldman Sachs in 1966, became a partner in 1971 and a member  of the management committee in 1980. He formerly headed the trading and  arbitrage division and previously oversaw the firm's commodity and foreign  exchange subsidiary.  </P> <P> Friedman, 52, also joined Goldman Sachs in 1966, was elected partner in 1973  and became a member of the management committee in 1982. He headed the mergers  and acquisitions unit for several years and had been co-head of the investment  banking division.  </P> <P> Rubin and Friedman served as co-heads of the fixed income division from 1985-88  and have been vice chairmen of the firm since 1987.  </P></p>

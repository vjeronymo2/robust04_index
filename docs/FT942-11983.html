			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Northern Leisure healthcare sale Northern Leisure, which has been trying to dispose of RealCare, its nursing homes business, since 1992, yesterday announced plans to sell it to Midland Assets for Pounds 1.9m cash. Midland is a new company chaired by Mr Nicholas Oppenheim, who is also vice-chairman of Northern. It intends to raise Pounds 2.4m via a placing and intermediaries offer of 17m shares at 14p apiece. Thereafter it will seek a full listing. Mr Oppenheim said RealCare, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 212,000 in the year to August 31, had four nursing homes. He added that a 'relatively modest' additional capital expenditure would improve its profitability.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Merger talk brings cheer for Christmas - London Until last Thursday afternoon it seemed that the festive season had turned into the open season. At least, that is, as far as the merchant banks and regional electricity stocks were concerned. Just as the institutions and the market's big trading houses began to wind down for the Christmas break, with no signs of the expected and traditional year-end rally, up popped news of merger talks between S. G. Warburg and Morgan Stanley, closely followed by news that Trafalgar House was considering a bid for Northern Electric. Those two pieces of news, plus widespread expectations that there could well be other big bids in the market, dispelled much of the recent gloom in UK equities. With the FT-SE 100 index having fallen below 3,000 - it reached its lowest level for five months early last week - the general consensus around the City's trading desks now is that the market can make some progress as we move into 1995 And in spite of the surprisingly abrupt termination of the merger talks between Warburg and Morgan, which drove Warburg shares back to their pre-merger talks level, there is a much better feeling to the equity market. Activity this week will inevitably slacken as the winding down process really gets under way and there are no really big results scheduled outside the utilities area. But as a broker at one of the City's blue-blooded securities houses put it last week, the big corporate finance departments in London's merchant banks and stockbroking firms are being put on 'red alert' for the new year, which many expect to bring a burst of takeover activity. It is the utilities area of the market that strategists see as attracting much of the corporate activity. With the government's golden shares in each of the water stocks privatised in 1989 due to disappear at the end of this month and those of the electricity companies, privatised in 1990, due to expire at the end of March 1995, the two sectors are the market's prime candidates to attract the attentions of predators. Analysts have long suggested that the powerful US utility companies have been eyeing the cash generative electricity companies. Strategic mergers among various water and electricity stocks are also said to be on the cards. There are, however, two not-insignificant hurdles for the market to negotiate this week; Tuesday's Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, which will ponder US monetary policy, and Thursday's Bundesbank Council meeting. The markets are betting on both institutions leaving their interest rates unchanged. But you never know.</p>

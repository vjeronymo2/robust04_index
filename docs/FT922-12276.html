			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Finnish Bonds: Extra borrowing another blow to investors THE Finnish government bond market has had a turbulent time. Short-term interest rates shot skywards in early April, pushing up yields on longer-dated debt. In addition, the government is expected to issue heavily over the next few months, a factor which could depress the market. The sudden plunge in Finnish bond prices this month took some investors by surprise. Until recently, the Finnish government bond market had a certain allure: it offered high real return as interest rates hovered around 11 per cent, while inflation, which has fallen, is now below 3 per cent. Although the market is small and lacks significant long-dated issues, traders expected the government to increase the maturity range to provide a liquid 10-year pure government bond - as opposed to the existing 10-year housing bond. Bond dealers say some international investors bought Finnish government bonds on the convergence argument, encouraged by the Finnish markka's link to the Ecu and the fact that Finland has applied for EC membership. However, hopes of profiting from a gradual decline in interest rates were cruelly dashed. Mr Rolf Kullberg, governor of the Bank of Finland, announced on April 3 he planned to resign. This followed a public row with the prime minister, Mr Esko Aho. Fears of a devaluation quickly forced up short-term interest rates, pulling up the yields on government bonds by as much as 1 percentage point. An estimated FM5bn to FM10bn flooded out of the country. The government was forced to put together an emergency economic package that weekend, promising FM10bn in expenditure cuts, and Mrs Sirkka Hamalainen was quickly installed as the new governor at the central bank. Promises of support for the markka from the Bundesbank and the central banks of Sweden, Denmark and Norway helped calm the markets. The one-month Helsinki interbank offered rate (Helibor), which shot up to 25 per cent, soon fell, and the yield on seven-year government bonds, which had climbed as high as 12 per cent, is now slightly lower. Although the crisis scared some foreign investors, there has been renewed buying interest from those hoping to benefit from a future fall in interest rates, according to analysts. The Bank of Finland reports an inflow of capital, but the crisis may well have jolted the confidence of investors. Traders expect the government to issue up to FM40bn of bonds this year. Before the crisis, they had expected half to be markka bonds, mainly in the domestic market, and the remainder in the international market. However, with the rise in domestic interest rates, the government may borrow much less than half the amount in the domestic market.</p>

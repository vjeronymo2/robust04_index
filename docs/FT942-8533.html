			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / US trade deficit declines to Dollars 7.5bn The US trade deficit fell to Dollars 7.5bn in March against Dollars 9.2bn in February, but the underlying trend remained adverse, official figures indicated yesterday. The drop in the deficit was larger than most Wall Street analysts expected, but partly reflected special factors. Exports rose 9.6 per cent from February, with large increases in volatile items such as gold bullion, aircraft and telecommunications equipment. Imports rose 5.4 per cent, reflecting the strength of US domestic demand. In the first three months, the overall deficit was Dollars 23.3bn against Dollars 14.7bn in the same period last year. The deterioration reflected a 9.5 per cent gain in imports that more than offset a 5.1 per cent rise in exports. Analysts expect the deficit to continue widening until the rate of economic growth in overseas markets catches up with that in the US. This is unlikely to occur until next year. The widening of the overall US deficit continues to mask sharp differences in the performance of different sectors. In March a surplus of Dollars 4.6bn in trade in services contrasted favourably with a Dollars 12bn deficit on trade in goods. The trade figures left analysts scrambling to revise estimates of growth in the first quarter. The preliminary official estimate of growth at an annual rate of 2.6 per cent assumed a larger trade deficit in March than reported yesterday. It also underestimated the strength of consumer spending in March. However, other components of demand, such as non-residential construction and inventories were weaker than expected. Economists at Merrill Lynch, the financial services group, yesterday predicted the net effect of these changes would be a small downward revision to first quarter growth - to an annual rate of 2.2 per cent.</p>

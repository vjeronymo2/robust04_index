			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Protests over Companies House changes USERS OF Companies House, which stores information on more than 1m UK limited companies, have protested about new consultation procedures, saying it will be harder to put their views across. The Users Group, which has been a forum for customers of Companies' House for 19 years, is being replaced by several specialist committees. The users, including registration agents, credit agencies, chambers of commerce, solicitors and accountants, complain that the procedures have been introduced abruptly and that there will be restrictions on free discussion. They argue that as Companies House has a monopoly on company registrations consultation with its customers is essential. Companies House plans at least four specialist user committees covering large users, such as business information and credit-rating agencies; banks; solicitors and accountants; and smaller credit agencies and chambers of commerce. Companies House says more focused discussions on specialist issues will be feasible than was possible with the Users' Group, which typically attracted between 20 and 30 people to its quarterly meetings. A Companies House official said: 'The Users' Group was getting too big and too general. The smaller groups will allow us to draw our specialist staff into the discussions.' Members of the group believe, however, that Mr David Durham, the chief executive and Companies House staff, resented criticisms and comments made at the Users' Group meetings. Mr Terry Robinson, vice-president of the Institute of Credit Management, said: 'At times they acted as a ginger group and I wonder whether the reason for disbanding the Users' Group was that they they felt they could do without the criticism.' Mr George Corderoy, chairman of the Law Services Association, a grouping of registration agents, said: 'The opportunity for a general debate will be lost in the specialist committees.' Members also believe that Companies House, an executive agency since 1988 and likely to be privatised in the next year or so, felt uneasy at taking criticism from organisations which were increasingly becoming competitors. Competition has come particularly from the search agents, which compile company profiles from information supplied by Companies House.</p>

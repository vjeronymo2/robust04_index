			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Wanted - superhighway cops The imminent arrival of traffic cops and tax inspectors on the information superhighway has been forecast by one of the UK's leading technologists. Looking ahead to some of the less obvious consequences of the emergence of what he describes as 'infobusinesses', John Taylor, head of Hewlett-Packard's European laboratories, says new laws could be needed to regulate a technology which takes no heed of barriers of space and time. What are infobusinesses? Operating in the 'information marketplace' they are similar to today's physical businesses, but the customer travels electronically around the marketplace and his or her purchases are delivered electronically. Taylor gives as examples tele-healthcare, tele-learning and tele-brokering and trading. 'We shall need,' he says, 'the ability to monitor and audit transactions in the information marketplace, which inevitably means that we need the electronic equivalent of the police to detect and prosecute crime, evasion and fraud.' He thinks, however, that the information marketplace will not truly arrive until its transactions can be taxed like any other business area. 'This is patently not the case today,' he says. 'There are probably hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property criss-crossing national borders every year without paying any customs duties or taxes. 'This is happening not just on the Internet, but on thousands of private and commercial networks all over the world. We have not yet invented the electronic customs inspector for electronic objects moving at the speed of light over the invisible superhighways' Intellectual property rights and privacy were issues which demanded further attention. Once an intellectual property like a book or picture is connected to an information network, it loses its financial value because it becomes freely available to everybody on the network. 'No pop video company would connect its current top 50 video albums on-line to the Internet at the moment, because there is no way of ensuring a copy sold to someone and sent to them on the net is not replicated a million times by the purchaser, and sent electronically around the world.' Taylor is fascinated by the idea of the ubiquitous distribution system of small, inexpensive video cameras. Some might be used to promote peace of mind - 'did I leave a saucepan on the gas?', while others might monitor speeding drivers, automatically sending messages across the network to debit their bank account on a scale equivalent to the magnitude of the offence.</p>

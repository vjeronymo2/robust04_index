			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (Serious Money): Will gilts beat the building societies? IT MAY BE time for a significant shift in the portfolios of UK savers. After many years in which the rates available from building societies have been far higher than those on long term investments, the gap has narrowed. Take the rates on offer from a well-known building society such as Alliance &amp; Leicester. On its 90-day notice account, it pays 9.8 per cent gross on balances of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 24,999 and 9.25 per cent on amounts between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 9,999. For instant access, the rates payable on the same amounts are respectively 8.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent. On Thursday this week, it was possible to buy long term gilts at rates of around 9.5 per cent gross - and know that those rates would stay the same for five years or more. In the jargon of the industry, the yield curve has flattened. This may not have been noticed in the high streets of Britain ('Morning, Mr Higginbotham. Looks like rain.' 'Aye, and I see the yield curve has flattened again.'), but it matters a lot to savers concerned with return and safety. The indications are that, in their efforts to stimulate the housing market, the building societies are likely to favour borrowers at the expense of savers in the near future. And if Britain's membership of the ERM does succeed in reducing inflation, interest rates should fall over the next few years. That will be bad news for those with money in the building society, but good news for owners of gilts. Before buying gilts, investors should be sure they know the jargon. Most gilts have a fixed interest rate, called the coupon. A gilt with a 10 per cent coupon and a face value of Pounds 100 would pay Pounds 10 in gross interest per year. Gilts are traded and do not normally sell for their face value. So investors must pay careful attention to the yield, which has two aspects. The running yield is the relationship between the coupon and the market price. A gilt with a coupon of 10 per cent and a price of 80 would have a running yield of 12.5 per cent. But the gilt will eventually be repaid, so the investor who buys for 80 can look forward to a capital gain. The return in terms of capital gain or loss, plus interest on a gilt, is called the gross redemption yield. So what are the pros and cons of moving money from the building society into gilts? Security Building societies are very safe, given that the industry has a habit of rescuing troubled societies, and a compensation scheme will repay 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 an individual deposits. But gilts offer the absolute security of the British government. Barring revolution, one can be certain that interest will be paid and that the capital will be repaid at face value. Certainty of return A building society investor can be certain that his capital will be returned at par value. He cannot be sure - save on a limited number of accounts for a limited period of time - of the interest rate. A gilt investor faces short term uncertainty and long term certainty. He knows the interest rate he will receive and what he will be repaid when the gilt matures. Because gilts are traded, however, in the short term his holding may be worth more or less than the capital he invested. Gilt prices normally rise when interest rates fall, and vice versa. Ease of access An instant access account at a building society is extremely convenient, provided you can get to a branch. Gilts will never be as accessible but they can be bought and sold through the Post Office. If you want to sell gilts, the proceeds will be posted within three working days. This makes gilts more accessible than a 90-day notice account. However, gilts are not suitable for frequent payment and withdrawal of odd sums to pay the gas bill. Tax The interest on both gilts and building society accounts is subject to income tax. However, it is possible to make a capital gain on gilts, which would be tax free. Non-taxpayers can receive gross interest on building society accounts; they can also do so if they buy gilts through the Post Office. Charges There are no charges for deposits or withdrawals at most building societies, although Halifax is introducing the practice for accounts with low balances. You do have to pay a charge for investing in gilts. At the post office, this is Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250 invested, with 50p for every further Pounds 125; a Pounds 10,000 investment would cost Pounds 20. You cannot invest a larger sum than that in one day through the Post Office. In any case, for large sums, you need the advice of a stockbroker. The London-based Killik would charge Pounds 146.25 for a single trade of Pounds 25,000 (though it advises spreading your investment among a few issues). There is also a small buy-sell spread, which is rarely more than a fifth of a point. Which gilts should you choose? David Kauders, a Taunton-based investment adviser, illustrated the principles in these pages a few weeks ago. Those gilts trading below par value will offer a lower income, or running yield, but the prospect of tax-free capital gain. Those trading above par value offer higher income but at the expense of capital loss. Gilts should only be acquired by those investing for the long term, although they might offer the chance for short term profits. But if you like security and a guaranteed return, they could be highly attractive.</p>

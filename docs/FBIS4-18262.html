			<p>BFN     [Text] Justice Minister Seyfi Oktay said that Election  Councils are separate from the Justice Ministry, and that the  government cannot influence these bodies.    Replying to reporters' questions in parliament today, the  justice minister said that the allegations being made are aimed  at undermining the regime. Circles that are opposed to the  democratic regime, he said, come up with such allegations.    Asked to comment on reports that ballot boxes and ballot  slips were found in garbage dumps, the minister said that it is  the High Election Council and the officials on duty during the  elections that are accountable for that. The public prosecutors  will investigate the allegations on this issue, he said, and the  judiciary will do whatever is necessary.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Decision day for Waterglade Waterglade International shareholders will today decide the fate of the lossmaking property developer at an extraordinary meeting called to oust the board, writes Simon Davies. The board claims to be close to achieving a debt restructuring with bankers, necessary for the company's survival. It had net negative worth of Pounds 10m as at November. However, rebel holders led by Mr Winston Ng, controlling 11 per cent of the company, are trying to put together a financing package, involving an immediate Pounds 6m rights issue. At the EGM, an attempt will be made to depose the three existing executive directors, and appoint Mr Ng, Mr Anthony Midgen and Mr Selwyn Midgen. Waterglade incurred a loss of Pounds 2.37m in the six months to November 1993, and Pounds 11.7m in the 14 months to the previous May. The management's refinancing plans surfaced last April, when the documents were inadvertently faxed to marketmakers by the stockbrokers involved in the deal.</p>

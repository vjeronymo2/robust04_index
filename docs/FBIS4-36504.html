			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Excerpts] Jerusalem perceives the Washington encounter as  a genuine breakthrough between Israel and Jordan. The  breakthrough was manifested in the agreement to set up working  groups on specific issues, and especially the agreement to move  the talks to Elat and al-'Aqabah.    Political elements said that following Israeli-Jordanian  contacts held before the encounter, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  consented to discuss borders -- an issue which Israel had  earlier opposed discussing -- while Jordan consented in  principle to move the talks to the region. [passage omitted]    A senior Foreign Ministry source said, however, that the  process would be long, possibly a year or two. He explained  that objective difficulties, such as border demarcation and  water resources control are part of the cause, but mainly he  based his estimates on the assumption that al-Asad will not  permit Husayn to clinch a separate deal with Israel.    What caused the turnabout in King Husayn's foreign policy?  Jerusalem elements point to several reasons. King Husayn  believes that a breakthrough on the Israeli-Syrian track is  imminent. He, too, is aware of the intensive U.S. mediation,  and he is afraid of being left out of the process. Syria, too,  finds the presence of another partner convenient. Members of  the Israeli delegation to talks with Jordan, who returned home  last night, said their impression from the encounter with the  Jordanians was that al-Asad had given Husayn a green light to  make progress, albeit up to a certain point only, because he is  not about to allow Jordan to sign a separate peace agreement.    An additional reason has to do with the Palestinians.  Husayn, who was skeptical about the Israeli-PLO agreement, is  now witnessing the implementation of that agreement, and he does  not want facts -- particularly in the economic sphere -- to be  established on the ground without his involvement and without  consideration for Jordanian interests.</p>

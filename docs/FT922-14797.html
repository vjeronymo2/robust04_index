			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee market awaits pact talks - Week in the Markets THE WORLD coffee market was marking time at the end of this week as traders awaited the start next Monday of fresh negotiations on the future of the moribund International Coffee Agreement. Hopes for the revival of the agreement's export quota system, suspended since July 1989, were given a boost last month when Brazilian growers, exporters and, finally, the government came out in favour of export controls as a means of lifting coffee prices out of the present depression. Most growers in Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, had always hankered after the return of the quota system, but the exporters, understandably, had been more interested in unfettered trade than in remunerative prices. Meanwhile the government had shown no inclination to promote consensus on the issue within the country's coffee sector, much to the frustration of other producing countries, especially Colombia, the second-biggest producer. Now that Brazil is off the fence the way seems clear for real progress to be made towards a new price-stabilisation pact. But traders said yesterday that the were not expecting a major breakthrough at next week's five-day council session, in view of the major issues that had to be settled, such as the level of individual quota shares and the question of 'selectivity' between different types of coffee. 'What we are searching for is a total consensus of producers and consumers towards launching a negotiating process for a good agreement, a sustainable agreement,' said Mr Clodoaldo Hegueney, head of the economics department at the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, after Brazil's 10-point proposal was presented at a meeting of the International Coffee Organisation working group that is studying the prospects for a new international agreement. The working group is to make recommendations to the ICO at next week's session. At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices edged higher, with the July position regaining Dollars 10 of last week's Dollars 18 fall at Dollars 869 a tonne. But trade was slow, apart from a burst of activity on Wednesday when turnover totalled 9,647 lots of five tonnes each. Yesterday's turnover of 1,328 lots was the lowest since mid-February and well below the recent average. At the London Metal Exchange base metal prices moved higher early in the week in response to more hopeful US economic indicators. The cash copper price, which was also boosted by talk of Chinese, buying broke through chart-based resistance to reach Pounds 1,300.50 a tonne at one point. Its gain was trimmed, however, partly in response to the ending after two days of a rail strike in Zambia. At yesterday's close cash copper was quoted at Pounds 1,289.50 a tonne, up Pounds 14.50 on the week. Zinc prices touched fresh 15 1/2 -month peaks early in the week before its rise was arrested by profit taking and trade selling. But the market remained underpinned by technical tightness and the cash price closed yesterday at Pounds 1,273 a tonne, up Dollars 19 on balance. Concern over the availability of good quality metal for delivery this month drove the cash tin price higher and by Wednesday's close it had established a Dollars 30 premium over the three months delivery price, having ended last week at a Dollars 2.50 discount. At that point Mr David King, the LME chief executive commented: 'We always watch all markets closely. . . some we're watching more closely than others. . . Tin falls into that category at present'. That thinly veiled warning of possible exchange action may have played a part in the subsequent unwinding of the backwardation, as the cash premium is known. At yesterday's close cash tin, which had reached Dollars 5,802.50 a tonne on Wednesday, was still Dollars 35 up on the week at Dollars 5,760 a tonne, but that represented a Dollars 5 discount against the three months position. At the London bullion market the platinum price went on a roller-coaster ride. A statement by Russia's Almazyuvelirexport saying it would retain its monopoly of exporting the white metal eased fears of an unco-ordinated flood of metal into western markets and set the price on the upward path that took it to Dollars 362.50 a troy ounce on Wednesday. But on Thursday dealers decided that the rise was overdone, and with Japanese investors selling platinum to cover equity market losses the price plunged Dollars 7.25. At yesterday afternoon's fixing it was quoted at Dollars 355.75 a tonne, up 50 cents on the day and Dollars 5.25 on the week.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------- Aluminium       +19,100  to  1,194,475 Copper          -2,300   to  296,400 Lead            -1,675   to  130,900 Nickel          +240     to  26,268 Zinc            +1,250   to  222,825 Tin             -80      to  11,910  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Ankara--At a news conference held yesterday to  discuss terrorism and the economy, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  expounded the causes of various problems and ways of resolving  them in what she described as "blunt terms."    Stating that no stability shock package will be introduced  after the local elections and that the equilibration measures  will continue, the prime minister discussed state economic  enterprises [SEE], privatization, social security institutions,  the budget deficit, devaluation, foreign trade and the country's  balance of payments in the segment of her talk allocated to the  economy. Ciller said: "If we had not enacted the tax law, the  inflation rate would be 500 percent in the year 2000." She also  said: "It was not us but the market that brought about the  devaluation. We simply made it official." Stating that the rise  in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the  Treasury, Ciller said that "the Treasury has not borrowed for  the last three months."    Ciller also insisted that there will be no early elections  even if the electoral share of the coalition government drops in  the local elections. Below are Ciller's comments on the economy  under principle headings.  <H5>  Causes of Devaluation </H5>   The underlying cause of the problems that are being  experienced today is the budget deficits that assumed high  proportions in recent years. The swelling in public spending  between 1984 and 1987 was increasingly financed through domestic  and foreign borrowing. That kept inflation from accelerating but  led to very high interest rates on domestic borrowing, which  made interest payments the largest determinant of the public  sector deficit beginning in 1988. In addition, the rise in real  wages between 1989 and 1990 boosted the public sector deficit.  The public sector borrowing requirement rose from 6.2 percent of  the GNP in 1988 to 16.3 percent in 1993. When international  capital movements were freed in 1989, increasingly larger  volumes of short-term capital began flowing in from abroad. The  financing of the public deficit with this mechanism resulted in  slower price increases and a temporary acceleration in the  growth rate.    On the other hand, the inflow of short-term capital boosted  the relative value of the Turkish currency which led to a  decline in exports and an increase in imports and upset the  balance of trade and the current account. The increase in the  public sector borrowing requirement made the control of the  money supply difficult and boosted the demand for foreign  currency. It also caused an increase in the exchange rates on  the free market leading to a 20 percent exchange rate  differential on 19 January.    Finally, the Central Bank adjusted the value of the Turkish  lira vis-a-vis foreign currencies by 12 percent on 27 January  1994 to eliminate uncertainty in the market, to prevent the  rapid rise in the exchange rate, and to control excessive  liquidity.  <H5>  People Were Not Hurt </H5>   This adjustment has helped to boost exports and to cut the  foreign trade deficit and will protect the economy from  speculative movements. The functional restoration of monetary  policy is expected to have a positive medium-term effect on  foreign trade, the growth rate, and prices.  <H5>  Foreign Trade, Balance of Payments </H5>   The ratio of exports to imports has declined steadily since  1989, and the trade deficit has grown. This was caused by the  rise in the relative value of the Turkish lira beginning in  1989, the simultaneous liberalization of the import regime and  capital movements, contractions in foreign markets, and the  decline in tourism receipts as a result of the anarchic  incidents experienced in 1993. We will reverse this course in a  positive direction by ensuring exchange rate stability and  confidence in exports, phasing in Exim Bank credits, maximizing  the utilization of this resource and primarily using it as a  source of predelivery import credits, and introducing other  incentives for secondary and marginal export products.  <H5>  Impact of Rising Real Wages </H5>   The public sector wage index declined from a baseline of 100  in 1980 to 49 in 1988. The private sector wage index dropped  from a baseline of 100 to 87 during the same interval. The  average wage in 1989 was 97 percent of its value in 1980. The  decline in real wages and salaries between 1980 and 1988 was  reversed steadily beginning in 1989, and wages increased rapidly  in subsequent years.    This rapid rise in wages and salaries boosted the share of  personnel expenditures in total public spending and had an  adverse impact on the balance of public sector spending. This  increase, which was not proportional to the growth in  productivity, created compatibility problems in the private  sector and limited employment because of the preference of  entrepreneurs for capital-intensive production.    The rise in real wages and salaries combined with the  increase in the relative value of the Turkish lira between 1989  and 1990 cut the competitiveness of export products, and exports  stalled. In this case the problem was not the high level of  wages but their excessive fluctuation between 1980 and 1993.  <H5>  New Tax Measures </H5>   We introduced new tax legislation because our revenues could  not keep up with our expenditures, because the system was not  just, and because existing legislation was very complex. As a  result of these measures the budget began to be financed with  solid resources. Also fairness was ensured by low taxes on  low-income individuals and high taxes on high-income  individuals. In addition, taxation was simplified.  <H5>  Had Tax Law Not Been Enacted </H5>   Had we not enacted the tax law, the inflation rate would  rise  to 78 percent in 1994, 95 percent in 1995, 137 percent in 1996,  and over 500 percent in 2001. That would result in a contraction  of the economy: The GNP in 2001 would be 15 percent less than  what it was in 1993. Per capita income would decline from $2,737  in 1993 to 15 percent less in 2001. The public sector deficit  would rise to 20 percent of the GNP in 2001.  <H5>  SEE Burden on Economy </H5>   The SEE's lost around 60 trillion lira in 1993. The SEE's  became bankrupt because of excessively large payrolls, large  wage increases, inadequate technology, and revenue losses as a  result of the reduction of import barriers and the real increase  in the value of the Turkish lira against foreign currencies. To  stop that, privatization measures will be speeded up. SEE's  which cannot be privatized or are found to be so will be  restructured on the basis of effectiveness and productivity.  Those laid off from work will not be allowed to suffer. The  system of unemployment insurance will be expanded, and more  employment will be created as a result of privatization. The  battle against inflation will continue.  <H5>  Social Security </H5>   The deficits of the Social Security Organization and Bag-Kur  [Social Security Association for Tradesmen, Artisans and the  Self-Employed] in 1993 were 25 trillion and 6 trillion Turkish  lira respectively. We introduced legislation to boost the  premiums and other revenues of the Social Security Organization.  We also decided to withhold 1 percent of earnings from  agricultural products for Bag-Kur.  <H5>  Agricultural Cooperatives </H5>   Agricultural cooperatives are in a morass of debt. Their  debt  totals approximately 30 trillion Turkish lira.    Municipalities had a deficit of 2.304 trillion Turkish lira  in 1991. Their total deficit is 6 trillion Turkish lira. We will  reverse this adverse situation in the municipalities through  reforms we will introduce in local governments.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: The wrong policies - Diary of a Private Investor / Derivatives can lead to huge losses I believe strongly in the benefits of insurance, and insurance-linked savings and pension schemes. But there are two new threats which may affect the value of my policies and those of millions of others. Since July 1, UK insurance companies have been allowed, in calculating their assets, to include the value of their holdings in derivatives. This might well encourage them to take a much greater part in the highly speculative and volatile markets for options, swaps and futures. Although derivatives can be useful for efficient portfolio management, the question is whether some insurers' relative lack of experience in this area could lead them into loss-making contracts. It is fairly easy to make huge losses on derivatives. Metallgesellschaft, for example, lost well over Dollars 1bn from oil derivatives, while Procter &amp; Gamble lost Dollars 157m on leveraged currency swaps. Perhaps of more interest to pension and life assurance investors is the fact that a number of US pension funds have lost big sums on derivatives. Several have dropped more than Dollars 20m each. A few years ago, I forecast in the FT that some people with endowment mortgages might have to increase their insurance premiums or face the possibility that, when their policies matured, the proceeds would be insufficient to repay the mortgage. This has proved true, with a number of companies warning of possible shortfalls because of lower investment returns. Imagine how much greater the shortfalls might be if some companies, as well as making unfortunate share and property selections, also invest in derivatives which produce losses] The second new threat is from the government, which is considering 'whether the favourable tax treatment of dividends paid to pension funds encourages companies to pay larger dividends than they might under a neutral tax regime'. This leads to one particularly pertinent question. If companies did pay less in dividends, would they really use the money saved to fund more research and development - or would they, instead, make over-generous and inappropriate take-over bids for other companies, and reward senior executives with even greater salaries and perks? If the government does make changes that affect adversely the level of dividend payments, what effect will this have on insurance companies' performance if they can no longer rely on a regular stream of good dividend income? When the chancellor unveils his Budget this month, I believe that if he wants to encourage British industry and ensure parity between pension funds and ordinary investors, he ought to give private investors the same tax breaks as the government gives to institutions, rather than tampering with existing tax reliefs. People should be encouraged to create and manage their own personal pension fund, rather than having to invest through an institution. Not so many years ago, everyone's tax return had a section labelled 'chargeable assets acquired' into which people had to list all their shares. The government should re-introduce such a section, but label it 'pension assets acquired'. People should use this to list shares and other assets, up to a specified level each year - say, a quarter or half of their average annual income. The dividends and capital gains from such assets would be given tax-free treatment so long as the assets were used eventually to provide the individual with a pension. Such personal schemes would increase greatly the percentage of shares held directly by individuals, rather than institutions. People also would save the cost of fees to pension fund managers and would have complete control over their pension assets. They would know exactly what they had invested in whereas, with existing institutionalised schemes, they have little idea - perhaps until too late - of what the fund manager has done with their money. They could also, if they wished, avoid derivatives. It is also worth reminding the government - and the opposition - that it is individual private investors who are more likely to support long-term actions by companies. And, with a few notable exceptions, it is private investors rather than institutions who are vociferous in condemning directors who get huge pay-offs for poor performance and/or undeserved salary increases. If the balance of shareholder power was swung back in favour of private investors, perhaps there might be less need to worry about 'corporate governance'. After all, a majority of private investors is much more likely to boot out a 'bad' director. Thus, two new threats could be turned into something positive instead.</p>

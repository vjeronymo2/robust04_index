			<p>BFN     [Text] The European leaders will resume consultations at  1000 [0700 GMT] today in Corfu on the appointment of a new  Commission president. The [Greek] Government spokesman stressed  that the Greek Presidency will exhaust all efforts for Jacques  Delors' successor to be appointed today.    At last night's working dinner in Akhillion Palace and  during  the second unscheduled supplementary meeting, the 12 European  state leaders were leaning toward Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene.</p>

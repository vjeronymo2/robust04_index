			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bell Canada places CDollars 1bn switch order BELL Canada, the country's biggest telecommunications utility and the main subsidiary of BCE, has ordered CDollars 1.1bn (USDollars 910m) of digital switching equipment from Northern Telecom to accelerate modernisation of the eastern Canada local network. The programme will be spread over two years. The new equipment will allow Bell Canada to introduce new services and boost revenues. The equipment includes Northern's DMS computerised switches, which are marketed worldwide. Bell Canada has already converted its long-distance operations to DMS. The contract will bolster Northern's revenues in 1992 and 1993, countering the impact of the recession on the domestic equipment market. Last year, Northern had total revenues worldwide of CDollars 8.2bn. BCE's consolidated revenues were nearly CDollars 20bn. BCE says it will not launch an appeal if federal regulators later this month decide to open up Bell Canada's monopoly of domestic long-distance telephone traffic in eastern Canada. 'If competition is the name of the game, then let's have it,' said Mr Lynton Wilson, BCE president. Several groups want to compete with Bell Canada in the long-distance market, including Unitel, owned by Rogers Communications, and Canadian Pacific.</p>

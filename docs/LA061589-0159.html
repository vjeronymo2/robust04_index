			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA'S TURMOIL HAS HONG KONG WORRIED;  </P> <P> TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO, WHICH HAS BEEN BOOMING, IS AT STAKE  </P> <P> Every day, 25,000 trucks cross the border between Hong Kong and the southern  Chinese province of Guangdong, carrying components and partly assembled  products that have helped turn the economies of those adjacent and economically  interdependent areas into booming success stories.  </P> <P> Now, makers of toys, electronics, textiles and other products based in Hong  Kong and other business centers are waiting to see whether the eruptions in  Beijing lead to damaging changes in government policies and attitudes.  </P> <P> "No one knows what is going to happen in the next couple of weeks," says Danny  Cheong, a senior executive of Maio &amp; W. (China), a Hong Kong company that  makes handbags in Dongguan City, one of Guangdong's most successful industrial  centers. "At present, the Guangdong government officials are operating on their  old orders, waiting to see if there are any new rules."  </P> <P> Confidence and economic prospects in Hong Kong would be seriously hit by a  setback in Guangdong, which has benefited more than any other part of China  from the open-door policies of the past 10 years.  </P> <P> Some Hong Kong companies that rely on Guangdong for cheap labor and readily  available industrial sites would probably collapse.  </P> <P> Between 1.5 million and 3 million Guangdong workers, supplied by Chinese  government agencies, are employed by more than 60,000 Hong Kong companies in  factories stitching hair into plastic dolls' heads, assembling toy railway  sets, laminating circuit boards and producing soft drinks, among other things.  </P> <P> At least 300,000 come from other parts of China. They are mostly young girls  earning about $80 to $160 (300 to 600 Chinese yuan) a month, well above the  roughly $40 (150 yuan) paid by state industrial companies but far below the  $400 (1,500 yuan) or more that the companies would have to pay in Hong Kong.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Creating Envy  </P> <P> The development of Guangdong, which includes three of China's four special  economic zones, has been personally backed by Zhao Ziyang, the former Chinese  Communist Party leader. Guangdong has become China's most prosperous and  freewheeling province.  </P> <P> But this has created envy in Beijing and elsewhere, and there has been  outspoken criticism of the area's independence and its life style. Thus, Zhao's  fall from power in this month's political upheaval could lead to a clampdown on  Guangdong and the purging of some liberal-minded officials.  </P> <P> The economy is so open that Hong Kong dollars are widely and officially  accepted; some local people estimate that as many as 20% of all Hong Kong's  currency notes are in use there.  </P> <P> In the special economic zone of Shenzhen, which is the most capitalist-oriented  area, officials recently were even preparing capitalist-style laws culled from  Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and the United States covering areas such as  company structures, bankruptcy, taxation and labor.  </P> <P> The province has absorbed 45% of all foreign investment going into China. About  70% of its $1.5 billion in foreign capital comes from or has been routed  through Hong Kong. This comprises direct investment in joint ventures as well  as wholly foreign-owned projects, including a float-glass plant from the United  States, Peugeot cars from France and various electronics companies from Japan.  </P> <P> These figures do not include the 60,000 businesses connected with the  processing work where materials or parts are sent from or through Hong Kong,  then sent back as finished or semi-finished goods.  </P> <P> This traffic last year accounted for 73% of Hong Kong's $4.9 billion in  domestic exports to China. It also accounted for 35% to 40% of Hong Kong's  $12.2 billion in re-exports to China of unfinished goods brought into Hong Kong  from elsewhere.  </P> <P> The Chinese government recently said Guangdong's production was rising at an  annual rate of 25% so far this year. A senior Shenzhen official said last  weekend that the favorable foreign investment climate there would continue.  There have been some disruptions and protests at government-owned factories  during the current turmoil over China's violent suppression of a student-led  movement for democracy.  </P> <P> But executives such as Cheong of Maio and Aaron Lo of Tootal China, a spinoff  of a British company that runs a factory in Guangdong, report few problems  apart from occasional transport blockages and delays in supplies from China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy Changes Possible  </P> <P> Many companies were hit last week when there were reports that the border on  the China side of the Shenzhen customs-free zone had been closed. The report  proved false, but some Hong Kong truck drivers have become unwilling to drive  very far past the border and into Guangdong. For most of last week, there were  more trucks leaving China than entering it.  </P> <P> Few if any people here believe that China will close its doors to outside  businesses, but there could be policy changes that will drive out much of  Guangdong's economic dynamism. There could also be a purge of officials or a  crackdown on corruption that would curb such lucrative practices as  under-invoicing or receiving bribes for official favors. In addition, railway  problems might impede coal supplies to power stations, worsening already  serious electricity shortages.  </P> <P> Guangdong officials visited Hong Kong recently to stress to Hopewell Holdings,  a local company involved in road and power-station projects across the border,  that they do not want work to stop. That illustrates the interrelationship  between the two places that neither side wants to see ended, whatever may  happen in Beijing.  </P></p>

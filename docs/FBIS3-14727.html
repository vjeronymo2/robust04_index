At the same time, neither has it displayed any  animosity. Of late, however, there has been a rapid change in  the situation. The United States is doing everything possible to  embarrass India. Why is it so furious against India? The sole  reason is that, being an international policeman, it thinks that  India has not become its consummate slave. Moreover, India's  progress in South Asia as well as its overall development, which  befits a global superpower, also irritates the United States.    Right from the Nehru era, only the Soviet Union maintained a  close friendship and gave protection to India. The United  States was unhappy with India as it was leaning toward the  Soviet Union when both the Soviet Union and the United States  were superpowers. Therefore, whoever became U.S. president, he  maintained a moderate level of friendship with India. They  never provoked India unnecessarily. Similarly, while being  friendly with the Soviet Union, India never neglected the United  States. It maintained an equal level of friendship with both  countries.    The situation started changing after the Soviet Union was  fragmented in 1992. Some change occurred in the moderate level  of friendship that existed between 1941 and 1991. At the same  time, India improved its ties with the United States without  sacrificing its right of individuality. The stance adopted by  India during the Gulf War a shortwhile before the break up of  the Soviet Union pacified the United States. The then prime  minister Chandrashekhar permitted the American warplanes, which  took part in the Gulf war, to refuel in India. Although the  opposition leader Rajiv Gandhi protested and the event created  some turmoil, the Gulf War came to an end by then and the United  States emerged victorious. Besides appreciating India for its  cooperation, the United States came forward to strengthen its  ties with India.    As a result, Indo-U.S. joint military exercises were  organized. The commanders of the armed forces of the two  countries met and held discussions. During the war in  Afghanistan, the United States was lending support to the Afghan  militants through Pakistan. Although Pakistan acted with silly  intentions to neglect India, the United States did not endorse  it. Moreover, when the Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan  and Najibollah relinquished his presidency, the United States  delinked itself from Pakistan. The resolution moved by Senator  Larry Pressler to declare Pakistan a terrorist state and  withhold all assistance because of its support to terrorists in  Kashmir and Punjab was passed. An ultimatum was also issued to  Pakistan that it would be declared a terrorist state, unless it  mends its ways.    At this juncture, U.S. presidential elections were held by  the end of 1992. George Bush was expected to be re-elected as  the president. He was defeated and Bill Clinton became  president. Some political observers predicted that India will  have problems as long as Bill Clinton is the president. This  was proved right. As soon as President Clinton took office, he  indirectly made it clear that he is antagonistic toward India.  He discreetly said that if India does not cooperate with (obey)  the United States in its efforts to establish global peace, the  U.S. will resort to other means.    What President Clinton said came true. The Soviet Union  collapsed and the United States now is the only superpower in  the world. President Clinton is prepared to tell the world that  all countries should obey the United States and whoever does not  obey will have to meet the fate of Libya, Cuba, or Iraq. He,  who vetoed the decision to declare Pakistan a terrorist state,  has extended assistance to that country and started using it as  a tool against India.    Everything is under the grip of the United States, whether  it  is the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, or the  United Nations. When it imposed certain regulations, India  endorsed some of them -- those with which it could cope and were  deemed appropriate. Opposition parties accused Rao of  introducing the economic liberalization program only per the  dictates of the World Bank. It is true to a certain extent.  The World Bank gave directives toward the establishment of a  market economy in order to pave the way for implementing a  privatization program, which is aimed at real economic growth  rather than create a wrong precedence by granting unnecessary  subsidies and concessions. As this program was deemed  appropriate, Rao introduced it.    Then came the compulsion to accept the Dunkel proposals. It  is nothing, but granting royalty to a country for a commodity  which solely originates from that country. Although we have to  grant royalty to the United States for some particular  pharmaceuticals, we stand to gain in several ways. Agriculture  will not be affected. Only after realizing this did the  government accept the Dunkel proposals.    The United States, however, is exerting pressure on India to  sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. The United  States thinks that if India signs the treaty, it can enslave  India by crippling its military might. The treaty does not say  anything about destroying nuclear weapons from the developed  countries or to prevent their manufacture. India has insisted  for the past few years that it will not sign a treaty which is  aimed at crippling only the developing countries. This alone  enraged the United States.    Then again, the United States has not given up the intention  of setting up a military base in India. It has been nurturing  this intention for several years. When India sensed this, it  decided not to have any military exercises or strengthen its  military ties with the United States. India's frontier regions  are best suited to conduct military exercises or launch  offensives from land, sea, or hilly terrains. Hence, the United  States also wants to browbeat China by establishing bases in  India, especially on its border with Kashmir by upgrading its  military ties with India. India has not accepted this.    India's advancement in missile technology has also amplified  the irritation of the United States. The successive  accomplishments in the testing of Agni and Prithvi missiles have  intensified President Clinton's indignation against India.    Under these circumstances only, President Clinton  unnecessarily raked up the Punjab and Kashmir issues. Where  there is a gradual return of peace in Punjab, he spoke about the  deprivation of the rights of the Sikhs. His statements about  the violation of human rights in Kashmir and about his readiness  to assist the terrorists have dismayed India to an unprecedented  level. So far, no president has raked up the issue of Kashmir  or Punjab in such a silly manner just because India is not their  slave. Similarly, they did not encourage Pakistan after  describing it a terrorist state. Now, Clinton has done it.  Indian experts are of the opinion that it is not going to bring  any change.    India has begun to protect itself and to improve its growth  without caring about the United States. Like China and Japan,  it is ready now to speak with dignity and honor at international  fora. The Kashmir issue, however, is a stumbling block in this  regard. The central government believes that if terrorists are  dealt with and elections held in Kashmir, normalcy can be  restored there through democratic rule. However, although the  United States will not create a big headache for India over  Kashmir, it will not fail to use it as leverage to coerce India  to sign the NPT.    Indo-U.S. ties deriorated to such an extent only after  President Clinton assumed office. He is not going to yield,  whatever peace efforts India makes. As long as he continues in  office, there will not be any dearth of problems. It is a  matter of two and a half years only. After that a new president  will come to power. The American people always have regards for  India. They would like to maintain friendship with India. On  this score, we believe that the crack in Indo-U.S. ties is of a  temporary nature.</p>

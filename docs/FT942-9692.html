			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Receivers may sue advisers on Astra Litigation seeking compensation on the collapse of Astra Holdings, the munitions company connected to the Iraqi supergun affair, is likely in the next few weeks against its professional advisers. Lawyers engaged by the partners at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who are the receivers to Astra, are believed to be preparing potential legal actions against Stoy Hayward, the auditors, and Paine Webber, its merchant bank. Separately, the joint disciplinary scheme, the accountancy profession's highest regulatory body, confirmed yester-day that it had begun an investigation into Astra, which was subject to a critical Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the senior diplomats at the British Embassy  in Tehran has been given one month to leave Iran. The action  has been taken by the Iranian Foreign Ministry after it was  discovered that the British diplomat was involved in activities  incompatible with the diplomatic norms. The said diplomat was  under surveillance for quite some time, but his expulsion orders  came in what can be termed as a retaliatory measure.    The British foreign office minister, Mr. Douglas Hogg, who  still thinks he is living in the British Empire era, has become  angry over Tehran's retaliatory measure and has made certain  remarks that reflect his wrath. The irresponsible remarks made  by Mr. Hogg on Wednesday indicate the fact that London still  wants to live with its past dreams. Mr. Hogg does not accept  the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran is an independent  country whose foreign policy is based on the principle of  protecting the interests of the Muslim world as well as the  national interests of Islamic Iran.    However, the expression of such illogical remarks by British  officials is not something new, and once again the straining of  the Tehran-London ties is also not something that has happened  recently. Mr. Hogg is well aware of the fact that, contrary to  all diplomatic norms, the intelligence agents of his government  had planted bugging devices inside the embassy of the Islamic  Republic of Iran in London. But, instead of tendering an  apology to the Iranian Government, Mr. Hogg has made  controversial remarks.    The British, who always practice the policy of divide and  rule, and ruled the world for centuries on the basis of the same  policy, know how much the Muslim world hates the policies of the  British Governments. The installing of the aggressive Israeli  regime has been carried out directly by Britain. Its policies  and activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina today are wholly  anti-Islamic and the British forces in Bosnia and the former  Yugoslavia are inflicting blows on Islam and the Muslims.    The London government is sinking in the quagmire of domestic  problems these days and Mr. John Major's government is  witnessing the gradual demise of the British Government.  Rampant unemployment has turned the country into a big house of  the beggars.    We advise Mr. Douglas Hogg that, instead of creating such a  negative climate and making such irresponsible remarks, he  should officially tender an apology to the Islamic Republic of  Iran's Government for the illegal activities of the British  diplomat in Tehran and for the illegal act of his government in  bugging the Iranian embassy, which is against all diplomatic  norms.    Mr. Hogg should also accept the reality that the golden era  of London's domination in the Middle East is long over.</p>

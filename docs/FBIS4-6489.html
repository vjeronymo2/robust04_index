			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Newspapers here today  dedicate signed articles to the 30th anniversary of the opening  of diplomatic relations between Korea and Indonesia.    Over the past 30 years after the establishment of diplomatic  relations the friendly relations between the two countries have  developed favourably, NODONG SINMUN notes, and says:    The two countries, member nations of the non-aligned  movement  in Asia have supported each other politically and cooperated  with each other economically. The friendly relations between  Korea and Indonesia are conducive to building a new society in  the two countries as well as an independent and peaceful, new  Asia.    The Indonesian Government is steadfastly keeping to an  independent stand, rejecting the imperialists' intervention in  its internal affairs.    Indonesia, the chairman state of the non-alignment, is  playing a positive role in broadening and developing this  movement, and, together with Asean nations, are working hard to  ensure Asean prosperity and security in the Asia-Pacific region.    The Korean people fully support the principle and stand  maintained by the Indonesian people in building a new society.    MINJU CHOSON says the Korean people express the belief that  the friendly and cooperative relations between Korea and  Indonesia would further develop and wish the Indonesian people  greater success in their future work for national prosperity.</p>

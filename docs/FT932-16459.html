			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Patten vows to improve skills base INTRODUCTION of vocational education for 16-to-19-year-olds in full-time education is to be speeded up in the drive to improve the country's skill base, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday. Mr Patten, who has given a much higher public profile to vocational qualifications in recent weeks, told the Institute of Directors he would like to see vocational qualifications developing into mainstream qualifications, catering for up to half the age group. Ambitious goals were essential if the UK was to meet the national targets for achievement of vocational and educational qualifications set by the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Patten said that a number of alternative qualification routes were needed in order to meet the national targets. He stressed his commitment to retaining 'all that was best in the A-level system' but said a central objective was to provide people with an attractive vocational alternative. The new National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were designed to do this. The first GNVQs - in art and design, business, health and social care, leisure and tourism and manufacturing - are being piloted in about 100 colleges and schools. Mr Patten said he wanted GNVQs in at least two subjects to be available in at least 1,500 schools and colleges by 1996. Pupils could take GNVQs alongside GCSEs and A-levels. 'Vocational education has in the past been held in low esteem,' said Mr Patten. 'We need to attack ingrained cultural attitudes that regard practical and applied studies as inferior to theoretical A-level courses. We need to promote parity of esteem between vocational and academic qualifications.' Mr Patten said employers had an important part to play and he hoped they would all ensure that recruitment decisions and advertising material gave due credit to GNVQ achievement. Young people, he said, were sophisticated and could read signals from the employment market. 'If they think that employers value higher levels of education and skills, and are prepared to reward them, they will aim for those higher levels. If they think that employers value the vocational routes they will follow these routes.' The Institute of Personnel Management has questioned whether numerical targets for education and vocational qualifications will be adequate to generate the skills needed to sustain the UK as an economic force in the 21st century. Mr David Wright, vice-president of the institute, which has welcomed the targets in principle, said in Personnel Management, the monthly magazine, that there needed to be a more strategic approach to the types of skills required. He said: 'Relying on local labour market intelligence to match immediate local demand for and supply of skills is fine, but there needs to be a more strategic national and long-term focus.' It was to be regretted that such a role was outside the remit of the new employer-led advisory body on the targets. A central role of the new body, the National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets, is to persuade employers in England and Wales to take up national vocational qualifications. Mr Wright said NVQs would not be welcomed by employers if they were perceived to increase the price of training over and above present expenditure and if they added to bureaucracy.</p>

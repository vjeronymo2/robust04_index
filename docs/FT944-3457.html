			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Contemplating a long engagement - Norma Cohen on the prospective Morgan Stanley/Warburg merger In exhibiting the virtues of a Morgan Stanley/SG Warburg merger, executives at both investment banks point to their asset management arms. The combined entity - should it ever be created - would have roughly Dollars 150bn (Pounds 91bn) under management, making it the eighth largest US fund manager and the single largest American manager of institutional money. Moreover, the strengths of the two organisations complement each other; where MAM is strong, Morgan Stanley is non-existent, and the sectors where MAM has been weak are among Morgan Stanley's strongest selling points. But melding two discrete fund management companies, each with their own approach to investment and loyal band of clients, is easier said than done. Indeed, it now appears that, at least initially, the two fund management arms will continue as separate businesses which benefit from their close relationship. 'In the early stages, we think it should be independent,' said one Morgan Stanley official. 'We will have to see how the co-ordination and the synergy work before putting the two together,' he added. For one thing, a full merger would require the permission of Morgan's institutional clients, who under US rules must agree to a change of ownership of their fund manager. Meanwhile, at MAM, senior executives enjoy managerial autonomy which they would be reluctant to surrender. Moreover, MAM's largest clients, many of whom are also shareholders of MAM and Warburg, are anxious that the merger does not spark the flight of the most talented fund managers. But analysts and pension consultants say that there are indeed synergies which would be created by a merger of the two fund management units. Morgan Stanley, for instance, has only a handful of European clients, and most of its clients are based in the US. MAM, by contrast, manages relatively little money in the US, and much of that is mandates to manage non-dollar fixed-interest portfolios. Its strength is concentrated in the UK, and about two thirds of the Pounds 62.7bn in total assets is managed for UK institutional clients. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is a relative newcomer to the retail market, only in the past year launching a range of US mutual funds which now have about Dollars 500m under management. MAM, by contrast, has launched an aggressive campaign into the retail sector with an impressive array of unit and investment trusts both in the UK and overseas. Moreover, in performance terms, Morgan Stanley's strengths are MAM's weaknesses, according to pension consultants who scrutinise fund managers' returns. While MAM has turned in above-average performance in UK equities, in general, its investment in overseas equities has been below average for each of the past five years, according to data from Combined Actuarial Performance Services. 'What MAM definitely needs is a credible overseas presence,' said one pension consultant. For one thing, MAM 'did not go thumping into emerging markets' - an area which Morgan Stanley's fund management arm has specialised in - and it has also had particular problems with stock selection in the US and Japan. While MAM is said to be disputing its overseas performance data, saying it accounts differently for costs than other fund managers, its clients too have noticed some weaknesses. 'Overall, they haven't been too bad,' said one client, noting that there had been particular problems with stock selection in some regions. Meanwhile, Morgan has made little headway in attracting European business, particularly the key UK institutional fund management market. It is obvious that the mechanics of a merger could leave key members of each firm's senior management - and its star fund managers - unhappy. Both Warburg and Morgan Stanley are surely likely to opt for two expanding fund management businesses, than a larger one in danger of imploding.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Top asset managers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank                                           Funds under management                                                 Dec 1993 (Dollars bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   1      Fidelity Management &amp; Research                324.7   2      PNC Bank                                      192.5   3      Bankers Trust                                 164.2   4      Metropolitan Life                             162.0   5      Merrill Lynch                                 159.9   6      Wells Fargo Nikko                             154.7   7      State Street                                  132.5   8      Combined                                      130.4   9      Vanguard Group                                127.9  10      Alliance Capital                              115.3  16      Mercury Asset Management                       83.2  42      Morgan Stanley Asset Management                47.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

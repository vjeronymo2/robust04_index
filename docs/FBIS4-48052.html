			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with General Constand Viljoen, leader </F> of the Freedom Front, by reporter Jan Taljaard "this week";  place not given]    [Text] Peaceful co-existence between the Afrikaner and  other South Africans and a constitutional solution for the  Afrikaner are the immediate objectives Freedom Front [FF] leader  General Constand Viljoen is setting for himself in a government  of national unity.    In an interview this week Viljoen shed some light on how he  views the future and how he plans to further the cause of what  he calls "Afrikaner self-determination".    A prerequisite will be to win the confidence of the new  rulers and to convince them that the FF is sincere in its desire  for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] and peace.    "The concept of self-determination is new to Nelson Mandela.    To bring the true meaning of this concept home, there must  be peace and there must be straight talking. Mandela must have  full confidence in the leadership of the Afrikaner people or  else it will not work," he says.    On how he plans to sell the volkstaat to an ANC-dominated  government of national unity, Viljoen said the issue should not  be forced.    "We will have to convince Mandela that self-determination is  the real desire of the Afrikaner. When I decided to opt for the  peaceful way it was because I knew that the hostilities  generated by war will take too long to heal," he says.    He is adamant a volkstaat could "easily" have been taken by  force, but that this course of action would have caused  divisions almost impossible to heal.    The achievement of a volkstaat by peaceful means will  necessarily take time, he said, emphasising that the concept of  a future volkstaat will have to revolve around political  independence and economical interdependence.    "We do not want to repeat the black homelands in a white  homeland. They were never economically viable."    To achieve Afrikaner dominance in a volkstaat, Viljoen  envisages a gradual resettlement programme that may take from 20  to 25 years.    In this regard he likes to mention the example of the state  of Israel that started out with about 650,000 settlers in 1948.    "But at the same time we would not like to withdraw the  Afrikaner out of the South African community."    Viljoen says the volkstaat must become an Israel to  Afrikaners living outside its borders. Even if they do not live  there they can always look to it as the home of Afrikaner  nationalism.    But if it is all about perceptions can't the Afrikaner  preserve his heritage without a volkstaat? "No, it must be  real," says Viljoen.    Viljoen shies away from the issue of whether blacks will be  accorded citizenship in a volkstaat. "That remains the subject  of negotiations and there are many possibilities," he says.    "One of these may be to entrench 25 percent of the seats in  a  national assembly for black representatives."    Viljoen won't be drawn on a possible position for himself in  a new government. "I will only talk about it when the offer is  actually made to me," he says.    But what if, for instance, he is offered the position of  defence minister? If such a position can further the cause of  peace in which the interests of the Afrikaner can be pursued, he  will definitely consider it, he says.    He says it will take a minimum of five years before a new  and  integrated defence force can be properly established. In the  meantime the bulk of the existing armed forces still lies in the  commando and citizen forces.    "The armed forces will be of great importance to stabilise  the situation during the next five years," he says. "And if I  can play a role in ensuring that, I will do it."</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Ex-MoD official found guilty over Pounds 1.5m bribes A FORMER director of the Ministry of Defence ammunition procurement department was found guilty yesterday of taking Pounds 1.5m in backhanders from arms companies in what is thought to be Britain's biggest corruption case. Mr Gordon Foxley, 69, was convicted of 12 charges of corruption at Snaresbrook crown court in east London. He was allowed Pounds 100,000 bail until December 10, when he will be sentenced. Judge Andrew Brooks warned Mr Foxley, who retired in 1984, that he faced the very real prospect of jail. The judge ordered a report on his assets with a view to confiscating them. Mr Foxley's Pounds 20,000-a-year job involved awarding contracts for supplies of mortar bomb fuses, rockets, tracer rounds and other ammunition for the armed services, principally the Army. He fed most of these to three companies, Fiat subsidiary Fratelli Borletti of Milan; Gebruder Junghans, based in Schramberg, Germany; and AS Raufoss, which has offices in Gjovik, Norway. In return they paid him backhanders or commissions of up to 5 per cent of the value of the deals. The amounts - Pounds 400,000 in one case - were first sent to companies Mr Foxley either owned or ran. He then had the cash transferred to secret Swiss bank accounts. A four-year investigation failed to recover the cash.</p>

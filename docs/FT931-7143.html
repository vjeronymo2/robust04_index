			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Midland calls for subsidised bank loans MR Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, last night called for the government to subsidise banks to provide loans to small businesses, and to give tax breaks to individuals to provide new forms of equity finance. It is the first time a bank chief executive has publicly indicated that losses suffered by banks on small business lending may lead to them limiting their exposure to small companies unless they receive public subsidies. Mr Pearse admitted that banks had sometimes 'pulled the rug too soon' from under struggling small companies. But he said tax incentives were needed because otherwise the return on equity capital for small businesses was not high enough. Banks have grown increasingly worried at these losses. National Westminster this week disclosed that nearly half of its Pounds 1.3bn provisions for possible bad debts in UK branch banking in 1992 were on loans of less than Pounds 50,000. Mr Pearse, speaking at the City University Business School last night, said the government should promote a partnership between itself, businesses and banks rather than the three 'being caught up in a rather sterile slanging match'. Mr Pearse called for two government innovations to attract more debt and equity finance to small businesses: A 'manufacturing support scheme' which would give tax breaks to individuals to provide equity finance to small businesses. This would overcome the obstacle of the small size of such investments and the poor risks associated with them. A Pounds 70m loan support scheme that would act as a form of subsidy to industry. The government would provide support to banks to allow them to offer medium and long-term loans to companies at 1 per cent over base rate. Mr Pearse said that unless the government, banks and businesses found answers to the financial difficulties facing business, failures would remain at unacceptable levels and viable businesses would fail to achieve their potential. He called for a review of the tax regime to favour business owners who retain profits within their company. At present the tax laws encourage business owners to take out profits and put them into pension investments. He said legislation should give suppliers a statutory right to interest on the late payment of debt. The government should also alter the Loan Guarantee Scheme to raise cover provided by the guarantee from 70 per cent to 80 per cent. The banks, for their part, should be more willing to take equity or equity options in businesses and should make more long-term loan finance available, Mr Pearse said. Businesses, meanwhile, should be more willing to set aside funds to build up equity and make more use of long-term loans.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The electronics  industry has been booming in the Chinese capital city, making it  China's fourth largest producer of electronics products, an  official from the municipal office of the electronics industry  said.    The official said Thursday [19 May] that Beijing turned out  9.2 billion yuan (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) in electronics  products in 1993, which resulted in 1.8 billion yuan (200  million U.S. dollars) in profits.    The electronics industry was tabbed as one of the three  pillar industries in Beijing in 1988. Since then, the  municipality has reorganized more than 10 loss-making  electronics enterprises to make the best use of resources and  developed such advanced products as telephone switchboards,  color tv tubes, color television, microcomputers and video  cassette recorders.    As a result, the city has established itself in the  development of telecommunications, broadcasting and television,  computers, electronic circuits and electronic instruments. It  has also become China's largest producer of telephone  switchboards and microcomputers.    Foreign investment has played an important role in this  development. Now some 100 foreign-funded electronics joint  ventures are located in Beijing, bringing in a total investment  of 65 million U.S. dollars last year alone.    Beijing Matsushita Color CRT [Cathode-Ray Tube] Co. Ltd.,  one  such joint venture, has entered China's 10 best foreign-funded  enterprise list by producing 1.56 billion yuan in output value.  A Sino-German joint venture also established itself as the  largest producer in telephone switchboards in the electronics  industry.    Besides the foreign-funded enterprises, a number of computer  giants like "Stone," "Jinghai," and "Kehai" are engaged in the  production of computers, softwares, printers, Xerox machines,  and fax machines.    Board card sales by the "Legend Group," another blue chip  computer company, make up 10 percent of the international  market. The Chinese version of "Express Publisher" by the  Beijing University Founder Group Corporation is hailed as one of  the top publishing software programs in the world. Currently,  the software covers 60 percent of China's domestic market and  has also sold well in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.</p>

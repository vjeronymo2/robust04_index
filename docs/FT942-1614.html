			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BTP jumps 48% to Pounds 30.3m - Speedy input from MTM purchase and good start to current year BTP, the speciality chemicals group which paid Pounds 106.7m for most of MTM's assets a year ago, beat City expectations with a 48 per cent jump in annual pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 30.3m. Earnings per share of 15.8p (12.7p) topped the previous record of 15.4p set in 1991. Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, described the figures for the 12 months to March 31 as 'not a bad performance' considering that most of the group's markets were in recession for a large part of the year. 'The results from the MTM acquisition have come through more quickly than the market anticipated.' The shares rose 8 1/2 p to 309 1/2 p, helped by Mr Buckley's comments on trading: 'There has been an encouraging start to the current year and there are positive signs that the recessionary conditions experienced in a number of our markets are now behind us.' The MTM assets contributed profits of Pounds 7.76m in nine months on sales of Pounds 56.8m out of total group turnover up Pounds 81m at Pounds 289.8m. US operations had performed 'very much better than expected'. BTP introduced some of its biocides, leather and textiles chemicals into the MTM plants in the US, replacing UK imports which attract duty of more than 16 per cent. US sales were also boosted by BTP's new industrial biocide in the last quarter. Annual growth in the global industrial biocide market is about 15 per cent, largely due to environmental pressures. Profits from biocides and fine chemicals jumped to Pounds 12m (Pounds 4.84m), including Pounds 5.35m from the MTM assets. Sales more than doubled to Pounds 81.1m. Performance chemicals, which includes tanning products, contributed Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 5.79m). The mainly UK-based industrial division turned in Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 4.21m) but adhesives and textile coatings slipped to Pounds 5.66m (Pounds 6.49m). A 6.55p final dividend gives a 10p (9.3p) total, covered 1.6 times. Mr Buckley said the long-term aim was for dividends to be twice covered by earnings. COMMENT Shareholders who supported last year's rights issue at 185p have been well rewarded for their faith. The MTM deal has paid off as predicted, giving BTP under-used capacity almost tailor-made for its needs. The full benefits are yet to come and combined with strong growth in areas such as industrial biocides and recovery in other markets BTP looks well-placed for the next couple of years. Assuming profits of about Pounds 39m this year, the shares are trading on 16 times forward earnings. Not expensive for the sector and there is a yield of 4 per cent.</p>

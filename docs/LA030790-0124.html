			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL BASKETBAL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> DIVISION III GIRLS;  </P> <P> MCDANIEL SETS BREA-OLINDA RECORD  </P> <P> It was a game for Brea-Olinda High School's Aimee McDaniel to remember. But it  might better be described as a game San Diego Lincoln would like to forget.  </P> <P> McDaniel scored 19 points and broke the the Brea-Olinda career girls' scoring  mark, and the Lady Cats scored 35 consecutive points en route to a 66-32  victory in a first round Southern California Regional basketball playoffs  Division III game.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda (31-0), which won Southern Section 3A and state Division III  championships last season, will play host to Lemoore (21-7) in Thursday's  semifinals.  </P> <P> McDaniel scored her record-breaking 1,779th point early in the first quarter  Tuesday, breaking a mark set by Carrie Egan, who played at Brea-Olinda from  1984-87. The game was stopped briefly and McDaniel, a senior, was presented the  game ball.  </P> <P> "It was a super moment," said Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh, whose team won its  53rd consecutive game. "This was her night."  </P> <P> It certainly wasn't Lincoln's.  </P> <P> Lincoln (16-7), the San Diego Section Division III runner-up, scored late in  the first quarter to cut Brea-Olinda's lead to 14-6. But Lincoln suffered  through a scoreless second quarter, missing nine field goals and four free  throws, and did not score again until early in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda's press caused the most problems for Lincoln, which committed 31  turnovers.  </P> <P> While Lincoln was struggling, Brea-Olinda was scoring in bunches . . . and  bunches.  </P> <P> McDaniel scored on a layup, which set the record, and added a three-point  basket to start the Lady Cats' run. By halftime, Brea-Olinda led, 47-6.  </P> <P> "This was our night," McDaniel said. "We came in really psyched. We were at  home, with our fans and we didn't think anything could beat us. We came in and  everything clicked."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Lincoln struggled with the fundamentals. Lincoln committed 31  turnovers, including 20 in the first half, and was two of 19 from the  free-throw line.  </P> <P> "If you don't make your free throws and have too many turnovers, you can't  play," Lincoln Coach Dorothy Robinson said. "My girls have to stop letting the  officials upset them."  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda took its biggest lead at 58-10 with about five minutes left in the  third quarter. Trakh pulled his starters soon after taking the 48-point lead.  </P> <P> Guard Tammy Blackburn, who had several steals to lead Brea-Olinda's pressure  defense, scored 15 points. Sheila Dixon, a 6-foot-3 junior, led Lincoln with 18  points and 16 rebounds.  </P> <P> "This is the way we're going to have to play every night if we want to win  state again," McDaniel said.  </P></p>

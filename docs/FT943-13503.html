			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Algoma Steel rebounds strongly Algoma Steel, restructured in 1992 at the height of the recession, is rebounding strongly. It has been boosted this year by rising demand for sheet and most of its other products, higher prices and a lower Canadian dollar. In the second quarter to June 30, net profit was CDollars 33.2m (USDollars 24.1m), or Dollars 1.26 a share, against a loss of Dollars 4.5m, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 7 per cent to Dollars 262m. It was the fourth consecutive quarterly profit for Algoma, which produces about 2m tonnes annually. In the first half the group recorded net profit of Dollars 49.2m, or Dollars 1.87 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 22.3m, or 85 cents, a year earlier, on revenues which advanced to Dollars 528m from Dollars 446m. Algoma said rolled products continued to perform strongly and volume was improving in tubular products and structurals. 'The first half is indicative for the rest of the year,' said Mr Glen Manchester, finance director. Algoma hopes to list its stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the third quarter. It was delisted during its 1992 reorganisation.</p>

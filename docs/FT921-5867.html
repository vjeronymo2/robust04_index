			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Fax of life Staff at the Central Statistical Office are clearly trying to impress their new boss, Australia's Bill McLennan, who takes over as Britain's top number-cruncher today. The Australian economy might not be up to much, but its statistics are jolly good and there are high hopes that Mclennan will be able to work the same sort of magic at a CSO which has had trouble shaking off its dozey image. So will the gung-ho Australian be impressed by the CSO's latest innovation - Statfax? In what could be another cruel blow to London's dwindling army of motorbike messengers, the CSO is now offerring to fax important statistical press releases within minutes of publication. A list of publication dates for economic statistics can be obtained by polling 0336 416046 from a fax machine. Unfortunately, Observer was unable to understand the footnotes to the CSO's Statfax instructions.</p>

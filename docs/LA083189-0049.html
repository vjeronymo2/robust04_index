			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE RAP ON THE FLAP OVER FLIPPER  </P> <P> In response to "The Flipper Flap" (by Lynn Smith, Aug. 16), I am one who holds  that swimming with captured dolphins is a pleasure won at much too high a cost.  It is telling that the human beings so eager to experience the unique  gentleness of these creatures are willing to do so at the expense of their  freedom.  </P> <P> Prisoners, no matter how petted and loved -- no matter how docile -- still  remain in jail. What crimes did these amazing and loving animals commit to be  thus incarcerated? They are not our toys or playthings.  </P> <P> Ironically, we may yet come to learn this through the dolphins themselves, who  within the confines of their servitude, tweak our consciences by their  nobility, their captured spirits hovering over our vacation fun.  </P> <P> CATHERINE R. LEACH  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

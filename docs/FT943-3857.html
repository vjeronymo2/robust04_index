			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / UK Company News: TLG planning autumn debut - Former Thorn EMI offshoot likely to be valued at more than Pounds 225m TLG, the holding company for the Thorn Lighting group, is planning to come to market later this autumn through a placing and public offer likely to value the former Thorn EMI subsidiary at more than Pounds 225m. The flotation of TLG, Europe's second largest supplier of professional lighting equipment and systems after Philips of the Netherlands, will be one of the biggest in a busy autumn new issue calendar for the Stock Exchange. In August last year, TLG was the subject of a Pounds 171.5m management buy-out led by Mr Hamish Bryce, TLG's executive chairman, and backed by Investcorp, the Bahrain-based international investment bank. Thorn EMI retained a 12 per cent stake in the business while the management team took a 3 per cent holding, which could rise to about 13 per cent subject to the exercise of stock options. Thorn Lighting's origins go back to 1928 when Sir Jules Thorn founded the Electric Lamp Services Company in London. The lamp bulb manufacturing business was finally sold to General Electric in 1991 leaving TLG - renamed to avoid confusion with its former parent - as a dedicated fittings manufacturer. TLG is expected to raise between Pounds 70m and Pounds 80m of new money through the flotation which will initially be mainly used to reduce TLG's Pounds 100m net debt. Investcorp and Thorn EMI are expected to retain most of their shares following the flotation. The group, headquartered in Spennymoor, County Durham where it also has a state of the art manufacturing facility, has operations in 23 countries, including manufacturing facilities in eight, and has more than 4,000 employees world-wide. Among the large projects undertaken by TLG are lighting the Tower of London and the Sydney Opera House. It is the market leader for commercial industrial, public and industrial light fittings in the UK, where it has about a 23 per cent market share, and the Nordic region and has strong positions in the French and German markets. It is also a market leader in Australasia and has a strong base in the fast growing Chinese and south east Asian markets. Despite the recession, which has affected all the group's main markets including the Pounds 2.8bn European market, TLG's profitability has grown rapidly in recent years helped by cost reductions, the introduction of modern management and production techniques and sharply improved productivity. The company's Spennymoor factory, which employs 1,050, has won a raft of awards and was recently named best factory in the north-east in a competition run by the Cornfield School of Management and the Department of Trade of Industry. Over the past three years, the workforce has been cut by 22 per cent, three factories have been closed and a 24-hour European distribution hub has been established in Brussels. As a result, turnover per head has risen by 30 per cent and profit per head by 135 per cent. Meanwhile, tight financial management means that working capital has been reduced while investment in new product development has been stepped up and product portfolio has been updated. As a result, sales of new products launched since 1992 are expected to account for about 40 per cent of UK sales this year. Overall operating profits have increased by 85 per cent from Pounds 11m in the year to March 31 1992 to Pounds 20.4m in the latest period (to March 31 1994) on flat turnover of Pounds 324m, reflecting the recession and intense competition. As TLG's main markets, including continental Europe, begin to show signs of recovery, Mr Bryce says the group is poised for strong organic growth which could in some markets, for example in Germany, be augmented by acquisitions, though he insists there is nothing planned at present. At the time of the management buy-out, TLG had been expected to come to market by about 1996. Mr Bryce, who joined Thorn Lighting in 1986 and has overseen the transformation of the business, says the accelerated timetable reflects the success of the group in boosting its financial performance, and the favourable market conditions. 'We believe now is an appropriate time to obtain a listing of TLG's shares. The flotation will reduce the group's indebtedness and enhance growth prospects,' Mr Bryce said. The issue is sponsored by Kleinwort Benson and the joint stockbrokers to the issue are Cazenove and Kleinwort Benson Securities.</p>

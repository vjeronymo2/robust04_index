			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENSPAN SEES SLOWDOWN IN LEVERAGED BUYOUTS  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Saturday that he believes  the number of leveraged buyouts of companies has started to subside, but a  panel of business experts disagreed, contending that many more large companies  would be takeover targets.  </P> <P> Greenspan expressed his view at a closed-door meeting of the Business Council,  a group of 65 top executives of the nation's biggest corporations assembled for  their spring meeting here.  </P> <P> The Fed chief refused to comment to reporters afterward on leveraged buyouts or  on any other topic, especially the moderate 0.4% rise in the producer price  index for April that sent the stock market soaring Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oppose Fed Restraints  </P> <P> Many of the corporation executives hope the Federal Reserve will refrain from  further restraints on growth of the money supply, which they fear may trigger a  recession. Greenspan "ducked a question" on his views about whether inflation  has been checked by the Fed's recent tightening of monetary policy, one of his  listeners said.  </P> <P> Other participants in the session discussed Greenspan's views on leveraged  buyouts -- the controversial practice of corporate raiders making acquisitions  through heavy borrowing.  </P> <P> A panel of business leaders differed with Greenspan's conclusion, however,  indicating that they felt the use of such buyouts would be "accelerating" in  the future, even though the trend could not be sustained indefinitely.  </P> <P> David M. Roderick, chairman of USX Corp., said: "There's a tremendous amount of  cash out there to keep leveraged buyouts going for some time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Airline a Target  </P> <P> A manager of pension funds from Los Angeles, Robert G. Kirby, agreed, saying  that Northwest Airlines, a target of takeover attempts in recent weeks, was a  "sitting duck" because the value of its stock was much lower than the value of  its assets.  </P> <P> "And there are a lot more out there like that," Kirby said.  </P> <P> Roderick said those who take over corporations by heavy borrowing must usually  cut back on research and development in order to repay the loans, thus making  the firm less competitive in the long run.  </P> <P> "America is paying a horrible price to get short-term gains by burdening  corporations with tremendous debt," Roderick said at a news conference after  the private session.  </P> <P> Despite the excesses, however, neither Kirby nor Roderick favored federal  legislation to interfere with the buyouts, saying the free market should be  allowed to operate.  </P></p>

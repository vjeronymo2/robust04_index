			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD ADVICE  </P> <P> Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS should  not be the basis for denying residency to immigrants, the California Department  of Health Services has advised the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It  is good advice.  </P> <P> "Please be advised that we believe denying a person legal residency solely on  the grounds of HIV seropositivity is counterproductive and poor public health  policy for this disease," Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the department,  informed the INS, according to correspondence just made public.  </P> <P> In response, Richard E. Norton, associate INS commissioner, promised careful  use of the service's discretionary authority to grant waivers and said only two  cases are pending. But more cases could develop as the process of screening  immigration amnesty candidates continues.  </P> <P> Kizer opposed the exclusion on grounds of both public health and equity. From  the public-health-policy point of view, it is important that these people have  "access to programs that provide education, behavioral intervention and medical  monitoring" to minimize the risk of further spread of the infection by them,  including the enhanced risk if they are forced underground.  </P> <P> From the equity point of view, Kizer pointed out that amnesty applicants have  been in the United States at least six years and therefore "it is likely that  they contracted the virus while in the United States." He concluded that "it  would be inhumane to deny these individuals legalization benefits, force them  to resume an illegal underground existence, or constructively force them to  leave this country at a time when they most need proper medical guidance and  assistance." Their return to Third World nations of origin "is likely to worsen  the worldwide HIV epidemic and, in the long run, hurt the U.S. more than  tending to these individuals in this country now."  </P></p>

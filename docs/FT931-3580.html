			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Kohl speaks out in support of Yeltsin CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday issued a ringing endorsement of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, warning that not only his domestic reform policy but the entire process of peaceful international co-operation was threatened by the political backlash in Moscow. In a statement on political developments in Russia, Mr Kohl declared that the reforms pursued by Mr Yeltsin and his government were in the interests not only of Russia and its people, but also of all other countries, above all Germany. 'I therefore emphatically endorse this process,' he said. President Francois Mitterrand of France will be carrying a similar message of support for Mr Yeltsin when he arrives in Moscow today. The visit will be 'a chance for the French president to reaffirm how strongly France wants Russia to recover its balance', an Elysee spokesman said. In his statement, Mr Kohl said: 'President Yeltsin and the political groups which support him, striving for democracy and the rule of law, a market economy and not least, a policy of peaceful co-operation with the world community, are increasingly threatened by forces which want to stop the reform process in Russia.' Although Germany had reached the limits of its financial capacity to support Russia, the debate within the G7 over further ways of providing economic assistance 'underlines the importance the western countries attach to the continuation of the reform process,' he said. The German government also attached vital importance to its bilateral relations with Russia, he added, in a statement which could be clearly seen as a direct warning to Mr Yeltsin's opponents in the Russian Congress of Deputies. 'Russia and Germany today enjoy relations which are free of tension, trusting and friendly. This is due in good measure to the achievements of Boris Yeltsin. We want these relations to be developed in mutual interest and trust, so that a free, democratic Russia, based on a market economy, remains a peaceful, calculable and stable partner both for Germany and for all our neighbouring states.' Meanwhile, Japan seems set for a clash with the US, France and Germany over its opposition to an emergency summit to sanction further aid to Russia. The Japanese government is opposed to a summit meeting to consider the issue even though a meeting of G7 officials in Hong Kong over the weekend agreed to consider plans for further aid. Japan insists it cannot consider further aid until Russia accepts Japan's claim to sovereignty over the four islands off the northern tip of Japan known as the northern territories.</p>

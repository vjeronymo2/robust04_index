			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUNGARY IN MOVE TO DROP WARSAW PACT MEMBERSHIP  </P> <P> Parliament agreed today to consider suspending Hungarian membership in the  Warsaw Pact and opposition leaders urged the government to negotiate a  permanent break with the Soviet-led alliance.  </P> <P> In an indication of widespread support, members of the recently elected  Parliament applauded loudly when the suspension proposal was introduced by  Mikos Vasarhelyi, a deputy of the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats.  </P> <P> Lawmakers voted to consider the proposal at their next session.  </P> <P> Approval would make Hungary -- whose once-dominant Communist Party has been  removed from power and reformulated itself into a Socialist Party -- the first  East Bloc country to suspend Warsaw Pact membership since last year's wave of  anti-Communist reforms in Eastern Europe began.  </P> <P> Hungary withdrew from the alliance briefly during the 1956 uprising that was  crushed by Soviet tanks.  </P> <P> Vasarhelyi was the spokesman of the Imre Nagy government that was dissolved  after the failed uprising. The Nagy government's Nov. 1, 1956, announcement  that it was withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact was followed three days later by  the Soviet invasion.  </P> <P> "We wanted to express the historic continuity with this proposal and we wanted  to carry on the traditions of the government in 1956," Vasarhelyi said at a  news conference after introducing the suspension legislation. "What that  government was unable to carry through, we now present to Parliament."  </P></p>

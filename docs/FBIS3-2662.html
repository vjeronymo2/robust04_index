Muzenda made his remarks in a meeting with Chinese  Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Tian Zengpei, who arrived in  Harare yesterday for a two-day working visit to Zimbabwe, the  last leg of his tour of southern Africa. The Chinese  vice-minister has already visited South Africa, Namibia and  Mozambique.    "Zimbabwe got support from China in its fighting for  independence and freedom and now China also made a lot of  efforts for Zimbabwe's developments after independence," said  Muzenda.    Tian Zengpei told Muzenda that China was impressed with the  way Zimbabwe had tackled its economic problems and its role in  peace-keeping missions.    Tian later held talks with his counterpart Nathan  Shamuyarira. They discussed international issues, especially  southern African situation and bilateral problems. Both sides  expressed their satisfaction at the present friendly relations  between the two countries and hope to find new areas and ways of  cooperation in promoting the two countries' relations.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS WHO CHEATED NEED STRONGER LESSON IN HONESTY;  </P> <P> LACK OF PUNISHMENT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE  </P> <P> Schoolchildren know that you don't cheat on tests. National City police  officers apparently have to be warned.  </P> <P> That's one lesson to be learned from Police Chief Stan Knee's decision not to  discipline any of the 11 officers who admitted to "exchanging information," as  Knee prefers it, before the second day of a two-day promotional exam.  </P> <P> Twenty-two officers signed up to take the May oral exam for 22 newly created  positions as "senior officers" and eligibility for a 5% pay raise. The exam was  designed to test competence in departmental policies and procedures. Eleven  officers took the exam the first day. Later, in casual conversation with  officers who had yet to take the test, some officers described the questions  they had been asked. Some of the listeners walked away. Others didn't.  </P> <P> In a subsequent investigation, 11 officers freely admitted that they had  discussed the questions.  </P> <P> Knee made all 11 ineligible for the new position, and reported his decision to  the city's civil service commission, which concurred. No further discipline was  meted out.  </P> <P> Knee defends his action, saying the officers lost the chance for a pay raise  (but only until the next test, when they will again be eligible to compete for  the 11 remaining vacancies). There was no conspiracy to cheat, he adds, only  the mistake of discussing the questions. The officers freely admitted  wrongdoing. And the examiners failed to warn the first group of officers not to  discuss the questions, Knee says.  </P> <P> Yes, that was an oversight. But Knee's decision isn't good enough. These  officers should have been sanctioned, if only by a formal reprimand. Like it or  not, the public holds police officers to a higher standard of honesty because  they enforce the law. When they cross the line, it is especially important that  they pay for it.  </P> <P> Besides, by the time you're old enough to carry a gun, you should have learned  that it's not acceptable to cheat on exams.  </P></p>

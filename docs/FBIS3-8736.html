			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chief Editor Jan Smolec: "My Word About the </F> Slovak President"]    [Text] When writing an article about the Slovak president,  I have the advantage, compared with some other journalists, of  having spoken and written about Slovak statehood and the post of  Slovak president even during the days of the rigid federation.  At that time, today's fighters for democracy did not even  mention Slovak statehood, let alone the Slovak presidency. Even  my friend Jozef Sitko, currently chief of the president's press  section, once called speculation about a Slovak state and the  post of Slovak president extremely nationalistic.    I reminded Mr. Michal Kovac of this immediately after his  election as president, at his meeting with nationally oriented  journalists. To make matters clear right from the start, I  supported Michal Kovac's candidacy for the presidency both as  journalist and as deputy to the former CSFR Federal Assembly,  particularly in view of his contribution, as chairman of the  Federal Assembly, to the civilized and constitutional partition  of the Czechoslovak state.    The sort of people with whom the president surrounded  himself  after his election came as a shock to me, however. Some people  from his circle were active opponents of Slovak statehood. The  president repeats in a stereotyped way that he wants to be  everyone's president. Although this sounds nice, many of us are  asking whether he also wants to be the president of those who  had fought for an independent Slovakia.    All kinds of Czechoslovakist and anti-Slovak cadres have  entrenched themselves at the Castle [seat of the Slovak  president]. One of them is Alojz Rajnic, deputy to the former  Federal Assembly for the Christian Democratic Movement. In the  Office of the President, he was in charge of the Slovak state's  security policy. What were his qualifications for this post?  While a Federal Assembly deputy, he had voted against an  independent Slovak state. A few days ago, I learned that he was  leaving the Castle at long last. He is leaving to assume the  post of chief of an outlying branch of the Presidential Office  that is being set up in Kosice.    During our last meeting, I conveyed to the president these  objections in person. I was extremely perturbed by the fact  that a certain aversion to Prime Minister Meciar, verging on  hatred, had taken possession of him. He told me briefly what he  also said in the National Council of the Slovak Republic the day  before yesterday. I conceded that Meciar was making mistakes,  also with regard to diplomatic restraint. What cannot be  ignored, however, is the credit he deserves for the founding of  the state and the enormous endeavor he is devoting to the  elimination of the transformation pangs and the building of  Slovak statehood. In no way has he ever violated the  Constitution, the law, or the principles of democracy, freedom,  and pluralism. The Meciar phenomenon is stirring Slovakia; the  young state needs both Michal Kovac and Vladimir Meciar, I wrote  after that meeting. I hoped that they would make their peace  with one another. After all, in the Czech Republic, too, there  are disagreements between the president and the prime minister,  but no one is making a fuss about it.    Unfortunately, the Slovak president has turned the  misunderstandings between the Castle and the government into a  confrontational drama. Like a telltale, he complained to the  world that the prime minister did not come to welcome him at the  airport.    The president has become too absorbed in himself. It is as  though he did not want to take into consideration certain  historical connections. For example, he accepts without any  reservations the title of first Slovak president. "The  president's Slovaks" (they bear the emblem of the president's  banner) do not protest and do not emphasize that Michal Kovac is  the second Slovak president. The first president was Dr. Jozef  Tiso, irrespective of his evaluation by history. The Slovak  nation can excuse all kinds of things, but the sight of Michal  Kovac with headphones on, listening to a Hungarian-Slovak  translation at the congress of the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement, was an insult to the stately post of Slovak  president.    The people were looking forward to the Slovak president's  speech [in parliament on 9 March]; they expected it to be  conciliatory, calming, and supremely statesmanlike. What they  heard, however, were tones of confrontation that open the doors  to the Balkanization of our life.    Unfortunately, these are the traces that the second Slovak  president is leaving behind him. He has somehow forgotten who  supported him, nominated him, and elected him. Under the  influence of his advisers, he has staked on a risky card. He  has not even noticed that he is cheered mostly by those who did  not want an independent Slovakia.</p>

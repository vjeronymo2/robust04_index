			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Commercial radio's share of advertising up Commercial radio will increase its share of advertising to an unprecedented 6 per cent by the end of the decade, according to a study to be published at the weekend. Mr Douglas McArthur, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, a body set up to promote commercial radio, said yesterday that the optimistic projection was the main finding of a consultants' report into the sector by the Henley Centre. The full report will be published at the annual Commercial Radio Convention in Dublin. The forecasts on commercial radio came as official listening figures confirmed that the commercial sector had overtaken the BBC's share of listening for the first time in the 21-year history of the commercial sector. Commercial radio has traditionally had only about 2 per cent of display advertising. In the third quarter commercial radio had revenues of Pounds 56.7m, a rise of 23 per cent from the same period last year. The rise means that the industry is on course for a 4 per cent share of advertising this year. Most of the growth to the end of the decade is expected to come from existing stations with only 8 per cent coming from new licences. In the third quarter commercial radio's share of listening rose from 47.4 per cent to 49 per cent with the BBC falling to 48.6. The 2.4 per cent of 'other listening' is mainly accounted for by pirate radio. Mr Justin Sampson of the Radio Advertising Bureau said yesterday: 'Commercial radio has not hit its peak and prospects for further growth remain good.' In spite of the increase in the number of radio stations, radio had 860,000 fewer listeners in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. In the quarter commercial radio added 57.1m hours-a-week and the BBC lost 76.5m hours compared with 1993. Radio 1 lost a further 1m listeners in the quarter to 11.2m. The BBC blamed the loss of its Radio 1 medium wave frequency. Radio 5 Live had a record 4.4m listeners. Radios 2 and 4 had a stable share with Radio 3 audiences up. All three national commercial stations, Virgin 1215, Atlantic 252 and Classic FM showed year-on-year growth. Atlantic, which broadcasts to the UK from Ireland and is unable to reach all of the country, managed to increase the number of weekly listeners to 4.93m compared with 3.85m in the same quarter last year. Virgin showed similar growth, up from 2.8m to 3.9m. For the BBC the competition can only increase with the effect of five new commercial stations launched last month showing up in the fourth quarter figures. The BBC suggested yesterday that commercial radio was reaching market saturation with two high-profile London stations losing listeners - Capital FM down 7 per cent and Kiss 100 down 8 per cent.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Boddington purchases nursing homes from Bupa Boddington Group is to expand its nursing homes division by about 60 per cent with the purchase of the Care for the Elderly subsidiary of Bupa, the UK's largest private healthcare provider, for up to Pounds 30.7m. The subsidiary has 448 beds in 10 homes mainly in southern England. It made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m on turnover of Pounds 8.6m in 1993. The deal will make Boddington the leader in the premium sector of the nursing homes market with a 'powerful position' in south-east England. The price was criticised as too high by Laing and Buisson, a care home consultant. A typical valuation for homes was Pounds 40,000 per bed but Boddington was paying over Pounds 60,000, it said. Boddington said the price compared favourably with, for example, the sum it paid recently to build a home in Hertfordshire. Moreover, it was buying freehold properties valued at about Pounds 23m.</p>

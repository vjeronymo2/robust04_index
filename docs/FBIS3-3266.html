When she heard his voice on the phone, she was very excited  as this was unthinkable in the past.    The old woman had come from the Ulanqab grassland, in the  north of Inner Mongolia. She had a good word to say for the  region's booming telecommunications, and with good reason.    With the expansion of the region's transportation and  telecommunications networks, more than 20 million herdsmen are  finding themselves closer to the outside world.    They can travel by plane and train to other provinces or  even  abroad. Through international telecommunications, they speak  with their overseas relatives and friends, and television  enables them to obtain all kinds of information without leaving  home.    In Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia, telecommunications  systems have connected the city with more than 180 countries and  regions throughout the world. Over 200 phone booths are  scattered round the city, providing people with domestic and  international telephone service.    Last year, the region's postal and telecommunications sector  invested 760 million yuan (85 million U.S. dollars) in  constructing or renovating over 250 telecommunications projects,  automating all telephone exchange systems in the region's  counties and cities.    Meanwhile, more micro-wave lines and optical fiber cables  were laid, adding thousands of new long-distance switching  networks and telephone exchanges.    Improved posts and telecommunications enable the region to  get access to changes in the outside, greatly promoting local  economy.    The region tops the country in its length of micro-wave  lines, which measure nearly 5,000 kilometers.    Over 75 percent of the region is covered by a television  network. In the region are 28 TV stations and over 800 TV  transmission stations, as well as over 800 satellite land  stations.    In addition, the region's transportation network has  improved.    Inner Mongolia has now opened 35 commercial air routes,  carrying more than 100,000 passengers annually.    From Hohhot, people can directly reach a dozen major cities  in and out of the country.    The region has expanded seven airports, among which, the  Baita Airport in Hohhot has been approved by the state as an  international port.    The Manzhouli airport, located at the intersection of  several  international lines, is expected to become one of China's major  international ports and handle all kinds of large cargo and  passenger planes after being put into use this year.    Also in 1993, rail transport in the region was on the rise.    Last year, about 100,000 overseas tourists visited Inner  Mongolia. At the same time, thousands of workers, students,  technicians, doctors, experts, artists and merchants in the  region went abroad.</p>

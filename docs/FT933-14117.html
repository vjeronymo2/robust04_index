			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Pacific Rim indices move narrowly SHARE prices moved in a narrow range following Tuesday's rise to above 20,000 for the Nikkei average, which closed marginally lower yesterday after fluctuating on profit-taking and arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei was finally off 41.31 at 20,139.11, its first decline in four trading days. It rose to a day's high of 20,207.52 just after the opening but slipped later on arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking, setting a day's low of 20,030.30. Volume totalled 300m shares, against 331.7m. Rises led falls by 495 to 476, with 186 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 3.73 to 1,631.58. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.09 at 1,240.37. Equities were supported by hopes that monetary or fiscal support would be implemented by the new government to be elected this weekend. The new cabinet - probably a coalition around a core conservative party - is likely to try to build support through income tax cuts. A fiscal stimulus package is unlikely to be implemented, thought traders, due to the lack of a kingpin figure to orchestrate the various interests of politicians and ministries. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, may be reluctant to cut the official discount rate due to fears of reflation. Mr Yasushi Ueki at Nikko Securities said that while a large loss by the ruling Liberal Democratic party would damage investor sentiment, an unexpected victory, on the other hand, would also be a negative factor for shares. 'It will mean a return to the old corrupt ways,' he explained. On the trading floor, Gajoen Kanko, a hotel and restaurant operator, was suspended in the afternoon session due to reports that Dream, an unlisted pachinko pinball operator which holds a large stake in Gajoen, had filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law. Gifu Bank, a regional bank in which Dream has a 5.5 per cent holding, fell Y45 to Y535. Kirin Brewery, the industry leader, lost Y20 to Y1,280 on reports that four company officials had been arrested for paying off racketeers. Profit-taking depressed bank shares, which gained on Tuesday on hopes of credit easing. Industrial Bank of Japan retreated Y20 to Y3,130. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 31.47 to 22,157.43 in volume of 23.3m shares. Roundup INDIVIDUAL equities and sectors moved more than indices on the Pacific Basin markets. AUSTRALIA saw strength in National Australia Bank, heavy trade in Woolworths and profit-taking in golds bring the All Ordinaries index into balance at a close just 0.3 higher at 1,804.5 in turnover of ADollars 348.8m. National Australia finished 24 cents ahead at ADollars 10.30, after reaching ADollars 10.32. Woolworths followed its successful market debut, topping the active stocks list with 9.9m shares traded as it added a cent at ADollars 2.81. The gold shares index receded 13.5 to 2,202.2. Market leader BHP appreciated 10 cents to ADollars 14.66. Salomon Brothers recently made a strong buy recommendation on the stock, saying that its improving balance sheet underpinned its ability to expand aggressively. TAIWAN's turnover fell from TDollars 17.22bn to TDollars 15.35bn as the weighted index finished 9.29 higher at 4,022.47. SEOUL closed virtually flat, with the composite index just 0.2 firmer at 762.96 in turnover down from Won478bn to Won424bn. HONG KONG slipped a mere 0.60 to 6,955.50 as a bout of late selling wiped out an earlier 73-point rise in the Hang Seng index. Turnover increased from HKDollars 3.02bn to HKDollars 3.22bn. There was local retail buying of Cheung Kong and Hutchison, but institutional selling dragged both off their highs. Cheung Kong lost 30 cents to HKDollars 25.30 and Hutchison closed steady at HKDollars 20.30. Red chips, or China-related stocks, were popular buys after being oversold recently. Citic Pacific jumped 60 cents to HKDollars 16. NEW ZEALAND lost ground after a sequence of highs, the NZSE-40 index finishing 17.11 down at 1,706.62 in a turnover of NZDollars 26.3m. Brewery concern Lion Nathan, which earlier announced a placing of 85m shares at NZDollars 3.05, shed 10 cents to NZDollars 3.30, due in part to share dilution but mostly because of the big discount involved. SINGAPORE featured Tonhow Industries, a takeover target, which closed 36 cents stronger at SDollars 1.05. But the Straits Times Industrial index was 2.41 easier at 1,775.11. BANGKOK fell for the third straight day, the SET index losing 7.68 at 892.98 in moderate turnover of Bt5.28bn. MANILA's composite index shed 7.70 to 1,616.98, but the debut of Jollibee Foods, the fast food chain, saw the shares climbing to above 16 pesos, a premium of more than 80 per cent to the initial offer price. COLOMBO saw demand for most Sri Lankan stocks, although turnover fell from Rp180.7m to Rp104.5m as the All-share index moved forward 8.34 to 687.41.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: CME to centralise trade in swaps deals The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said yesterday it would create a centralised trade processing organisation for the large over-the-counter market in interest rate swaps. The CME plan offers swaps dealers trade valuation and collateral depository services, while stopping short of clearing or guaranteeing transactions. The exchange, whose membership includes most of the world's top swaps dealers, said the swaps collateral depository would help increase the stability and security of derivatives transactions worldwide. However, swaps dealers said the CME's facility would attract business only if less expensive than the current system, where dealers process their own swaps trades bi-laterally. Several banks and derivatives dealers have attempted to organise similar swaps-processing services. However, competitive concerns have limited their use. The CME will be the first independent entity with enough experience to offer swaps processing services. The exchange has two high-profile partners for the venture. The international bank data communications and processing system, known as Swift (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) will be used to deliver the transactions to the CME depository. The depository will use software supplied by SunGard Capital Markets to value, or 'mark to market', the transactions and administer the collateral. The Swift message system and the SunGard software are widely used in the global derivatives industry. CME officials said they expect the collateral depository would be organised as a separate legal entity and would open for business next autumn.</p>

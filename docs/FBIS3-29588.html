It is noteworthy that both internal and international  disputes have been solved through peaceful negotiations, and the  world is on the road to peace. Various methods have been  applied for the resolution of seemingly insurmountable disputes  such as apartheid in South Africa, the PLO and Israel, and the  Cambodian civil war. The All Burma Students' Democratic Front  (ABSDF) warmly welcomes all these achievements.    If a comparison has to be made between these international  problems and the Burmese crisis, we sadly discover that the  former were negotiated in a freer atmosphere than the latter --  the most significant point being that bilateral views can be  expressed and exchanged freely under the watchful eye of  international observers.    In the case of Burma, let alone allowing these  internationally-accepted norms, Slorc (the State Law and Order  Restoration Council, which rules Burma) has not created an  atmosphere of hope or sincerity, not to mention a spirit of  compromise. Instead, it has set unwritten conditions, such as  the venue must be in their controlled areas, etc.    The ABSDF has always accepted the peaceful solution of  political problems through political means. However, there must  be:    -- A broad-based discussion on the current political  problems    -- The creation of a harmonious atmosphere, and    -- The presence of international observers.    Slorc has deliberately ignored such conditions, without  which  chances of the talks' success are slim.    If we were to examine Slorc's overtures there is practically  no chance of addressing the most important aspect -- the  political problem -- which is the crux of the conflict, the  ulterior motive being that it will be discussed only at Slorc's  orchestrated National Convention.    At its talks with the Kachin Independence Organisation  (KIO),  it repeated that unconditional surrender is the only way to  political discussions.    By insisting that this is an internal problem and talks  could  be held only inside the country, choosing insignificant towns  instead of cities, clearly shows that it wants only its own  version to be known. At the same time, it will restrict the  movement of any negotiating party to prevent contact with the  populace. [passage omitted]    Despite their loud rhetoric, it is evident that Slorc is  not heading towards a multi-party democracy. Instead, it is:    -- Curbing fundamental freedoms,    -- Liquidating some political parties and adopting  multifarious methods to maim others, and    -- Preventing people from participating freely in the  political process.    The farcical National Convention aims to legalise the  leading  role of the Burmese army. Among other signs that the military  has no intention of giving up power are:    -- Nullification of the 1990 general election, which was a  manifestation of the people's desire for democracy.    -- Expansion of repressive measures, which continues  unabated.    -- Monopolisation of the economy through both long- and  short-term projects.    -- Expansion of the armed forces and purchase of huge  amounts of weapons.    As the agenda for peace, all repressive measures must be  revoked or abolished, such as martial law, extrajudicial  killings, kangaroo courts, torture, concentration and  interrogation camps, the secret Military Intelligence Service.    All political prisoners and prisoners of conscience must be  released, and forced labour and forced eviction must be stopped.    Human rights must be protected and personal security  guaranteed. Press freedom, freedom of assembly and freedom of  expression must also be allowed, so as the rights of the workers  and freedom in agronomy.    The military mechanism has to go. This means Slorc must  reduce the number of the combat forces and prevent further coups  d'etat from taking place. Further, it is imperative that the  army be subordinated to a civilian government.    In regards to the ethnic minorities, equality and  self-determination for them must be guaranteed. The right for  them to freely participate in the political process is a must.  Also, measures to promote the cultures and improve the living  standards of ethnic peoples has to be implemented.    Compensation must be paid for losses caused by atrocities  and  civil war. Destroyed villages must be reconstructed,  forcibly-evicted villagers must be relocated to their original  homes, violators of human rights must be brought to justice, and  rehabilitation programmes for refugees must be set up.    And finally, Slorc must transfer power to the duly-elected  people's representatives.    ABSDF's perspective on the ongoing negotiations between  ethnic groups and Slorc is that it understands and sympathises  with the difficult situation of the ethnic nationalities which  have forced them to enter into the peace talks. The ABSDF  regards them as allies until final victory.    The ABSDF urges the nationalities:    -- To consider the whole national issues,    -- Not to confine themselves to bilateral economic issues  but to highlight democracy and their rights,    -- To adhere to DAB policies, and    -- To strive for the unity of democratic forces and ethnic  nationalities.

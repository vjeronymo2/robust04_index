			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / BP sees Pounds 100m in annual profit from new Colombian oilfield BRITISH Petroleum expects to produce 150,000 barrels of oil a day from its important Colombian oil finds - which could add Pounds 100m a year to the company's profits by the end of the decade. City analysts agree with BP, however, that lack of pipeline capacity could hinder production increases and profit potential of the 2bn barrel oilfield. Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst at Hoare Govett, the London stockbrokers, estimated that if production was able to reach 500,000 barrels per day, as would be expected from an oilfield of this size, the contribution to BP's pre-tax profits would be Dollars 525m (Pounds 348m) a year. In the company's first detailed briefing this week on the Cusiana and Cupiaga finds in the Andean foothills of eastern Colombia, Mr David Harding, chief executive for Latin America, said the oilfield was 'very significant for BP and we're optimistic'. The size of the oilfield, which BP confirmed was at least 2bn barrels, increases the group's worldwide oil reserves by 5 per cent. Mr Tony Hayward, exploration manager for BP Colombia said the company was very pleased with its appraisal of the Cusiana field although the latest well to be drilled was dry, which showed that the field did not extend as far south as had been hoped. Piedemonte, a new field to the north of the two finds, is being explored in the hope that the oil-bearing rock structure extends further. Mr Richard Campbell, president of BP Colombia, said BP would soon agree a development plan and financing with its partners for phase 1 of the project. Ecopetrol, the state oil company, will take a 50 per cent share in the discovery as part of Colombian law, leaving BP with a 19 per cent stake, French oil group Total with 19 per cent and Triton, the US oil company, with 12 per cent. The partners will invest Dollars 1.1bn in building a pipeline and upgrading an existing line to transport the oil in order to reach production of 150,000 b/d by 1995. BP will pay Dollars 200m of this overall investment. BP officials refused to put a figure on the level of production that will be reached in phase 2 later in the decade, but pointed out that Ecopetrol has estimated 800,000 b/d.</p>

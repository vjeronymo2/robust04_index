			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Peru's Fujimori faces opposition MR Maximo San Roman, Peru's vice-president, has declared he will soon form a rival government to oppose President Alberto Fujimori, who seized power two weeks ago, AP reports from Lima. Mr San Roman said he would set up his own cabinet on the grounds that Mr Fujimori acted unconstitutionally in dissolving Congress and shutting the courts on April 5. Mr San Roman, who was once a close ally of Mr Fujimori, claims to have the support of high-ranking military officials in trying to restore democracy. Reuter adds: An Organisation of American States (OAS) mission, led jointly by the Uruguayan foreign minister and OAS secretary-general, was due to arrive in Peru late yesterday.</p>

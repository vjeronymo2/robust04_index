			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POORLY RATED READING PROGRAM DROPPED  </P> <P> An experimental remedial reading program for seventh-graders at four San Diego  city schools will not be continued beyond this spring, but similar courses for  such at-risk students will probably be necessary across the district again next  year, school district trustees decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> The board reconsidered the pilot program at its regular meeting Tuesday after a  Times story earlier this month described how educators at all four schools  disputed a negative evaluation on which the board relied last month when it  voted to kill the program.  </P> <P> Trustees strongly criticized Supt. Tom Payzant and his staff for their failure  to send the critical evaluation to the schools for comment ahead of board  consideration and asked for a policy change so that teachers and principals  involved in other programs will have a chance to see evaluations ahead of board  discussions and speak on them if desired.  </P> <P> But the board spent little time questioning Payzant and others Tuesday on  whether the contents of the reading evaluation were accurate, in part because  only the vice principal from one of the four schools involved showed up to  discuss the report.  </P> <P> Instead, members stressed that they still have a commitment to reading  remediation for those students reading one or more grade levels below the  average for their age, and that they are still willing to consider new  programs, especially because low reading achievement continues to plague many  students, among them blacks and Latinos in numbers disproportionate to their  total enrollment.  </P> <P> Kermeen Fristrom, head of the district's basic education services who strongly  backed the pilot, told the board that special reading remediation will be  required at many schools next year, even as the district begins using a new  language-arts curriculum that stresses literature for  kindergarten-through-eighth grades.  </P> <P> Fristrom said the pilot has many strong features, including its reading  materials, teacher training and small class size -- half that of regular  classes -- which many middle schools and junior highs will try to copy in their  classes next year. However, Fristrom said, the schools probably will not have  the money, as was available under the pilot, to have small class sizes, even  though the evaluation showed that students in small groups, with individual  attention from teachers, both learned to read better and developed positive  attitudes toward reading.  </P></p>

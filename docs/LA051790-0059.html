			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> 'A Little Glitch': A lawsuit by Johnny Carson's first wife asking for more  alimony may be foiled because she remarried after divorcing Carson. Joan (Jody)  Carson, the mother of the talk show host's three sons, wed Donald Buckley, an  ad executive, soon after she divorced Carson. Describing the remarriage as a  "little glitch in the case," New York State Supreme Court Justice Phyllis  Gangel-Jacob questioned if her request for more alimony could be supported.  Mrs. Carson is seeking $120,000 a year from her ex-husband. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--The Arab League General  Secretariat has expressed its deep concern over the continuing  Israeli measures against Palestinian citizens in the occupied  Arab territories while the Palestinian-Israeli talks pass  through a very delicate stage that requires Arabs to rally  around the Arab negotiator.    In a statement today, the General Secretariat said the Arab  negotiator is fighting an important political battle to achieve  the desired goal of establishing a just, durable, and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This, the statement  added, requires Israel to show its credibility toward this noble  goal by halting the policy of evacuation it is still carrying  out in the occupied Arab territories. The statement said that  the last such incident was on the night of 18 April, when the  Israeli occupation forces evacuated about 110 Palestinian  families from the Yatta area in Hebron and proclaimed this  20-square km area a confiscated land.    The statement noted that the Israeli authorities' campaign  of  arrests and wide-scale deportation measures have covered most of  the West Bank and Gaza Strip cities and villages. This is  Israel's largest campaign since the arrests that preceded the  deportation of over 400 Palestinians in December 1992 to south  Lebanon and the subsequent deportation of 2,500 Palestinian  laborers who work in Israel by force and under strict military  guard.    The statement emphasized that these continuous Israeli  measures create a tense atmosphere that does not contribute to  the peace process that the Arab countries have agreed to and all  countries have supported.    The General Secretariat called on the international  community, especially cosponsor countries of the peace  conference the United States and Russia, to force Israel to  adhere to international legitimacy resolutions, provide  international protection for the Palestinian citizens, implement  the Fourth Geneva Convention that stresses the protection of  civilians who are under occupation, and halt its arbitrary  measures against the Palestinians in the occupied territories so  that an appropriate climate will prevail to continue the peace  process. This process, the statement added, aims to end the  bloody conflict in the region and to work toward achieving  security, stability, and development for all the region's  nations.</p>

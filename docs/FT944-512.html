			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Arts: The good, the bad and the positively eccentric - Christopher Dunkley looks back at television programmes over the last 12 months In 1994 television brought us the BBC's excellent adaptation of Middlemarch but also The National Lottery Live. People groaned at the mindlessness of the game-show-from-hell, Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, and stayed silent, mostly, about the excellence of Watergate, which finally revealed the astounding details of the most bizarre affair in modern American politics. Phil Agland, previously known for the unforgettable Baka, People Of The Rain Forest, went to China and made a superb series called Beyond The Clouds, about everyday events in a country town, which proved that some aspects of life (the generation gap) are universal, while others (attitudes towards medicine) vary dramatically between countries. Little was said about it. In other words, television was, as ever, providing the good and the bad and, as ever, being noisily attacked for the bad and rarely praised for the good. Perhaps it is just human nature. For some reason, when you sit down at the year's end to prepare any sort of audit, it is the disappointments which spring to mind. Who can forget, for instance, the cascade of lamentable comedies throughout the year, with far too many contributed by BBC1: Nelson's Column, set in a newspaper office; Honey For Tea in which the previously indefectible Felicity Kendal came a cropper, playing an American matron in a Cambridge college; and Nice Day At The Office which was so dreadful that you had to watch several episodes to make sure that there was not something subtle going on which you had missed. There was not. Of course BBC1 was not alone. BBC2 piloted a comedy called The High Life about the squabbling members of an insufferable cabin crew on a Scottish airline. Seeing how appalling it was, someone has commissioned six more episodes to start in the new year. ITV had fewer comedy failures, largely because they had fewer tries, but Mother's Ruin, set in an alternative health shop, with Dora Bryan playing the tippling mother of a middle aged son (Roy Barraclough, fresh out of Coronation Street) was so old fashioned that it was sometimes unintentionally funny. You could hardly blame ITV's House Of Windsor for damaging the reputation of the royal family, given the greater damage done throughout the year by the members of the family themselves - not least via ill-advised television programmes - but this was not the most sophisticated comedy ever seen on television. Comedy was not a complete disaster area, but several of the year's best series turned out to be remarkably old. With a bit of editing to bring the shows down to 40 minutes, the BBC proved in Morecambe And Wise: Bring Me Sunshine that those who suspected the old hoofers would outshine any of their successors were absolutely right. And The Lost Steptoes similarly confirmed that there is nobody writing television comedy in Britain today who even aspires to creating the sort of complexity or subtlety of relationship which Galton and Simpson achieved via Wilfred Brambell and Harry H. Corbett. The best of the 1994 comedies were The Day Today which fed off the crassness of television itself, and Rory Bremner - Who Else?, a show which gets more topical and more sinewy with each series. There were plenty of other let downs. Channel 4 had the praiseworthy idea of commissioning three new 'operas' for television which, in the event, looked as though they set out deliberately to confirm all the worst expectations of opera-phobes, being pretentious, unmelodious and silly. The first major piece of drama actually produced by Sky 1 rather than being bought secondhand, Red Eagle, was a run-of-the-mill thriller with poor direction and (consequently, perhaps) poor acting. Horizon, one of the most consistently admirable series, celebrated its 30th birthday with the most daft and incomprehensible edition I have ever seen. Between The Lines slithered from first to third rate when it bafflingly abandoned the setting of an internal police investigation division and became just another crime series. However, looking back through a year's notebooks it is fascinating to find how much good material has failed to spring to mind. Take drama series, the category used by ITV to sustain the centre of its evening ratings. Most of their series about doctors, policemen and so on, were pretty ho-hum, but the nine o'clock ITV slot also contained Sharpe, with Sean Bean swashing his buckle through the Peninsular War; Finney in which David Morrissey played the reluctant gangster who just wants to be left alone to strum his double bass; and, best of all, another excellent run - the best yet - of Cracker, with Robbie Coltrane playing the psychologist-detective. Politically correct rights-ists attacked it for being anti-black, anti-woman and anti-soccer, but the people at Granada stuck to their guns, knowing that they were protected by the quality of the drama and by the fact that you only had to wait to find that it was, on balance, pro-black, pro-woman and pro-soccer. In the same category the BBC offered us Richard Griffiths - larger even than Coltrane - as the would-be retired detective who only wanted to be left alone to run his terribly English restaurant in Pie In The Sky; a medical series called Cardiac Arrest which was said to be an insult to the medical profession, but which seemed, to some of us who have worked in hospitals, to be only too horribly accurate; and the all-human-life-is-there saga of the dustmen - whoops, refuse operatives - Common As Muck. Most undervalued and least noticed was probably Takin' Over The Asylum, an autumn series on BBC2 which managed to move beyond television's previous stereotypes. Good documentaries were thin on the ground, though Secret History offered an interesting revisionist version of the dam busters' raid, and Edward Mirzoeff brought us an eye-opening account of Britain's ice dance champions, Torvill And Dean: Facing The Music, which revealed that Mr Dean ran the partnership with a rod of sarcasm. It was the attempt by Torvill and Dean to win another Olympic gold medal which produced not only the highest rating for an unrepeated programme in 1994, but the highest in a decade: they attracted 23.95m viewers. The National Lottery Live which we were assured beforehand would achieve huge figures actually managed 20.2m in the first week, 18.5m in the second, and by week three had slipped to fifth place in the national Top 10 with 15.7m. The two strongest documentary series were both on BBC2: White Heat which looked at the development of technology and the way we have reacted to it; and The Fall Of The Wall which investigated the detail of the events leading up to the fall of the Berlin wall and proved, yet again, just how compelling detail can be. BBC2 also had a powerful showing in current affairs series. Heretic introduced us to scientists whose ideas did not win the approval of their peers, a failure as damaging in science as in religion. The Trial took British television cameras inside British - actually Scottish - courts for the first time. And Midnight Hour provided a forum for the discussion of the day's politics. We saw the last of Minder and That's Life], but Esther Rantzen was pretty soon back on screen with a daytime studio agony show - called Esther, of course - which is already better than the odious Kilroy-Silk thing (what isn't). It and Ms Rantzen have some way to go before it begins to challenge the American originals such as Donahue. The year brought a Commonwealth Games and a football World Cup to keep the sports departments, if not British fans, happy. And Question Time dispensed with the services of Peter Sissons, took on David Dimbleby, and dished out 'Yes, No, Don't Know' keypads to the audience. None of which made any difference. This was also the year when television almost ceased to transmit bright, cheery programmes about Aids in which dim personalities claim 'We're all equally at risk now'. The best arts programme of the year was the poignant and moving interview in Without Walls between Melvyn Bragg and the most important British dramatist (not merely 'television dramatist') of our generation, Dennis Potter. He was, he told us, dying of cancer, and he swigged morphine from a flask with a bravura that made you want to cheer and weep. Weeks later he was gone, having raced death in his final months to leave us two drama series, Karaoke and Cold Lazarus, which we are to see in 1995. Other memorable arts programmes included a South Bank Show celebrating the life and work of Larry Adler and George Gershwin; an Omnibus on the astonishing working methods of actor Robert Stephens; and Channel 4's coverage of the building of the new Glyndebourne theatre and the opening performance of The Marriage Of Figaro. If obliged to make awards mine would go to four eccentric marvels. First, from January, Jonathan Meades' splendidly unclassifiable series Further Abroad which offered engrossing and hilarious programmes on vertigo, brewers, golf and pigs. Next, also from the start of the year, The Unpleasant World Of Penn And Teller, which combined comedy and conjuring with quantities of bad taste and endeavoured to give away many of the tricks of the protagonists' trade. Third, Billy Connolly's World Tour Of Scotland in which a fond travelogue was married to some foul-mouthed and yet hilarious stand-up comedy routines. And fourth, Christopher Hitchens' hatchet job on Mother Teresa in Without Walls, a programme which kept alive the libertarian ideal of real freedom of speech rather than the wan little imitation which we know so well. Roll on 1995, when cable comes to our street. Let a thousand channels flourish]</p>

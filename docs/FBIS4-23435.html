			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Bumpy Road -- Given the "huge obstacles" that lie ahead,  Labor Minister Tito Mboweni "seems to have identified what needs  to be done in the next five years," notes an editorial in  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 6 June on page 14. He  argues "broadly, for a tripartite `social partnership' between  government, business and labor -- but one which gives due  recognition to the increasingly competitive world economy which  South Africa is re-entering" -- "an attempt to create an  adequately harmonious system in circumstances which naturally  militate against it." But "it may suceed simply because there is  no real alternative." "The fragile economy needs a period of  consolidation and painful restructuring. Available state  resources must be directed at the poorest sections of the  population. Tariff barriers must be gradually but surely  lowered. The trade-off between job security and wages will  become more onerous. For many, the emphasis will be on sacrifice  and and deferring the fulfilment of post-apartheid expectations.  This will test Mboweni's partnership to the limit."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Amnesty -- "It is imperative the Government sets firm  principles and guidelines on the issue of amnesty;" Vice  President de Klerk granting indemnity and commuting sentences of  rightwingers "are bound to add fuel to the fire," notes an  editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 6 June on page  6. "Pressure on the new Government regarding amnesty is being  applied on several fronts": the previous government "seems to  have obtained a commitment from the ANC of blanket amnesty for  State-inspired crimes up to a certain date" and attempts to draw  "the far rightwing" into negotiations may compel the government  to extend indemnity to those responsible for the Johannesburg  car bombs. "Even more controversial will be amnesty to Chris  Hani's killers." "The Government will have to move swiftly on  its amnesty plans, including the setting up of a `truth  commission', and defuse a potentially explosive situation."    Frontline Summit -- "It was appropriate that President  Nelson  Mandela's first foreign engagement was to attend a summit of  Frontline States in Harare last week. It was these states that  provided refuge and succour when the apartheid regime forced our  liberation organisations and thousands of political refugees  into exile," the second editorial in the 6 June SOWETAN states.  "Undoubtedly," the new South Africa owes the Frontline States an  enormous debt." However the suggestion that the "Frontline club  be retained" "needs to be carefully considered" as "a formilised  structure could be a costly duplication of other structures like  the Southern African Development Community." "The glue in the  bonding process among Southern African countries is economic  progress" and "it makes more sense to devote resources to what  Namibian President Sam Nujoma says is the new struggle against  poverty, disease and ignorance."  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Affirmative Action -- "The relaxed mood of the country as a  result of the conciliatory speeches and statements of President  Mandela may not last much longer. Steps are being taken in  various aspects of life to bring into force the government's  policies of empowerment, affirmative action and so on," notes an  editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 3 June on  page 6. "There is a plan to place the Defense Ministry under  civilain control" and "there is also talk of a complete  reorganisation of the South African Police Service." Eskom  [Electricity Supply Commission] and Transnet [public  transportation company] are "already applying affirmative  action, which means that Whites are not being taken on but  Blacks are. Some government departments are following a similiar  line." "Redressing the balance of unemployment by putting Whites  out of jobs, or denying them employment, will create the very  conditions that will breed White resistance or force Whites to  emigrate." "The government should not do anything to upset  people, Whites in particular, by making drastic changes that  undermine confidence in the spirit of reconciliation or by  encouraging discrimination in reverse."</p>

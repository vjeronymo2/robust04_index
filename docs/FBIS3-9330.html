			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav  Klaus said on Czech Radio today that he was not willing to  comment on today's trade union demonstration, saying that the  government "did not have the smallest scrap of a share in the  demonstration," and that it "bore no relation to the government  at all." The demonstration was organized in Prague's Old Town  square by the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions  (CMKOS). Journalists estimated it was attended by 40,000 people.    He said he believed negotiations between the government and  the unions were held in a manner that was completely correct.  The government had accepted many of the points made by the  unions concerning the amendment to the employment code, and so  to say it had not consulted the unions on the matter was "utter  lies and falsehood."    However, he said, the government did not have to accept all  the unions' comments, "as some of the union leaders seem to  wish."    Klaus said he had been receiving reports from all over the  country concerning pressure placed on union members, who were  offered a free ride to Prague in order to take part in some kind  of demonstration for a bit. This action by unions was being  revealed by "telephones, faxes and letters by people from all  over the Republic," he said.</p>

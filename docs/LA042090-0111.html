			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL;  </P> <P> COLTS TRADE FOR TOP PICK IN DRAFT, PROVIDING THEY CAN SIGN GEORGE TODAY  </P> <P> The Atlanta Falcons agreed on Thursday to trade the first pick in Sunday's  National Football League draft to the Indianapolis Colts, who will choose  quarterback Jeff George of Illinois.  </P> <P> The Falcons, who also will give Indianapolis a fourth-round draft pick this  year, will get six-time Pro Bowl tackle Chris Hinton, wide receiver Andre  Rison, the Colts' first-round draft choice in 1991 and a fifth-round pick this  year.  </P> <P> The deal is contingent upon the Colts signing George today.  </P> <P> George supplanted Keith McCants in the No. 1 draft position after the Alabama  linebacker's mediocre workout two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Agent Leigh Steinberg flew to Indianapolis earlier Wednesday to begin  negotiations with the Colts.  </P> <P> "I'm very optimistic," he said. "We will break out the caffeine and camp down  until it's done."  </P> <P> Steinberg represented quarterback Troy Aikman last season, when the former UCLA  star signed an $11-million, six-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys, who made him  the No. 1 pick in the draft.  </P> <P> Steinberg said he will seek more than Aikman received.  </P> <P> "It's a new year with a new television contract with enormous growth in it,"  Steinberg said. "I would think that once we get started, no matter who we're  dealing with, we could get the thing done in five or six hours."  </P> <P> With 72 hours to go before the draft, the Seattle Seahawks, Detroit Lions and  San Francisco 49ers reportedly are trying to trade up toward the top of the  first round. The San Diego Chargers, Chicago Bears, Buffalo Bills, Kansas City  Chiefs and New York Giants are considering trading their No. 1 choices.  </P> <P> "I don't mean that the first round is not a marquee-name round," said General  Manager George Young of the Giants. "But there are some pretty good people in  the second and third rounds."  </P> <P> The Chargers traded running back Gary Anderson, who sat out all of last season  in a contract dispute, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a third-round pick on  Sunday and a conditional second-round pick in 1991.  </P> <P> The conditional pick is based on Anderson gaining 1,000 yards combined in  rushing and receiving in 1990. Anderson reached 1,000 yards twice in four years  with the Chargers. If he fails to gain 1,000 yards, the Chargers will get Tampa  Bay's third-round choice in 1991.  </P> <P> The 49ers traded running back Terrence Flagler and defensive end Danny Stubbs  to Dallas for second-and third-round choices.  </P></p>

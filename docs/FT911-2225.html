			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: AGA pulls out of bourse in Helsinki FOLLOWING Volvo's announcement yesterday that it was to withdraw from the Helsinki bourse due to the high listing costs, Swedish industrial gas company AGA said it would discontinue its Helsinki listing due to a requirement that listed companies join an association to help cover costs, writes our Financial Staff. 'The new requirements for membership and the increased fees to be introduced are not justified at the level of trading activity that the AGA share has had on the Helsinki Stock Exchange,' AGA said. The company said it would have had to pay the association FM300,000 a year, for 'marginal' trade. AGA is listed on six other exchanges, and American depositary receipts are also traded.</p>

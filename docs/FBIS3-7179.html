Kim referred to North Korea's suspected  nuclear weapons program in a banquet hosted by Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    "(North Korea) has threatened peace in this region. But  cooperation between South Korea and Japan will surely bring a  nuclear-free peace to (the region)," he said.    The South Korean president, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday  for a three-day visit, said he expects both countries will  overcome a transitional period through close cooperation and  mutual trust.    Prior to the speech by Kim, Hosokawa said that the  building-up of relations of trust between Japan and South Korea  will begin with addressing the past frankly.    Hosokawa touched on Japan's colonial rule of the Korean  peninsula from 1910 to 1945, saying, "studying the lessons of  the history from now on is a way of strengthening partnership  (between Seoul and Tokyo.)"    He said it is important for Japan and South Korea to  cooperate on every field to develop and stabilize relations  between the two nations.    Hosokawa said such cooperation will convince Japan and South  Korea that they are irreplaceable partners in an international  society.    Among those who attended the banquet were former Prime  Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono.</p>

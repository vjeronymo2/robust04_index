			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / ICI to split and shed 9,000 jobs worldwide: Investment in petrochemicals halted Pounds 384m pre-tax loss reported IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's manufacturing flagship since the 1920s, yesterday signalled an end to its ambitions as one of the world's biggest chemical groups when it announced it would split in two and shed 9,000 jobs worldwide. Britain's biggest manufacturer also announced its first loss for a decade following a massive Pounds 949m provision for its historic change in direction. The company's narrower ambitions were underlined by the revelation it would cease to invest in the loss-making petrochemicals and chlor-alkali industries which between them account for turnover of about Pounds 2bn. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, announcing the largest restructuring in UK industrial history, said ICI would split in June, creating a separately quoted company called Zeneca. The new group, with a turnover of about Pounds 4bn, would comprise ICI's drugs, agrochemicals and seeds, and specialities businesses. ICI shareholders will receive one Zeneca share for each ICI share. The group's shares rose 70 1/2 p to Pounds 11.52 1/2 . Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer and new ICI's designated chief executive, said the company was in the middle of the longest recession since the 1930s. 'We are restructuring ICI so it can face the future,' he said. 'The world is becoming ever more demanding. There will be slower growth over the next five years because of shortage of capital. We must prepare for a harsh- er competitive environment.' About half the 9,000 job losses will be in the UK, representing about 10 per cent of ICI's 44,000-strong workforce. About 7,000 jobs will be lost from new ICI and about 2,000 from Zeneca. The head-count of the combined groups will fall to about 105,000. ICI reported a Pounds 384m pre-tax loss for the year to December 31, following an exceptional charge of Pounds 949m, including Pounds 516m for rationalisation. Sir Denys said the outcome was not satisfactory, but was in line with the experience of ICI's peer group. Sir Denys said there might be an improvement in trading conditions during the second half of the year. Both ICI and Zeneca would improve on last year's results during 1993. New ICI's operating profits fell from Pounds 324m in 1991 to Pounds 148m last year, on turnover of Pounds 8.88bn while Zeneca's trading profits dropped from Pounds 682m to Pounds 587m. Last year's net cash outflow was Pounds 454m, in spite of the group's target to be cashflow neutral. Mr Hampel said the outflow was unacceptable. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, downgraded ICI's debt from double A minus to A plus. It said it reflected the fact that new ICI would be more vulnerable to economic cycles and less profitable. ICI maintained the dividend at 55p, although it was paid from reserves. ICI and Zeneca will each pay a dividend of 27.5p for 1993. Petrochemicals and chlor-alkali production did not make sense in the long term, explained Mr Hampel. He said the businesses would not be sold, but could be integrated into joint ventures. ICI's chlor-alkali business at Runcorn, Cheshire, employs about 7,000 people. The petrochemicals complex at Wilton on Teesside has about 10,000 staff. The split must be confirmed by an extraordinary general meeting in May. Zeneca will raise about Pounds 1.3bn through a rights issue, underwritten by SG Warburg and BZW. The proceeds will be used to reduce ICI's Pounds 2.3bn debts. The new ICI will have debts of Pounds 600m and Zeneca Pounds 400m. Mr Hampel said: 'ICI in its new form will be a performance-driven, no-frills cost-conscious entity. Non-performing activities will have to be dealt with more quickly than in the past. We must be more ruthless.'

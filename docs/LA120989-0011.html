			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOLEN KEYS OPEN THE LID ON PRAGUE PARTY SPLIT  </P> <P> With his broken wrist, rumpled suit and apologetic manner, Frantisek Valabek  somehow personified the Communist Party for which he spoke.  </P> <P> For Valabek, the problem was personal and immediate, but it spoke volumes about  the state of affairs within the party.  </P> <P> Standing awkwardly Friday in the press room of the party's Central Committee  office, Valabek admitted his problem. A visit to the Tesla Hloubetin electric  appliance factory in suburban Prague that he and a colleague had painstakingly  arranged for two foreign reporters had just collapsed.  </P> <P> The trip had been set up so that the reporters could meet members of the  People's Militia at the factory, a unit of the party's praetorian guard, which  is being disarmed. The militiamen were eager to show off their new benign  image. It fell to Valabek to inform the reporters that others were not so  eager.  </P> <P> "We can't get in," he said. After a long pause he added, "They've taken the  keys."  </P> <P> Valabek, his eyes on the floor, explained that when members of the party's  local district committee learned of the visit, they went to the factory and  stole the keys to the rooms that contained the militia weapons and other gear.  Not even the once-powerful Central Committee office could pry them loose.  </P> <P> "A visit today will be impossible, I'm afraid," Valabek said. "You need to come  back next week, after the elections."  </P> <P> Party elections are to take place over the weekend, to choose new committees in  preparation for the emergency party congress scheduled for Dec. 20-21. The  party leadership hopes the elections will end the reign of the hard-liners,  exemplified by the men who took the militia keys. Reform-minded committees  could be expected to send delegates who are receptive to overhauling the party  for the democratic age ahead. But the message of Friday's incident at the  appliance factory is that the road ahead will not be smooth.  </P> <P> Echoing complaints made two days earlier by Karel Urbanek, the party general  secretary, Valabek said that many regional and district party committees refuse  to understand that their power is no longer absolute. "It's like a drug," he  said. "Once you have it, it's hard to give up."  </P> <P> By mid-afternoon, the chief party spokesman, Jozef Hora, and a Politburo  member, Vasil Mohorita, had become involved. But the keys were still not  available.  </P> <P> "Today is not possible," Hora said after discussing the situation with  Mohorita. "Perhaps on Monday."  </P> <P> Disarming the People's Militia, which has been one of the most visible symbols  of party supremacy, has been a traumatic experience for the militiamen. Many  felt slighted when Urbanek ordered them to turn their weapons in by last Sunday  in order to reduce the risk of violence in the tense political atmosphere.  </P> <P> "They felt they couldn't be trusted," Valabek said. "Their pride was damaged."  </P> <P> According to Hora, the party spokesman, the People's Militia has 40,000 to  50,000 members, all attached to factories and other institutions. The first  units were formed in 1948, to defend such places against possible attack by  counterrevolutionaries.  </P> <P> As communism itself has come into question, some militia units have voted to  disband. Party secretary Urbanek announced that the militia will now be used to  help in large-scale accidents or natural disasters.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's that much to see anymore," Valabek told the reporters.  "It's probably just a lot of empty shelves."  </P></p>

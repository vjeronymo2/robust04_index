			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / IoD in science campaign call THE INSTITUTE of Directors yesterday called for a national campaign to encourage more students to take up science studies. Dr Ann Robinson, head of the IoD's policy unit, said business and the government should co-operate 'in making maths, technical and scientific subjects more sexy and exciting for young people'. This week's A-level results showed falls in the number of students taking chemistry, physics and biology. 'Unless more schoolchildren and higher-education students are encouraged to take up these subjects, Britain's competitive position will be seriously threatened,' said Dr Robinson.</p>

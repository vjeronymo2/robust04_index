			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NO LONGER 'MUM'S THE WORD' ON CUTBACKS;  </P> <P> PUBLIC RELATIONS: TROUBLED COMPANIES ARE HIRING SPECIALISTS TO HEAD OFF FALSE  RUMORS ABOUT THEIR FISCAL HEALTH.  </P> <P> Companies in trouble are dumping the notion that no news is good news, and that  couldn't be better news for public relations firms and business consultants.  </P> <P> From Los Angeles to the District of Columbia, PR firms are honing a new  specialty -- teaching clients hit hard by the economic downturn how best to  disseminate information to their employees, suppliers, bankers and customers.  </P> <P> A number of these self-described "crisis management" companies are new, such as  Sitrick &amp; Co., formed nearly three years ago by people who had worked with  corporate turnaround artist Sanford Sigoloff. Others are PR firms such as Kekst  Inc. that once specialized in mergers and acquisitions but have since moved to  what they consider a better opportunity for growth.  </P> <P> "Business is increasing," said Jay M. Jaffe, president of the Washington-based  PR firm Jaffe Associates Inc.  </P> <P> "Two years ago, local real estate firms were calling me to help them market  their properties. Today, they are calling me to help them with bankruptcy  filings. I'm getting at least one Chapter 11 call a week," said Jaffe,  referring to the title under which many businesses seek to reorganize their  affairs in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  </P> <P> Operating in teams of three to five people, trouble-shooting PR firms often  arrive at the doorsteps of a beleaguered client on the eve of an appearance in  bankruptcy court or as they are considering the possibility of seeking  protection from creditors.  </P> <P> Many companies offering crisis management advice say that they would prefer to  become involved with a troubled company as early as possible, say four to six  months before the firm winds up in court.  </P> <P> "That's the ideal," said Stephen H. Case, a bankruptcy lawyer in the Washington  office of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell who reports that he has increasingly seen  his clients turn to PR firms in times of trouble. "The fact of life is that  these things usually are handled at the last minute."  </P> <P> Another fact is that five years ago most troubled companies, especially those  faced with a bankruptcy court date, would not have bothered to call a public  relations firm at all, Case said.  </P> <P> But the increasing complexity of business reorganizations, reflecting the  complexity of the companies involved in them, has changed the "mum's-the-word"  approach to corporate fiscal crises. Instead, they are seeking what Jaffe likes  to call "rumor control."  </P> <P> Rumors often start when companies choose to squelch information, causing their  employees, stockholders, suppliers and bankers to dig for their own answers to  tough questions, said attorney Alan S. Gover, a bankruptcy lawyer in the  Houston office of Weil, Gotschal and Manges.  </P> <P> Erroneous information can cause employees to panic and abandon ship, and it can  cause suppliers to stop shipping, customers to stop shopping and creditors to  start suing -- all of which can hurt a company's chances for survival, Gover  said.  </P> <P> While their intentions may be good, the effectiveness and quality of these  crisis management experts are difficult to measure, according to bankruptcy  attorneys and others who have used their services.  </P> <P> Some financially ailing companies say privately that their public relations  consultants actually hurt them by giving the "wrong" advice -- telling them to  forewarn employees of layoffs before the plans are firm, for example.  </P> <P> "There is no room for mistakes in business reorganizations," said Michael  Sitrick, who is chairman and chief executive of the 17-member public relations  firm specializing in such work.  </P> <P> "You're not just talking about a financial workout. You're talking about  people's lives. The wrong word at the wrong time can ruin everything and put a  company under. It's a hell of a responsibility. Rather than fool around with a  public relations firm that isn't going to handle it right, a company would be  better off leaving everything up to the lawyers."  </P> <P> Sitrick and Co., apparently fearing nothing from competitors, is publishing its  crisis management techniques in an upcoming book. Among other things, the  company advises troubled companies to:  </P> <P> * Create a crisis management team to address communications issues.  </P> <P> * Make the lawyers part of that team.  </P> <P> * Restrict who can speak to the media.  </P> <P> * Make sure there are people specially trained to handle the calls of  shareholders, bondholders and vendors.  </P> <P> * Decide what you want the story to be; stress, for example, "the difference  between laying off 3,000 people in a 31,000-employee company and " 'saving'  28,000 jobs by restructuring," Sitrick said.  </P></p>

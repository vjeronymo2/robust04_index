			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Clinton pledges to aid Russian economy PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to propose 'some innovative solutions' for Russia's problems at his summit with President Boris Yeltsin, to be held in Vancouver on April 3 and 4, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Mr Clinton said that he planned far more than a 'get acquainted' meeting. 'I don't want to make any sweeping commitments but I'm going there with the intention of trying to more aggressively engage the US in the economic and political revitalisation of Russia.' Vancouver was chosen over Warsaw, offered as a site by President Lech Walesa, because Mr Yeltsin will be travelling in the Russian far east immediately beforehand. The administration has already proposed increasing bilateral assistance to Russia from Dollars 400m (Pounds 281m) to Dollars 700m but Mr Clinton almost certainly has a more ambitious agenda involving the US leading the main industrialised countries in a bigger, more concerted Russian assistance programme.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SADNESS IN THE SOUL;  </P> <P> THEATER: ATHOL FUGARD'S 'MY CHILDREN! MY AFRICA!' SHOWS SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL  CONFLICT THROUGH DEBATING STUDENTS.  </P> <P> Athol Fugard has sometimes been referred to as the Samuel Beckett of South  Africa -- not, heaven knows, because he is sparing with words. Quite the  reverse. Rather because, like the late Irish playwright, he understands, in  some deep visceral part of his conflicted self, the tragedy of humankind.  </P> <P> He did not have to look far. The stage was set for him from birth: A white man  born in a predominantly black country, where the caldron of racial repression  was about to boil over; a white man, moreover, outraged by injustice and torn  by his helplessness in the face of its daily manifestations.  </P> <P> With this set of givens, it was inevitable, perhaps, that Fugard, who gave us  such early jolts as "The Blood Knot," "Boesman and Lena," " 'Master Harold' . .  . and the Boys" would, sooner or later, write a play like "My Children! My  Africa!," which opened Sunday at the La Jolla Playhouse. Later more likely than  sooner, because it is a work of emotional complexity and philosophical argument  that could only have erupted from a playwright at a certain stage of maturity  in both his life and work.  </P> <P> The plot takes two bright high school students from opposite ends of the South  African spectrum with, in common, intelligence and a taste for scholarship.  Thami (Sterling Macer Jr.) is a black boy from the impoverished "location"  (township), and Isabel (Nancy Travis) is a well-to-do white girl from the  better part of this small eastern Cape Karroo town. They are brought together  in a debate by Thami's dedicated black teacher, Mr. M (Brock Peters).  </P> <P> The success of this brief encounter across the great racial divide emboldens  Mr. M to team these two students in another contest -- this time, on the same  side of the argument. It's a daring idea that excites the inspired old man and  the eager Isabel but generates inarticulate resistance in Thami.  </P> <P> Fugard, who also directed his play, has set this up so that we begin to see  these children not only as the division of South Africa itself but as the two  halves of the teacher's tortured soul: the African in him who yearns for parity  and freedom -- and the scholar in him who reveres the essentially white legacy  of education, believing passionately in its power.  </P> <P> Weighing the stone somebody tossed through the schoolhouse window in one hand  and a dictionary in the other, Mr. M makes an ardent case for the dictionary,  imploring Thami to seize the penetrating force of the word over the blunted  stone.  </P> <P> But Thami and his fellow students are not listening. Their patience has run  out. These are young men who see the pleading Mr. M as a superannuated  so-called "white black," whose ideas won't wash any more. The conflict between  man and boys -- embodied in this one boy -- precipitates disaster, while  Isabel, like the chorus in a Greek tragedy awash with tears, tries to make  sense of it all.  </P> <P> Extraordinarily, she does. The torrent of words that has gushed and spewed  before, some of it simply as too many words (this is a very verbal play) but  most of it with tremendous eloquence, is a preamble to a stunning close.  </P> <P> The impotent Isabel and alienated Thami sort out their contradictory emotions  in a confrontation that neither oversimplifies the issues nor backs away from  the abundant sorrow and complexity of its resolution. It puts Fugard in first  rank as a playwright.  </P> <P> He is supported here by three superb performances. Peters is at once a man in  ruins and pillar of tragedy as the upstanding teacher who cannot overcome the  turning tide, showing us both aspects of Mr. M: the morality and anachronism of  his deeply felt beliefs.  </P> <P> Macer gives Thami the strength, seriousness and sweetness of a boy caught in a  maelstrom and struggling with an illogical world. And Nancy Travis exemplifies  the rage and sadness of enlightenment stumped by the senselessness of violence.  All three, sooner or later, burn a hole in one's consciousness.  </P> <P> Dennis Parichy's lights provide a moody scheme, but, in every other respect,  simplicity wisely rules Fugard's production. Douglas Stein and Susan Hilferty  have designed a basic platform severed by a curtain that the actors pull at  will.  </P> <P> But, in the end, it's all about the writing. In "My Children! My Africa!"  Fugard achieves what every dramatist aspires to, a profoundly regionalized  vision that illuminates the universal.  </P> <P>  At the Mandell Weiss Theatre, UCSD campus, La Jolla Village Drive and Torrey  Pines Road in La Jolla, Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with matinees  Saturdays and Sundays at 2.

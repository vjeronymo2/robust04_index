			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'PATIENCE IS CRITICAL, BECAUSE YOU DON'T GO FROM THE BAEMENT TO  THE PENTHOUSE WITHOUT CLIMBING UP A WHOLE LOT OF STAIRS'  </P> <P> San Diego State women's basketball coach Beth Burns recently completed her  first season as head coach with the Aztecs. But just a few years ago, when the  31-year-old from Chatham, N.J., competed in college, women's sports were almost  an afterthought. She was a four-year starting forward for Ohio Wesleyan  basketball team who was named the most outstanding female athlete. Burns  participated when women athletes still competed in the Assn. of Intercollegiate  Athletics for Women and full athletic scholarships were virtually unheard of.  Working her way through school while playing basketball and attending class  full time, she earned her bachelor's degree in physical and health education in  1979 and a master's in physical education and psychology in 1981 from Ohio  State, while she was an assistant coach there. Burns went on to become an  assistant coach at University of Colorado and North Carolina State before  coming to SDSU. Burns spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather in her SDSU  office and was photographed by Vince Compagnone.  </P> <P>  In 1975 there were just the rumblings, the beginnings of scholarships for  women. I'd like to think I'm not that old at 31, but it's incredible and  rewarding to me to see the strides we have made in terms of full scholarships  for women. At the time I went to college, I got up, went to school, went to  practice and worked in the kitchen. And I took out loans to go to college. So I  do appreciate the value of an education.  </P> <P> And I've always been interested in athletics. I grew up in a family that was  always athletic. I was surrounded by sports as far as I remember. There's  pictures of dad and me with a whiffle ball when I was 4 years old. If there was  a tree, I'd climb it. If there was a ball, I'd throw it. Growing up, athletics  was everything. We played kickball, soccer, field hockey, volleyball, anything  that was there we did.  </P> <P> My parents really inspired me. My dad, who still lives in Chatham, has been  from the start very supportive, open-minded and encouraging for my sister and  me. When they wouldn't let us play Little League, he'd get out there and start  a league and help us get involved. He never said, only girls can do that, or  only boys can do that. He said, you can do whatever you want to do. My mother  was a source of strength for me. She died when I was 18, which really affected  me. If anyone was to ask me what was the most devastating thing that ever  happened in my life, that would be it. Both of my parents encouraged me to be  successful.  </P> <P> When I went to grade school, we didn't have any organized teams for girls, so I  didn't really play anything competitively until high school. We just played.  There really was nothing organized until they started a local fast-pitch  softball league.  </P> <P> When I started playing organized basketball in high school, it was just  beginning for girls at my high school. They had just started giving you someone  who was a coach and not someone who just sat on the side of the gym and kept it  open from 3 to 4 p.m. and on game day give you a penny and you'd play. This was  frustrating. I didn't have any coaching. I wanted to be good, I wanted to learn  and I wanted my team to be good because I was so competitive. We'd practice for  a half-hour and no one knew what they were doing. We were kind of like the "Bad  News Bears." We lived through those losing seasons, but I think, if anything,  it made me want to be a coach.  </P> <P> When I first got to college, I wanted to be a high school coach. But as soon as  I got there, I wanted to be a college coach. I think it was because I didn't  have people who were really coaches until the fast-pitch softball league. A  couple of the firemen started up a fast-pitch softball team and they were real  coaches. They yelled at us and they made us do what we had to do.  </P> <P> If you zigged instead of zagged, they told you about it. It was never, "It's OK  because you're girls and it doesn't matter." I loved it, there was someone who  was coaching us, pushing us. You would have thought we were playing for a  national championship.  </P> <P> I found that the biggest transition from player to coach was you're used to  doing things physically. When you see a problem, you go out and do something  about it, you go out and play. The hardest thing is to stop doing it with your  body and start with your brain. When I first got out of college, I needed a  seat belt on the bench.  </P> <P> I'm thrilled with this opportunity at SDSU. I think it will take hard work and  the bricks are already starting to be laid. Patience is critical, because you  don't go from the basement to the penthouse without climbing up a whole lot of  stairs. I want to build a program here. I don't want to have a good team  1990-91. I want to have a good program for the rest of the time I'm here.  </P></p>

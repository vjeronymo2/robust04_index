			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VEGETABLES AL FRESCO;  </P> <P> CHEF GROWS WHAT HE SERVES IN GARDENS NEAR RESTAURANT  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks chef Tindaro Pettignano is cultivating fans who have never set  foot in his Ventura Boulevard restaurant or put a fork to his Capelli d'Angelo  Primavera.  </P> <P> He's doing it by cultivating crops a few steps from the rear door of his La  Pergola Italian Ristorante.  </P> <P> Pettignano tends garden plots that are sandwiched between apartments and  condominiums in the shadow of high-rise office buildings near Ventura  Boulevard's busy intersection with Sepulveda Boulevard.  </P> <P> Rows of corn stand next to the street in the front yard of Pettignano's home. A  few doors away, bushy tomato plants are among hundreds of vegetables, flowers  and fruit trees sprouting from a 6,000-square-foot lot at the corner of  Moorpark Street and Lemona Avenue.  </P> <P> His fans include neighbors who never eat in his restaurant but appreciate the  corny look.  </P> <P> "It's refreshing to see something like this in a place like Sherman Oaks, where  there's so much development," said Cynthia Cummins, who visits Pettignano's  mini-farms every day on walks with her 2-year-old daughter Jaclyn.  </P> <P> Cumming says that as "a stay-at-home mommy," she can't afford to eat at  Pettignano's restaurant. But "it's very aesthetic to see his vegetables  growing" instead of the usual Sherman Oaks' kind of growth, involving  "everything being torn down and big condos going up."  </P> <P> Residents of condominiums that overlook Pettignano's miniature agribusiness  keep their eyes peeled for radish rustlers and others who might be tempted to  pick his produce. They also cheer Pettignano on each morning when he hoes and  waters his plants, which are grown without pesticides.  </P> <P> At 11 a.m. each day, Pettignano picks cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes. An hour  later, he serves them as La Pergola Salad, Mista All 'Italiana and Di Mare  Seafood Salad to his restaurant's lunch crowd.  </P> <P> In the afternoon, he turns his eggplant, zucchini and bell peppers into Lasagne  Alla Contadina and other evening dinner specials. He said his gardens provide  him with nearly every vegetable he needs, except mushrooms.  </P> <P> "I don't save any money doing this," said the 38-year-old Italian-born chef.  "It's just a hobby. It makes me happy to grow things. It makes other people  happy to see them. A lot of people around here have never seen anything like  it."  </P> <P> Pettignano started his garden by cultivating his front yard and planting  vegetables in his tiny back yard. Then he decided to track down the owner of  the long-vacant lot at Lemona and Moorpark and agreed to rent it for $200 a  month. He spent about $3,000 to have water piped in.  </P> <P> "I studied agriculture in Italy until I was 18, when I got involved in my  brother's restaurant over there," he said. After coming to the United States  and working as a waiter on a cruise ship and as a chef in San Luis Obispo, he  opened his Sherman Oaks restaurant 1 1/2 years ago.  </P> <P> The front of his 60-chair restaurant is decorated with outdoor planters. Hidden  among their small trees and shrubs are tiny clumps of parsley, basil and other  spices. In a pinch, Pettignano said, he can dash out to harvest an emergency  supply for his kitchen.  </P> <P> Most of Pettignano's customers know about his gardens. Many stroll over to look  at the latest crop.  </P> <P> "The vegetables here are the best I've ever eaten," said diner Paul De  Montesquiou of Woodland Hills. "They are the freshest, tastiest, sweetest I've  ever had in any restaurant."  </P> <P> Diner Bob Delay of Sherman Oaks was unaware of the do-it-yourself produce,  however. "Could I tell the difference in the freshness of my salad? Truthfully?  No," he grinned.  </P> <P> Delay said he came for the Cioppino Alla Livornese. That's a clam dish.  </P></p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Inland Revenue clash looms over merger plan The Inland Revenue is privately threatening to tear up its pay agreement with its staff in retaliation for the creation of a new 'super-union' in the Civil Service which it fears could lead to more conflict. The IRSF, the tax officers' union, plans to amalgamate with the NUCPS union which covers the executive grade in the Civil Service. If their merger plans are accepted by the members, the new union - which would be the biggest in the Civil Service - would come into being next October. Mr Clive Brook, the IRSF general secretary, has already been warned privately by management that such a move could bring future collective bargaining arrangements in the Inland Revenue into question. Under a clause written into the existing agreement either side can reopen the deal if the 'identity' of either is substantially changed. The Inland Revenue insisted this should be included in the agreement over Mr Brook's protest. It is expected that the proposed merger would change the 'identity' of the IRSF, thus enabling the Inland Revenue to decide whether to derecognise the union, end the check-off system of paying union subscriptions or introduce other restrictions on union activity. Mr Brook said last night that the Inland Revenue had wanted to see fewer unions in its business and that the new body was in line with that position. But management is believed to dislike what it sees as the more aggressive campaigning tactics and leftwing strategy of the NUCPS, fearing this could lead to the greater likelihood of disruption. The Inland Revenue said last night that it would consider its next move if the new union was created. The executives of both the unions involved in the merger have just agreed to a joint rulebook. The IRSF is holding a delegate conference next February and both unions will ballot their members on the merger in the spring. This will be followed by further ballots of the rank and file in both unions in the summer to approve the joint rule book. Mr John Sheldon, the NUCPS general secretary, said yesterday that his union was well on the way to financial recovery after restructuring its organisation with the help of overdraft facilities from the Unity Trust Bank. But to allay fears among tax officers that their more prosperous union might be used to finance the NUCPS's activities, Mr Brook said it had been agreed to 'ring-fence' the IRSF's Pounds 3m campaign fund. That money could only be used after the merger by those who now belonged to his union.</p>

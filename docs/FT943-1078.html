			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Multimedia strategist takes on Time Warner - Tony Jackson on the appointment of Norman Pearlstine as editor-in-chief The press release 10 days ago announcing Mr Norman Pearlstine's appointment as editor-in-chief of the US media giant Time Warner contained one curious and revealing sentence. The challenge for Mr Pearlstine, it said, was 'to preside over the explosion of our journalistic creativity . . . into multimedia forms'. In more innocent days, the job of presiding over a group of magazines ranging from Time and Fortune to Sports Illustrated might have been enough to get on with. It is also one for which Mr Pearlstine, a former editor of the Wall Street Journal, is eminently qualified. But the clincher, it seems, is what he has been doing for the past two years: setting up and running his own multimedia investment company. His appointment is a clue not only to developments in the magazine world, but to Time Warner's wider strategy. The company has been in the news lately for its rumoured interest in buying all or part of the NBC television network. The link between broadcasting and programme production is at the currently fashionable end of the multimedia spectrum. Such a deal would also be very expensive. Since the magazines are less fashionable but still highly valuable, there had been speculation that they might be sold. The terms of Mr Pearlstine's appointment plainly suggest otherwise. Mr Pearlstine's two years in the investment game do not seem to have been particularly productive, a fact which he proposes as a lesson in itself. 'I think the most valuable thing I may bring is some caution and scepticism on where the true opportunities are,' he says. 'I must have looked at 400 opportunities in the past two years, and I didn't see that much to excite me.' This caution may partly be a matter of policy. Mr Pearlstine is the first outsider ever to be appointed as Time's editor-in-chief. Besides, though his name is already on the door of his new office, he does not take over officially until January 1. 'I'll never know more about this company than I do now,' he says. 'The more you learn, the more complicated it gets.' He has discovered, he says, that each of the magazines in his stable is well advanced with its own multimedia plans: whether on-line services allowing Time readers to quarrel with the editor by E-mail, or one-off CD-ROM publications by Sports Illustrated. 'One thing I have found is that Time Warner is as far along this road as anyone in America,' he says. What if Time Warner's rumoured interest in a broadcasting network were to bear fruit? 'In that case, I can see more readily how (editorial) content would move back and forward. I can also see how instant polls through TV or on-line (personal computers) could play into the publications. But I don't think giving Fortune and Time reporters camcorders and sending them out to get material for TV would be very useful.' Beyond that lies a wider problem. The essence of print journalism is getting the right words and the right stories into a scarce amount of space. The point about personal computers and the Internet, by contrast, is that it is theoretically possible to call up everything that is known on any conceivable topic. 'I haven't seen a good working business model for that yet,' he says. 'How you work out a model that handles an infinite capacity for information rather than scarcity hasn't been addressed yet.' Traditional journalistic skills may prove his main qualification after all. 'As much as I'm fascinated by new media, and as much as it's a plus for an editor-in-chief to know about it, the bulk of the job is looking after the print magazines for the foreseeable future.'</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Israel in poll offer for Palestinians A FIFTH round of Mideast peace talks opened in Washington yesterday with Israel offering to hold Palestinian municipal elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In a hopeful sign, all five parties - Israel, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians - lowered the volume of rhetoric in briefings after the talks. Israel's offer put in concrete form a proposal discussed in general terms in previous rounds of the Mideast peace talks. Israeli spokesman Benjamin Netanyahu said: 'Today we made several concrete suggestions, the most prominent one being the proposal to have pilot municipal elections in the territories.' He said Israel was putting forward the suggestion in an effort to make concrete progress in the talks. But the proposal received a sceptical response from Palestinians who fear it is an Israeli smokescreen to avoid holding the national elections they are demanding. Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said her delegation wanted elections for all 1.75m inhabitants of the occupied territories and not just the 30 per cent who lived in towns. They wanted the elections to choose a legislative assembly that could take control of the region. Giving further promise of progress in the current round of talks - likely to be the last round before Israeli general elections on June 23  - Syria yesterday relaxed travel restrictions on its Jewish community. The move was in response to Israeli demands as well as the prompting of the US and moderate Arab states.</p>

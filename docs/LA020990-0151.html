			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Genentech Shareholders File Suit: Four Genentech Inc. shareholders have filed  suit in Delaware Chancery Court to block the sale of a 60% stake in the firm to  Roche Holding Co., according to Federal Filings Inc. The report said the  holders contend that the sale of new shares to Roche would severely dilute the  holdings of current holders. They also claim that the $2.1-billion deal is a  change of control of the company, which obligates the Genentech board to  conduct an auction. The South San Francisco-based biotechnology concern said it  had not seen the suit.  </P></p>

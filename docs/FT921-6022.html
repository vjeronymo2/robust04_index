			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: NI rebate cut in Serps move THE government has announced the size of the cut in the rebate in National Insurance payments it is offering to those who opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). From April next year, the rebate will be reduced from the present 5.8 per cent to 4.8 per cent of earnings. The 2 per cent incentive offered to those opting out for the first time will be cut to 1 per cent. Last autumn, the government actuary called for a rebate of 4.68 per cent to ease the state's burden of pension provision by encouraging employees to take out a personal plan instead. Employees who are not members of a company pension scheme enjoy a rebate on National Insurance contributions if they opt out of Serps. Since 1988, more than 4.6m people have done this and gone into personal plans. The rebate is calculated as a percentage of those earnings between the lower and upper National Insurance contribution levels. For the 1991-92 tax year, these limits are Pounds 2,700 and Pounds 20,280 per annum. The present rebate is 8.47 per cent; so if you opt out of Serps for this tax year by April 5, the Department of Social Security will pay a maximum of Pounds 1,490 into a personal pension of your choice. This includes the 2 per cent incentive. Tony Newton, the social security minister who made the announcement on Thursday, said he was considering offering higher rebates to older people and less generous ones to those in their 20s. He proposed an additional rebate of 1 per cent payable only to those aged 30 and above on personal pension plans from April 1993. Flat-rate rebates favour those in their 20s and 30s since they have longer to invest them - which should result in a larger pension. Sun Life, the insurance company, yesterday criticised limiting the 1 per cent additional rebate solely to personal plans and not to final salary and occupational money purchase schemes, warning that it would result in bias against these schemes. It recommended that, in general men, over 47 and women over 40 should not contract out if they were doing so for the first time.</p>

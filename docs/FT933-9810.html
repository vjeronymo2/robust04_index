			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: Joy of a poetic frame of mind Sir, Michael Glover writes in his article, 'Poetry with perception' (July 31-August 1): 'Learning poetry by rote in UK schools is, effectively, dead - and few would wish anything else.' I am one of the few. I wish I had learned a hundred times more than I did, while it was still easy. A mind without snatches of poetry, and some good long pieces, must be like a mind without tunes.

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: How to order room service and save time What do you do after you have placed an order with room service? A shower is out of the question - the food will arrive soon and you do not want to answer the door wrapped in a towel. Telephoning home is not a good idea - you might be interrupted, writes Michael Skapinker. You could do some work, but you are jet-lagged and hungry. So you lie on your bed watching CNN, noting how difficult it is to fill a 24-hour news service. Fifty minutes later, your order has still not arrived. You are seething at the wasted time. You telephone room service to complain. You begin: 'I ordered some food nearly an hour ago . . . ' only to be interrupted by a knock on the door. 'Ah, I think that might be it,' you say weakly. Some hotels say they understand how you feel. Jane Mackie, European marketing manager at ITT Sheraton, says interviews with guests at European hotels showed that they wanted room service 24 hours a day, and more control over when it arrived. She says Sheraton plans to introduce an appointments system, allowing guests to specify what time they want their room service order to be delivered. Guests who want to go for a swim can ask for orders to arrive in exactly 90 minutes, for example. When they go out in the morning, they can say they want their order to arrive at a specific time in the evening. There will be a minimum delivery period. Kurt Ritter, chief executive of Radisson-SAS hotels, says he has come up with another answer. At the company's hotel at Stockholm rail station, you can order food from the McDonald's next door. The order arrives in four minutes. The service is available 24 hours a day. Your bill is debited and the hotel settles with McDonald's later. You can order healthier fare from the hotel's restaurants, but Ritter says his guests seem to prefer McDonald's.</p>

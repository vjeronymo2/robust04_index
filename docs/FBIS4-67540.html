			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- An Environment Agency panel  has drafted a new long-term program calling for greater  involvement by individuals, businesses and the government in  efforts to protect natural surroundings from industrial  pollution.    KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the draft program  sketched out by the agency's central environmental council,  headed by University of Tokyo Professor Emeritus Jiro Kondo.    The draft says, "the expansion of human social and economic  activities...led to the excessive use of natural resources so as  to nullify the environment's ability to restore original levels  of the resources, while depleting wildlife and reducing its  ability to survive."    "It also triggered pollution of the environment by expanding  the discharge of unnecessary waste," it said.    "It is also important to defend and preserve the environment  by conquering the sort of environmental destruction attributable  to modern lifestyles in cities," it said.    The draft urged the public in developed countries to  "question the current mode of civilization where prevailing  values have encouraged mass production, huge consumption and the  subsequent vast discharge of waste into the environment."    The report also urged individual members of Japanese society  to "take action" useful in staving off environmental  deterioration.    However, it stopped short of setting numerical targets and  specific timetables that could be referred to as yardsticks for  attaining the cleanup of contaminated areas.    The report also urged the government and local communities  to  step up efforts to preserve and protect small forests in cities  that have survived the rapid urbanization of Japan.    It cautioned that such forests, beaches and paddy fields in  mountainous areas are on the brink of losing their natural  capabilities to provide shelter to small animals and to clean up  contaminated water.    The draft also urged efforts to prevent wildlife not native  to Japan, like the black bass, from damaging Japan's ecosystem.  Such wildlife have infiltrated the Japanese environment  following their intentional or unwitting importation, the report  said.</p>

At a press conference Monday [17 January], Landsbergis  commented on a meeting of Polish and Lithuanian politicians,  scholars and representatives of social organizations, held in  Warsaw Saturday. The meeting's participants focused on common  political interests of both countries and also discussed the  problem of Russian military force in the Kaliningrad region.  Lithuanian and Polish politicians must seek the region's  demilitarization, Landsbergis said. In his opinion, the struggle  against the emerging Russian imperialism could also be a common  interest, as well as Lithuania's rapproachement with the  Visegrad Treaty (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech  Republic).    The opposition leader specified some reports that Poland  regrets the absence of an agreement on friendship and  cooperation with Lithuania. Landsbergis said the Lithuanian side  emphasizes the need to sign a separate declaration on the 1920  occupation of the Vilnius region by Poland together with the  main agreement.    Landsbergis said Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  expressed hope that the problem will soon be solved.    The opposition leader said the Polish side apologized  several  times for a letter to President Lech Walesa, signed by 72  members of the Polish parliamentary majority. As previously  reported, the letter suggests very categorical terms of signing  the agreement. Landsbergis said an apology was also made by the  chairman of the Polish party in power.    "Possibilities to agree do exist, but there are opponents  who  seek to prevent this."</p>

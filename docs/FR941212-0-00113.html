Those U.S. inhabitants whose claims would otherwise be cognizable under the Military Claims Act (subpart C) and who are deemed by the receiving state to be proper claimants under the SOFA claims provisions must also file with the receiving state. However, if they fail to do so, their claim may be considered under subpart C, for good cause, with the permission of the Commander, USARCS. Claims for which a foreign country is responsible under a SOFA or similar agreement will not be paid under subpart J or subpart C without prior approval of the Commander, USARCS or the senior JA in country (&sect;&sect;536.52(a)(3) and 536.152(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) A claim filed and adjudicated by a receiving state under a SOFA or other international agreement claims provision may be considered under other claims provisions of this regulation only if the receiving state denied the claim on the basis that it was not cognizable under the treaty or agreement provisions. Where a claimant has filed a claim with a receiving state and received payment, such payment will be the claimant's final and exclusive remedy against the United States. If the claim is denied on the merits by the receiving state, that action will also be the claimant's final and conclusive remedy against the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.117  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Commander, USARCS, is responsible for_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Providing policy guidance to command claims services concerning SOFA or other treaty reimbursement programs implementing 10 U.S.C. 2734a. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Monitoring the reimbursement system to ensure that programs are in place for the proper verification and certification of reimbursement claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Monitoring funds expended for reimbursements to foreign governments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Command claims services within whose jurisdiction SOFA or other treaty provisions providing for a claims reimbursement system are in force and where DA has been assigned single-service responsibility for the foreign country seeking reimbursement (see &sect;536.159) are responsible for_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Establishing a program for the verification, certification, and reimbursement of claims.

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Books: A welcome D-Day Armada - Publishers have mobilised. Ian Davidson picks the best works Surrender: young members of the Wehrmacht - from D-Day: The Climactic Battle of World War II by Stephen E Ambrose (Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 20) It was with foreboding that I tackled this clutch of books about D-Day and the Normandy landings. There was little reason to suppose that the familiar story would be improved by the hoop-la of the 50th anniversary. And yet, the D-Day landings were an amazing event. It was the biggest sea-borne invasion in history, the product of an extraordinary combination of intelligence, deception, secrecy, inventiveness, planning, engineering, logistics, discipline and bravery. None of this would have been able to overcome the fearful odds, if the operation had not been over-arched by an astonishing depth and intensity of international co-operation and military integration between the allies, which laid the foundations for Europe's security throughout the next 50 years. If you want to know the essential story, I cannot imagine a better place to begin than the Penguin Atlas of D-Day (Viking / Penguin, 143 pages, Pounds 17 in hardback, Pounds 10 in paperback). This is a superbly produced little book, with excellent maps in colour, which illuminate every aspect of the operation from the planning to the armada, from the landings to the bridgehead, right through to the end of the Normandy campaign 10 weeks later. If you are a military history buff, and want to trace the movements of an individual division, the index gives a reference to relevant maps and text. The text is the real bonus. I had expected the words to be no more than a make-shift skeleton of facts, filling in the spaces between the maps. In fact, it is a sizzling narrative, told with verve and drama by John Man; and he skilfully intersperses the detailed account of events on the battlefield with glimpses of the larger picture and stimulating judgments which avoid any taint of patriotic prejudice. David Evans' Guide to the Beaches and Battlefields of Normandy (Michael Joseph, Pounds 14.99, 186 pages) is a more pedestrian affair. It is obviously intended as a utilitarian handbook for military tourists or relatives of men who fought in Normandy. There is a short historical section, but the book is mainly devoted to an alphabetical gazetteer of villages and towns in Normandy, with brief thumb-nail sketches of their associations with the campaign, and their war memorials and museums. Unfortunately, the maps and diagrams, in black and white, are rather crude. If it is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, then a book of photographs of the invasion ought to give the vividest possible impression of a great and dramatic event. The curious thing about D-Day: the Invasion in Photographs (edited by Tony Hall, Salamander, Pounds 4.99, 64 pages, paperback) is that the overall impression is rather confused and unfocussed. Perhaps this is because this book does not include the best selection of the available photographs. Or perhaps it is unavoidable that the dominant impression through the lens is the fog of battle; it is only afterwards that the researcher can reconstruct the drama and its meaning - which must be conveyed in words. Russell Miller's Nothing Less Than Victory (Penguin, Pounds 7.99, 496 pages, paperback), is in its way a verbal equivalent of the book of photographs, because this is an oral history of the invasion, told afterwards by men (from both sides) who were there. Some of the extracts are drawn from books or other published sources. But most of them are from interviews conducted by the author, and cumulatively they give a powerful impression of what it was like to be alive in 1944, to be young, and to be at war. D-Day 1944 (by Robin Neillands and Roderick de Normann, Orion, Pounds 5.99, 320 pages, paperback) is another attempt to tell the story of the invasion in the words of men who were there. But where Russell Miller leaves the extracts to speak for themselves, Neillands and de Normann have woven their first-hand sources into a seamless story. This is warfare at ground level, and a vivid and frightening experience for all these terribly young men. Someone took a lot of trouble to liven up the page layouts in D-Day: the Normandy Landings and the Liberation of Europe (Anthony Kemp, Thames and Hudson, Pounds 6.95, 194 pages, paperback). Unfortunately, the effect is so busy, with different type-sizes and different types of illustration inter-twining with the text on every page, that the result is difficult to read. Anthony Kemp has produced a straightforward narrative, but the visual confusion does not help, even if many of the illustrations are striking. The attraction of a first-hand account of war, such as Geoffrey Picot's Accidental Warrior (Penguin, Pounds 6.99, 318 pages paperback) or Alastair Borthwick's Battalion (Baton Wicks, Pounds 16.99, 270 pages) is that it can give a powerful impression of what it was like to be there; the drawback is that personal knowledge is almost invariably confined to a small perimeter: the individual soldier knows little of the battle, and almost nothing of the campaign. Geoffrey Picot, a 19-year-old infantry officer in Normandy, makes this explicit. 'Those who get their picture of a battle from films where seemingly hundreds of rival soldiers are packed into a few hundred square yards may have difficulty imagining a real battlefield. You and a couple of pals can be hundreds of yards from anybody else; you may not have much idea where friend or foe are. You fire from a concealed position to a hidden target. And how on earth do you find out what is going on?' Accidental Warrior has been praised by soldiers. I found it a bit too stiff-upper-lip; as Russell Miller found when he was interviewing for his oral history, the English were less ready to admit to any real feelings than the Americans. Borthwick, however, has a turn for engaging humour. 'Egg-hunting was the only sport possible in St Honorine, and it was pursued so diligently by the garrison that some claimed eggs were snatched before they even touched the straw. All the hens certainly had a harassed look . . . You had to follow the hen into the hen-house and sit staring it out of countenance until it had laid, because if you took your eyes off it for a second someone came in and robbed you.' Battalion was published in 1946, under the title Sans Peur; it deserves its re-issue. Decision in Normandy, by the American military historian Carlo d'Este (Harper Collins, Pounds 10.99, 558 pages, paperback) is another welcome reissue. First published in 1983, it is detailed, comprehensive, deeply researched, penetrating, and well written; it has become and will doubtless long remain one of the classic accounts of the Normandy campaign.</p>

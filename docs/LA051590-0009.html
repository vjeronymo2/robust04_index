			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VALENZUELA DOES DOUBLE DUTY AS DODGERS END SLUMP, 3-2  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela turned back the clock and the Montreal Expos on Monday with  a vintage performance that earned him standing ovations for his hitting as well  as his pitching.  </P> <P> With the Dodgers reeling from a six-game losing streak and desperately looking  for a stopper in Orel Hershiser's absence, Valenzuela stepped up with a 3-2  victory in the opener of an eight-game home stand at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> The veteran left-hander not only improved to 3-3 in winning his third game in  four starts, but he went two for two with a home run, picked off Tim Raines --  the potential tying run -- in the eighth inning and withstood some more shaky  Dodger defense, working around two errors by third baseman Mike Sharperson that  put runners in scoring position.  </P> <P> After giving up a home run to losing pitcher Kevin Gross (4-2), Valenzuela got  the crowd of 28,758 roaring in the third inning with his first home run since  Sept. 5, 1987. He then sailed through three perfect innings, aided by two  outstanding fielding plays by shortstop Alfredo Griffin, and got out of trouble  after giving up an unearned run in the eighth by catching Raines leaning the  wrong way off first.  </P> <P> Valenzuela was so combative in the ninth that after he walked leadoff batter  Andres Galarraga, he tried to persuade pitching coach Ron Perranoski to leave  him in the game, and stalked off angrily when Don Aase was brought in for his  second save.  </P> <P> Afterward, Valenzuela acknowledged that he was tired. "I like to stay in the  game all the time," he said. "After the first inning I felt like it was one of  those (good) games."  </P> <P> Expo Manager Buck Rodgers said after Gross homered, Valenzuela "was awful good.  He's the kind of guy who doesn't have a best pitch -- he used all his pitches  and kept us off balance."  </P> <P> Valenzuela was in control for much of the game, striking out six through five  innings and giving up only one other hit out of the infield through seven  innings. He gave up five hits and walked one in his eight innings.  </P> <P> And Valenzuela seemed to energize the offense when he hit Gross' first pitch of  the third inning over the right-field fence. Juan Samuel followed with a single  and his 17th stolen base and Lenny Harris doubled him in. Four batters later,  Mike Scioscia drove in the third run home with a sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> The Dodgers also threatened in the fourth, Griffin and Valenzuela opening with  singles to put runners at first and third. It took a running catch by Expo  rookie outfielder Larry Walker that was turned into a double play at the plate  to quell the rally.  </P> <P> Even Dodger first baseman Eddie Murray seemed rejuvenated Monday, stealing his  first base of the season after missing a game during the weekend because of a  strained hamstring.  </P> <P> It was Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda who put Valenzuela's performance in  perspective. Asked if he would have let Valenzuela finish the game five years  ago, Lasorda said, "Five years ago he was five years younger."  </P> <P> Valenzuela, who threw 118 pitches, lowered his earned run average to 2.68,  raised his batting average to .333 and brightened the Dodgers' outlook. The  home run was the eighth of his career.  </P> <P> "It's my eighth. I knew the ball was going out," he said.  </P> <P> Said Gross: "He's hit a lot more (home runs) than I have. I threw a good pitch  at his knees, he just lifted it. . . . Maybe this was just their night to win."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Left-handed reliever Ray Searage, suffering soreness in his left elbow, Monday  was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to May 11. Left-hander Mike  Munoz was recalled from Albuquerque to take his place. Searage was examined by  Dr. Frank Jobe, whose diagnosis was inflammation of the muscles. . . . Disabled  pitchers Pat Perry and Jim Gott pitched for Bakersfield Sunday. Gott will throw  a simulated game here Wednesday. . . . Disabled outfielder Kirk Gibson took  batting practice, ran and threw Monday. . . . Disabled reliever Jay Howell  worked out Monday and hopes to return soon.  </P> <P> Juan Samuel started in center field Monday night but said he expects to be at  second base tonight. The newest Dodger, Stan Javier, was in uniform Monday,  wearing No. 5 -- which, he said, has no special significance. Dodger Manager  Tom Lasorda's first advice to Javier was, "Stay away from (Mickey) Hatcher. The  last three guys who hung around him went down. We fine (Brian) Traxler for  sitting next to him in the dugout."  </P></p>

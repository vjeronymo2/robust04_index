			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Pensions switch tax blow forecast Thousands of workers moving into pension schemes for the first time may face extra income tax demands, the President of the Institute of Taxation said yesterday. Mr Ian Luder urged the government to take statutory action to help those affected. Two recent developments in the pensions industry will result in large movements into schemes. In September the European Court of Justice ruled that barring part-time workers from pension schemes amounted to indirect discrimination against women and must stop. Earlier this week the Securities and Investments Board said hundreds of thousands of personal pensions sold since 1988 had to be reviewed. Large numbers of workers will be seeking entry to pension schemes and the backdating of payments and benefits. Although contributions to pension schemes of less than 15 per cent receive tax relief, Mr Luder is worried that the most vulnerable workers entering pension schemes may have to make a first-time contribution over the 15 per cent tax threshold. The Inland Revenue said those involved could avoid the 'rolling-up' of contributions by asking pension companies for an instalment plan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oil Exports Planned To Go Up"] </F>   [Text] The Fuel and Energy Ministry has requested that the  Russian Government allocate an extra quota to export 2-3 million  tonnes of crude oil with a corresponding overall increase in  Russian enterprises' oil export quotas for 1994. The ministry  thinks that oil exports will guarantee that Western banks will  give loans to restructure the coal industry and to close mines  that have no future prospects. At present, the Fuel and Energy  Ministry and the Rosugol company are conducting talks with  representatives of German and Portuguese firms and the World  Bank on possible cooperation in the implementation of this  program.</p>

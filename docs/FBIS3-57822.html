Briquemont succeeded French General Philippe Morillon as the  UN's top soldier in Bosnia in July last year, and like Morillon  has frequently expressed anger at the UN Protection Force's  (UNPROFOR) lack of means to protect civilians in Bosnia and stop  attacks on UN aid convoys.    Briquemont's one-year stint as UNPROFOR head ends in July.  But the defence officials said Belgium had asked UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to release him earlier.    The Belgian military authorities would give no official  reason for its request to recall Briquemont, apart from saying  that he was needed to help restructure Belgium's defence force.    Briquemont recently demanded reinforcements for the  12,000-strong UNPROFOR contingent in Bosnia, and said he no  longer bothered to read unheeded UN resolutions on the civil war  in the ex-Yugoslav republic.    The Belgian radio station RTBF said Briquemont might be  recalled as early as the end of January. A Belgian Defence  Ministry spokesman said Belgium would nominate another top  military officer to serve out Briquemont's term.    On Monday [3 January], French General Jean Cot, commander in  chief of the 30,000-strong UNPROFOR force in ex-Yugoslavia,  complained of the "humiliations" suffered by the UN troops and  said it was ready for an "offensive intervention" in Bosnia.</p>

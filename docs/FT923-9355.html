			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / ICI demerger given provisional approval by Inland Revenue THE INLAND REVENUE has given provisional approval for the restructuring plans of Imperial Chemical Industries, clearing the way for the UK's largest ever demerger, which will split the company into two separately quoted groups, ICI and ICI Bioscience. The approval - known as pre-clearance - has been agreed in discussions over the past two months and removes the most important stumbling block to the demerger. ICI said yesterday it hoped to launch a secondary share issue for ICI Bio, which will be comprised of the group's drugs and agrochemicals operations, in April or May of next year. Pre-clearance by the Inland Revenue will ensure the demerger is practically tax neutral, and does not generate greater liability for advance corporation tax or capital gains for shareholders. Mr Colin Short, ICI's finance director, said the dividends paid next year would be decided by the two boards separately after the demerger. He claimed, however, the move was not a subterfuge to reduce ICI's dividend. Mr Short said: 'The Inland Revenue was far and away the most significant potential show-stopper. I believe this is the largest and most complicated demerger the UK has ever seen.' He said ICI had also obtained a strong opinion from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, its US legal adviser, that the demerger plans should be acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service. Details of the demerger - known internally as 'project mortar' - will be submitted next month to tax authorities in the other 150 countries in which ICI operates. 'Even with a following wind, it will take until the end of the year to prepare the demerger,' said Mr Short. The way would then be clear for the split after the annual results are announced on February 25 and the annual report is published on March 4. A prospectus for a secondary offer in ICI Bio will be published shortly afterwards. 'In early March, we'll poke our nose out of the Millbank windows and take a look at the markets. If they look fine, ICI Bio will raise equity in about April or May.' The company will study the recent Wellcome share sale carefully. SG Warburg will be advising ICI, while Goldman Sachs would probably advise in the US. Tax tangle, Page 17</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Mass march in Bonn opposes benefit cuts MORE THAN 100,000 building workers converged on Bonn yesterday in a mass protest against the social spending cuts ordered by the German government. In the biggest demonstration of union discontent yet organised in a 'hot autumn' of protest, the builders denounced government plans to cancel their 'bad weather money', which is paid as an alternative to unemployment benefit in the winter months. Mr Bruno Kobele, leader of the building workers' union, accused the Bonn coalition of 'running socially amok' with its savings plans, which will cut unemployment benefit by three percentage points, limit its duration to two years, and abolish the workers' special deal. The 'bad weather' money has existed since 1959 to prevent mass winter lay-offs in the industry. The size of the turnout surprised even the organisers, and confirms a gathering mood of discontent in the German workforce at the combined squeeze of increasing unemployment, reduced social spending, and rising tax and social security deductions. At the same time, there was confirmation yesterday of growing support for short-time working to be introduced as an alternative to outright job cuts. The Volkswagen plan to bring in a four-day week as an alternative to mass redundancies was formally proposed by a workers' leader at Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the troubled Daimler-Benz subsidiary which has announced cuts of up to 16,000 jobs. Mr Horst Kowalczyk, works council chairman in the Deutsche Aerospace Airbus division, called on the management to negotiate alternatives such as the four-day week to its planned programme of plant closures, which will shut two large plants in Munich and Lemwerder in Lower Saxony. He was speaking at a mass meeting at the threatened Munich-Neuaubing plant, where more than 1,000 workers whistled and heckled Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, head of the Airbus division, and Mr Georg von Waldenfels, the Bavarian finance minister.</p>

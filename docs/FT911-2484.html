			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Looking for something to build on: Lafarge Coppee seeks to cement its future Watching the economy for signs of an upturn can be hard enough at any time, but with weather fluctuations and the Gulf crisis disturbing the signals, the task becomes even more unsettling. 'I would love to have a clear model to hang on to,' says Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman of Lafarge Coppee,the largest French cement and construction materials group. For 1990, the impact was clear enough. The recession in North America, especially in Canada,made a dent in Lafarge's earnings. Lafarge Corporation, the group's US offshoot, suffered an 8 per cent drop in operating profits, with net profits stable at FFr2.19bn (Dollars 360m) thanks to higher exceptional gains and a lower tax charge. Europe, on the other hand - especially Lafarge's domestic market in France - showed only a slight downturn. In Spain, Lafarge's Asland subsidiary, acquiredin 1989, continued to produce strong profits despite a flattening of the cementmarket and an increase in competition from imports. Mr Collomb does not expect much of a pick-up in business in North America before the end of the year, although he notes significant regional variations: Florida, he says, is now a disastrous market for cement, as bad as Ontario was last year, whereas the GreatLakes have resisted the recession better and Texas is now recovering. More disconcerting, however, were Lafarge's difficulties in two other markets which are expanding rapidly: plasterboard and bio-technologies. In plasterboard, where the group ranks second in Europe with a 25 per cent market share sinceit teamed up last year with Redland of the UK, overcapacity has led to price-cutting wars. Operating profits in this sector halved last year to FFr136m. 'It is clear prices are at levels where no-one earns any money, but we consider that we are among the most competitive,' he says. Over the longer term, Lafarge expects the plasterboard market to show annual growth of 5 per cent. For the immediate future, Mr Collomb draws encouragement from a recent price riseintroduced in the UK by BPB, the market leader, but still expects 1991 to be a difficult year. Lafarge's bio-technologies division, meanwhile, sank backto an operating loss of FFr59m last year, after profits of FFr212m in 1989. Buffeted by the decline in the dollar, the lysine business, making animal feedstuffs, saw prices plunge by 30 per cent, although Mr Collomb says demand is still strong for products like monosodium glutamate, and the seeds division showed a slight improvement. This division is the one which financial analysts have always had the most difficulty in reconciling with Lafarge's core businesses in the construction materials sector, but Mr Collomb appears ready to persevere withthis diversification. Seeds, however, are one sector where Lafarge is rethinking its position. Mr Collomb plans to continue developing its vegetable and flower seed sector, but he is now seeking a partner in the cereal seeds business to enable the group to take better advantage of the research it has put in. For 1991, Mr Collomb denies adopting a defensive posture, although he admits to a prudent approach. He plans to continue exploiting the reserves of profitability in the companies Lafarge has acquired over the last two years  -which he says are already making a positive contribution to earnings after financing costs - by bringing productivity up to the group's normal levels, and to maintain industrial investments. The overall investment budget will be restricted to what Lafarge can cover with its own cashflow, or around FFr5bn, but the acquisitions budget will be reined in after the FFr12bn spending spree of the last two years - although there could still be room for acquisitions up to around FFr2.5bn, perhaps in Lafarge's developing paints and special building materials division. 'We are not expecting a miraculous economic upturn, but we are not going into hibernation,' Mr Collomb says.</p>

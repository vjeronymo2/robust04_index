Deputy Prime Minister [PM] Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim conveyed  this message to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen today.    "Give us a break. Fair enough we want to establish  democracies and believe in the principle of human rights,  although the perception may differ slightly.    "But have a better understanding, listen a bit more  establish  an effective channel of communication and rapport among  countries and cultures," Anwar said he told Bentsen.    Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said this in reply to a  question from the foreign Press about Malaysia's views on human  rights and U.S. moves to set human rights standards for the  Chinese.    Anwar, however, made it clear that he was not making a  particular reference to the Chinese but that he generally felt  there was a need to show a great deal more tolerance.    Asked what would happen if this was not done, Anwar replied:  "Then you come out with very crude tough pronouncements or  policies.    "And worse still if you use trade and aid issues to force  down the throats of leaders and countries so that they see your  point of view. I think what we need is dialogue and persuasion."    Anwar told a packed conference room that there were some  serious problems of complexities in some countries.    He added that this was not an exaggeration and neither was  it  an issue meant to condone the excesses of other countries.    But there was a need to understand the concerns and views of  others.    "There is nothing stopping us in democratic societies with a  free Press to highlight issues. But of course we differ if  these are taken as judgment or conclusion that will influence  policies of the powerful world against the developing world in  particular."    Anwar said Malaysia did not condone any sort of oppression  or  depression but added that to assume that some countries "have  the sole monopoly and understanding of what constitutes  democracy and human rights is certainly a very false arrogance."    "In this multi cultural and pluralistic world, we have to  appreciate predicaments, problems and complexities of various  countries and cultures."    Asked whether Bentsen tried to persuade him to take a more  positive view of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC),  Anwar replied that Malaysia had always had a positive view of  APEC.    "However, we do not believe that it should be  institutionalised." he added.    Asked about the liberalisation of financial markets and  possible moves by the U.S. to seek greater opening of these  sectors in Asian countries, Anwar said Malaysia would not move  backwards but move forward adding that it was the manner and the  speed that was the issue.    "As a principle I think developing countries must be given  some lead time to start their infrastructure and gather enough  experience before we can move further ahead".    Anwar had explained to Bensten at the World Bank IMF meeting  that most foreign banks had operations in Malaysia and to a  large extent continued to do so.    "But to further liberalise means that they will not have  free  competition at all because we will have to give some leeway to  allow for locals to have some experience before they can  continue to compete.    "What we are asking is for some breathing space.    "It is not an issue whether to open or not. The question is  whether to continue to further liberalise, it's already quite  liberal."    "Even now 16 of the 36 banks in Malaysia are foreign and  some  30 percent of total deposits in Malaysia are with the foreign  banks.    "To say that countries in the region are not giving access  to  their financial markets is not true. It is a question of access  to what extent that is given at that particular time".    In terms of capital flows and the resultant impact on the  economy, Anwar said there was speculation in the stock market  and the ringgit [Malaysian currency].    "These are normal problems of success. If people believe in  the ringgit and speculate in the ringgit then what do we do?  "But I think getting more information and to see and learn from  their experiences will be a great help in managing our economy,"  he said.</p>

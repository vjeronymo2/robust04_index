			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Moscow acts to defend rouble THE RUSSIAN government announced emergency measures to defend the rouble yesterday after it plunged 18 per cent against the dollar to Rbs1,299. The rouble's fall was blamed on the political crisis, an end to central bank dollar sales, and loose monetary policy. The emergency measures included an increase in the central bank's discount rate from 170 per cent to 200 per cent. It had earlier lifted the rate to 180 per cent. The government also recommended that Sberbank, Russia's biggest savings bank, increase its savings rate. The central bank, placed under direct government control in Mr Yeltsin's decree on Tuesday, last increased the discount rate in July. Mr George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier, promised Dollars 250m in new aid for Russia's education system during a meeting with Mr Boris Yeltsin in Moscow yesterday.</p>

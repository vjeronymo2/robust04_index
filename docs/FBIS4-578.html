			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye  returned to the Zambian capital yesterday after a stopover in  Luanda, following his return from Geneva, where he had held  talks with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. As always,  the UN special representative did not hazard any guesses, though  he believes in a favorable outcome to the Lusaka peace talks.    [Begin Beye recording, in French with passage-by-passage  translation into Portuguese] If someone could come up with a way  for us to achieve peace, I would immediately seek and consult  with that person. [end recording]    While in Luanda, the UN special representative was received  by President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos and  National Assembly Chairman Fernando Franca van Dunem. Blondin  Beye was not willing to reveal the nature of his talks with the  Angolan head of state or with the National Assembly chairman,  saying it would be discourteous to do so.    [Begin Beye recording in French, fading into Portuguese  translation] It would be irresponsible on my part to leave the  president of the Republic's office and promptly tell you: Here,  this is what he has just told me. I do not intend to be  disrespectful toward the Angolan people. I cannot do that. I  want to work for peace, so I cannot disclose (?things like  that). [end recording</p>

Two years ago it  was "missiles-by-rail" and now it is "trash-by-train." We wonder if Christmas  gifts of toy train sets for these wackos will end their frustrations and nutty  ideas for our Riverside County rights-of-way and leave us to the serious  business of promoting needed rail commuter service between Coachella Valley and  the coast through the pass and Inland Empire.  </P> <P> DOLLIE IRWIN  </P> <P> Banning  </P> <P> CAROLYN TOENJES  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

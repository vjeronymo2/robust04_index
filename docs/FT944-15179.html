			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US launches investigation of EU banana marketing regime The US is the latest combatant to enter the EU banana wars, claiming discrimination against US bananas. 'American banana marketing companies should be able to compete on a fair basis in the European market, just as European firms can here,' says Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, who has launched an investigation of EU banana marketing practices under Section 301 of US trade law. Kantor is also considering an investigation of the EU 'Framework Agreement on Bananas' reached with Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The framework accord was negotiated as a result of a complaint filed by the Latin American producers under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After a dispute settlement panel ruled against the EU, the Community agreed to modify its banana import regime which gave special access to former colonies in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific. It granted the four Latin American countries specific quotas based on their past share of the market, within an overall ceiling of 2.1m tonnes from Latin America. Kantor said the framework permits the governments of Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela to impose 'in a discriminatory manner, export quotas and licenses on US banana marketing and distribution companies'. In addition, it does not address the import licensing provisions of the EU-wide banana regime, agreed in July 1993. Mr Kantor said he would not file a formal complaint against the framework until it is implemented. The regime is also under threat from Germany, which argues that it discriminates against its traditional suppliers in Latin America. Bonn has taken two cases challenging the quota system to the European Court. Kantor called on Latin American governments to work with the US in seeking reform of the EU's banana policy. But he threatened an investigation if any of the governments implements the framework pact 'or takes alternative steps that appear to be unreasonable, unjustifiable and discriminatory against US companies'. Section 301 allows US companies - in this case Chiquita Brands International and the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association - to ask the US government's help in gaining relief from 'unfair trade practices'.</p>

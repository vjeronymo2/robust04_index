			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / NZ warned of inflation dangers New Zealand is now reaping the benefit of the economic reforms introduced since the mid-1980s, but the challenge for policymakers will be to ensure that high growth does not lead to a resurgence of inflation or a deterioration in the balance of payments, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. Its latest survey predicted growth of 3.9 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent next, making New Zealand one of the fastest growing OECD economies, the report said. It was based on data available around mid-year, since when the economy has appeared to be growing even faster, prompting the Reserve Bank to tighten monetary conditions, most recently last week. 'The main challenge for policy now appears to be managing the risks associated with fast economic expansion, while enhancing growth and employment prospects,' the report said. 'Although the current monetary policy and labour market arrangements should reduce these risks, they have yet to be tested in a strong growth environment.' The task would be made easier if the current improvement in New Zealand's fiscal situation, which has seen the budget swing into surplus, were used to redeem government debt, the report added. 'The current speed of budget consolidation being probably the minimum required to ensure a balanced policy mix, a loosening of the fiscal stance risks placing undue pressure on monetary policy. 'A strong case can also be made for running budget surpluses in the medium term,' it said, citing the need to reduce the level of net public debt relative to gross domestic product, 'an area where new Zealand has performed badly by international standards.' New Zealand's high growth rate was finally starting to help reduce unemployment, but with the rate expected to remain over 8 per cent next year, there should be enough slack in the labour market to mitigate pressures on wage rates, the report said. This should be consistent with inflation staying within the official target range of zero to 2 per cent, while the current account balance of payments deficit, which last year held roughly steady at NZDollars 41.65bn (Pounds 16.8bn) should decline. The OECD said it expected the implementation of the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation to bring a one-off net gain to New Zealand of some 0.6 per cent of gross domestic product, largely as a result of increased world prices for its beef, dairy, forestry and fishing products.

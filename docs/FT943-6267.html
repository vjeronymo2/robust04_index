			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): SBF acts to curb Euro Disney bloodletting The absence of UK business took its toll of bourse volume yesterday morning, but the afternoon saw more action after a lively start on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ended higher, the CAC 40 index advancing 12.53 to 2,075.27. But on a thin day, with turnover of FFr2.4bn, any satisfaction professionals might have had was marred by Euro Disney and Danone. The leisure group, suspended limit down on Friday, was twice suspended yesterday for the same reason as it fell by 10 per cent, and then by a further 5 per cent. Finally, the French Bourses Association, SBF, said it had put a FFr7.75 floor under the shares for the day, and would not execute orders below that price. Euro Disney was finally FFr1.10, or nearly 12 per cent, lower at FFr8.40 after bottoming out at FFr7.75, depressed by poor prospects and the lack of apparent value in the stock. Danone, the food group, dropped FFr32, or 3.8 per cent, to FFr814. Here, the market liked neither the fall of 8 per cent in first-half profits, nor the nomination of Mr Franck Riboud, son of the Danone chairman, to the board. FRANKFURT ignored trenchant arguments expressed last week about the expensiveness of its equity market, and continued to attach itself to US stocks and bonds. There was little real excitement about a 31.65 rise to 2,193.65 in the Dax index on the session, because volume was inhibited by London's closure and the session's gain little more than consolidated the post-bourse close of 2,190.58 last Friday. However, yesterday's post-bourse took the Ibis indicated Dax up a further 25.14 to 2,215.72 as strength in the dollar continued, and bund futures broke through resistance at 92. The afternoon's big winners included both oversold defensive stocks and recently popular cyclicals, Deutsche Bank and Bayernhypo closing the post bourse up DM13.50 at DM431.50 and DM13.50 at DM740.50, and Bayer and Hoechst gaining DM8 and DM8.80 respectively to DM379.50 and DM369.50. ZURICH moved forward 2.1 per cent in active trade which saw the return of some private investors on Wall Street and bond markets. The SMI index finished 53.9 higher at 2,635.2, with the firm dollar proving a further positive factor. Among the banks, hard hit in the weeks since reporting six-month figures, UBS bearers rose SFr34 to SFr1,160. One analyst noted that investors appeared to be switching from SBC to UBS on reconsideration of its results and in response to news that UBS had substantially increased its securities portfolio in the first half of the year. CS Holding firmed SFr15 to SFr541. Roche certificates rose SFr140 to SFr5,985, close to resistance at SFr6,000. Ciba registered added SFr22 at SFr821 amid optimism that the group would confirm hopes tomorrow that earnings were accelerating in its industrial and agricultural sectors. Sandoz, also with half-year results due later in the week, saw its bearers advance SFr22 to SFr715. Oerlikon-Buhrle, which released lower than expected half-year figures on Saturday, slipped SFr3 to SFr145. Bearer shares in Surveillance dropped SFr35, or 1.7 per cent, to SFr2,085 following news that the chief executive officer had stepped down. AMSTERDAM took its cue from the stronger dollar and firmer US stocks, and the AEX index gained 3.77 at 424.60. Royal Dutch rose Fl 4.20 to Fl 199.80, the positive impact of the firm dollar outweighing disappointing oil prices. Among other dollar earners, KLM firmed 50 cents to Fl 53.00, Wolters Kluwer added Fl 2.20 at Fl 119.70, VNU rose Fl 3.20 to Fl 184.90 and Elsevier put on Fl 2.80 at Fl 172.00. MILAN was encouraged by signs of progress on the budget and the Comit index picked up 9.10, or 1.3 per cent, to 694.70. Insurance shares, strong last week, continued to find favour on expectations that their private pension schemes would see an influx of funds from people worried about future returns on state schemes. Over the weekend, Mr Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister, also said he wanted to see a 15 per cent tax on private pension funds scrapped. INA gained L35 at L2,397, while Generali, Italy's largest insurance group, ended L488 higher at L42,386. Banks, underperformers in recent weeks, regained some ground on hopes that they would also benefit from the spread of private pensions. Credito Italiano rose L60 to L2,270 and BCI L55 to L3,835. Elsewhere, Telecom Italia climbed L39 to L4,601 while Fiat firmed L60 to L6,611. HELSINKI featured a new high in metals and mining concern Outokumpu as the Hex index strengthened 34.2, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,948.5. Outokumpu added FM7 at FM106 on strong demand from foreign investors, and on projections of a sharp rise in 1994 profits on higher base metals prices and internal rationalisation measures. TEL AVIV was expecting an increase in bank rate to combat inflation. It took a 1.5 percentage points rise in its stride and the Mishtanim index recovered 5.68, or 3.3 per cent, to 179.94. The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable yesterday because of the English bank holiday. Written and edited by William Cochrane and Michael Morgan</p>

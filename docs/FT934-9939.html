			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (4): Naughty boy of television - Profile, Francisco Pinto Balsemao PORTUGUESE Prime Ministers are not accustomed to being grilled by broadcasters. But prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva was recently subjected to a live mauling by three journalists on the country's private TV station SIC, Sociedad Independente de Comunicacao. The occasion confirmed the shake-up of Portuguese television since SIC first hit the airwaves a year ago, thereby ending 35 years of state monopoly. 'People in government say we are an opposition channel but that's because they are not used to it. We are simply professional,' says SIC's head Francisco Pinto Balsemao. At 55, Balsemao could be looking forward to retirement. Instead he still gives the impression of being a bit of a naughty boy, trying out his latest toy. 'The average age in SIC is under 30. Youth ensures a certain degree of irreverence which I appreciate. It has contributed to forging a personality,' he says. Behind the frivolity lies a more serious background of experience which has made Mr Balsemao one of Portugal's leading public figures. Born into a rich banking family, Mr Balsemao has always used, rather than sat on, his privileged status. He trained as a journalist on the family-owned newspaper Diario Popular and entered politics in his late twenties as a member of the moderate wing of the old ruling fascist party. Family privileges could have been drastically curtailed in the aftermath of the Portuguese revolution of April 1974, but Mr Balsemao had by then founded Expresso, a dynamic weekly which pushed back the boundaries of censorship and served as a sounding board for the young revolutionary colonels. By capturing the political spirit of the times, Expresso became an instant commercial success. Subsequently Mr Balsemao sensed correctly that what most Portuguese wanted was not revolution but reform, a fact he reflected in his editorials and in his founding of the country's Popular Democratic Party, later renamed Social Democratic Party. Perhaps the least happy period of his professional life, and one which makes his sometimes muted candidacy for the future presidency seem an unlikely option, was when he served as interim prime minister between 1981-1983, more by default than ambition.( He succeeded Francisco Sa Carneiro who was killed in an aircrash.) 'That was not an easy period,' he recalls. He helped curb the power of the military and brought Portugal one step nearer to the EC, but he proved less effectual in dealing with the opposition of politicians and the economy. Now 20 years after founding Expresso, and an intervening period of mixed political fortunes, Mr Balsemao has recovered his flair for the main chance. 'I am going for the multi-media option,' he says. The granting of a franchise for a private TV channel to a former prime minister who is a member of the ruling party would have been unthinkable in Portugal until quite recently. But SIC exemplifies the extent to which technological change has far out-stripped regulatory thinking in the country, even if the government is insisting on more home-grown productions. Mr Balsemao seems determined to use SIC not only for his journalistic pursuits but also as a platform for his seemingly ever expanding commercial empire which ranges from magazines to electronic mailing. He says that the first year of the station's life has proved 'more difficult than we expected'. A deteriorating economic climate meant that advertising was 25 per cent down on forecast, although costs generally were kept to budget. Audience figures have, however, proved encouraging and Soincom, Mr Balsemao's investment company which is the largest single shareholder, and the TV station's other main backers, which include Globo TV of Brazil, Jose Manuel de Melo, Banco Totta y Acores, and Banco Espirito Santo have raised an additional Es3bn to help SIC compete more aggressively with the state networks next year. The fact that the land bordering the site chosen for Portugal's Expo fair (rising in value by the day) happens to be owned by his family could come in handy if SIC encounters problems with the banks. 'You could say I've been lucky,' says Mr Balsemao.</p>

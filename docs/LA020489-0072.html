			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: A PEACH OF A PART  </P> <P> Nellie Melba -- the soprano who took her stage name from Melbourne and gave it  to peach desserts and toast -- was a symbol of Australian national identity as  much as a cultural icon. As such, she is also becoming a little-understood,  mythic figure in her homeland.  </P> <P> "We think she has been very much maligned," says Linda Cropper, the actress who  portrays the tempestuous diva in "Melba," a six-hour, four-part Australian  miniseries airing Fridays at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and other PBS  stations. "People are pretty ignorant about her -- I was one of them. We show  the scandals, but I know we went all out to do a very truthful thing."  </P> <P> Trained at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Cropper considers herself  primarily a stage actress, though she has done other miniseries and has a film,  "Eden's Lost," showing in Britain. She has never been tempted to sing, however,  and the voice of another young Australian, Yvonne Kenny, has been dubbed in  whenever Melba sings in the series.  </P> <P> "The two biggest challenges were the singing -- or the miming -- and the  aging," Cropper says, "but I love a challenge."  </P> <P> During the course of the series Cropper, who turned 28 in the middle of six  months of shooting, is Melba from adolescence to old age.  </P> <P> "The padding you can live with," she says, "though it does get hot. It was the  first time I had worn prosthetic makeup."  </P> <P> The result produced changes on and off the set. "It was very helpful to perform  with that weight, and the older I got, the more people deferred to me -- even  friends who knew me well."  </P> <P> Despite the makeup burden while shooting in a hot Australian summer, Cropper  has no regrets about taking the part.  </P> <P> "I always try to go for a role if it's something that's going to stretch me, or  just a great script. I like being in a situation where anything can happen."  JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

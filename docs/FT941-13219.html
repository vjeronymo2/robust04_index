			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (2): Leaders emerge in notebook market The 'clam-shell' notebook computer has become the de facto standard for portable computing in the 1990s, an important business tool and one of the fastest-growing segments of the world computer market, writes Paul Taylor. The success of notebook computers stems from advances in silicon integration and other technological developments. As a result, PC manufacturers can pack most, if not all, of the processing power of a desktop computer into lightweight A4-size packages. Low-power chips, together with improvements in screen and battery technology, have enabled engineers to build machines with brighter displays and longer battery lives while new lightweight miniaturised components such as high capacity hard disks deliver full desktop functionality. While many notebook machines are still based on Intel's 386 processor, machines built around the more powerful Intel 486 processor are catching up fast. Over the past few years, notebook computer sales have shown dramatic growth as customers looked to them to provide fully functional computing power on the move while computer manufacturers dived into the notebook market to bolster sagging margins. According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, notebook shipments in Europe jumped by 27 per cent between the 1992 first half and the corresponding period last year. Mr Jeffrey Goldberg, a Dataquest analyst, says the notebook market is 'settling down', although he expects 'very good growth' this year. As it matures, some clear leaders have emerged in the notebook market while second-tier manufacturers face an increasingly tough battle. One of the most striking features revealed by Dataquest's quarterly figures over the past two years has been the resurgence of Compaq. The US computer manufacturer has overtaken Toshiba to claim the No 1 vendor slot and has been building up significant lead - even though Toshiba has been expanding its market share. Dataquest's 1993 third quarter figures for Europe show Compaq with a 25.5 per cent of the market compared with Toshiba's 18.6 per cent. Aside from the success of Compaq's Conturas range of notebook computers, Mr Goldberg suggests the US group has benefited from the preference of corporate buyers in particular to source all their machines from the same supplier - something Toshiba, which lacks desktop machines from its product portfolio, cannot match. Lower component prices and fierce competition have sent most notebook prices tumbling and have markedly reduced the price premium commanded by notebooks over their desktop counterparts. Eighteen months ago, a typical notebook with an Intel 386 processor, 2Mb of Ram and a 60Mb hard disk cost around Pounds 2,000 in the UK. Now, a more powerful machine based on Intel's 486SX processor with 4Mb of Ram, an 80Mb hard disk and a tracker-ball for mouse-style pointing under Microsoft Windows can be bought for less than Pounds 1,000. Top-of-the-range models cost considerably more but these have state-of-the-art colour displays and other features such as PCMIA card slots to connect modems for data communication. Indeed, one of the main changes since 1992 identified by Dataquest's Mr Goldberg is the growing 'stratification' of the notebook market. 'People are buying at the top or bottom ends of product ranges,' he notes. Corporate buyers in particular tend to buy top specified machines while individual buyers go for cheaper, more basic models. Mr Lewis Schrock, Compaq's UK product marketing manager, argues that the growing fragmentation of the market 'means you are going to see a wide range of machines targeted at different segments of the market'. In particular, he believes manufacturers will produce broad 'families' of products built around a modular design, or emphasise 'different prioritised feature sets' such as useability, ease of mobility or upgradability. Some manufacturers including Elonex, AST and Olivetti are already producing highly modular and upgradable machines with interchangable components for screens, processors and hard drives which they argue enable customers to keep up with future technologies and provide users who share machines with additional flexibility. Other manufacturers have targeted specific machines at niche applications. For example, Toshiba's T6600C portable includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo speakers, detachable keyboard and other facilities to make multimedia presentations while travelling while Canon's BN22 BJ notebook computer incorporates a bubble jet printer. Many notebook computers are second machines, used by people on the move who also have desktop machines in the office. But a growing number are being used as desktop replacements. Some manufacturers have taken this dual function concept a stage further, developing 'docking stations'. These enable the portable to take advantage of such facilities as full-size screens and keyboards and connect to an office local area network. Another innovation in portable computing over the past couple of years has been the arrival of pen-based 'notepad' systems. Some manufacturers have sought to combine the benefits of pen systems with the attractions of the conventional keyboard. For example, AST's Grid Convertible has both keyboard and penpad and Compaq has launched the Concerto, a high performance notebook with a detachable screen which doubles as a pen pad.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Le Pen rally cancelled MR Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's extreme right-wing National Front (FN), was ordered to call off a weekend rally in Corsica because police could not guarantee his safety, writes William Dawkins from Paris. Mr Le Pen criticised the decision, by the state's senior representative in the region, as 'democratic harassment' and accused the government of being in 'connivance' with Corsican separatists. Seven policemen were wounded in scuffles in Ajaccio, as Corsican separatists clashed with an estimated 150 supporters of the FN, which is committed to keeping Corsica part of France. Earlier, Mr Le Pen's aircraft had to be diverted after separatists parked trucks on Bastia airport runway. The FN's campaign for the March 22 regional elections has attracted violent controversy.</p>

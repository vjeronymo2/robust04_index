			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, the Secretary was persuaded by the commenters who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asserted that need for or length of training programs is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly linked to the ability of institutions to administer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is more appropriate as a requirement for participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Title IV, HEA programs under an institution's program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision has been moved to &sect;668.14(b)(26).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the requirements of this provision have been amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an institution to demonstrate a reasonable relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the length of the program and occupational entry level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements established by any Federal agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Almost half the commenters supported the proposals for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that information on job availability and the relevance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of courses to any specific State licensing standards be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to students. All of these commenters suggested new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ideas to clarify and expand the proposed requirements. Most of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other commenters asserted that the proposed requirements did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not pertain to the proper administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and noted that accrediting agency and SPRE standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will address these areas. These commenters recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these proposed requirements be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary continues to believe that providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate and accurate information to students and prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, so they can make informed decisions, is a function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement is covered in the section on the Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participation Agreement, &sect;668.14, and therefore is being removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the administrative capability standards section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed paragraph 668.16(l) is removed from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters stated that the proposed requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on advertising and recruitment practices was an extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important one and recommended that it be strengthened by adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to oral as well as written statements. The majority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters asserted that the proposed requirements did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertain to the proper administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and noted that accrediting agency and SPRE standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will address these areas. These commenters recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these proposed requirements be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the Secretary continues to believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising, promotion and recruitment practices that reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content and objectives of educational programs accurately is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical aspect of the proper administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, the Secretary also recognizes that accrediting agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and SPREs will address these practices and agrees with those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters that recommended that these proposed requirements not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed paragraph 668.16(m) is removed from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that there might be a timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem for an institution that is in the process of responding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an audit report in which liabilities have been identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter recommended that the Secretary expand the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language that would require that an institution have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outstanding liabilities, unless it has made satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements to repay them, to allow for liabilities the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is currently in the process of making provisions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay. Another commenter stated that this provision duplicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the financial responsibility requirements proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.15(b) (3) and (4) and recommended that it be removed from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The one commenter apparently believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities are established at the time an audit report is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued. Contrary to the commenter's perception, institutions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided with the opportunity to respond to an issued audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report before liabilities are established. However, once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit report and institutional response have been reviewed and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final program determination letter establishing liabilities has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been issued, an institution must either repay the liabilities or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make satisfactory arrangements to repay. Responding to audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, making any necessary corrections to institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, and making satisfactory arrangements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment of any liabilities established are all fundamental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities of participating institutions. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary agrees that these responsibilities are adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enumerated in the general standards of financial responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;668.15(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;668.16(o) is removed from these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of commenters asserted that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that an institution show no evidence of significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems identified in reviews of the institution was overly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad and imprecise, giving the Secretary unlimited authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deny certification because of evidence of problems in a wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety of areas. They recommended that the proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be rewritten to limit the scope. Many of these commenters were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that institutions would be penalized even if there were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a problem unrelated to Title IV, HEA programs matters. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example given was that of a university hospital that was found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of Medicare reimbursement rules. Some commenters were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that the Secretary would deny certification based on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit finding or other citation that had not yet been reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and upheld in a final audit determination or similar action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They urged that only serious findings upheld in final audit or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program review determinations or legal proceedings be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters expressed concern that the Secretary would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deny certification to an institution on the basis of a SPRE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, even if the SPRE itself thought the institution should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still receive student aid. Two commenters argued that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, as proposed, would affect the institutions involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Department of Justice investigation of the Overlap Group,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> though they have signed a consent decree. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the provision be removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Koretskiy: "Enrollment for Abkhaz </F> `Fifth Column' Has been Announced. Overthrow of Ardzinba Being  Prepared"]    [Text] Yesterday, Aleksandr Chikvadze, head of the  Georgian Foreign Ministry, signed in Brussels an agreement on  Georgia's joining the Partnership for Peace program. This is  the first time that a country in a state of civil war intends to  join it. Besides, the joining of the NATO program takes on a  special meaning with the emergence in Abkhazia of a pro-Georgia  secret organization.    The probability of the countries in conflict reaching an  agreement is small despite the recent statements by Eduard  Shevardnadze and Vladislav Ardzinba for the continuation of  dialogue. Now the conflict may flare up in Abkhazia itself,  where a secret organization "For a Peaceful Abkhazia" (its  membership and national composition are unknown) has announced  about existence. An appeal to Butros-Ghali, Boris Yeltsin, and  Eduard Shevardnadze, circulated yesterday in Tbilisi by members  of the underground organization points to their intention "to  come out weapons in hand against the Ardzinba regime" if the  latter fails to agree with Georgia. Besides, unless the United  Nations urgently steps into the conflict, "a genocide of the  Georgian population in Abkhazia may lead to irreparable  consequences." The way out, in the underground organization  members' view, is to bring Russian troops and Georgian police  into Abkhazia.    In Shevardnadze's opinion, the organization consists of  Abkhaz people and is in no way connected with Tbilisi.  Information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY from informed sources  put in doubt the existence of this organization (most people in  Abkhazia are more anti-Georgia than anti-Ardzinba) and gives  grounds to believe that the creation of the "For a Peaceful  Abkhazia" movement was not done without Tbilisi, which in the  standoff in Sukhumi is using the old "fifth column" principle.  A conflagration in the autonomous entity would undoubtedly  spark a reaction in the world. And in this event, NATO may  think it right for it to interfere ahead of the UN "blue  helmets" unless the underground appeal first draws a reaction  from Moscow, which has repeatedly stated that it is not going to  ask for UN permission for peacekeeping every time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic said on Friday [22 April] that the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia resolutely urges a political and  peaceful solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina and supports Russia's principled and  objective stand on the crisis in ex-Yugoslav territory. In  talks with a delegation of the Russian parliament's lower house  [State Duma], Kontic said that Russia's efforts have prevented  the escalation of the fighting in Bosnia and underscored that  the further continuation of the international sanctions against  Yugoslavia practically prolongs the crisis in the former  Yugoslav territory.    The head of the Russian parliamentary delegation, Nikolay  Bezbirodov, said that the aim of the visit is to see for  themselves the situation in Yugoslavia and the developments in  Bosnia, and thus enable the lower house of the Russian  parliament to make objective and principled decisions.  Bezbirodov, who is deputy chairman of the parliamentary Defence  Committee, said that he lower house is aware that the sanctions  should be lifted and that they do not contribute to the  resolution of the crisis in ex-Yugoslav territory. He said that  the lower house is opposed to the use of military power in the  settlement of the Bosnian crisis and that all conflicts should  be resolved through negotiations, in a peaceful way.    The Russian delegation also met with the Speaker of the  Yugoslav Parliament's lower house, Radoman Bozovic, who said  that peace in Bosnia should be established immediately along the  separation lines and then that all international institutions  should be engaged to take part in political talks on all open  issues. He said that the peace process requires the objective  and equal treatment of the Serb people, on the same footing as  all the other warring sides. Pointing out that it is senseless  to further maintain the sanctions against Yugoslavia, the  Russian delegation said that a legal project on their lifting  had been drafted in the lower house, but that the procedure had  been halted for the present due to the deterioration of the  situation in Gorazde.</p>

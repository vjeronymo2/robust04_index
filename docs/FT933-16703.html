			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: SFO tries to sidestep row over Steel document THE SERIOUS Fraud Office yesterday attempted to distance itself from a controversy surrounding a forged letter purporting to come from the former liberal leader Sir David Steel, by passing the blame to the City of London Police. The SFO director Mr George Staple said last night that he had asked the police 'to insure that no occurence of this type would occur in the future'. Mr Staple emphasised that 'no SFO lawyer or other member of the SFO' was involved in the forgery of a letter which was found to have been sent as an April's Fool joke last year. 'The letter was written and sent by an officer or officers of the City of London Police who had been working in conjunction with the SFO on the BCCI investigation,' Mr Staple added. The SFO confirmed that on April 1 1992, a senior lawyer working on the BCCI investigation received a faxed copy of the letter which appeared to come from Sir David. It was written on House of Commons paper and said that Sir David would be attending court later that day in relation to a defendant's bail application. According to Mr Staple's statement the senior SFO lawyer believed the letter to be genuine and showed it to the defendant's lawyers. The City of London Police said last night that the forged letter had been sent by one of its officers who was on secondment to the SFO. The force said its own inquiry 'did not result in any displinary proceedings'. Mr Alex Carlile, a Liberal Democrat MP, said he had evidence of a second forged letter relating to the same case, purporting to be from Mr David Freeman, a London solicitor.</p>

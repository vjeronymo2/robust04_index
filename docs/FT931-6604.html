			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Rocket attack on Kabul kills 60 ROCKETS and shells ploughed into homes and a busy bazaar in Kabul yesterday, killing more than 60 people and injuring 100 a day before planned peace talks between rival Afghan leaders in neighbouring Pakistan, Reuter reports from Kabul. Two mortar bombs exploded among crowds in the Feruzhgar bazaar, killing 14 people and injuring more than 60 in the bloodiest attacks since an informal ceasefire took effect two weeks ago. The Defence Ministry blamed the hardline dissident Hezb-i-Islami party of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar for shattering the ceasefire and bombarding the city with more than 40 rockets and shells.</p>

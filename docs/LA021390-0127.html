			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CONTINUATION SCHOOL MEETING SET TONIGHT  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach Union High School District will hold a public hearing  tonight on the proposed move of Wintersburg Continuation High School.  </P> <P> The plan to relocate the school for students with behavioral or attendance  problems has sparked considerable community opposition since it was announced  in December.  </P> <P> The school, now at Ocean View High School in Huntington Beach, would move to  the campus of Fountain Valley High School.  </P> <P> Residents opposed to the plan say it would bring increased violence, crime and  traffic to their area. But police and residents of the area around Ocean View  say there have been no problems.  </P> <P> "They are taking kids who weren't able to adjust in a high school setting and  putting them back into a high school setting," resident Barbara Emerson said.  "It doesn't make sense."  </P> <P> Opponents distributed leaflets in the community this week urging residents to  attend tonight's meeting. It begins at 7:30 p.m. at the school district  headquarters, 10251 Yorktown Ave.  </P> <P> The school board is expected to take a final vote on Feb. 27.  </P></p>

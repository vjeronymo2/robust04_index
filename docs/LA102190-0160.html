			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COLTON;  </P> <P> POLICE FOLLOW CARD TO RAID CRACK HOUSE  </P> <P> Police in Colton seized $400,000 worth of methamphetamine and $13,000 in cash  in a raid prompted by a business card that advertised "good, high quality,  uncut cocaine." The card, confiscated in neighboring Banning during a warrant  search, announced "Colton's newest crack house" and gave an address, police  said.  </P> <P> "If you offer good, high quality, uncut cocaine, at a reasonable price,  Southern California will beat a path to your door," the card said. "This is our  guiding principle, so why not give us a try." Banning and Colton officers  raided the home Thursday and seized eight pounds of methamphetamine and $13,000  in cash, Banning Police Lt. George Lanterman said. Six people were arrested for  investigation of possession of methamphetamine for sale, he said.  </P></p>

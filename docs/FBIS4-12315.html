			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat has stated that in his meeting with Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today, they discussed  the latest developments in the Palestinian-Israeli talks,  whether those in Cairo, Washington, Paris, Moscow, or elsewhere.  The purpose of the meeting was to put the Arab League in the  picture on these latest developments, he added.    Speaking to MENA following his meeting with Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid, 'Arafat said he informed the Arab League chief  that Israel was dragging its feet about implementing the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement, something that marks the general  Israeli position, although 13 April, the date on which Israeli  troops are scheduled to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho, is  approaching.    The Palestinian president described Israeli leaders'  statements that the deadlines for withdrawal are not sacred as a  new attempt by Israel to avoid implementing the agreements on  time. He referred to the obstacles Israel is placing in front  of the talks, be it at the Administrative Affairs Committee or  other committees. He added: This has become a basic feature of  the Israelis, who first evaded the withdrawal on 13 December and  are now evasive about completing the withdrawal on 13 April as  agreed upon in Washington. He pointed out that with Israel  dragging its feet, the antipeace forces will seize the  opportunity to get fiercer.    On Egypt's role in promoting peace, 'Arafat thanked  President  Mubarak for his constant efforts to boost the peace process in  every direction. He described his meeting with President  Mubarak today as positive and constructive, part of the constant  consultations between the two sides.    'Arafat added: Our relations with Egypt are strong and  outstanding in every political and economic field. He noted  that the Palestinian side uses Egyptian experts in economic and  other fields to face the Israeli negotiators, who are trying to  be evasive about legal issues to which they committed themselves  in their agreements with the Palestinians. 'Arafat pointed out  that he briefed the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of  peace, on Israel's intransigence over implementing the peace  agreement and asked them to perform their duty in protecting the  Palestinian people and sanctities and implementing the  international resolutions for safeguarding the Palestinian  rights.</p>

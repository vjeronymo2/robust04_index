			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> No Toon-Up for Tom Cruise: Tom Cruise has dropped out of "Capt. Planet and the  Planeteers," Ted Turner's cartoon eco-series.  </P> <P> Cruise was to be the voice of Capt. Planet, a green-haired hero who can be  summoned by five youngsters of different races and nations to fight various  villains ruining the Earth. But the star's busy film schedule didn't allow him  to be involved. But the $7.8-million project is pressing on. Previously  announced stars such as Sting, Martin Sheen and Meg Ryan still remain as the  voices of such eco-villains as Zarm, Sly Sludge and Dr. Blight. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

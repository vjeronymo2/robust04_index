			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Administrators rule out any early disposal of controlling stake in MGN AN EARLY sale of a con-trolling interest in Mirror Group Newspapers was last night ruled out by the administrators of Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests. In an apparent attempt to end speculation, Mr John Talbot, one of the administrators, said last night that the late Mr Maxwell's controlling 51 per cent stake was not for sale at present. The stake is effectively owned by banks such as Midland and National Westminster because they were pledged as collateral to cover Maxwell debt. The administrators said they have received a considerable number of approaches for the MGN stake from groups not yet publicly identified. Last night's statement said that the administrators were co-operating with the board of MGN 'and will give consideration to the timing of any sale of the shares, if appropriate, when comprehensive information is available from the board.' This implies that no decision is likely for a matter of months. Audited accounts for 1991 are not likely to be available before April. 'The administrators are working closely with banks who have taken security over MGN shares and who have indicated they support the course of action being taken by the administrators,' the statement added. The announcement came as a disappointment to Sir Peter Parker, chairman of a management buy-out group at MGN which includes Mr Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror. The group was pressing for an early sale on the grounds that delay and uncertainty would damage MGN. Last night the group said: 'It is not clear who this delay benefits but we have not withdrawn our interest.' Hambros Bank has also said it is interested in putting together a consortium to bid for MGN.</p>

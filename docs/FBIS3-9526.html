"I believe the conflicts in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and  the Middle East call for more frequent contacts between Romania  and Turkey, two large states in the region," Demirel said in an  address broadcast live on state radio from the Cotroceni Palace,  where he met with Romanian President Ion Iliescu. Iliescu said  Turkey and Romania were key countries for stability in the  Balkans.    Demirel's visit is the second by a Turkish head of state  since 1989, the year the communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu  was toppled in a bloody revolution.    In addition to the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, the two sides  discussed their increasing trade ties since the demise of  communism. Turkish firms are involved in 2,649 ventures in  Romania, the fourth largest number of any country. Turkey ranks  ninth among countries in overall foreign investment in Romania  since the 1989 revolution, at about 32.3 million U.S. dollars.    Demirel's visit coincides with the opening of a  Romanian-Turkish bank in Bucharest. He also is expected to  visit the port of Constantsa on the Black Sea, home of most of  Romania's ethnic Turkish minority.</p>

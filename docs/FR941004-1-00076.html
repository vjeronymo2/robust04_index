			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Comprehensive Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We propose to consolidate into one five-year plan (rather than two plans, one of which currently is due on a one, two, or three-year cycle) all requirements applicable to the two service programs under title IV&hyph;B. These two programs are administered by the same agency, generally serve the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations, contain similar (in some instances identical) planning requirements, and are a part of the child and family services continuum. (See &sect;1357.15)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Description of Other Services Included in the CFSP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because services under the Independent Living Program and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act are also a part of the child and family services continuum, we propose that the CFSP describe the services provided under these funding sources and that the State explain how these funds are coordinated with and integrated into the services continuum. (See &sect;1357.15 (a), (n) and (o))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Joint Planning and Approval of the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have proposed an ongoing joint planning partnership to implement the statutory requirement that the CFSP may not be approved unless it was jointly developed by ACF and the State (or the Indian tribe). Both the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report must be jointly developed and approved in order for a grantee to receive funding. (See &sect;1357.10(c) and &sect;1357.15(b))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Content of the CFSP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In designing their family preservation and family support services programs, States and Indian tribes may select the services to be provided, the target populations, and the geographic areas where services will be provided. We have not required specific ``core'' services, model service approaches, client eligibility criteria, or methods for the selection of priority populations or geographic areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the statutory requirement for goals, measures of progress toward the goals, and annual services reports, we propose to require that the CFSP include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A vision statement (&sect;1357.15(g));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Measurable objectives to implement goals (&sect;1357.15(i)); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Brief descriptions of how family preservation and support services in the CFSP are or will be linked to other services in the child and family services continuum; how the title IV&hyph;B services will help meet the permanency planning requirements in the Act; how the child and family services continuum is designed to meet the service principles; and how the services in the continuum will be coordinated with other public services and service systems. (See &sect;1357.15 (o), (p), and (q))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Planning Processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have proposed flexibility but also included minimum specific requirements to implement the statutory provisions for consultation and coordination of services. (See &sect;1357.15 (l) and (m))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we have proposed that the State and the Indian tribe, as appropriate, collect existing or available information as the basis for planning, priority setting, targeting of services, funding decisions, and measuring progress toward the goals and objectives. (See &sect;1357.15(k))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Requirements for Indian Tribes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Taking into account the resources, needs, and circumstances of Indian tribes, we have waived some and modified other programmatic and fiscal requirements for Indian tribes. (See &sect;1357.15 and &sect;1357.50(f))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

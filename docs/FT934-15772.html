			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Uprising of Russian right took Yeltsin government by surprise: The day Moscow teetered on the brink THE GOVERNMENT of Pres-ident Boris Yeltsin was completely unprepared for the uprising that led to the storming of the banned Russian parliament and the subsequent gun battles in which nearly 200 people died. It has also emerged since last weekend's uprising that the Russian army spent several hours last Sunday debating whether it should 'become involved in politics' as armed supporters of the Russian parliament roamed the streets of Moscow, captured the mayoral offices and attacked the television centre. The army's long period of inaction in the crucial hours after the uprising is becoming a cause of bitter debate within the Russian government. Radical ministers and officials, convinced that only the mobilisation of their supporters on the streets saved the day, are now calling for Mr Yeltsin to order a clean-out of the Defence, Interior and Security ministries. Moscow's military city commandant also warned last night that he would take 'decisive' retaliatory action against any anti-government groups holding weekend demonstrations, banned under a state of emergency. A detailed account by eyewitnesses inside the Kremlin during the day when Moscow teetered on the brink of civil strife paints a picture of a government caught completely by surprise. They say that: The Kremlin authorities did not expect an armed uprising. Senior members of the Defence ministry sat far into the night debating the issue, long after the defenders of the White House, the parliament building, had become attackers. Groups of democrat supporters were about to be armed in order to attempt to put down the parliamentary revolt. The Russian central bank refused to advance credits on Sunday night to the government - which had asked for large emergency reserves of cash. Confidential assessments of the situation by the security forces had put a very low probability of any armed attack by the parliamentary forces, in spite of the large quantity of arms known to be in the White House and the presence of armed detachments of extremist forces. Summoned by a phone call, Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, saw the demonstrators from the window of his car as he rushed back to the Kremlin at about 3.30 pm - to be followed shortly by Mr Yeltsin, helicoptered from his dacha at Arkhangelsk, outside Moscow. The atmosphere, according to those present, in the presidential offices was panicky. The panic was largely because Mr Yeltsin and his staff could not get through to General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister. Much time - according to Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, deputy head of the Federal Information Service, who was closely involved in the day's events - was spent in discussing which of the military men close to the president should go to Gen Grachev to ask him to bring in the army. 'The trouble was,' Mr Yuzhenkov said yesterday, 'no one had good relations with him.' Within the Council of Ministers building in Old Square, next to the Kremlin, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, grew increasingly concerned as he saw the Interior Ministry forces protecting the White House melt away. Mr Yuzhenkov phoned to ask if he could say the army was on its way to deal with the uprising. No, said Mr Gaidar, he could not. The two men then decided they had to act: Mr Gaidar made an appeal on TV for detachments of volunteers to form outside the Moscow City Council building opposite the Kremlin. The detachments were to have been armed on the orders of Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow city mayor. Several thousand volunteers responded, although arms were not handed out. Meanwhile, the top army generals at the Defence Ministry convened under Gen Grachev. Faced with many of his colleagues who insisted on the army's non-involvement, he went round the table, demanding that each give his own position. Mr Yuzhenkov says: 'The army was a hostage to its own slogan - that it should not be involved in politics. But the decision was not to get involved in politics: it was to stop an attack on the state.' The government decided early in the evening to create a large fund of cash with which it could pay and feed troops. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier for finance who was in the Council of Ministers' building on Sunday night, said: 'There was a decision to create some cash reserves in the government if things got worse. The Bank didn't refuse - Mr (Viktor) Gerashchenko (the chairman) is too clever for that - they just delayed.' The army's deployment against the White House has received official eulogies. But Mr Gaidar and Mr Yuzhenkov have criticised security forces. 'We need a real clean-out of these ministries now.' said Mr Yuzhenkov.

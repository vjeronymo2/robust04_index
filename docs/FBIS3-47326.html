			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kunihiko Saito, administrative vice minister for  foreign affairs, commented on the issue of visits to Taiwan by  Japanese cabinet members and other government officials at a  press conference on 10 January. Saito said: "There has been no  change in our basic policy of abiding by the principles and  spirit of the Japan-China Joint Communique; that is, relations  with Taiwan will be limited to areas other than political. In  line with this policy, we will decide on each individual visit  after looking carefully at the substance of the visit and other  relevant factors." This is believed to leave the possibility  open for visits by high-ranking government officials in  connection with economic issues or international conferences.    Touching on a statement made by Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, at a news conference in Beijing  negating the possibility of cabinet members visiting Taiwan,  Saito said: "This was in reply to the question `will there be  visits to Taiwan in the near future, for instance, before the  end of 1994?' It did not mean anything more than that." He  indicated that the foreign minister's remark would not restrain  visits by cabinet ministers to Taiwan in the future.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Poverty survey finds gap widening Poverty in Britain's cities has become increasingly concentrated in small pockets of deprivation, two reports published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation say. The social research organisation says that the gap between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in cities widened between 1981 and 1991. Most cities have areas where low incomes, unemployment and low levels of car and home ownership are becoming the norm. These are often close to more prosperous areas where people own their own homes and many households have two incomes and two cars. The areas of intense poverty are mostly in northern cities and inner London, according to an analysis of data in the 1991 census. But less localised poverty is spread over most old industrial areas such as the south Wales valleys, northern England and central Scotland. The Geography of Poverty and Wealth 1981-1991. Increasing polarisation between better-off and poorer neighbourhoods in Oldham and Oxford. Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 40 Water End, York YO3 6LP.</p>

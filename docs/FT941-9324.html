			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU president faces the unpalatable facts - David Naish is prepared for change, but some of his members hanker after the past / Farmer's Viewpoint Almost imperceptibly over the last few years the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales has changed from the whingeing body many still believe it to be into a positive, forward-looking organisation, ready to meet, head-on, the undoubted challenges ahead. At least its leaders have changed. In the backwoods, some grass roots members still expect the government to provide them with a living through guarantees and subsidies; and there are probably far more of them than the union's leaders would care to admit. Last week's annual meeting in London illustrated the point. Ten or 15 years ago the keynote speech by the president of the day was often a long tirade against the inadequacies of government farm policies. It normally contained demands for increases in guaranteed prices of a whole range of farm commodities. That was the kind of speech the membership expected and it had been like that for most of the 90 years of the union's history. But at last week's event, significantly entitled 'Farming in Society', Mr David Naish, the NFU president, sought to create a different mood. And he did so at a time when agriculture faced more and potentially greater challenges than for 60 years. Although average UK farm incomes increased by over 60 per cent in 1993 - largely a result of the 1992 sterling devaluation and compensation for the set-aside and price cuts imposed by CAP reform - they did so from a very low base. Furthermore ongoing reform, followed by further Gatt-inspired restrictions, would lead, said Mr Naish, to 'turbulent' times for farmers over the next few years. The price-cuts and compensation package is scheduled to continue for two more years, after which there is no firm policy except that the level of those guaranteed prices which remain will be below most UK farmers' current production costs. And although both the European Commission and the UK government claim the requirements of the Gatt deal are compatible with CAP reform the NFU and other commentators are not convinced. They believe further price and production cuts are inevitable. But apart from stressing the need for new policies to be 'applied equitably across the European Union and the world', Mr Naish accepted the challenge these changes would bring. He went on, moreover, to state that agriculture had just two choices to consider - reducing production or accepting more price cuts. It was clear that for the long-term he favoured the removal of production restrictions and the acceptance of much freer markets based on world values, not least because he questioned whether taxpayers would be prepared to fund more and more set-aside. Open-ended support systems, he declared, did farmers no favours; they merely distorted marketing decisions and made the process of change even more difficult. Nevertheless, he demanded that farmers should not be abandoned to the whims of a totally unregulated market and that his members should not be sacrificed on the altar of free trade. The question was not whether farmers should be supported, he said, but what form the support should take. And he went on to suggest that it should be tied to the holistic relationship farmers have with the countryside - as its guardians as well as producers of safe food. These were brave, and to insiders, radical words from a man who faced re-election the following day. The NFU insists on subjecting its leaders to a vote every year; and if a sitting president fails to receive the support of 80 per cent of the council he can be ousted from office. Clearly the incumbent cannot afford to offend more than a few of the 80 or so members of that ruling body, or the regions they represent, if he is to survive. And at the end of Mr Naish's speech to the AGM, the applause was, to say the least, subdued. In spite of that, Mr Naish and his two deputies, both of whom have been associated with the new positive approach of the union, were all re-elected. Perhaps most of those who voted were feeling charitable because of those increased incomes last year. Or perhaps the grass roots membership is at last coming to terms with the fact that change is inevitable and they must either accept the challenges or get out of the business. In any case, the re-election of the NFU's top team seems likely to lead to even greater official advocacy of sound farm business principles rather than reliance on government. That means improving efficiency and getting more from the market. As Mr Naish put it in his address: 'We must be determined to produce what our customers require - not just what we want to produce'. To such an audience those were very brave words indeed.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Extending the legal limits - Phil Manchester continues a series on getting the most out of software by describing how a firm of solicitors expanded its practice through better use of computers Like many other traditional professional organisations in the UK, Steele &amp; Co, a firm of solicitors based in Norfolk, has had to come to terms with information technology quickly. Five years ago, the firm had a few PCs in its single office in Norwich and employed 20 staff. It now operates nine offices across Norfolk and Suffolk and employs more than 120 people. They are supported by a computer network which performs billing, provides word processing and administers accounts. An integrated network system, based on a mixture of proprietary and Unix systems, has given the firm an opportunity to find new ways to work. Most important of all, the system provides management accounting information which enables Steele to make the best use of its resources. Tim Hankey, Steele's financial controller, says that the firm's recent expansion would not have been possible without the computer network, which now forms the backbone of the practice. Steele operates in all the traditional areas of law - about 25 per cent of its income comes from conveyancing; 25 per cent from commercial work, 25 per cent from litigation; and 25 per cent private clients. But Steele's approach to running its business is not typical. 'We have a philosophy of small satellite offices feeding into a larger regional office and to a central administrative headquarters. This is a somewhat unusual philosophy for a firm of solicitors and it is only through the IT network that we can retain control,' Hankey explains. The network also allows scarce resources, such as legal specialists, to be shared out in the most efficient way. 'We can't have all of our specialists at every site. They are at a central or regional site and our general solicitors at the other ones,' explains Hankey. The current network is based on a Unisys 6000/60 which runs both CTOS and Unix. This is located at the headquarters in Norwich and connected to the outlying offices through dedicated lines leased from British Telecom. The technology at the outlying offices varies according to the local need. Some offices have a direct inquiry facility and others go through a TCP/IP Ethernet network connection. At the smaller offices, where access to the whole system is unnecessary, there is a single inquiry screen. Hankey has taken an unusual approach to data capture, which flies in the face of current thinking. Financial and timekeeping data are never entered directly into the system by the outlying offices. It is sent to the central administrative headquarters to be entered by specialist data entry staff. Hankey says that the main reason is to keep control over the integrity of the company's data. Transactions are recorded on sheets and faxed across to the central administration office every afternoon. Steele's software also has an unusual pedigree. TMA, its software supplier, acquired the rights to a popular solicitor's application package called Solacs and used it as the basis of a new package called Comptroller. But Steele wanted a more flexible version of the software and searched for other firms of solicitors with a similar need. 'We joined forces with a consortium of five other firms of solicitors and commissioned TMA to write a replacement. It was quite unusual for a firm of solicitors to take this sort of initiative.' The new package, called TMA-Sims, is written using a fourth-generation language called Progress, which brings particular advantages. The TMA package provides the standard application, and Progress allows users to write extra reports. Hankey says that this is where applications packages have fallen down in the past: 'You could not have the full range of reports that people want. But it is very easy to write reports with Progress. They have a feature called Fasttrack which lets you do programming on a portable computer and then send it down the line to the main system.' In addition to the standard administration software the network also supports other important functions. Terminals have access to office automation facilities - word processing, spreadsheets and communications - all supplied as part of the CTOS package. Steele rents every part of its system - including the software. Hankey says this brings financial benefits as well as allowing the company to maintain its technological edge. Carefully-timed upgrades mean that the company is always running an up-to-date system: 'We are in position where we don't own the hardware and don't want to. You could argue that after five years in strict cash terms you have nothing else to pay. But the technology will need replacing by then anyway. 'The other advantage we have found is that when the rental period expires - because hardware costs have come down - you are getting a much better specification of hardware for the same price. Not only that, with depreciation the value of the rental has gone down.' A rental agreement also brings other benefits: 'Renting ties the computer company to you. There is that syndrome where the salesman sells you something and does not need to come back to you. When you are renting, it is still their hardware and they have to look after you. 'We rent software too. Arguably it is even more important to rent software because you have constant upgrades. As an accountant I don't want the software as a capital asset on the balance sheet,' says Hankey. He is keen to expand the system and is currently experimenting with the use of facsimile and telex links so that every terminal in the system can send messages. There are also plans to make greater use of portable computers so that solicitors can work on the move and connect into the company network. Hankey uses a Unisys Powerport portable for his own report writing and to build small applications in the Progress language: 'We are using Progress to develop our own reports - which brings some advantages. On the big Unix box we have a run-time licence. But on the portable we have a full licence. This means I can develop things on the portable and then push them across to the Unix box.' Despite his personal enthusiasm for the technology Hankey is realistic about its effect on a company and believes that data integrity and trust in the system is paramount. 'We have auditors from the Law Society, the tax office and the DSS so the data must be absolutely correct. If there is a single error the whole system loses credibility.' But Hankey notes that there is predictable shift in attitudes about a new computer system when it is introduced: 'There is a very interesting cycle which occurs when you introduce computer systems. Day one - it is put in with great expectations and, after a month, people want to know where all of these fantastic reports are. After six months they still have not got them, because there is no history in the system. 'After a year, there is total rejection of it. But by the end of 18 months you can start producing comparative data and the users see information they have not seen before - fluctuations in work in progress or your debtors' position. After two years they start to believe that it is right because the trends which it has shown start to ring true.'                           *       *      * BUZZWORDS FOURTH-GENERATION LANGUAGES were devised so that non-technical computer users could build simple programs. They use plain English to state a user's requirements, for example 'Print Sales Report'.                           *       *      * RUN-TIME LICENCES refer to a type of agreement between software suppliers and purchasers. Suppliers do not sell software outright, and this licence gives the purchaser the right to use the package only in its final form. A full licence give the purchaser rights to develop the package further.                           *       *      * STEELE &amp; CO COMPANY SNAPSHOT Steele &amp; Company is one of a new breed of professional organisations which has based its business expansion plans on significant use of technology. The geographical spread of its operations in rural East Anglia has made good communications and careful use of computer systems a necessity. NATURE OF BUSINESS: The firm operates in all the standard areas of law including property conveyancing, litigation, probate and commercial work. TURNOVER: As a professional partnership, Steele &amp; Company does not disclose financial data. TECHNOLOGY FILE SOFTWARE: The main administration and financial work is handled by TMA-Sims, a specially-developed package for solicitors, running under Unix.  The office systems software is provided by Unisys's CTOS system and covers electronic mail, database query, word processing and spreadsheets. HARDWARE: The main system runs on a Unisys 6000/60 with 1.3 gigabytes of disk storage for the central database. Each satellite office is served by a number of Unisys CTOS systems, operating on a local area network.  These can also act as terminals to the main system.  The whole system serves 120 screens. COMMUNICATIONS: The satellite offices are connected to the main computer at the firm's headquarters, through leased BT lines. COSTS: Steele rents all software and hardware at a current annual cost of Pounds 170,000.  Equivalent capital cost of the installation is estimated at about Pounds 700,000.  Steele also pays an annual Pounds 35,000 maintenance cost for both software and hardware.</p>

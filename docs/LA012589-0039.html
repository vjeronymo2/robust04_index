			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLD SPELL FAILS TO STOP CRESPI, 51-31;  </P> <P> CELTICS SURVIVE 11-MINUTE FIELD-GOAL DROUGHT IN VICTORY OVER ST. JOHN BOSCO  </P> <P> If the St. John Bosco High student cheering section likes to refer to itself as  "The Pit," then the Braves' boys' basketball players were the pits Tuesday  night against Crespi.  </P> <P> The Celts, playing down to the Braves for three quarters, pulled away in the  final period to record a 51-31 Del Rey League victory at Crespi.  </P> <P> "It was pretty ugly for three quarters -- very ugly," Crespi Coach Paul Muff  said. "But a win is a win. We'll take it."  </P> <P> This was a game in which baskets came about as often as leap year. St. John  Bosco shot air balls (from the field and the free-throw line), backboard balls,  and even threw up a "beam ball" -- Marco Castaneda's desperation shot at the  end of the half that hit a ceiling beam.  </P> <P> The Braves (3-11, 1-4), whose only Del Rey win this season came against Crespi  (9-9, 4-2), went the entire first period without a field goal and trailed the  Celts, 14-4, after a quarter. St. John Bosco drew within 19-14 at halftime  after Crespi went 0 for 13 from the field in the second period.  </P> <P> The Celts' cold streak spilled over into the third quarter before Pat Brady hit  a jump shot 2:45 into the period, ending an 11-minute field-goal drought.  </P> <P> "We couldn't hit anything in the first half," Crespi guard Chris McGee said.  "They've only won one game (in league), but against us, they play tough."  </P> <P> Crespi shot 26% in the first half, St. John Bosco 29%. The Celts were 29% for  the game, making just 12 baskets. The Braves finished at 29%, making 10 shots.  </P> <P> McGee was 0 for 7 before making a 3-point basket 1:35 into the fourth period  that gave Crespi a 28-25 lead. He hit another 3-point field goal minutes later  to put the Celts ahead, 33-27.  </P> <P> "Chris' 3-pointers were real key for us," Muff said. "We've been really going  dry at the end of the second quarter and start of the third this year. We start  missing and it mushrooms. Guys start doubting themselves."  </P> <P> Crespi converted 16 of 17 free throws in the final 2:48 to account for the  lopsided final score. McGee was 8 of 8 from the line in the period, and reserve  forward Scott Martin was 4 of 4.  </P> <P> Ken Lynch, the only Celt to shoot better than 50% from the field (5 of 8),  finished with 13 points and 7 rebounds. McGee led Crespi with 14 points -- all  in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Brady, who fouled out with 7 minutes to play, and Matt Luderer each scored 8  points.  </P> <P> Ron Metoyer and Radizwell Gangalang each had 8 points for St. John Bosco.  </P></p>

The Muslim  Palestinians protested yesterday against this merciless killing,  which has grievously wounded the conscience of mankind. They  held strikes and, despite the curfew imposed by the Zionist  armed forces, they spilled onto the streets to demonstrate and  clashed with the Zionist soldiers.    In these clashes, three Palestinians were killed by the  Zionist executioners and nearly 50 others were wounded. Thus,  the number of victims killed or wounded at the hands of the  Zionist forces in the past two days has reached 300. The  indignant Palestinian demonstrators attacked 40 Israeli targets  with bombs. One of the most important and distinctive  characteristics of the demonstrations in the past two days in  the territories occupied since 1948--where the Palestinians are  a minority of the population--is the flourishing of the  intifadah.    The staging of extensive demonstrations in the cities of  Nazareth and Yafo and the southern environs of Tel Aviv by the  incensed Palestinians and the setting afire of dozens of  vehicles and stores belonging to the Zionists are unprecedented  in the past decade. The anger and frenzy of the Palestinian  Muslims at the staggering atrocity committed by the Zionists in  the al-Ibrahimi shrine was so extensive that for the first time  the Zionist regime has imposed a curfew in order to protect the  lives of the Jews in the settlements the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    According to political observers, at its session today the  Zionist cabinet may make some decisions in order to placate the  enraged Muslims because of the pressure due to the spread of the  Palestinian Muslims' intifadah in the past two days. Some  Palestinian prisoners may be released in this regard.    The UN Security Council session is to conclude its  deliberations today on the recent crime of the Zionists. In  view of the fact that the United States gives quite a lot of  arms and financial and economic assistance to the Zionist regime  and thus is a de facto accomplice to all the crimes of this  racist regime, it is possible that in its usual way the United  States will use its influence in the Security Council to prevent  the UN from playing its legitimate role in the Palestinian  crisis.    Political analysts believe that the heart wrenching crime at  the al-Ibrahimi shrine has highlighted the fact that the greater  the international legitimacy attributed to the Zionists, the  more crimes they will commit. This incident further proves that  the Zionist settlements in the occupied territories are a major  problem, and coexistence between the Palestinians and the  residents of the Zionist settlements, which is envisaged in the  Gaza-Jericho accord, is very questionable.    The extensive demonstrations by the people and students in  Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, and the demand for the immediate  cessation of the talks and the breaking of all kinds of  relations with the transgressor Zionist regime show that the  Muslim people of the region do not concur with the policies  adopted by their governments. This places the Arab countries in  a position where they have to make a fateful choice on whether  to choose their people or the Zionist regime.</p>

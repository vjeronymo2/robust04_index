The Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations until July 1, 1994. By delaying the effective date, the Secretary seeks to reduce confusion about the effective date of these regulations by making the effective date consistent with the effective date of other changes to the regulations published by the Secretary at that same time.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994, with the exception of the amendments to &sect;&sect;682.202, 682.208, 682.402, 682.410, and 682.411.

Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations which are affected by this change in effective date amend the FFEL loan discharge regulations. The effective date of these regulations has been delayed until July 1, 1994 so that all of the regulations implementing changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and certain technical changes made by the Cash Management Improvement Act Amendments of 1993 in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program which were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  before May 1, 1994 will take effect on July 1, 1994. The Secretary was informed that there was confusion among participants in the FFEL Program about the effective date of the regulations because other regulations published at the same time and implementing other changes to the HEA were not effective until July 1, 1994. The Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations to resolve the confusion and to afford participants in the FFEL program additional time to comply with the requirements of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232 (b)(2)(A)), and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, because the Secretary is delaying the effective date of these regulations for only a brief period to reduce confusion and afford participants in the FFEL program additional time for compliance, the Secretary finds, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that the solicitation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment on this change in the effective date would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number: 84.032 Federal Family Education Loan Program)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard W.

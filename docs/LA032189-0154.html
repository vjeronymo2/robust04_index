			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CZECH PLAYWRIGHT'S APPEAL DENIED  </P> <P> A court today rejected an appeal to free dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, but  the judge reduced one charge and trimmed his nine-month jail term by a month.  </P> <P> The decision concerning Havel, convicted and jailed in connection with a  protest in January, was greeted with cries of "Shame!" and "Release him!" from  a crowd of about 150 supporters who jammed a corridor outside the courtroom.  Havel's fellow Charter 77 activist Vaclav Maly, allowed into the courtroom to  translate for an Austrian legal expert, termed the verdict "prefabricated."  </P></p>

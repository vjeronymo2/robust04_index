After the conversation in the embassy Kozyrev told  ITAR-TASS there was an exchange of opinions about the best ways  of discussing with the Uzbekistan leadership a number of  problems of bilateral relations, the questions of citizenship,  migration, right of property.    Kozyrev believes that although problems still exist and some  of them are acute, their discussion with Uzbek leaders is calm  and constructive, without mutual recriminations. He believes  that since his latest visit to Tashkent last year, the acuteness  lessened and misunderstanding decreased. From the Russian  Embassy Kozyrev headed for the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry and  began negotiations with Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said  Asymov.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the conclusion of his meeting with Nabil Sha'th  at the Erez checkpoint a short while ago, Major General Amnon  Shahaq said that Sha'th would apparently not visit Jerusalem  tomorrow due to changes in his schedule.    Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that Maj. Gen. Shahaq  said that Nabil Sha'th had asked him to increase the number of  entry permits for Palestinian workers from the autonomous areas.  Shahaq, for his part, raised the issue of the collaborators who  have been arrested in the autonomous areas. The two men agreed  that this matter, as well as the issue of the Palestinian  prisoners, would be discussed at their meeting next week.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 19 June  reports that "Maj. Gen. Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th this afternoon  agreed that Israel and the PLO will next week launch  negotiations on the beginning of the next stage: The gradual  transfer of powers in Judaea and Samaria to the Palestinian  authorities." The report notes that "next week, the two men  will also discuss the full implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  First agreement and the release of all the Palestinian  prisoners, including those who were transferred to Jericho.  Nabil Sha'th asserted that he intended to visit Jerusalem  tomorrow; however, this also depended on how busy he would be in  the Gaza Strip. At any rate, Sha'th said, his intention was to  hold a private visit and to people he described as friends, such  as Faysal al-Husayni, visit the churches, and pray at al-Aqsa  mosque." The report adds that "Nabil Sha'th and Maj. Gen.  Shahaq today agreed that at the beginning of next week, 30,000  permits to work inside Israel would be issued to the residents  of the Gaza Strip. It was also agreed that the families of the  Palestinian policemen would immediately be allowed to enter  Israel. The Army will also ease the policy regarding entry and  departure from the autonomous areas."]    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Nabil  Sha'th's planned visit to Jerusalem and the intention to convene  the autonomy council at the Orient House building were raised  today at the weekly cabinet session. The speakers at the  meeting expressed doubts as to whether the autonomy council  would really be convened in Jerusalem. The cabinet was told  that in general, the territories were more quiet, although the  autonomy authorities had failed to meet the timetable for  assuming responsibility over the residents' daily affairs.    The cabinet revoked the ban against signing contracts with  South Africa following the Security Council's decision to end  the military embargo and other restrictions against South Africa.    The cabinet also issued another 10,000 work permits for  laborers from the territories. Approximately 55,000 work  permits for Palestinians from the territories have been issued  so far.</p>

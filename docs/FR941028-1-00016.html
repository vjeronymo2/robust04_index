			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(c)(3)(K) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3)(K), also authorizes the Commission to determine other persons to be ``appropriate persons'' for section 4(c) contract market transactions in light of their financial or other qualifications, or if appropriate regulatory protections are applicable. The Commission is therefore proposing under &sect;36.1(c)(2)(xi) to permit persons, including natural persons, to enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions provided their total assets exceed $10 million. The Commission requests comments specifically addressed to whether these thresholds are appropriate and whether any additional or different financial criteria (such as net worth standards) should be added to any other category of ``eligible participants'' and, if so, whether part 36 should be conformed to part 35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is proposing, in Rule 36.1(c)(2)(x), to include floor brokers and floor traders within the class of ``appropriate persons'' that may participate in section 4(c) contract market transactions. Furthermore, proposed Rule 36.1(c)(1) would permit floor brokers to enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions on behalf of other eligible participants. The Commission is not proposing separate financial standards for eligible floor brokers and floor traders at this time based upon its understanding that each such participant would, by necessity, be a member in good standing of the section 4(c) contract market whose transactions thereon would be guaranteed by an exchange clearing member. The Commission seeks comment on whether it should make a requirement of a clearing member guarantee explicit in the rule and whether it should impose separate financial requirements on floor brokers and floor traders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Transactions Eligible to Trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;36.2 establishes the breadth of the exemption, delineating those transactions eligible to trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions. In that sense, proposed &sect;36.2 modifies the broad definition of section 4(c) contract market transactions set forth in proposed &sect;36.1(c)(1). Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(1) provides that except for a major foreign currency, the transaction must be settled either in cash, at a price that meets the existing Commission requirements for cash-settled contracts set forth in Guideline No. 1, 17 CFR part 5, Appendix A, ``or by means other than the transfer or receipt of any commodity.'' The phrase ``or by means other than the transfer or receipt of any commodity'' would permit the delivery of a subsequent contractual agreement, such as a subsequent position in a swaps agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(2) states that the transaction must be cleared through a clearing organization subject to Commission oversight, a provision originally part of the CME and CBOT's petition for exemptive relief. The rules of clearing organizations subject to Commission oversight as adjuncts to contract markets must be submitted to the Commission pursuant to section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additionally, as the result of section 4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6d(2), such organizations must settle accounts or positions daily. The rules would require section 4(c) contract market transactions to be separately identified on the books of the participant in clearing records to facilitate surveillance of these transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> United States of America, et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> [1977&hyph;1980 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) &para; 20,534 (D.D.C. Jan. 11, 1978).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;36.2(a)(3) prohibits section 4(c) contract market transactions on the agricultural commodities enumerated in section 1a of the Act, except for contracts on a broad-based index thereof. In this regard, the Commission notes that it did not provide specifically for an exemption from Commission rules concerning speculative position limits. Under Rule 150.2, 17 CFR 150.2 (1994), the Commission directly administers position limits for futures contracts on those agricultural commodities. Commission Rule 1.61, 17 CFR 1.61 (1994), requires contract markets to adopt speculative position limits for futures and option contracts which do not have Commission-set speculative limits. While in theory Rule 1.61 would apply to section 4(c) contract market transactions, the exemption from that requirement, 1.61(e), 17 CFR 1.61(e) (1994), has been interpreted flexibly to permit the exchanges to substitute for speculative position limits various position accountability rules for certain futures and option contracts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Therefore, the exchanges have already been afforded substantial flexibility in this area. In addition, additional flexibility in this regard would be afforded by proposed Rule 36.3 which should permit exempt contract markets to implement trading rules more expeditiously and without formal approval by the Commission. The Commission requests comment on whether any further relief is appropriate for section 4(c) contract market transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  57 FR 29064 (June 30, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

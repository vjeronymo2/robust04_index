			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ARCADIA;  </P> <P> AGENCY BUYS RAILROAD LAND  </P> <P> The Arcadia Redevelopment Agency has approved paying $1.1 million for land  owned by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co.  </P> <P> The agency Tuesday voted unanimously to buy the property, at 21 N. 2nd Ave.,  including a small portion of land north of Wheeler Avenue, abutting the  railroad tracks. The agency also agreed to pay the railroad up to $5,000 for  removing a side track connected to the main track.  </P> <P> Councilman Robert C. Harbicht said the agreement ends what he called a  "friendly condemnation" process to acquire the 1.1 acres. The property falls  under the city's Northwest Corner Project redevelopment area, which will be  used to build a commercial center.  </P></p>

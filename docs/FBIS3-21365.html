			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcel Herzog: "Long Live the SAP (Structural </F> Adjustment Program)!"--first paragraph is LA VIE ECONOMIQUE  introduction]    [Text] On 13 January 1994, a daily newspaper published a  long study by Mr. Mohamed Said Saadi, entitled: "The Limitations  of Structural Adjustment in Morocco." In that article, we found  many questionable passages.    Citing exogenous factors that enhanced the positive results  of the SAP (Editor's note: Mr. Saadi write "la SAP" (Structural  Adjustment Policy), but actually it is "le SAP" (Structural  Adjustment Program)), Mr. Saadi enumerates: "Exceptional weather  conditions, favorable worldwide economic conditions, 1985  aftereffects of the oil crisis, rescheduling of the foreign  debt, and cancellation of $2.8 billion in debts owed by Morocco  to Saudi Arabia, all these helped achieve the above-mentioned  financial results."    We shall remember, therefore, that some of the SAP positive  results are due to external conditions.    Second, Mr. Saadi writes: "The Moroccan economy experienced  growth rates that were modest (3.5 to 4.0 percent during the  eighties, and only 2.0 percent on the average in recent years!)  and uneven (negative growth in 1983, 1987, and 1992; near  stagnation in 1993). If we compare these rates with demographic  growth rates (2.6 percent), we realize that per capita income  remained practically stagnant during that period."    Curiously enough, the author does not mention the growth  rates experienced since 1988. They were as follows: 1988: 10.4  percent; 1989: 2.5 percent; 1990: 3.7 percent; 1991: 5.1 percent.    In other words, from 1988 to 1991 the GDP [gross domestic  product] rose by 11 percent in constant dirhams [DH] (from  DH101.525 to DH113.460 billion) over a three-year period; if we  take 1987 as a basis, the GDP grew by 23.4 percent in four  years! For Mr. Saadi, it is an established fact that the GDP  growth rate is low: "The low GDP growth rate," he writes, "is  due first to the fact that Moroccan economy is very vulnerable  to weather conditions and to economic conditions worldwide. But  the SAP also contributed to it in two ways: on the one hand, it  increased the involvement of Moroccan economy on the world  market, based on ill-advised specialization in low value-added  products, the prices of which fluctuate considerably on the  world market; second, it triggered a shrinkage of the domestic  demand as a result of the austerity imposed to the  State--especially as far as economic intervention is  concerned--and to low-income social strata.    The author overlooks the disastrous harvest of 1992--and the  1993 harvest as well--although he just wrote that the SAP  benefited from "exceptional" weather conditions. Actually, these  exceptional conditions did not bring about good harvests, but  bad ones. Besides, here are the results for the four leading  grains (in million quintals): 1987: 42.1; 1988: 78.3; 1989:  73.3; 1990: 61.9; 1991: 85.3; 1992: 28.6 [sic].    As for the "shrinkage of the domestic demand as a result of  the austerity imposed to the State," here are accurate figures:    1. Government expenditures (GDP) (in constant dirhams):  1988:  DH15.521 [billion]; 1989: 16.303; 1990: 16.572; 1991: 17.343;  1992: 18.210.    That is a constant progression (even in 1992); compared with  1988, it amounts to 17.3 percent. It is not a lot and undeniably  an effort was made to reduce State expenditures, but you cannot  waste money during a restructuring period.    2. Household consumption (in billions of constant dirhams):  1988: 115.989; 1989: 127.197; 1990: 138.720; 1991: 160.742;  1992: 159.667.    Obviously, there was a marked shrinkage in 1992, but that  was  the year when the rural world saw its resources cut by DH9  billion compared with 1991. But can we really say that there was  a "domestic shrinkage" during the four previous years? Besides,  as can be seen, the 1992 shrinkage was due to the poor harvest,  not to the SAP as Mr. Saadi would have us believe.    As for the development of exports achieved by the SAP  through  deregulation and devaluation of the dirham, it is, he writes,  "characterized by its weakness and it does not reflect an  improvement in the economic competitiveness of the Moroccan  economy at international level."    Mr. Saadi mentions the textile industry, "which suffers both  from the depressed climate that prevails on foreign markets and  from strong foreign competition," in spite of which he notes  that "the increase in exports during the second half of the  eighties was due mostly to an increase in worldwide demand...."  Morocco's lack of competitiveness, according to Mr. Saadi, comes  from the fact that "the SAP completely overlooked the question  of the creation of a local scientific and technical potential,  and even specific problems that plague the industry," and he  added that the SAP "contributed to the deterioration of human  resources through the severe cuts it made in the budgets of  social services (especially education and health budgets)" (see  Table 1). Since 1988, credits allocated to National Education  were increased by 58.2 percent; those allocated to Health, by  77.1 percent.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1 - Increase in Budgets of Social Services (Operations and Investments)|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Education (Billion Dirha-|Health (Billion Dirhams) |  |                         |ms)                      |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1988                     |9.448                    |1.721                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1989                     |10.627                   |1.737                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990                     |11.803                   |2.082                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991                     |12.093                   |2.161                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992                     |14.229                   |2.777                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1994                     |14.950                   |3.048                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Mr. Saadi goes on: "Another indicator of the negative impact  of the SAP on the growth of productive forces is the stagnation  of the investment rate" (Ratio of the GFCF [gross fixed capital  formation] to the GDP: 22.2 percent in 1980; 23 percent in 1985;  and 23 percent in 1992)." [punctuation marks as published]    Compared with the statistics published by the Ministry of  Planning ("Morocco in Figures"), these figures are not accurate.  Here are the figures we found (in current dirhams:    Table 2 - GFCF and GDP Increases (Billion Dirhams)                            GFCF              GDP                Ratio   1980                     14.767            70.024             21%   1985                     24.724            119.658            20.7%   1990[.sup]1[/]            51.179            207.876            24.6%   1992                     55.804            242.448            23%   [.sup]1.[/] For information only.      The GDP increased by 246 percent in 12 years, and the GFCF  by  278 percent. Let us overlook "the SAP low impact" on agriculture  (although "by eliminating subsidies for fertilizer and seed, it  furthered a production cost increase"). Note that the 1994  Finance Law eliminates the PFI [import tax levy] and the  value-added tax on fertilizer. As for the processing industry,  "it is still handicapped by its low integration level, the  uneven development of its branches, and it strong dependence on  foreign suppliers of capital goods and inputs (raw materials,  intermediate products), and its reorientation toward foreign  markets was not enough to offset the negative impact of the  shrinking domestic market; all this accounts for the low  industrial growth rate experienced during the last 10 years (3.8  percent during the eighties, and 2.5 percent from 1990 to 1992)."    Let us take another look at the GDP figures (in constant  dirhams) for the industry, during the nineties: 1990: DH40,284.2  million; 1991: DH42,845.1 million; 1992: DH45,015.1 million.    Let us say it again: The industrial growth rate was 6.35  percent in 1991, and 5.1 percent in 1992, in constant dirhams,  which is far more than the results quoted by Mr. Saadi who,  still with the same bias, goes on to consider the foreign debt  problem. Here is what he has to say: "Although the SAP was  supposed to settle the foreign debt issue once and for all and  restore Morocco's solvency, it appears that, after 10 years of  structural adjustment, the foreign debt level remains  particularly high ($21.3 billion in 1992). Certainly, the  foreign debt/GDP ratio declined from 97 percent in 1983 to 78  percent in 1992, but the debt still places a burden on the State  budget and on the balance of payment, and we should expect this  burden to increase, as Morocco decided that, starting in 1993,  it would no longer reschedule its foreign debt (as an example,  it is expected that 19 percent of all the 1994 State budget  resources will be earmarked to cover the foreign debt, which  represents a considerable reduction of the resources available  to stimulate the economy and start solving social problems)."    Mr. Saadi probably imagined that the objective of the SAP  was  to obliterate the foreign debt. Actually, it was to enable  Morocco to honor its signature. It did so, which greatly  enhanced its credibility and the confidence it inspires in  investors.    Certainly, the debt is a heavy burden, and if we listened to  Mr. Saadi, who denounces "the drop in public investments" during  the eighties, it would be still higher.    But our economist has a ready solution. You read it right:  the foreign debt service "represents a considerable reduction of  the resources available to stimulate the economy and start  solving social problems." The message is clear. You see, all we  have to do is eliminate that reduction, reschedule again, in  other words, not pay what we owe.    But eventually Morocco will pay a high, a very high price  for  such an irresponsible attitude (not to use another word).  Therefore, let us clean up the mess. And long live the SAP!</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Truly, deeply and profitably: Oil companies are successfully tapping previously inaccessible reservoirs For much of this year US-registered exploration rigs have been flocking to the Gulf of Mexico to take part in what promises to be one of the most remarkable changes in the fortunes of an oil-producing area. After nearly 45 years of production, one of the world's most extensively drilled pieces of oil and gas-bearing seabed is attracting renewed interest from oil companies - in spite of relatively low world oil prices. The reason is that new technology has given oil companies the ability to explore large, geologically-complex areas, which were previously not thought to contain oil, or which defied conventional exploration methods. Industry observers say the new reserves in the Gulf of Mexico that can now be tapped could be large enough to slow the steady decline in overall US domestic production. The new techniques could also extend the productive life of other mature areas, including the UK and Norway's reserves in the North Sea. The resurgence of interest in the Gulf of Mexico results from two innovations. One is the growing technical ability to operate oil production platforms in deep water. The other is the extensive use of a new seismic technique which, combined with advances in computing power, is pinpointing oil and gas reserves where previously they could not be seen. The first of these innovations is the most visually dramatic. Until recently, most of the world's offshore oil platforms sat above a lattice work of steel, firmly fixed to the ocean floor. But the volume of steel needed to fix a deep-water platform to the seabed would make them uneconomic. To overcome this problem, oil companies working in the Gulf of Mexico are using the first of a new generation of floating structures known as 'tension leg platforms'. These are held in place by 12 steel pipes, each more than half a mile long, that run from the floating hull to the ocean floor. The design eliminates most unwanted vertical movement while allowing the structures to move with the waves. The first of these new structures came into operation in April when production commenced at Shell Oil's Auger platform in the Gulf of Mexico. It lies in 2,860 feet of water, a US record and one of the deepest oil platforms in the world. A new US depth record will be set in 1996 when Shell and its partner, British Petroleum, install a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m) platform in 2,933 feet of water over the Mars field, found in 1989 and the largest discovered in the gulf in 20 years. Lessons learnt in the Gulf of Mexico are being applied elsewhere. Shell and BP are partners in two UK deep-water projects west of the Shetland Islands that are currently being assessed for production. Mr Bob Howard, vice-president of domestic operations for Shell Oil, says the new drilling technology could help exploit an additional 8bn-15bn barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. In contrast to the small reservoirs common in the shallow water of the gulf, the new deep-water fields have much larger reserves. In the early 1980s, most geologists thought that these off-shore deep-water fields contained few oil-bearing sands, says Mr Howard. If these estimates are confirmed, it would place the Gulf of Mexico deep-water reservoirs in the same league as Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the biggest single oil field in the US, which accounts for a quarter of the country's daily output of 6.6m barrels. The change in exploration outlook was largely brought about by the second innovation that is opening up more of the world's oil reserves - the use of a three-dimensional seismic technique. This has allowed geologists to 'peek around corners', says Mr Howard. The new technique uses the same principle as conventional two-dimensional seismic surveys. Air guns towed by boats generate sound waves. The reflections from rocks under the seabed are picked up by lines of underwater sound receivers, known as hydrophones, towed by the boats. But three-dimensional surveys use many more air guns and hydrophone lines placed in parallel. That allows seismic 'snapshots' to be taken every 25 metres, compared with typically every 2km-3km in the past. The large amount of data generated would be useless, however, without rapid advances in computer processing. Mr David Work, group vice-president for exploration at US oil company Amoco in Houston, says increased computer power has cut the cost and the time it takes to interpret the data. 'It now costs Dollars 50,000 to process the same information that five years ago cost Dollars 250,000,' he says. BP officials say such technical advances have cut the time between the first seismic shot being fired and an exploration well being drilled to as little as six months. A couple of years ago the process would have taken two years. The Dollars 1bn or more that it takes to build a new generation deep-water platform has restricted interest to big oil companies. But smaller ones are among those leading the way in using three dimensional seismic surveys to explore beneath the seabed, where sheets of salt until recently formed a impenetrable blanket over as much as 60 per cent of the Gulf of Mexico. 'Five years ago if you hit salt you would stop drilling,' says Mr Clive Fowler, vice-president of Amoco's offshore business unit in New Orleans. The two-dimensional seismic technique then in use gave geologists insufficient detail to determine where the salt ended and any oil-bearing rocks began. But three-dimensional seismic combined with computer power have helped geologists to 'see' below the salt sheets, which can be about 5,000ft thick. The race to discover new fields in the Gulf of Mexico began last year when a consortium comprising Philips Petroleum, Amoco and Anadarko, a US independent explorer, announced a big commercial sub-salt discovery in the gulf. That set off competition to secure new government leases in areas covered by the salt. Experts are divided over whether the sub-salt reserves will rival those in deeper water. But 'if the sub-salt play is for real, it could be like rolling the clock back 30 years in the Gulf of Mexico', says Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, the New Orleans broker specialising in the energy industry. Unlike the deep-water finds, many of the most interesting sub-salt areas are in shallow water close to existing platforms and pipelines. That should keep development costs low. But even with the advantage of existing infrastructure and new seismic techniques, Mr Work does not expect the commercial success rate in developing sub-salt fields to lead to big improvements from the 10-12 per cent success rate in traditional areas. There are many technical problems, including the difficulty of drilling through the plastic-like salt without causing the well walls to collapse. Some industry observers predict that there will be 'many disappointments'. Earlier this summer, Philips and Anadarko announced the abandonment of a sub-salt exploration well due to problems with the well, even though it had hit large amounts of oil and gas. Some oil executives believe the full potential of the gulf will not be realised without government help. They say the high risk associated with deep-water development means that as much as half of the potential reserves might not be exploited unless the government provides royalty relief or a production tax credit. Both proposals are being considered in Washington. But Ms Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, says any relief would have to be 'revenue neutral', and not add to the federal budget deficit. The industry says any financial aid would pay for itself, with up to 100,000 jobs created by full-scale, deep-water development. But even if the full potential of the Gulf of Mexico is realised, it is unlikely to be enough to reverse the decline in US domestic production, caused mainly by the depletion of mature onshore fields. The government says large reservoirs of oil remain to be discovered in US coastal waters apart from the Gulf of Mexico. But most of these areas are covered by Congressionally-imposed environmental bans on drilling. The impact of the technical innovations on the reserve base and cost structure on the US oil industry will be substantial, however, even if their application is mainly confined to the Gulf of Mexico and other existing oil regions. In addition to pinpointing new reserves, three-dimensional seismic surveys of existing fields have uncovered nearby deposits missed in earlier studies. The technique has also given companies a better idea of how more oil and gas can be extracted from an existing reservoir, while the increase in information available to geologists has reduced the number of expensive, exploratory wells that need to be drilled in prospective fields.</p>

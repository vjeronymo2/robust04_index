			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Recovery gets under way at slimmed-down Darby DARBY GROUP, the USM-traded specialist glass company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 379,000 for the six months to August 31, on sales of Pounds 8.27m. The Scunthorpe-based group also announced a return to the dividend list with an interim distribution of 0.5p. The comparable period saw losses of Pounds 471,000 before tax, as profits of Pounds 99,000 from continuing activities were outweighed by a deficit from French and US operations, now sold. Mr Michael Darby, chairman, said business in the UK was slowly improving - the factory in Barking has been recommissioned reflecting a stronger market in the south-east - but there was reduced activity in German markets. Nevertheless, exports now account for some 10 per cent of total turnover. 'We shall continued to pursue this market vigorously,' he added. Earnings per share emerged at 2.2p (losses of 1.99p).</p>

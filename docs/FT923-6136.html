			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: L&amp;M cuts losses and bankers extend loans LONDON &amp; Metropolitan, a property company with negative net worth of Pounds 44m, yesterday announced that its banks had agreed to extend their loans for another year. The company, which has debts of Pounds 129m, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 26m for 1991. That compared with Pounds 100.3m in 1990, when losses were increased by Pounds 88.9m of provisions against falling property values and the collapse of a consortium that had planned to buy London's County Hall. Its plunge into loss precipitated a financial restructuring in March 1991, when banks accepted warrants in return for injecting new working capital into the company, converting unsecured debt into five year debt and extending their secured debt until June 30 1992. This debt and the working capital facilities have been further extended until June 1993 by the company's dozen banks. Mr Chris Harris, chairman and managing director, said he believed the company's future was secure. 'There is arguably very little to be gained by putting the company into receivership,' he said. Instead of merely winding the company down, L&amp;M was engaged in long term projects such as its golf course development in the south of France, he said. The group has recently signed a joint venture agreement with Pierre et Vacances, a resort group, for the project's development. L&amp;M's development in progress is valued at Pounds 75m, while its investment programme is worth Pounds 22m. The group's accounts will be qualified by its auditors as they were prepared on a going concern basis. The operating loss increased from Pounds 9.28m to Pounds 13.7m, while interest payable increased from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 12.7m. Last year, the company sold 18 properties for Pounds 26m. It made new provisions of Pounds 6m, half of which related to an unlet office building in St John Street, in London. At the end of the year, shareholders had negative equity of Pounds 40m compared with Pounds 21m a year earlier. Losses per share fell from 171.9p to 44.3p.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' CHOICE: WHAT AM I DOING HERE? BY BRUCE CHATWIN (VIKING: $19.95; 369  PP.)  </P> <P> "The magic in Chatwin's best work goes beyond his perfection of incident, of  phrase and of portrait. It comes, also, from the zigzag, unpredictable circuits  and detours he takes through his material. It is as if he himself were a  Chinese geomancer, listening for dragon-lines; the hidden routes that bring  virtue and prosperity."Richard Eder  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report: "Jure Radic: Confirmation of Principles That </F> Exist in a Multiparty System"]    [Text] Zagreb -- The Presidency of the Croatian Democratic  Community [HDZ] unanimously approved the agreement that was  signed in the parliament on Wednesday [18 May]. This was stated  by HDZ Secretary General Jure Radic for Croatian Television's  Dnevnik [news] program on Thursday night. Dr. Radic appeared as  a guest on the Dnevnik program shortly after the voting on the  aforementioned agreement at the session of the HDZ Presidency.    "Considering that, according to the HDZ Statute, the  Presidency makes all important political decisions and is  accountable for them, it is quite clear that the HDZ accepts the  agreement signed on Wednesday without any reservations, and that  it will carry it through," the HDZ secretary general said.  <H5>  Parliamentary Crisis Avoided </H5>   Radic said that "a possible parliamentary crisis had been  avoided in the best way," with the signing of an agreement. He  stressed that the HDZ had approached the agreement with clear  stands and the desire to offer to the opposition parties the  number of leading posts in the assembly to which they are  entitled to according to the percentage of their deputies in the  Assembly of the Republic of Croatia. He said that the same  principle applies to the HDZ, which means that posts of the  chairmen of both assembly chambers belong to the HDZ.    Commenting on the view expressed by Drazen Budisa, leader of  the Croatian Social Liberal Party, that thanks to the signed  agreement, the Croatian Assembly will no longer be able to  function as a mouthpiece [transmisija] of the ruling party and  the president of the state, Dr. Radic said that the Assembly had  not been the mouthpiece of anyone in the executive authority nor  of the president of the state in the past either. He said that  the Assembly of the Republic of Croatia has the constitutionally  regulated powers and tasks, and it has been and will be  functioning in a democratic way as a multiparty assembly. Dr.  Jure Radic said that the agreement signed on Wednesday is "yet  another confirmation of the principles that exist in a  multiparty system founded on the results of the elections."  <H5>  New Names by the End of the Week </H5>   In response to a question by the Dnevnik editor concerning  the election of the future leading people in the assembly, Dr.  Radic said that the representatives of the parliamentary parties  have agreed to complete all the necessary consultations in  connection with that this week, and after that they will inform  the public on who the new assembly officials will be.    Replying at the end of the interview to a question on  whether  the assembly, following the signing of this agreement, will  begin its work and deal with the vital issues for which it has  the mandate of the Croatian electorate, Dr. Jure Radic said that  he thought that the public was pleased with the signing of the  agreement and that the public was in fact one of the reasons as  to why the agreement was signed. The HDZ secretary general  repeated that the starting points of the agreement were that the  election results, which stipulate that the top posts in both  assembly chambers belong to the HDZ, be taken as the criterion.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Brazil's restless military finds favour: Disillusioned Brazilians question the efficacy of democracy DURING phone-in programmes in the run-up to Brazil's plebiscite last month on its political system, callers would often ask why ditadura, or dictatorship, was not an option. Disillusioned by the failure of the country's politicians to deal with pressing social and economic problems, Brazilians are increasingly talking of the military as the only way out. The word golpe, or coup, is cropping up everywhere from leading newspaper columns to pavement bars. This is a remarkable turnround for a people who only a few months ago were congratulating themselves on the strength of their renascent democracy and the restraint shown by the armed forces over last year's street campaign which helped produce the impeachment of President Fernando Collor. While the Brazilian army is far from sending tanks into the streets, there is undeniable stirring in the ranks - the result of desperation over the squeezed military budget combined with anger at the country's humiliating position as the laggard of the continent. Senior officers have begun making barely veiled political statements and pointing at Chile in the 1980s and Peru now as examples of how much easier it is to implement reform with an autocratic regime. Last month General Zenildo Lucena, the army minister, warned that Brazil's high levels of social misery were threatening democracy. In recognition of the gravity of the situation, President Itamar Franco met yesterday with the army chief and three military ministers to hear their grievances, after publicly praising them for 'exemplary behaviour in this moment of extreme difficulty'. The meeting follows an inflammatory article by Brigadier Ivan Froto, the airforce commander, in last Thursday's Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper. Aside from the usual warnings of American designs on the Amazon the article attacked Congress and the executive and described the airforce as going through 'the worst crisis in its history' because of government failure to update equipment and keep salaries abreast of inflation. So strapped for cash are the forces that men doing national service are sent home on Thursday nights for the weekend to save electricity. Wages are so low that it is common to see junior officers hitchiking back to barracks and many sergeants have two jobs, working off-duty as mechanics. But perhaps the real problem is the failure of the military to find a role eight years after the 21-year period during which it ran the country. Brazil has no serious territorial disputes and the high command has been reluctant to involve its men in activities such as combating drug-trafficking for fear of them being corrupted. At the same time their collective pride has been hurt by seeing Brazil, once the motor of Latin America, constantly referred to as dragging down the continent. One officer said: 'What particularly rankled was hearing the Clinton administration describe Argentina as a tiger. And Chile - why we export a whole Chilean economy a year.' A document has been circulating among officers praising the 'successes' of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's government. Mr Fujimori suspended Peru's Congress last year in an 'institutional coup'. Moreover the population is increasingly turning on the government and politicians over their failure to combat inflation, poverty, hunger and unemployment. The battered reputation of Congress recently suffered a further blow with the revelation that aid money for alleviating the drought in the north-east was mostly used by congressmen to drill wells on their private estates. President Franco is on his third finance minister in six months and has shown no signs of being able to control Brazil's 1,500 per cent annual inflation. Mr Carlos Castello Branco, a leading commentator, said yesterday that each successive government was 'worse than the last'. By contrast the military has retained its credibility. Their years in power saw the 'Brazilian miracle,' with growth rates second only to South Korea and very limited repression in comparison with other Latin American countries. Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the influential governor of Bahia, said in a recent interview: 'I don't want to be an alarmist but imagine what would happen if the military were to say 'let's work to reduce inflation. Let's clean up the administration. Let's end unemployment. Let's reduce poverty and inequality. We'll work for this and we want power.' Nobody could be against these aims - it would set public opinion alight.' The sheer scale of Brazil's problems is doubtless a factor discouraging the military from re-entering the political arena. But the economic crisis is increasingly provoking law and order problems, such as sackings of supermarkets in Rio and a flourishing separatist movement in the south. Mr Villas-Boas Correa, a political analyst, says: 'If the crisis starts to explode I can't see the military staying in their barracks watching.'</p>

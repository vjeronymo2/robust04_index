			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Barsukov] </F>   [Text] Washington April 7 TASS -- Russian communist leader  Gennadiy Zyuganov said his party and its allies would do  everything to achieve national reconciliation and accord in  Russia. He stressed that it is impossible to stabilise the  situation in the country without it, he said.    Zyuganov noted that, during his latest meetings with  high-ranking representatives of the administration, he had got  an impression that the U.S. leadership realised Russia's  problems and a new policy toward Russia was needed. At the same  time, the administration underestimates the processes underway  in Russia, he said.    According to Zyuganov, "the situation in Russia is going  from  bad to worse as before". The state has become a "communicating  court" and does not fulfil its functions. The crime rate has  reached the scale of the post-civil-war period. The power is  concentrated in the hands of one man, the Russian president,  whose powers are four times as much as the U.S. President has.  It lets those who have no powers and play a role of "collective  baron" "conduct the Russian civil strife". The situation in  many important spheres in the country is critical. Even missile  systems do not undergo some necessary operations in time, he  said.    According to the Russian communist leader, any democracy is  out of the question if there is no bread, water and heating.  The stabilisation of the situation is the main task requiring  coordinated efforts, of the international community in  particular. The further confrontation in Russia will lead to a  national tragedy.    Zyuganov noted that a rather big central-leftist bloc had  formed in the State Duma which can propose its own programme to  overcome the crisis in the country.</p>

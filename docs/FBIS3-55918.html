According to a law passed by the Seimas today,  they will be allowed to have one not larger than nine millimeter  caliber pistol and ammunition. The law states that the pistol  must not be automatic or have a large magazine. Permits to  acquire the weapons will be issued by the Internal Affairs  Ministry and the order of acquiring, keeping, and carrying the  weapon will be established by the government. According to the  Seimas instruction, the government will have to do this by 1  March.    Permits to acquire, keep, and carry arms will not be issued  to persons tried for premeditated crimes and imprudent crimes  committed with the use of arms, ammunition, or explosives, and  to those on bail.    Persons who have been fined for illegal acquisition and  keeping of narcotics, for encroachment on public order, and  other intentional administrative offenses if [words indistinct]  the weapon can be used for administrative offenses cannot have  weapons. The law forbids licensing arms and ammunition to  persons [indistinct word] abusing the use of alcohol and  narcotics and to persons suffering from mental illnesses.    The law contains some other limitations, also. When it is  published, we will know about them. Persons having illegally  obtained firearms, ammunition, and explosives must hand them in  to the police by 1 April. Those who do this voluntarily will  not be fined and a compensation in cash will be paid to them.</p>

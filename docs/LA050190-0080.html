			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: NO SANCTIONS LEVIED AGAINST SDSU FOOTBALL  </P> <P> The San Diego State University football program will not have sanctions levied  against it by the California Community College Football Coaches' Assn.,  President Jack Jordan said Monday.  </P> <P> Jordan telephoned SDSU Coach Al Luginbill Friday, after the committee voted  against the sanctions at a meeting in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The group was considering sanctions because of complaints lodged by coaches at  three community colleges last fall and stemmed from conversations they had with  Luginbill about high school players Luginbill was recruiting in 1989. Howard  Gay, coach at San Jose City College, accused Luginbill of acting improperly in  steering Donnell Ragsdale from Oak Grove High in San Jose to Mesa College in  San Diego.  </P> <P> The coaches also alleged that Luginbill, in addition to acting improperly in  the Ragsdale case, threatened to discredit their programs with coaches and  players in their districts if they did not cooperate with him in his  recruiting.  </P> <P> Luginbill denied the charges, calling them "ridiculous."  </P> <P> The committee could have imposed sanctions that prevented SDSU football coaches  from recruiting on California community college campuses and obtaining game  films and academic transcripts.

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Annual Production falls for first time since 1983 INDUSTRIAL production fell by an average 2.1 per cent in Italy last year, the first decline since 1983, according to figures from Istat, the national statistics office, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The figures confirm the recession affecting a broad swathe of industry which began in late 1990. There is no immediate evidence of recovery. Worst affected were heavy industry and engineering, where output fell 5.4 per cent, reflecting the downturn in the motor industry and machine tools, where plants are working at 75 per cent capacity. In contrast, the food sector rose a modest 1 per cent, underlining the way consumer spending has held up. Last year's industrial downturn was also confirmed this week by provisional Istat figures showing a 2.6 per cent decline in employment in companies with more than 500 employees. The industrial north was worst affected; Lombardy alone lost 108,000 jobs. The true level of industrial unemployment, however, is disguised by the practice of state-funded temporary lay-offs. Resort to this mechanism, especially notable in large groups like Fiat, increased by 21 per cent on average during the year, but in the case of engineering the increase was 60 per cent. Large companies also took advantage of a government scheme to help fund 11,000 early retirements last year; a further 25,000 are planned this year. The shake-out in industrial employment is expected to accelerate, and the government is likely to come under pressure to absorb more workers on the state payroll, following the example of an agreement over the weekend with Olivetti. The government agreed to absorb 1,000 Olivetti workers who had been threatened with job losses.</p>

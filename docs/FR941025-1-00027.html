			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the ANPR, the Canadian standard for children's sleepwear prescribes flammability requirements for pajamas, nightgowns, and robes which are similar to the requirements of the sleepwear standards codified at 16 CFR parts 1615 and 1616. However, the Canadian standard provides that close-fitting polo pajamas and sleepers, as well as sleepwear garments in infant sizes and sleepwear garments used in hospitals shall meet less stringent flammability requirements which are similar to those of the standard for clothing textiles codified at 16 CFR part 1610 (4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated September 13, 1993, the Director of Product Safety of the Canadian government advised the Commission that since promulgation of the Canadian sleepwear standards in 1987, no burn deaths associated with children's sleepwear have been reported in Canada. The Director of Product Safety added that a planned five-year study to collect data about burn injuries associated with children's sleepwear in Canada had been discontinued because of a lack of burn cases (11).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the Commission concludes that to the extent the children's sleepwear standards in their current form are applicable to tight-fitting sleepwear garments, they may apply to some garments which are not associated with an unreasonable risk of burn deaths and injuries and may not be limited to those garments which present an unreasonable risk, as required by section 4(b) of the FFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments address the issue of defining the term ``tight-fitting'' garment. Some comments suggest exempting specific types of garments such as ``ski pajamas'' or ``long johns.'' Others state that exempted garments should be required to have specific features, such as tight cuffs at the wrists and ankles. Some comments observe that the Department of Commerce has withdrawn the commercial standard for sizing of children's apparel which is cited in both children's sleepwear standards (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b) of the FFA requires that a flammability standard must be ``stated in objective terms.'' The amendments proposed below exempt ``tight-fitting'' sleepwear garments from the standard for sizes 0 through 6X and the standard for sizes 7 through 14. The proposed amendments define the term ``tight- fitting garment'' by specifying maximum dimensions for the following parts of the garment: Chest, waist, seat, upper arm, thigh, wrist, and ankle (12). The proposed amendments specify the specific points on the garment at which measurements are taken to calculate the maximum dimensions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The maximum dimensions specified for garments in sizes for infants six to 24 months old were selected by considering body sizes of children approximately six months old set forth in a proposed revision of ASTM standard D 4910 (12). The maximum dimensions selected for the various locations on the garment in each size from 2 through 6X are based on dimensions specified in a draft ASTM standard tentatively designated ``Standard Table of Body Measurements for Pre-School Children Sizes 2&hyph;6X/7.'' (12) The ASTM committee which is developing this draft standard has several members who are employed by manufacturers of children's garments as well as members from academic institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maximum dimensions of the specified locations on garments in sizes 7 through 14 are based on a report of an anthropometric study of children ranging in age from infancy to the age of 18 years, conducted in 1977 by the University of Michigan (12). Maximum dimensions are given for both boys' and girls' garments in the proposed definition of ``tight-fitting garment'' for the standard for sizes 7 through 14. The Commission is aware that at this time sleepwear garments are not marketed in girls' sizes 9, 11, and 13. However, dimensions for those sizes are provided in the proposed amendments to the standard for size 7 through 14 published below. Garments which are not explicitly labeled and promoted for use by girls must meet the maximum dimensions listed for boys' garments in each size to be exempted from the requirements of the sleepwear standard for sizes 7 through 14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be eligible for the exemption from the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards, a tight-fitting garment must not exceed the maximum dimensions specified for each size in the amendments proposed below. The proposed amendments also require that an exempted garment must be labeled to indicate the size to which it was manufactured. The size label required by the proposed amendment is for the use of the Commission staff when determining whether a garment meets the dimensional requirements for an exempt sleepwear garment. For this reason, the label is not required to be permanently affixed to the garment, but it must be visible when the garment is offered for sale to consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments also require that when offered for sale to consumers, exempted garments in sizes for 6 to 9 months and larger must be clearly and conspicuously labeled with a statement to advise consumers that the garment is not flame-resistant and should be tight-fitting for the safety of the child. If the proposed amendments are issued on a final basis, this labeling statement will be one component of an information and education campaign to advise consumers that the safety of these sleepwear garments is dependent upon their tight fit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, garments exempted from the flammability requirements of the amendments proposed below must comply with applicable provisions of the flammability standards for clothing textiles and vinyl plastic film (16 CFR parts 1610 and 1611).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> c. Alternatives to an Exemption for Sleepwear Garments in Infant Sizes and for Tight-fitting Garments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some comments suggest that rather than exempt sleepwear garments in infant sizes and tight-fitting garments from the sleepwear standards, the Commission should provide additional guidance about the differences between children's sleepwear and non-sleepwear garments, including long underwear (6). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

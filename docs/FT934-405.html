			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: Sinterklaas fights back I'm spending this Christmas, again with my friend Jean-Peter. He is from Luxembourg and is still active in DGXXII in the European Commission and is now in charge of the programme for new policy initiatives. 'Take a look at this editorial,' he said, flinging a recent copy of the Dutch financial paper, NRC-Handelsblad, over to me. 'Hmm,' I said. 'Santa Claus fights back.' It was all about the rearguard battle 'Sinterklaas', or St Nicholas, had launched against the encroachments of Father Christmas. The two are not the same, it seems. The article complained that today in Dutch shopping centres you hear 'Jingle Bells' in place of 'Zie ginds komt de stoomboot'. I said I wasn't really surprised, but Jean-Peter was impressed. 'You see they've got a point. Should the Gatt round have included St Nicholas as a cultural exception? NRC says he doesn't need a subsidy - 'a man enough to trust in his own strength.' Hmm. I wonder.' All this, it seems, is grist to Jean-Peter's new think-tank which is working towards the European Policy Innovation and Reformulation Colloquium to be held next March in Hilversum. He asked me for my ideas. I recalled the news conference given by President Mitterrand at the end of the G-7 Tokyo Summit in July. He had argued in favour of bigger handouts to developing countries. I thought he was right because of French demands for a preference communautaire. In other words the poor needed help because markets in Europe were closed to some of their exports. When I asked the French leader if there was not a contradiction here, he replied that if there was it was 'purely formal'. Jean-Peter smiled. 'Yes, we've been thinking about that sort of thing here. The French policy could provide a major boost for everybody if implemented properly. It is the concept of the 'purely formal' contradiction that we find particularly useful. A lot of circles can be squared if you look at them through the right prism.' I confessed that this was lost on me. But Jean-Peter said his colleagues had been inspired by a series of television programmes about Margaret Thatcher's time as prime minister. 'We have the Thatcher countervailing cost and tax tariff structure in place just ready to go.' Apparently the commission had been impressed by Thatcher's arguments for a Community Charge, or what the British call poll tax, as a new source of local government revenue. 'We saw Lady Maggie on that TV programme. The poll tax could have worked. 'Nigel Lawson had the solution,' she said, 'in his own hands. But he would not come up with the money to make it work.'' So Thatcher had achieved a Euro-breakthrough. If something costs too much, you raise a tax to pay for it and if that tax is too high you get the ministry of finance to subsidise it. If necessary by raising a new tax. 'As Mrs Thatcher noted, that was the solution finally chosen in Britain  - the standard rate of value added tax was raised to help pay for the Council Tax. Brilliant but too late to save Lady T unfortunately.' But unemployment was, of course, the real problem and Jean-Peter was absorbed in ideas for cutting it. 'A lot of people have been thinking productively on this subject. France encourages a four-day week, Volkswagen has a 29-hour week already and the German economics minister, Gunter Rexrodt, suggested doubling the annual holiday to three months. What we are aiming at, initially, is the 28-hour week, Europe-wide.' 'And if things get worse?" 'Then the 20-hour week would come in. But actually we are doing something really interesting, path-breaking in fact, in this area already. We're putting some money into a new French film that incorporates job sharing. It's called Le Monde est Ronde.' Who's in it? 'Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu. At least they are for four days a week.' 'And the other day?" 'We've got Josianne Bidochon out of retirement. She has not been in anything since 1962 and is actively seeking work. And then there is Pepe La Frite who is on a youth training scheme.' I gasped at this idea. 'It's quite absurd.' 'You fail to understand anything at all. Work sharing can work at every level. Look at the England football team - you 'need' only 11 players. But in a period of four years England managed to give jobs to 60. That's the way ahead - it should be compulsory for everybody. To achieve a level playing field.'

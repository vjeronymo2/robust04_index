			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Renee Lai] </F>   [Text] A senior official of the People's Bank of China  expects the yuan to remain stable because of the country's  strong foreign exchange reserves and its ability to control  soaring prices, and has dismissed concern about further  depreciation.    Worries have been lingering that the Chinese currency will  decline further following its effective 33 per cent devaluation  against the U.S. dollar since January 1, when Beijing scrapped  the two-tier yuan rate.    The yuan has been trading in a tight band of seven to 8.6 to  the dollar.    Tan Zhuohuai, vice-director of the central bank for  Guangdong  province, gave the assurance to foreign investors at a seminar  yesterday in Hong Kong.    He said a fall in the yuan would depend on the result of  China's fight against inflation and the management of its forex  reserves.    Mr Tan described China's economic policy as "neither a  control, nor an easing", but a combination of both measures. He  said price rises were inevitable under the reforms, but it was  necessary to keep them at an appropriate level.    Beijing had shown its ability in containing price increases  through the 13 per cent price rise last year, which had been  largely controlled by the government.    Mr Tan cited China's foreign assets of more than U.S.$200  billion and forex reserves of $29 billion last year as evidence  of sufficient backup. Chinese banks had a forex balance of  about $4 billion.    That strength was underscored by the fact that the yuan had  been picking up since the start of the year.    "The ultimate aim of foreign exchange management is to relax  control, allowing the yuan to be an international currency and  freely convertible," Mr Tan said.    China had lifted forex control on current accounts such as  imports and exports, while its grip remained tight on capital  accounts.    Meanwhile, Mr Tan said China had adjusted its structure of  fund allocation to cash-strapped state-owned enterprises.    "It is not a question of a credit squeeze or an easing of  liquidity now, but a selective policy to guarantee the liquidity  of key enterprises," he said.    He pointed to key infrastructure projects, more efficient  enterprises and purchases of foreign trade products and  agricultural products as priorities.    Dong Xinbao, professor of Tsinghua University's School of  Economics and Management, said the investment environment in  China was better than last year.</p>

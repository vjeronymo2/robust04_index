			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Laszlo </F> Gog; place and date not given: "Geza Jeszenszky on the  Partnership for Peace Program"]    [Text] [Gog] Hungary was among the first to accept the  U.S. and NATO offer for a partnership for peace and announced  that, within this framework, Hungary would like to participate  in bilateral military cooperation with NATO. When do you expect  from the signing of the peace partnership declaration adopted in  Brussels?    [Jeszenszky] I cannot yet give you a firm answer to this  question, but it will take place soon. After certain political  consultations at home, the signing of this cooperation will take  place soon. The U.S. side plans to send a further delegation to  Hungary, as well as to the other states, in the near future.  This is not an international agreement, so it does not need  parliamentary ratification; however, the government believes it  important to have the broadest possible political consensus  behind this.    [Gog] The signing of the statement will be followed by the  bilateral NATO-Hungarian agreement on cooperation, one that  contains the details of cooperation. What does Hungary plan to  include in this project?    [Jeszenszky] Definitely the framework of concrete  cooperation, political representation, and participation in the  activity of the NATO Headquarters. We would also like to  include something that is there in the Brussels document, namely  that the goal is full membership and, at the same time, that we  accept certain obligations.    [Gog] Will certain concrete elements of military  cooperation, such as the organization of military exercises,  military training, and participation in peacekeeping missions  also be included in the treaty?    [Jeszenszky] Of course. However, some elements of military  cooperation have already been effected, such as the training of  Hungarian officers in various NATO countries, as well as the  broadening of control over airspace. As a UN member, Hungary  also participates in certain peacekeeping actions, for example  in Mozambique and Cambodia. When we train in a NATO framework,  this will also advance the reform of the Hungarian Army.    [Gog] All four Visegrad countries have already announced  their willingness to participate in the cooperation offered  under the Partnership for Peace program. In your opinion, in  what way are President Clinton's visit and discussions in Prague  important?    [Jeszenszky] Actually, exactly what NATO was offering only  transpired on Monday [10 January]. This is an American proposal  and it had to be accepted by NATO. The United States played an  important and positive role in making the NATO summit accept  this rich cooperation program after all and, in this way, opened  a possible venue. It was not their goal in Prague to convince  us that this peace partnership is good for us and that it  provides adequate security, and it was not our goal to convince  them that this should be better and that they should give as  much as possible; instead, we talked of ways in which the  stability of Hungary and its neighbors could be advanced, for  example in economic matters, because these matters are very  important from the viewpoint of security.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: An elusive corporate consensus European economies are becoming more integrated, but European business leaders remain a highly diverse breed. Today's continent-wide opinion poll for the FT and five other European newspapers shows marked differences in attitudes to the continent's economic challenges. The continent seems to divide along north-south lines. Executives in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands generally favour free-market solutions to Europe's competitiveness difficulties, while those in France and Spain lean towards solutions involving government action - including a sharpening of protection against imports. The northern countries - above all, Britain and Germany - are more doubtful about possibilities for economic and monetary union and about the benefits of the European single market. The larger companies surveyed view monetary union with most scepticism. On the basic question of whether Europe will remain competitive during the next 10 years, the Dutch, Belgians and British have the lowest expectations, with 50 per cent, 45 per cent and 42 per cent respectively saying they believe Europe will slip behind. There is a general consensus that the countries posing the main competitive problems are the 'tiger' economies in east Asia. For the UK and France, China is seen as a much greater long-term economic threat than the US or Japan. Among British executives, for instance, 54 per cent say China is the 'greatest threat', while only 24 per cent and 12 per cent hold this view of Japan and the US respectively. Countries closer to the nascent market economies of eastern Europe take a more serious view of competition from this region. German, Belgian and Dutch business leaders see eastern Europe as a graver challenge than China, Japan or the US. Forty-three per cent of Belgian respondents see eastern Europe as a serious threat, with 40 per cent of those in the Netherlands and 26 per cent in Germany taking this view. German and British companies are considered most likely to succeed in cutting production costs and increasing competitiveness during the next five years. Spain and France are generally expected to fare less well. However, underlying doubts about the German economy are highlighted by a significant minority of respondents - 23 per cent - who believe Germany will achieve the least success in cost-pruning. Forty-one per cent of respondents believe Germany will fare best at reducing costs, with this view most widely held among German, Spanish and Dutch executives. The UK is regarded as the next most successful cost-cutter, with 21 per cent of executives supporting this view. German, Belgian and Spanish participants are most confident that Europe's worst recession since 1975 will give way to modest economic recovery this year - a view held by 78 per cent, 76 per cent and 71 per cent respectively in the three countries. Even the relative optimists, however, mainly believe that this year's growth in EU countries will be below 1 per cent. In line with diminished growth prospects, 45 per cent of respondents say they will reduce their workforces this year, with only 10 per cent expecting an increase and 44 per cent intending to keep staff unchanged. Fifty two per cent of manufacturing companies plan job cuts, while the proportion in service industries is only 33 per cent. The proportion of companies planning to reduce staff is highest in Germany (55 per cent), the Netherlands (50 per cent) and Belgium (48 per cent). There are large differences on one of the most emotive questions in the poll  -possible trade barriers against eastern Europe and Asia. Twenty-six per cent of French respondents favour higher trade barriers against imports, with only 17 per cent saying existing barriers should be lowered. But, in Britain and Germany, only 4 and 5 per cent want higher barriers, while 69 per cent and 62 per cent want to lower them. No Dutch industrialists surveyed favoured raising barriers, with 71 per cent saying they should be lowered. Executives' commonly lack detailed knowledge of the Delors white paper on growth and competitiveness. Only 22 per cent say they are familiar with it; of these, 70 per cent say it is 'fairly good' or 'very good'. Reaction is most positive in Germany, Italy and Spain, but more scep-tical in Britain and France. Business leaders display disappointment with the fading quality of national political leadership , as well as a lack of enthusiasm for EU institutions. Forty-one per cent say the quality of political leaders has deteriorated during the past 15 years, while 36 per cent say it has improved. In a solid vote against Chancellor Helmut Kohl, opinion is most negative in Germany, where 68 per cent say leadership has declined since the 1970s. Nearly half of respondents say they do not know who they would like as the new president of the Commission next year. Buoyed by support from business leaders in their own countries, Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of the Commission - who has said he does not want to stand again - and Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, lead the poll, each with 9 per cent support. Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner for external economic relations, comes next with 8 per cent. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is favoured by an overall 2 per cent of respondents - but only one per cent of executives in his own country believe he would be right for the job. CAN EUROPE COMPETE? This is the first instalment of a special 10-part FT series examining Europe's response to intensifying world-wide competition. Subsequent articles, appearing every weekday for the next fortnight, will look at: Manufacturing. How good are European workers and managers? The Labour Market. Why is Europe suffering from chronic unemployment and sluggish job creation? Service Industries. Can services create the jobs lost in manfacturing? Technology and Innovation. Is Europe being left behind in the global race for technological advantage? The Environment. Are green rules a burden or boon? Financial markets. Is Europe a world-beater in financial services? The European market. How complete is the single market? And what role can eastern Europe play? Grey Europe. Europe's population is ageing. What will this mean for business, the economy and the role of the state? The Cure. How companies, governments and employees can meet the challenge. WHERE EUROPE IS HEADING - THE VIEW FROM THE BOARDROOM The poll, commissioned by the FT in association with Die Zeit (Germany), Les Echos (France), Il Sole 24 Ore (Italy),  Expansion (Spain) and Het Financieele Dagblad (Netherlands), was carried out by Harris Research. It is based on telephone interviews carried out between January 6 and February 6 with directors of 507 top companies in seven European countries, of which 331 are manufacturing and 176 service companies. The survey sample, drawn from Europe's top 15,000 companies ranked by turnover, was split among the following countries: Belgium (42), France (86), Germany (85), Italy (84), Netherlands (42), Spain (84), UK (84).

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W advances Reports that Energis, the new telecommunications venture set up by the National Grid, had told analysts that it would not be specifically targeting Mercury customers when it launches its new business next year lifted Cable and Wireless, Mercury's parent company. Mercury was considered particularly vulnerable to Energis, which was launched three months ago, because its customers had already changed once from BT and could be prepared to do so again. C&amp;W also benefited from buying in the US which had created a shortage in ADRs. The shares advanced 7 to 770p. BT, which yesterday announced that the BT3 public offer was oversubscribed, steadied at 410 1/2 p.</p>

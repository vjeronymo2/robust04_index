			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Inquiry urged into Hoover offer MR NIGEL Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, yesterday called for a department of trade and industry inquiry into Hoover's 'free flights' offer, which he said was the subject of 'tens of thousands of complaints from customers'. Condemning the promotion as a 'fiasco,' he said the inquiry should be able to 'recommend compensation for any unreasonable conditions or behaviour by Hoover's agents'. Hoover yesterday accused the Daily Express of 'distortion and misrepresentation of facts' in a story which featured several instances of dissatisfied customers, based on a BBC TV consumer affairs programme broadcast last night. But the company refused to say how many people had applied for free flights in either of its two promotions, nor would it disclose the number of people who may have travelled so far. The offers have closed, but the last possible date for a flight is April 1994. said Mr Griffiths. 'Hoover is shrouding far too much of this in secrecy. There is considerable concern that they should come clean. The fact that they are not giving the public even simple information leads one to question their good faith.' Hoover ran two 'free flights' sales promotions last year. Customers spending Pounds 100 or more on a Hoover product could apply for flight vouchers to European or US destinations. The vouchers were to be processed by several travel agents hired by Hoover. Mr Mike Dunkley of Your Leisure, one of the agents, said yesterday 'many thousands' had booked and travelled on the schemes. He said he was contractually bound by Hoover not to disclose precise figures. The flights in both schemes were 'subject to availability'. In the last resort Hoover is legally able to specify the date, time and destination of the flights. Mr Keith Richards, a lawyer with the Consumers' Association said yesterday: 'Hoover seems to be getting rid of applicants because they have not correctly filled in the application form or because some of the applications are claimed to have been lost in the post. 'People are disappointed because they did not get what they want and were enticed by a very clever marketing ploy,' he said.</p>

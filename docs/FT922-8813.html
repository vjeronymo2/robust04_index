			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Sweden orders fighter jets Sweden is to go ahead with an order for 110 JAS 39 Gripen multi-purpose fighters two days after the Swedish consortium manufacturing the aircraft failed to win a FM13bn (Dollars 531m) order from Finland, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The total cost of the controversial JAS programme is now estimated to be SKr57.8bn. An initial order of 30 JAS planes for the Swedish air force will start being delivered next year. Deliveries of the latest order will start in 1996. To date, no foreign country has ordered the JAS 39 but the consortium hopes it will find customers in central and eastern Europe.</p>

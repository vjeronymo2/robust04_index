			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroaki Ito] </F>   [Text] Washington, 17 Jan -- One of the reasons for the  rough sailing of the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks is the  tough attitude taken by the United States. Washington expects  the Hosokawa government to display a positive attitude, unlike  past Japanese Governments, in the talks. This "excessive  expectation" has led to an aggressive attitude by U.S.  negotiators in the talks. Also, because of its weak political  basis at home, the Clinton administration "cannot retreat from  its tough stand" in the talks.    Last November, a senior USTR [U.S. Trade Representative]  official said, "We do not need to hurry because there will be  more negotiations on 11 February," indicating the trade talks  would be concluded during the summit talks between Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.  This suggests that the U.S. Government, which gives high marks  to Prime Minister Hosokawa, places more hope on "a decision to  be made by Hosokawa" than on negotiations with Japanese  bureaucrats.    However, even after welcoming in the new year, the Hosokawa  government remains stymied by the "political reform" problem.  The administration is unable to lead bureaucrats in the trade  talks. Instead, it has recently made remarks in favor of  bureaucrats' opinions.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently expressed  dissatisfaction with Japan, saying: "The United States has made  efforts to fulfill Japan's requests for reducing financial  deficits and realizing low interest rates. Meanwhile, Japan has  made little effort to open its markets to foreign competition."  The United States is irritated because things have turned out  contrary to its expectations.    As in Japan, the political base of the ruling party  supporting the Clinton government is weak. Some tough elements  in the U.S. auto industry are now saying: "Do not conclude the  trade talks if the two sides reach an agreement without setting  numerical targets."    Washington has not changed its view that the Hosokawa  government is "better than past Japanese Governments which  formed collusive ties with bureaucrats and corporations"  (according to a senior Commerce Department official). Thus,  when Washington criticizes Japan, it directs its criticism at  bureaucrats, not Hosokawa. U.S. Under Secretary of State Wirth  has suggested the summit talks between Clinton and Hosokawa  could be held not only on 11 February but also in the evenings  of 10 and 12 February. Washington seems to have concluded that  at the final stage it will have no choice but to urge Hosokawa  to make a decision.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The stakes in Hong Kong WITH LONDON and Beijing apparently preparing to resume talks on Hong Kong and the governor calling for a 'spirit of realism' about them, the people of the colony might be getting a familiar feeling: that their future is about to be decided without their participation. Mr Chris Patten may vow that the Legislative Council (LegCo) will never be a rubber stamp for the executive, but it is difficult to see how the governments concerned would proceed if an eventual Sino-British agreement were rejected by LegCo. Nevertheless, the conciliatory noises emanating from both sides do not necessarily presage the end of Mr Patten's proposals for political development. China's blanket opposition to them last October has now been replaced by a willingness to talk. Even if that is in essence a delaying tactic, it also represents an acknowledgement that its propaganda campaign against the governor has failed. Support in London remains solid, and the community in Hong Kong is still broadly behind him. Moreover, Mr Patten's proposals have brought a deepening of political debate within Hong Kong. The colony's politicians have assumed a greater responsibility for its future, and this will be hard for the future sovereign power to ignore. China has consistently maintained that the future of Hong Kong is a matter for talks with Britain, not with the Hong Kong government and certainly not with LegCo. But it would now have to hesitate before insisting on a solution which ignored LegCo's express wishes. Differing views As it will be in charge in a little over four years, China stands to gain from satisfactory resolution of this problem - in effect, a test of the 'one country, two systems' approach which Mr Deng Xiaoping devised as the means to re-absorb lost territories. There can be little real confidence in Hong Kong's economic future if Beijing does not allow it to develop a system of its own, within the framework already agreed between Britain and China. Clearly there are differing views within the Chinese government about how to handle the present dispute. While systematically attempting to undermine the governor, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council is participating in an investment venture which will give it a direct stake in maintaining the confidence of financial markets. In 1992 alone, China is estimated to have invested USDollars 20bn in Hong Kong. Planned listings of Chinese companies on the Hong Kong stock market indicate a central role for the territory in China's development. With its stake in Hong Kong's future growing, Beijing has an interest in obtaining a solution of the present dispute which bolsters confidence. Room for compromise Despite the apparent gulf between London and Beijing on political development, there is scope for a compromise which could satisfy both sides, combining convergence with the post-1997 Basic Law and greater democratic representation. This must be the goal of any talks. Such a compromise would greatly bolster confidence and would probably meet one of Mr Patten's key principles - that the solution be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. He has said from the start that the Hong Kong community's desire for more democracy was balanced by a desire for convergence with the Basic Law, and that China's opinions had to be taken into account. Since it would be silly to squander the opportunity for talks by precipitate action, the current delay in putting Mr Patten's programme to LegCo is not important. But LegCo must eventually be allowed to debate amended proposals, or the current ones if there are no Sino-British talks. The fact that the possibility for compromise exists does not, of course, mean that there will be one. China has got virtually everything it wanted out of talks with Britain on Hong Kong. But regardless of the finer points of negotiation, Mr Patten's open approach has forced greater recognition of the realities of Hong Kong's future and has drawn Hong Kong more into the process of developing its own 'system'. It is good for the long-term interests of Hong Kong - and therefore, ultimately, of China. He deserves continuing support.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As the world focuses on China for the fifth  anniversary of the June 4 massacre, Beijing has ordered hotels  to pull the plug on CNN television broadcasts and tried to  divert domestic attention elsewhere. Chinese officials complain  of the West's obsession with Tiananmen and the crushing of the  student democracy movement as if it had been no more than a  passing hiccup. It is because it was no such thing that the  anniversary must not be passed over in silence.    Compared with some of China's previous political  convulsions,  Tiananmen may seem relatively tame. Yet for hundreds of  millions of Chinese both inside and outside the country it  carries greater significance. Not only was it the first  upheaval to have such an immediate impact on international  political awareness -- it was also the seminal political  experience for a generation for whom the Cultural Revolution was  just a childhood memory. Older Chinese knew to treat the  apparent political relaxation of the Beijing Spring with  distrust. The protesters on Tiananmen Square had to discover  the leadership's ruthless cynicism for themselves.    Tiananmen was also a powerful wake-up call for Hong Kong.  Since 1984, the territory had accustomed itself to assuming  Britain and China provided stability while Hong Kong delivered  its own prosperity. The disappointment and anger which drove a  million people to march through the streets reflected the  realisation that Chinese rule after 1997 might not be so benign  after all.    In the five years since the crackdown, human rights in China  have hardly improved. Dissidents are harassed and jailed.  Political freedoms are nonexistent. Religious worship is  interfered with arbitrarily. Journalists are jailed for spying.  Sentences for economic as well as political crimes are harsh.  <H5>  Indispensable Partner </H5>   Discontent continues to simmer close to the surface. The  causes of the unrest that boiled over in 1989 -- arbitrary  government, economic disruption, and rampant corruption --  appear to have worsened in the past two years.    Yet while the anniversary has attracted media attention,  governments have once again begun to come to terms with the fact  that China is an indispensable partner politically and  economically.    Most European governments followed former United States  President George Bush in making peace with China during the Gulf  War and despite the occasional -- and costly -- flirtation with  Taiwan, most have continued to court Beijing. Under President  Bill Clinton, however, the United States tried and failed to use  trade as a lever to force improvements in human rights. To the  victims of the 1989 military crackdown, and of China's continued  political repression, that policy gave a glimmer of false hope.  <H5>  Rekindling Hope </H5>   It did not work. Its reversal was dictated by economic and  geopolitical necessity. But, while Mr Clinton's decision to  separate trade and human rights was the correct one for Hong  Kong, he has yet to come up with an alternative policy on human  rights which could rekindle real hope in China and provide some  reassurance of American support for Hong Kong's continued  political freedoms after 1997. Meanwhile, now that renewal of  China's Most Favoured Nation trading status is no longer a  domestic political issue, future anniversaries may pass  unnoticed.    Of more immediate concern to Hong Kong, however, is an  apparent change in British policy since the governor's return  from London last weekend. Although Chris Patten is standing  firm over his political reform package, which China has said  will be dismantled in 1997, the government opposes a human  rights commission and other human rights legislation because it  would not last beyond the handover. At the same time, while  exiled activist Han Dongfang has been permitted to stay in Hong  Kong, U.S.-based Chinese scholars Liu Binyan and Ruan Ming have  been refused visas to Hong Kong, for fear they may make  outspoken attacks on Beijing. These may be only the first signs  of change. But how long will it be before the government begins  to stifle local reminders of the June 4 massacre?    The crackdown five years ago was not a mistake or an  accident. It was a calculated act of repression, intended to  reassert total political control after a moment of relaxation.  That is why senior leaders such as President Jiang Zemin say  they would do it again if necessary. For Hong Kong to allow  them to escape without further criticism would be a betrayal of  the millions who are still suffering from their wounds.</p>

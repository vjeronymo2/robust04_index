			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- The Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Association will propose to the U.S. auto industry  the setting up of a forum for talks in the private sector on  U.S. auto imports to Japan, industry sources said Saturday [26  February].    The industry group's move reflects an effort to help bridge  the gap between the United States and Japan on purchases of U.S.  auto parts and sales of U.S. autos in Japan -- the most  contentious issue in the failed bilateral "framework" trade  talks.    Heads of the U.S. and Japanese auto industries agreed in  1992  to set up discussion groups, but the talks never materialized.    The establishment of talks in the private sector has become  urgent now, however, with the deadlock in government  negotiations, and the automobile association will try to find  ways to enhance U.S. imports, the sources said.    In line with the Japanese Government's plan to liberalize  the  domestic market, the automobile association and major Japanese  automakers have started drawing up their own measures to respond  to the U.S. demands.    The measures could be ready for implementation as early as  mid- March and include releasing the purchasing plans of auto  parts at each Japanese automaker.    This proposal has met with strong opposition from the  automobile industry, however, on fears that it could be taken as  a commitment to setting numerical import targets -- a U.S.  demand that Japan has strongly resisted throughout trade talks.    "That would run counter to our policy of never ever  releasing  figures," said an official at one major auto company.</p>

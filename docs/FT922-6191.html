			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Consumer confidence growing in US US CONSUMER confidence registered its third consecutive monthly increase in May, reinforcing other signs of a gradual economic recovery, Michael Prowse writes from Washington. The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its index of confidence rose to 71.6 this month, against 65.1 in April and a low of 47.3 in February. The increase was larger than expected, but left the index short of the 100-plus level normal in a healthy recovery. Mr Fabian Linden, for the Board, said the steady rise in confidence left 'little doubt that the economy is at long last recovering'. The stronger figures follow the Federal Reserve's decision last week that lower interest rates were not needed to sustain the recovery. For the first time since August the Fed reportedly shifted to a neutral monetary stance, abandoning its previous bias towards lower short-term rates. More than a quarter of respondents to the Board's survey said they expected the business outlook to improve over the next six month.</p>

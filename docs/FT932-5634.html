			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Kravchuk denied extra power The Ukrainian parliament yesterday blocked President Leonid Kravchuk's bid for additional power. It also refused to give Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime minister, the extraordinary authority over the economy he requested, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. It is unclear whether Mr Kuchma will agree to stay in office, having threatened to resign unless he had his way. Parliament's vote is a serious political defeat for Mr Kravchuk.</p>

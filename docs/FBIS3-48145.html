			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Monday [24 January] the government will simply "wait  and see" the stock market situation despite the tumble in  morning trading over political turmoil.    Fujii attributed the sharp decline to the muddy outlook in  the political scene ahead. But "(stock price fluctuations) are  a common phenomenon," he said. "We will wait and see for the  time being," he said.    The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues plunged  more than 4 percent during the two-hour session in a negative  reaction to the defeat on Friday of the government's political  reform bills in the House of Councillors.</p>

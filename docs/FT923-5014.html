			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Sterling steadies as ERM pressure eases STERLING clawed back some of its recent losses against the D-Mark yesterday, brushing off the dollar's renewed weakness, as pressure in the European exchange rate mechanism showed tentative signs of easing. The pound was unaffected by official figures suggesting that the Bank of England intervened heavily to bolster sterling's position in the ERM last month. However, the dollar continued to come under pressure, hitting a record low against the D-Mark for the second day running. The pound gained half a pfennig to close in London at DM2.7875, still less than a pfennig above its ERM floor of DM2.778. Against the dollar, sterling climbed to Dollars 2.004, against a previous close of Dollars 1.997. The dollar finished at DM1.3905, down less than half a pfennig. In New York, the pound held steady against the D-Mark, but dropped back slightly to Dollars 1.9993 against the dollar. There was also little change in the dollar/D-Mark rate, which closed at DM1.3942. In Tokyo this morning, the dollar opened at DM1.39725, while sterling was quoted at DM2.788 and Dollars 1.99575. The lira, which in recent weeks has come under severe pressure in the ERM, yesterday was unchanged against the D-Mark. It closed last night in London at L764.6 to the D-Mark, above its ERM floor of L765.4. In London, the Treasury announced that Britain's underlying gold and currency reserves dropped by Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 639m) in August, reflecting heavy intervention by the Bank to temper the currency's fall. The drop, which compares with a fall of only Dollars 86m in July, reduced the level of reserves at the end of August to Dollars 44.4bn compared with Dollars 45.7bn in July. The steadier pound gave some support to UK equities and government bonds. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up 14.6 at 2,313.0, while gilts gained up to 1 point. Expectations that Britain may be able to stave off a rise in base rates, now 10 per cent, were reflected on the UK money market. The three-month interbank rate, which indicates market perceptions about the future level of base rates, eased from about 10 9/16 per cent to about 10 7/16 per cent. Reduced currency turbulence also buoyed the Paris bourse where prices rose 2 per cent. But investors elsewhere in Europe indicated their continued nervousness that the strong D-Mark may require increases in interest rates in some European countries when growth prospects seem poor. Stock markets in Frankfurt and Milan fell by 0.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. The UK Treasury said the drop in reserves demonstrated the government's 'resolve' to protect the pound from sliding below its floor in the ERM. The pound lost 5 pfennigs in August after coming under heavy selling pressure, most spectacularly last week, because of the D-Mark's strength. Last Wednesday, after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, restated the government's commitment to maintain the pound's parity within the ERM, the Bank carried out extensive operations to prop up the currency. Estimates of the amount it bought ranged from Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn.

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> BUSH PLANS 3-HOUR TOUR OF QUAKE AREA  </P> <P> President Bush will take a three-hour tour today of Northern California areas  damaged by the earthquake. He will spend much of his time in a helicopter,  stopping only in Oakland and Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> "We'll do as much as we can without disrupting local activities," White House  press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Bush is to fly to Moffett Naval Air Station near Mountain View and take a  helicopter to Alameda on the east side of the San Francisco Bay, and then drive  to Oakland to view the collapsed Interstate 880.  </P> <P> He will then go back to Alameda for a helicopter ride to Santa Cruz, where  there is extensive damage.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos -- who had criticized an earlier  helicopter tour by Vice President Dan Quayle as being nothing more than a  publicity stunt -- was invited to accompany Bush on Friday, along with the  mayors of Oakland and Alameda.  </P></p>

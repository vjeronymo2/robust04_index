			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Coleman hardens support in Virginia Mr Marshall Coleman, the independent candidate in Virginia who was expected to draw votes away from Mr Oliver North, the Republican, is now inflicting more damage on Senator Charles Robb, the Democratic incumbent, according to two new state polls. The surveys both had Mr Robb in the lead, but by statistically insignificant margins. Both found that Mr Coleman, a former Republican lieutenant-governor and, on most issues, an orthodox conservative, was hurting Mr Robb nearly twice as much as he was Mr North. The director of one of the polls said Mr Coleman's support was hardening and his campaign manager even predicted a surprise on Tuesday. Mr Coleman appears to have scored by emphasising the character defects of both party candidates - Mr North for his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair and Mr Robb for his admitted personal infidelities. But Mr North's adoring hardcore right-wing support, while not constituting a majority, appears solid and may be understated by a few percentage points, whereas the senator's is notoriously soft. Meanwhile, another keenly watched Senate race - in California between Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Congressman Michael Huffington - has taken a new twist following reports that the senator may have hired an illegal immigrant as household help. Mr Huffington, who has already confessed to the same offence, rushed out a TV commercial claiming Ms Feinstein had 'flat out lied' in denying she had done the same. But the Immigration and Naturalisation Service came to her aid by saying the report appeared to be based on a case of mistaken identity.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Global overcapacity threat to petrochemicals manufacturing AFTER SPINNING off ICI Bio, the new ICI will be left with a mixed bag of high-volume, capital-intensive and very cyclical businesses. They were highly profitable in the chemicals boom of the late 1980s but worldwide overcapacity in bulk chemical manufacturing means that ICI is unlikely to see such good times again in the 1990s, however well the world economy recovers. The most vulnerable part of the new ICI is in petrochemicals - making plastics out of oil and gas. It is one of the smaller global petrochemical manufacturers, with sales of around Pounds 2.5bn a year compared to Shell's Pounds 6bn, and its production economics are generally less favourable than for oil companies such as Exxon and BP which have more flexibility to take petrochemical profits up or downstream. In some key areas of petrochemicals, such as olefins and aromatics, ICI is a regional rather than a global player. These operations are likely to be prime candidates for disposal. As Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said yesterday, 'We believe the right way to go is down the global route. Regional businesses can be satisfactory but they have to earn their corn.' One regional business that is not earning its corn at present is the UK-based chlor-alkali operation, which has been hit hard by what Sir Denys called 'an absolutely disgraceful increase in electricity prices'. Sir Denys threatened to close the chlor-alkali business down, saying 'we have got to a critical point - if anyone thinks we're just rattling sabres, just wait and see.' But the new ICI has several businesses in which it can fairly claim to be a world leader. For example: Paints has continued to trade strongly during the recession and is set for strong growth when the world economy picks up. Explosives is expanding into new areas such as the safe disposal or recycling of surplus military explosives and ammunition. The fluorocarbons business is building new plants in the UK, US and Japan for chemicals to replace CFCs (which are being phased out because they destroy the ozone layer). Tioxide, which became a wholly-owned ICI subsidiary last year, is cutting costs and investing in less polluting plants to produce the white pigment titanium dioxide. The future of ICI's materials business will depend very much on the outcome of current negotiations to sell its fibres interests to Du Pont of the US and buy Du Pont's acrylic interest instead. The swap is still awaiting clearance from the European and US competition authorities but, Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive designate of the post-spinoff ICI, said yesterday: 'We believe it is part of the more general restructuring which the chemical industry in Europe requires and which will enhance its competitiveness.' One issue threatening the competitiveness of the new ICI is environmental legislation. As an industrial chemical producer, it will have to invest heavily worldwide in cleaner factories and facilities to reduce wastes. Although Tioxide is now benefiting from recent investment of this sort, ICI as a whole has not yet faced up to the environmental challenge in the same way as its German competitors, BASF, Hoechst and Bayer. There is no good international model for the new non-biological ICI. Perhaps the closest match is Union Carbide of the US - though Carbide is still struggling to escape from the financial and moral damage done by the Bhopal disaster six years ago. The company will also have a lot in common with two other American chemical giants, Du Pont and Dow Chemical, which have spun off their pharmaceutical companies but still have substantial agrochemical operations.</p>

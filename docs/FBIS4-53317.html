			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- The government adopted  Wednesday [18 May] a 10.89 trillion yen supplement to extend for  40 days a 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 trillion yen  that is nearing expiration.    The revised stopgap budget totaling 21.94 trillion yen for  90  days was endorsed at a morning extraordinary cabinet meeting for  immediate submission to the current Diet session.    The government also extended the provisional outlays for the  fiscal loan and investment program, adding 6.95 trillion yen to  16.78 trillion yen.    The rare supplement on a stopgap budget -- the first since  fiscal 1990 -- followed long political turmoil involving the  resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the  selection of premier Tsutomu Hata.    Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget,  submitted to the Diet unusually late on March 4, started finally  Tuesday, but uncertainties over a speedy passage still prevail  with the new ruling coalition parties holding a minority of Diet  seats.    It normally takes about two months for a full budget to pass  through the Diet.    Citing the lingering uncertainties, a Finance Ministry  official told reporters the 40-day extension period was timed so  that the stopgap budget expires when the current Diet session  ends on June 29.    As in the initial provisional budget, the supplement  earmarks  necessary minimum expenditures to keep administrative bodies  functioning and excludes public projects in new policy areas.    Outlays related to public works are increased by 1.07  trillion yen to 3.84 trillion yen, about three-sevenths of  spending included in the full budget.    Minimum expenses in labor, operations and other  administrative expenses are set at 25 percent of the full  budget, up from 14 percent in the initial stopgap budget.    Among other major outlays, the supplement boosts social  welfare spending by 1.48 trillion yen to 3.69 trillion yen, and  raises tax grants to local governments by 3.64 trillion yen to  7.30 trillion yen.    In revenues, the ministry estimates an additional 2.92  trillion yen to a total 6.75 trillion yen in the 90-day period,  including 1.93 trillion yen more in tax income to 3.15 trillion  yen and 910 billion yen more in bond issuance to 3.38 trillion  yen.    To cover an estimated revenue shortfall of 15.20 trillion  yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term  treasury securities if necessary.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters after the  cabinet meeting, "I can't deny that a long delay will affect the  economy."    But he stressed that the government decided on the revised  stopgap budget to "minimize" adverse effects and is calling for  early passage of the full budget.    Meanwhile, some economists warned that the  economy-stimulating outlays earmarked in February's pump-priming  package will dry up by the end of June.    The Japanese economy is recently showing improvements on the  heels of the fiscal measures, but without fresh outlays, it  could suffer another setback, they said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech By Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari from </F> Los Pinos Presidential Palace; monitored in progress -- live or  recorded]    [Text] ...Luis Donaldo Colosio has died today. This is a  deeply indignant fact. It is a fact that offends us. It is an  offense against all Mexicans and the institutions that we have  built throughout our history. It has hurt the deepest  convictions of the Mexican people, who have always favored the  path of harmony, law, and peace, who have always rejected  violence as a method to solve our problems.    There is no political or moral reason that justifies  violence  in Mexico. It is an affront, because a climate of dialogue,  understanding, and of consensus prevailed among the political  forces, to direct the diverse proposals along the path of law  and legal reform. It is an affront to the PRI members, to the  Sonora residents, and also to all Mexicans.    We do not accept that enemies of Mexico seek to twist the  path of law and harmony. The loss of Luis Donaldo Colosio is  the most profound call for Mexicans to remain united, to revive  the awareness that we are people of great moral strength, and  that in the face of adversity, we know how to make use of our  values and energy to strengthen the firmness of our institutions.    As president of the Republic, I am determined to act  forcefully. I will ensure that the law is applied rigorously and  that this crime will be fully clarified. Nobody is above the  law. Mexicans must be sure that the Constitution and the law  will be complied with at all times.    I am making a call for harmony. I have received from  political and party leaders expressions of their conviction and  commitment to act responsibly in keeping with the new  circumstances. We will maintain our regime of freedom and the  constitutional order.    As a Mexican, and as a friend of Luis Donaldo Colosio, I  have  a lot of affection to offer to his family, his wife Diana Laura,  his son Luis Donaldo, and his daughter Mariana. Their pain is  not beyond me, and I will try to ease their loss with my closest  friendship.    I urge all my compatriots to remain calm despite their  indignation. I call on you to reaffirm our shared conviction  that we will be able to overcome this aggravation within the  framework of the institutions and the law.    The greatest show of love for Mexico and faith in its future  at this time will be accomplished by reinforcing our unity and  ensuring that our voice of harmony, as one people, is heard in  all parts of our homeland and the entire world.</p>

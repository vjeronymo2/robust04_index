			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Management: When head office goes native / A look at the experience of a group of Monsanto 'spear-carriers' in moving from the US to Europe There could be no clearer evidence of the pain involved in uprooting organisational structures, procedures and attitudes than this year's 4,500-mile move by the headquarters of Monsanto Resins. Yet multinationals must take similar steps if they are to become better at managing their various global businesses in a flexible way that best suits the market and technological characteristics of each business. Bill Slowikowski, boss of the resins division, calls the move a 'trial by fire' mainly because of his role as a spear-carrier for the sort of global management and information systems - as well as attitudes - that the rest of Monsanto's chemical businesses will need in the future. If he had not been so keen to play this role, the task might well have fallen to his counterpart in either the plastics or rubber chemicals divisions, both of which are nearly as international as resins. An immediate aspect of 'trial' was the shock experienced within the US side of resins, and elsewhere at St Louis, when the Brussels move was announced. 'It caused tremendous anxiety,' says Gustaaf Francx, general manager of Monsanto Chemicals for Europe-Africa, whose responsibilities included the European side of resins until Slowikowski's arrival in January. The US resins organisation 'had always felt close to the powerhouse - they were dominated by it - but all of a sudden the powerhouse was moving away from them,' says Francx. He sees this as a painful but real benefit for the people involved in terms of the extra delegation to them. 'Now we finally have a US organisation that has to learn to stand on its own feet, without being watched over constantly by senior management,' he says. Surprisingly, perhaps, the least troublesome aspect of the move has been face-to-face communication. Slowikowski will have travelled to the US only seven or eight times by the end of 1992. This is not so much to see his boss, the head of the whole chemicals group, as because he still has half his team there. The director of the Saflex business (a Briton) is located in Brussels, along with the director of one of the two smaller resins businesses, and the functional heads of manufacturing, planning, control and information systems. But the director of the other small resins business - which is purely American - is still in St Louis, as are the heads of human resources and technology. The latter is a Briton based near Boston, where most resins research and development is done - both Francx and Martin Kallen, head of Monsanto Europe, see the location of most Monsanto R&amp;D in the US as a very sore point. Communications between these people, and between their subordinates, have been eased considerably since the Gulf War by the introduction of extensive in-house video conferencing across the US, Europe and Asia. This has limited the need for long flights to meetings, although Slowikowski remarks that 'if you can't handle jet lag, this is no organisation to be in'. A different aspect of communication has been a real trial, however: the litany of technical computer problems which have beset Slowikowski and co. 'The St Louis people said you could get the same data in Brussels as in the US, but it wasn't true,' he says ruefully. All sorts of incompatibilities had crept unnoticed into the division's systems on the two sides of the Atlantic. These resulted, for instance, in total chaos when, in order to do an initial quarterly forecast before Brussels had been set up to do it, the new HQ tried early this year to down-load its files into St Louis. 'There was data all over the place,' recalls Slowikowski. Other such problems, including altering St Louis computer maintenance times to suit Brussels working hours, took six months to sort out. Worse difficulties have been encountered in trying to start the worldwide consolidation and control of orders, production flows and inventory. 'We're looking at major systems changes,' says Slowikowski. 'They wouldn't have been done from the US.' But these technical changes are minor compared with the challenge of changing people's attitudes and ways of working, from what Slowikowski calls 'vertical to horizontal'. In the past, everyone in the division identified their interests with their region, discipline, and department, and took decisions accordingly - whether about work on research projects, new product development, production, pricing or anything else. Decisions and actions which needed co-ordination had to be referred up each of these 'silos', as Slowikowski calls them, and then transferred across to the next silo at senior level, before being referred downwards again. Now Slowikowski and his lieutenants are 'breaking down the silos to work as a worldwide team', as he puts it. This involves getting people at all levels to manage horizontally, across disciplines and regions. That, in turn, requires each management procedure and system to be re-thought or, in today's fashionable jargon, 're-engineered'. This process is being aided by a review already under way across all the Monsanto chemicals divisions. Working as a global team also requires retraining and motivation programmes, so that people at all levels understand their new roles and how they are now supposed to relate to each other. Resins is making extensive use of teamwork psychologists to help train its people, and influence their real readiness to work in the new style, rather than just their expressed acceptance. One technique is to use 'sensitivity training' to get people to understand their own prejudices. In R&amp;D, for example, Slowikowski says: 'People are 'coming over' one at a time, and starting to think completely differently' about working in flexible, inter-disciplinary project teams. 'It's really exciting, but it takes a hell of a time.' A key example of the need for new systems and attitudes is in manufacturing, where global co-ordination is seen as increasingly vital. In order to optimise production continually on a worldwide basis, processes for product categorisation and labelling, capacity planning, working capital and production loading will have to be redesigned and integrated between the various plants in Europe, the US, Brazil and Asia. 'Instead of making 2,000 product categories in each plant, why not source 1,000 each from two plants worldwide?' asks Slowikowski. As with information technology, unexpected problems can arise. 'We have not supplied sheet resin successfully across regions in the past,' says Slowikowski. He cites one case where an order was switched from one factory to another and a boat load dispatched, only to find that one plant had changed its product specification slightly without telling the rest of the organisation. The replacement load was therefore unsuitable for the customer. 'Our people are going through a lot of things which we need to co-ordinate on a worldwide basis,' says Slowikowski. The resins boss, who clearly thrives on working abroad, emphasises repeatedly that the human side of going global is at least as important as redesigned systems and procedures. 'Trial by fire' is, after all, more of a human than a technical experience.</p>

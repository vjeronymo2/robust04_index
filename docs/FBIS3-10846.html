			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Minister of the Presidency Raul Vittor Alfaro  yesterday said that the government will create "at least one  million new jobs" during the year. The minister also announced  the construction of 31,000 new three and four story housing  units throughout the country to help the poor.    The minister said these housing units will be financed by  Fonavi [National Housing Fund], mortgage bonds, and a percentage  of family savings. The minister added, however, that in some  cases the government will provide 100 percent of the financing.    Alfaro said the government is anticipating a total  investment  of approximately $360 million a year. Sixty percent of this  total will be financed through the sale of mortgage bonds and 20  percent will come from family savings.    The minister did not give figures on investments in Lima or  the number of units planed for the capital. He mentioned,  however, the largest interior cities of Cajamarca, Ayacucho,  Chiclayo, Piura, and Tumbes, among others.    Alfaro, who left the Education Ministry and moved to his new  post only three days ago, did not mention details, but added  that other projects on the drawing board include the feeding of  students, increasing the rations of the glass of milk program,  building school centers, and implementing electricity projects.    "These programs will create new jobs. We are thinking of  building 300 schools on top of what is being contemplated by  Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund],"  Alfaro said.    The minister made these remarks during his swearing in  ceremony at government palace.    Later, during a meeting with the presidents of Regional  Administration Transitory Councils, he called for the immediate  implementation of a strategy to fight poverty, defeat recession,  and create jobs throughout the country through regional  governments and by offering incentives to the private sector.    Alfaro said that one of his portfolio's priorities is to  fight extreme poverty and asked the 12 regional presidents and  the presidents of Corde Lima [Lima Development Corporation] and  Corde Callao [El Callao Development Corporation] to begin  working seriously, cautiously, responsibly, and honestly.    "Let us begin working immediately so that one year from now,  in March 1995, the people can say now we have jobs," Alfaro said.    "This is what the government wants, to create the greatest  possible number of jobs," the minister added.    During the meeting, the minister and the presidents  discussed  this year's projections and the programs that will be  implemented in the regions.    "We must make optimum use of our human resources. It will  greatly help our development," the minister said.</p>

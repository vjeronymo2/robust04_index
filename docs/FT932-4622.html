			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Ministers warned on Whitehall market testing MINISTERS have been warned that they could lose control of public expenditure if Civil Service financial management functions are contracted out to the private sector. Mr Syd Norris, principal finance officer at the Home Office, has told the Treasury that plans to contract out internal audit and accountancy services threaten to reduce 'control over the cost, content and quality' of Whitehall spending. Several departments are putting financial management functions out to tender as part of the government's market-testing programme launched last November. They include the Department of Social Security, which pays out Pounds 80bn a year in pensions and benefits, and Customs and Excise, which collects Pounds 70bn a year in indirect taxes. Mr Norris's warning comes amid signs that the government's market-testing programme has fallen several months behind schedule. Some of the delay has been blamed on Civil Service resistance to the proposed changes. Departmental accounting officers have (raised their concerns about the accountability of those who would handle public money following the Treasury's circulation of draft guidelines on contracting-out finance-related functions. The guidelines have been drawn up by Mr Tim Burr, Treasury Officer of Accounts, who is responsible for government accounting issues and relations with the powerful House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. One concern is whether departments can retain enough in-house expertise to act as an 'intelligent customer' and monitor performance. It will be hard for finance staff to carry out these roles if they no longer have day-to-day management experience, according to Mr Norris. In his submission to the Treasury, Mr Norris says that 'ensuring that the public funds . . . are well-managed and safeguarded should be easier to the extent that the accounting officer uses directly employed staff whom he can change at will'. Concern is also expressed over the Treasury's guidance that almost any financial management function can be contracted out. Mr Norris asks the Treasury to specify which skills need to be kept in-house 'to maintain risk at an acceptable level'. The government's market testing programme was due to have contracted out almost Pounds 1.5bn of work and the jobs of 44,000 civil servants by the end of September. One information technology company has reached the tender stage in only one of the six contracts for which it is bidding. A senior manager in the company says the remainder are unlikely to be completed before the end of the year and blames delays on civil service resistance to market-testing.</p>

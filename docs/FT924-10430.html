			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Tory motion placates rebels: Ashdown recommends support as government woos Euro-sceptics THE GOVERNMENT yesterday averted a confrontation with its own backbenchers by tabling a motion for Wednesday's Maastricht debate aimed at bringing Tory Euro-sceptics back to the loyalist fold. The move switched the political spotlight to the opposition parties amid reports that the Liberal Democrats were under fierce pressure from Labour and several of their own MPs to oppose the government. Late last night Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, acted to end speculation over his party's stance by announcing that he would be recommending support for the government to his parliamentary colleagues. 'The Liberal Democrats will vote in favour of Britain's future in Europe,' he said. However, Mr Ashdown's position is likely to come under fire at the party's Scottish conference today when delegates will debate an emergency motion urging the party to take any action necessary to bring down Mr John Major's government. Labour is also attempting to bring the maximum pressure to bear on the Liberal Democrats, warning that their credibility as an opposition party will be in tatters if they are seen to shore up Mr Major when he is critically vulnerable. The nationalist parties and the Ulster unionists have yet to state their positions, though most are expected to oppose the government. The government's motion, which avoids any use of the word Maastricht, is clearly intended to maximise the difficulties for Labour. It also makes it extremely hard for the 20 Liberal Democrat MPs to justify opposing Mr Major. Far from confronting the Conservative rebels, as had been widely expected, the wording emerges as a highly defensive case for resuming treaty ratification in parliament. The text reminds MPs that a 244 majority in May committed the Commons to proceed to the committee stage of the bill. It stresses Denmark's clarification of its intentions and progress on defining 'subsidiarity'. The motion underlines the importance of a 'leading role' for the UK in enlarging the Community and using membership to develop jobs and investment. It ends with an invitation to the government to proceed with the bill in order to 'consider its provisions in further detail'. The initial response of several Conservative Euro-sceptics was extremely cautious. While some diehards, such as Mr Richard Shepherd and Mrs Teresa Gorman, remain determined to vote against the government, other opponents of the treaty, such as Mr William Cash, were reserving their position last night. Their final stance looks likely to be settled at a meeting on Tuesday evening when they will attempt to agree a common approach. Speculation is mounting that they may opt to abstain rather than oppose the motion. Labour dismissed the motion as chiefly aimed at persuading the maximum number of Liberal Democrat MPs to back Mr John Major and 'save his bacon'. A senior Labour official said an amendment would be tabled next week with wording intended to appeal to Tory Euro-sceptics by putting back the committee stage until after the Edinburgh summit. At the same time, it would underline Labour's own argument that the debate constitutes a confidence vote in Mr Major and the government. Labour MPs are doggedly backing their leadership's line of outright opposition. But their stance provoked an attack from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who accused Mr John Smith of abandoning his principles and emulating Harold (now Lord) Wilson. 'We have a sort of Harold Smith in charge of the Labour party,' he told a BBC radio interviewer. Speaking in his Huntingdon constituency, Mr Major commended the motion as ensuring that Britain did not isolate itself from the European mainstream. He said that the Euro-sceptics 'don't represent the majority of the Conservative party and they don't represent the maj-ority of the people of this country'. Tory party officials are confident of winning the vote next week, but Mr Major plans to continue his battle for hearts and minds of backbenchers with further meetings.

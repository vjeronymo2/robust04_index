			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Fifth of companies 'expect to relocate': Survey shows Bristol, Edinburgh and Nottingham are favourites while London is placed 18th More than a fifth of UK companies expect to relocate in the next five years, with Bristol, Edinburgh and Nottingham the top three choices for businesses planning a move, says a survey published today. Wigan, Sunderland, Bradford, Liverpool and Belfast were the least popular of the 40 cities considered. London ranked 18th behind Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. The survey, by Black Horse Relocation, part of Lloyds Bank, and Management Today magazine, received responses from chairmen, chief executives and other senior directors of 536 companies. Ten companies had turnovers of more than Pounds 100m and four employed more than 5,000 staff. About 22 per cent said they were very likely or quite likely to relocate in the next five years. More than a third cited business expansion as the main reason for moving. The survey says: 'This was nearly twice as important as restructuring or reorganising businesses which was the next most popular reason, chosen by 16 per cent.' Mr John Carolan, managing director of Black Horse Relocation, said: 'This is a clear sign that the economy is recovering and is very encouraging for the future. Previously most companies have been moving because they have been cutting back or closing works.' Black Horse expects to move about 4,500 families this year on behalf of companies and public-sector organisations. The most important factors in choosing a business location, according to the survey, were: Quality of the local workforce (identified by 57 per cent of executives who responded in the survey). Quality of road communications (44 per cent). Cost of overheads, such as local authority rates (36 per cent). Also important were availability of local customers (23 per cent); property costs (21 per cent) and competitive wage rates (20 per cent). Executives were less concerned about access to London (6 per cent) and proximity to air and rail networks (5 per cent). Most important personal factors cited by executives included: overall quality of life (57 per cent); cost of living (30 per cent); crime rate (29 per cent); access to countryside (27 per cent); and the quality of local schools (26 per cent). Bristol was found to be the most attractive centre for business relocation, closely followed by Edinburgh and Nottingham. Norwich, Plymouth and Exeter were among those in the top 10.</p>

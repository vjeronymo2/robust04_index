			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey  Kokoshin is convinced that the Chinese market is lucrative for  Moscow and is ready "to consume Russian systems of armaments."  He told this to Interfax at the end of the talks he conducted  in Beijing as a member of a Russian Government delegation that  accompanied Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in his official visit to  China.    Kokoshin explained that the systems of arms available in  China today had been patterned on Soviet weapon designs.    He reported that a contract to sell 26 SU-27 war planes to  China was already being implemented. He described SU-27 as a  "good machine, which will apparently be in service until  2020-2025, under conditions of essential modernization." He  added that there were plans to equip this fighter plane with new  on-board arms.    He said that his negotiating partner in Beijing was General  Liu Huangquing, a vice-chairman of China's Central Military  Council. In Kokoshin's assessment, "military cooperation has  been going well with close contacts between border military  districts and extensive delegation exchanges." He revealed that  the Chinese defense minister is to visit Moscow soon. Chinese  servicemen are expected at Russian military academies, and  Russian Army officers are to undergo training in China.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saddam Re-Forms `Popular Army'"] </F>   [Excerpts] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraqi President  Saddam Husayn has ordered the re-formation of the so-called  "Popular Army," the ruling party's militia which Taha Yasin  Ramadan led and which was disbanded after the end of the war  with Iran. Elsewhere, Britain and France have warned Baghdad of  the consequences of the attacks carried out recently against UN  employees, correspondents, and foreign nationals in north Iraq.  [passage omitted]    Regarding reports about the re-formation of the Popular Army  in Iraq, Dr. Hamid al-Bayyati, representative of the Supreme  Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI], said that  Saddam has issued a decision to that effect, together with  instructions concerning the details and rules governing the  commanders and personnel of this army, which is tantamount to a  militia for the ruling party.    Dr. al-Bayyati's statement, issued by the SAIRI support  office in London, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has  received, said that the authorities have designated several  camps to train the battalions and brigades formed recently from  partisan elements, on whom Saddam's instructions "imposed  voluntary service," in Popular Army formations for six to 12  months.    The statement pointed out that discontent has spread among  ruling party elements. They expressed their discontent at  Saddam's decision, which they believe means that the country is  experiencing a serious political, military, and security crisis,  and that they should expect an important event as a result of  which they will become the victims of one of Saddam's whims  manifested in his internal and external wars.    Dr. al-Bayyati pointed out that the Iraqi regime disbanded  the Popular Army after the war with Iran because it had  represented a huge financial burden for the regime and an  administrative vacuum during the war. The statement added: It  is also worth mentioning that, because the regime has been  exposed to real dangers threatening its existence at this stage,  and for the sake of staying in power, it has taken new steps to  protect itself with more than one security cordon to allow it to  maneuver and unleash its military forces to carry out tasks that  are still shrouded in ambiguity and could be launched at any  moment.</p>

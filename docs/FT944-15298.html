			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Arts: A Romanian 'Nabucco' - Opera Worried that a visit to that new production at Covent Garden might turn out to be a nasty post-modern surprise? Just a short tube ride away on Monday one could see opera being performed as it used to be, most appropriately in London's museum quarter at South Kensington. For a single night the Romanian National Opera was in town. With three operas in hand, the company is at present touring Britain on what is an ambitious itinerary given the costs involved in taking an orchestra, chorus and soloists overseas. Audiences are said to have been disappointing in some venues but there were no worries in London: a well-filled Royal Albert Hall greeted their rare staged performance in Britain of Verdi's Nabucco. Like other countries in eastern Europe, Romania has opera productions that are so old-fashioned as almost to be authentically 'period'. It is safe to say that Nabucco in Verdi's day would have looked more like this dusty offering from the Old Testament than one of our fashionably updated productions set in the present-day Middle East against a background of armoured tanks and oil wells. There is nothing like a bit of cheap spectacle. Colour-coordinated costumes (ruby red for bloodthirsty soldiers, green for homesick prisoners) ensure that every crowd scene will be a gaudy feast for the eye. Final tableaux are a speciality: soloists and chorus are happy to stand stock-still singing away for hours, but in the closing minutes of each act everybody will make a dash to take up their positions. Some dancing helps, too. Few generals are as fortunate as this Nabucco, who arrived with an army of comely dancing girls, each clad in little more than a body stocking and a strategically-placed big red tassel. Altogether, it was a bit of a hoot, but in the Royal Albert Hall it will at least have come across as a visually bright production. The Romanian chorus and orchestra are on an average level with small equivalent companies in western Europe and the performance seemed well enough prepared, though the conductor Cornel Trailescu might have brought more intensity to the high points of the drama. For export, Romania's main hope is likely to be its singers. This cast included a moving Zaccaria in Pompei Harasteanu and a tenor with some inelegant heft for Ismaele in Mihai Munteanu. Nicolae Urdareanu (the one with the big putty nose) had enough voice for Nabucco, but proved shaky on style and intonation when required to sing a lyrical line. Melania Ghioalda sounded confident about tackling Abigaille, although she lacked vocal claws in this tigress of a role. Most impressive was the mezzo of Ecaterina Tutu: the role of Fenena did not give her much to sing, but we shall no doubt hear more of her in the future. Tour concludes in Canterbury, October 18-22</p>

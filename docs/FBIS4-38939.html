			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 2, BNS -- The most favored nation regime,  Russia reportedly introduced in trade with Latvia on June 1, is  a temporary development since Russia reserves the right to  cancel it any moment it wants to, Aivars Vovers, Latvian Foreign  Ministry deputy state secretary, told BNS Thursday.    The Russian Foreign Ministry informed the Latvian Embassy in  Moscow about the decision by a note, handed in on May 30.    The agreement on the most favored nation status between  Latvia and Russia is a positive factor for increasing the  competitiveness of Latvian products, officials said Wednesday.    The motion will increase the mutual goods turnover between  both countries. Export of goods to Russia was very  disadvantageous to Latvia after March 15 when Russia raised  import tariffs on a series of products.    Russia is still the largest Latvian trade partner. Export of  Latvian goods to Russia comprises 30 percent of its total export.    Russia also expressed a hope in the note that Latvia will  ratify the signed agreements on the Russian troop withdrawal and  the social rights of Russian military retirees and their  families in the near future, the Latvian Foreign Ministry  reported.</p>

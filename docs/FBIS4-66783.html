			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raju Santhanam: "A Dose Too Much of Raphel </F> Rhetoric"]    [Text] New Delhi, March 30--The success of Indian diplomacy  can hardly be measured in terms of how Miss Robin Raphel, the  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, was treated  during her visit to New Delhi or how a Prime Ministerial trip to  Washington has been cleared. The truth, however, is that the  Indian officials, who were given a dose of the Raphel rhetoric  in private, too, have realized that there is no dilution of her  views on the Indo-U.S. relations.    There are those who say that if Miss Raphel's statements are  examples of American muscle-flexing, India can hardly complain  that "pressure" was a new factor. While the Bush Administration  and some Republic Senators did condemn Pakistan's support to  terrorists there was no let-up on the pressure from the Bush  Administration on other pending issues whether it was signing of  the NPT or the rocket deal with Russia.    The difference now is the accent on human rights which is  being described as a personal goal for the U.S. President, Mr  Bill Clinton, and it is applicable for all countries.    China has been able to withstand pressures of losing out on  the most-favoured nation status. This is more because of  pressures from the U.S. business community which is worried  about a losing market. India has not attracted that kind of  investment so far.    The Americans have a reason to believe that pressure has  worked on Pakistan.    Internally it is being admitted in Pakistan that whatever  they may say in public both the Nawaz Sharif and the Benazir  Governments are prepared to give guarantees of "capping" the  nuclear programme. That America expects India to follow suit is  obvious.    Mandarins in South Block, at least those having a wrong  notion of how to keep the "flag flying," have tended to react  more to statements in public but have on the other hand kept  quiet during private discussions where the "squeeze" is put on.    The growing impression in the United States, according to  observers, is that India is keeping its domestic compulsions in  mind a factor that has been overstressed in talks with the U.S.  officials. At the same time the United States is gaining the  impression that the "pressure" is working. An evidence of it is  India agreeing to bilateral talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir  issue.    While one official cannot make or mar the relationship  between the two countries Miss Raphel is being singled out for  special mention because she is the only U.S. official publicly  stating the U.S. policy as it stands today and being well  qualified to do so.    But even Miss Raphel and others concerned with the South  Asian affairs would have been impressed by the way India was  making sure that Miss Raphel was not "slighted" during her brief  tour.    If Miss Raphel has left with the impression that the Rao  Government was more than eager to extend a warm welcome there is  a good reason for it.    It was the Prime Minister's Office which was arranging  various meetings. Meetings with senior officials in charge of  anti-insurgency operations in Kashmir and Punjab; with Mr S.B.  Chavan and Mr Rajesh Pilot, besides the Foreign Secretary and  the Joint Secretary were those that were officially arranged.    The suggestion that Washington was not averse to a Rao visit  appears to have been timed during Miss Raphel's visit. One view  is that the timing of the offer is the State Department's way of  showing that Miss Raphel does have the clout despite her  "junior" status. The implied message: She is not a loose cannon.    Several weeks ago after an exchange of rhetoric, it was  being  speculated that Mr Narasimha Rao would not be able to visit the  United States. Now his visit is a virtual certainty although it  is not expected to initiate any change in the U.S. position. In  fact the invitation itself suggests further discussions on the  NPT.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEARY'S DAUGHTER RULED UNFIT FOR TRIAL  </P> <P> A Pasadena Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that the daughter of 1960s LSD  guru Timothy Leary is mentally incompetent to stand trial in the attempted  murder of her live-in boyfriend.  </P> <P> Judge Terry Smerling ruled that Susan Martino, 41, also known as Susan Leary,  is incapable of understanding court proceedings and of assisting in her own  defense. Smerling ordered Martino transfered from the Sybil Brand Institute to  a state psychiatric treatment facility.  </P> <P> Martino, 41, is accused of shooting Joel Ruben Chavira, 38, in the back of the  head Dec. 18 as he slept in the Glendale apartment that they shared. The bullet  lodged in the base of Chavira's skull but was removed by surgeons with no  apparent complications.  </P> <P> At the brief hearing on Tuesday, Martino stood silently in jail garb with her  head down. Her attorney, public defender Jonathan Mendel, said Martino's father  calls frequently to discuss her condition.  </P> <P> Under Smerling's ruling, she will be evaluated by a physician within 90 days of  her commitment. The physician can recommend that she remain confined or that  she be ordered to stand trial.  </P></p>

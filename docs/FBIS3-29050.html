The North Korean Christian Federation, in a message sent via  facsimile on 14 February, said: "The civilian-level exchange  between the North and South has hit the wall since the South  Korean authorities, under the pretext of the nuclear issue, held  off our delegation from attending the funeral service for Rev.  Mun Ik-hwan," adding, "It is regrettable that we are not able to  send the delegation to the general meeting."</p>

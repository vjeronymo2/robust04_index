			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Ireland suffers on two fronts IRELAND'S industrial and farming sectors are suffering the double bind of high interest rates and a poor exchange rate for exporters. About 31 per cent of Ireland's exports go to the UK, and around 42 per cent of its imports are sourced there. So while the Irish government is battling to maintain the punt inside the ERM, the currency's value against sterling is undermining the country's exports. Sterling's devaluation against the punt is also hitting manufacturers in the domestic market as British exporters seek new opportunities in Ireland. Yesterday sterling fell to an unprecedented 1.055 to the punt. Most analysts consider that a 1.05 sterling/punt exchange rate is the maximum the economy can withstand without serious disruption, although most also believe the government will try to tough it out even if sterling drops as far 1.10. Since sterling abandoned the ERM, Dublin has said it is determined to defend the punt and keep it within the ERM. Base rates rose last Monday by 3 percentage points, putting increased pressure on profit margins of farmers and manufacturers, and upon household budgets as mortgage rates also went up. The government says it believes these measures will be temporary. According to Mr Colum MacDonnell, chief executive of the Irish Exporters' Association, 'it is a pretty disastrous situation for those who sell most of their produce to the UK and who source their raw materials in Ireland'. The worst-hit industries are mostly indigenous Irish companies, concentrated in the food, textiles and consumer products sectors. 'For them the UK is a price sensitive market, where margins have been eroded by very competent and competitive buyers. Although Irish market share has increased over the past 4-5 years, margins are now very slim.' The food industry works on profit margins of between 3 and 8 per cent, he said, 'so the 12.5 per cent price change we have seen in the past 10 days, and then the interest rate increase of 3 percentage points, is creating a hopeless situation for many companies'. More than a third of his association's members 'are now facing serious problems'. Large retailers in Ireland are cutting prices. Mr Feargal Quinn, chief executive of Superquinn supermarkets, one of the four biggest retail chains, with an annual turnover of some IPounds 200m, said: 'We have made substantial price cuts of around 5 per cent on a wide range of products we are buying from the UK.' In the agriculture sector, sheep, pork and mushroom producers face financial ruin. Mr John Elmore, a spokesmen for Ireland's 52,000 sheep farmers said: 'Even before the devaluation it was already difficult to compete. 'Prices at 78p per pound have been at their lowest ever since before joining the common market, and now we have seen a further 10p per pound fall, and sterling is still going down.'</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler leads effort to hold Newbury for Conservatives THE Conservatives yesterday fired their opening shots in the Newbury by-election campaign with a concerted attack on the Liberal Democrats' record as 'natural allies' of the Labour party. Underlining a key theme of its efforts to hold Newbury, Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, produced a list of examples where Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats were consistent supporters of minority Labour councils. He cited seven councils in which the two opposition parties had combined to share power. Linking the by-election with the county council elections which are being held simultaneously on May 6, Sir Norman said a vote for the Liberal Democrats was one not for a 'lighter shade of blue' but for a 'deeper shade of red'. As Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat challenger, started his campaign in the once-safe Tory seat, Sir Norman made it clear that the Conservative strategy was to convince voters in both sets of elections that two main opposition parties were indistinguishable. The party chairman also signalled that the government's claims that economic recovery was under way were likely to grow stronger and louder as the campaign progressed. That strategy was echoed by Mr Julian Davidson, the Conservative candidate, in a speech last night arguing that Newbury was 'uniquely placed' to profit from the move out of recession. But the Liberal Democrats produced a Tory party document pointing out the growing threat that the Liberal Democrats posed to the government.</p>

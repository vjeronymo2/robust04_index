			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have received a statement from the press service  of the permanent representation of Ingushetia under the Russian  president. It says that one month has elapsed since the Russian  president signed the edict on the procedure of returning  refugees and forced migrants to their permanent places of  residence on the territories of the Republics of North Ossetia  and Ingushetia.    According to this edict, the first stage of the return of  deported Ingush citizens to their permanent places of residence  was due to begin last December. However, the Russian  president's edict has not been implemented. The statement says  that leaders of the Republic of Ingushetia have often expressed  their readiness to sit down at the negotiating table with  leaders of North Ossetia. However, the latter have a negative  attitude to such statements. The statement also says that those  who hamper the implementation of the Russian president's edict  will bear full responsibility for the potential consequences of  such a policy. This statement is signed by Ingushetia's  President Ruslan Aushev.</p>

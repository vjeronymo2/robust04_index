			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Nigeria poised for general strike today A Nigerian court trying presidential claimant Moshood Abiola for treason in Abuja adjourned until today, when a nationwide general strike is due to start if he is not freed, Reuter reports from Abuja. The embattled military government yesterday appealed to workers not to join the general strike, saying that a meeting was scheduled with the umbrella Nigeria Labour Congress tomorrow to discuss workers' grievances. The NLC has directed all its 3.5m members to begin a strike from today if Mr Abiola is not released. Mr Abiola, who is widely considered the winner of last year's annulled presidential election, is on trial in Abuja for treason for proclaiming himself president. The case resumed yesterday but was adjourned when the prosecutor could not reply to the defence motion to strike out the case and discharge him Oil unions, which are on strike in an attempt to end military rule and secure Mr Abiola's release, said the adjournment would not help matters. There was strong speculation that a meeting between General Sani Abacha, the military ruler, and leaders of the armed forces on Monday had decided to free Mr Abiola unconditionally to ease tension. It had been suggested all charges would be dropped during yesterday's court hearing. Mr Abiola's lawyers argued that the Abuja court had no jurisdiction to try an offence allegedly committed in Lagos. Mr Abiola told the judge he was still being denied access to newspapers and radio. 'They lock me up unless I have a visitor. That is only when I am allowed out,' he said. The area around the court was under tight security and hundreds of people were barred from entering. Oil industry unions said that freeing Mr Abiola would not be enough to send them back to work. 'He must be sworn in because he won the election,' said Mr Wariebe Agamene, president of Nupeng, the blue-collar union. 'Release itself will not be enough. The aim is to restore democracy now,' said Mr Bola Owodunni, president of Pengassan. Ina joint statement, the two unions said: 'We wish to stress categorically that we remain unimpressed by the play of the government to reduce our demands to the simplistic one of the release of Abiola and other political detainees.' The unions 'insist on the immediate withdrawal of the military from politics and the handing over of government to the democratically elected president'. Their strike has paralysed the nation by disrupting fuel deliveries. Banks and most other businesses have shut as a result. Further disruption is certain to result if the Nigeria Labour Congress joins the strike as hospitals, power and water will be affected. Meanwhile, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria said it had advised the government against using troops to back oil companies operating under threat from striking oil unions.</p>

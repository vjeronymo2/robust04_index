			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Chieftain incurs Pounds 285,000 deficit In line with its forecast at the interim stage, Chieftain, the USM-quoted specialist insulation and fireproofing company, finished the year to end-December in the red. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 285,000 compared with a profit of Pounds 396,000 last time, but represents a small improvement on the loss of Pounds 481,000 reported at the interim stage. The first-half result had been hit by a Pounds 995,000 exceptional charge for two branch closures and provisions for the full effect of the receivership of Swan Hunter, one of its main clients. Mr Peter Wardle, chairman, said that in common with most other companies in the building and construction sectors, Chieftain had suffered from the severe and prolonged recession. Turnover for the year fell from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 12.6m, however, at the trading level, profits were slightly up at Pounds 623,000 (Pounds 613,000). Losses per share emerged at 3.33p (4.36p earnings) and the final dividend is reduced by 1p to 2p, making 3.5p (5.1p) for the year. Despite the difficulties during the period, the group ended the year with no borrowings, a cash balance of about Pounds 1m and a firm order book of Pounds 7m, Mr Wardle said. Since the year end the acquisition of Blackett Charlton had been concluded at a purchase price of Pounds 25,000, he added.</p>

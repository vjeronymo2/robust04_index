			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Excerpt] Ruling and opposition parties, in the final  stage of their battle over a package of political reform bills,  have agreed to set up a joint committee of both houses of the  Diet to hammer out a compromise plan. However, some members of  the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the ruling Social  Democratic Party of Japan are increasingly taking the view that  reform of the current electoral system should be deferred until  later, and it remains unclear whether the joint committee will  hammer out the compromise plan. With the current Diet session  set to close soon, the tense situation is continuing. [passage  omitted on ruling and opposition parties' discussing the makeup  of the committee at a lower house steering committee].</p>

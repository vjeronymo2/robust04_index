			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> PROVOCATIVE CALL TO ARMS ON GAY RIGHTS  </P> <P> After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear &amp; Hatred of Gays in the  '90s by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen (Doubleday: $19.95).  </P> <P> One out of 10 Americans is gay, according to Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen in  "After the Ball," and these 25 million men and women are "forced to cower and  skulk like a German Jew of the '30s." They are the victims of "a national  sickness" that manifests itself in the fear and hatred of homosexuality. The  only appropriate response from the gay community -- and the only way to put an  end to their oppression -- is "ice-cold, controlled, directed rage."  </P> <P> But "After the Ball" is not a call to the barricades; rather, it is a curious  call to the story boards and 30-second spots of Madison Avenue, a kind of  sanitized upscale media radicalism that finds mass demonstrations to be  "ghastly freak shows" and prefers highway billboards that "earnestly propound  appealing truisms, the safer and more platitudinous, the better." As the  authors readily admit: "We're talking about propaganda."  </P> <P> "After the Ball" is a stubbornly revisionist critique of the conventional  wisdom of gay activism over the last two decades ("The gay revolution has  failed," the authors announce at the very outset); a study of the origins and  workings of contemporary attitudes toward gay men and women; and, above all, "a  practical agenda for bringing to a close, at long last, the seemingly permanent  crisis of American homosexuality."  </P> <P> The book opens with a wide-ranging and penetrating survey of what the authors  call "homochondria" and "homo-hatred," ranging from coarse back-room bigotry to  the veiled slander of television advertising. But the essential message of the  book is an urgent demand for a fundamental change in the very nature of gay  activism. The gay community, Kirk and Madsen argue, has resorted to the wrong  arguments, the wrong symbols, and the wrong acts of protest. And the authors of  "After the Ball' think that they have a better idea.  </P> <P> "We're assumed to consist entirely of extreme stereotypes: men ultra swishy and  ultraviolet, Frankensteinian thug-women with bolts on their necks, mustachio'd  Dolly Parton wanna-bes, leather-men in boots and whips, ombudsmen of pederasty  squiring their ombudsboys -- all ridiculous, deranged, or criminal," the  authors write. "And when we are finally allowed to rally and march, to lay our  case before the cameras of the straight American public, what do we do? We call  out of the woodwork as our ambassadors of bad will all the screamers, stompers,  gender-benders, sadomasochists, and pederasts, and confirm America's worst  fears and hates. You can call it gay liberation if you like: we say it's  spinach, and we say the hell with it!"  </P> <P> Instead, they have devised a program of gay advocacy based on media-wise  techniques of image manipulation: "A continuous flood of gay-related  advertising" that will depict gays "in the least offensive fashion possible"  while making "homo-hating beliefs and actions look so nasty that average  Americans will want to dissociate themselves from them." This is pure  propaganda, of course, but it is propaganda on the highest levels of insight  and calculation.  </P> <P> "We have in mind a strategy as calculated and powerful as that which gays are  accused of pursuing by their enemies -- or, if you prefer, a plan as  manipulative as that which our enemies themselves employ," Kirk and Madsen  declare. "It's time to learn from Madison Avenue, to roll out the big guns."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changed Behavior  </P> <P> To their credit, Kirk and Madsen do not make the mistake of piling all of their  expectations on "image-management techniques." They also call for changes in  what they frankly characterize as the "misbehavior" -- sexual and otherwise --  of the gay community. "Straights hate gays not just for what their myths and  lies say we are, but also for what we really are," the authors write. "All the  squeaky-clean media propaganda in the world won't sustain a positive image in  the long unless we start scrubbing to make ourselves a little squeakier and  cleaner in reality. And, as it happens, our noses (and other parts) are far  from clean."  </P> <P> I don't think Kirk or Madsen would disagree with my observation that "After the  Ball" is an uncomfortable book -- their self-proclaimed mission is to shock and  provoke their readers, whether gay or straight. But it's also true that their  ideas are so lively and provocative, their language so rich and spirited, that  I came to admire and enjoy "After the Ball" even in its moments of rhetorical  excess. (And, if I may say so, the graphic design of the book, credited to  Carol Malcolm, is as elegant, handsome and functional as any I've seen.)  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 12 Apr (INA) -- Tariq 'Aziz, official in  charge of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party, today received Naji 'Allush, secretary general of  the Arab Popular Liberation Movement.    Tariq 'Aziz stressed Iraq's adherence to pan-Arab principles  and convictions. He said the steadfastness of the Iraqis has  foiled all of the wagers of hostile powers. These powers sought  to undermine Iraq and harm its people through their aggression,  plots, and unjust blockade. 'Aziz added: We are confident that  the next stage will be in the interest of nationalist and  pan-Arab forces in the region.    Naji 'Allush paid tribute to the steadfastness and position  of the Iraqis in the face of the aggression and the crime of the  blockade. He asserted that Iraq is the hope of the Arab nation,  the base of steadfastness, and a symbol of awakening and  progress.    The meeting was attended by comrade Sa'd Qasim Hammudi,  member of the Foreign Relations Bureau and secretary general of  the Arab Popular Conference, and Salah Khalil, member of the  Executive Committee of the Arab Popular Liberation Movement.</p>

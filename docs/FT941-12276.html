			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Strategy Morgan Stanley's Barton Biggs notes in his latest comment on trends in emerging markets that he considers 1994 should see a significant shift in investor attitude. 'I think getting the country decision right will be much more important . . . in 1993 if you caught the re-rating of one region, Asia, you didn't have to worry much about countries, groups or stocks. I think it's going to be much more challenging in 1994'. The Emerging Markets Traders Association has elected Mr Alexis Rodzianko, managing director at Chemical Bank, as chairman for 1994. Latin America With worries that a severe correction is imminent among Asia's equity markets, Kleinwort Benson's Latin American team, headed by Roger Palmer, is claiming that the region is less exposed 'to any bursting of the liquidity bubble'. This view is based on the fact that the Asian markets have been driven ever higher by a wash of foreign, notably US, money, while the same funds' exposure to Latin America has been small. Therefore, when US interest rates finally rise, the argument goes, Latin America should be immune to the fall-out. Poland Argument and counter-argument continue to swirl around the equity market after last week's listing of Bank Slaski. On the first day of trading the shares rocketed 1,250 per cent from the offer price of 500,000 zlotys (Dollars 23). Now many are saying that the price was too low, while the securities commission is investigating the delay in processing applications, which has left some unable to trade shares on the exchange. On Friday the government minister responsible for privatising the country's banking sector was sacked. Indonesia The government is considering privatising some state-owned companies on foreign stock exchanges, although this is unlikely to include Garuda Indonesia, the state airline, for the time being. Fund growth Emerging market funds could double in 1994, following rapid growth in the last few years, Peter Jeffreys of Fund Research told a conference in London last week. The number of funds has risen from 65 in 1990 to 525 in 1994, he said, with 467 being equity funds with the remaining debt funds. Some Dollars 120bn has been invested over the last decade, with more than 50 per cent of that total coming in 1993, he added. Brazil Smith Barney Shearson is understood to have raised its weighting of Brazilian equities in its model Latin American portfolio from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. 'The economic and political outlook for Brazil shows signs of improving more rapidly than we had originally anticipated,' the broker said. It recommended buying on the market's recent weakness, which it said was due to profit-taking after a strong recent rally.

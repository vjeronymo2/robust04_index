			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> STANISLAUS NATIONAL FOREST;  </P> <P> MARIJUANA HELD AS EVIDENCE IS STOLEN  </P> <P> More than 120 pounds of marijuana -- evidence in the trial of a Los Altos man  -- has been stolen from a locked storage shed at a ranger station in the  Stanislaus National Forest. A U.S. Forest Service spokesman said that the  plants have a street value of almost $225,000 and that the FBI has been called  into the investigation. The marijuana was being held as evidence against  Jeffrey Peter Gurney, 37. Officials said the theft will not affect the case  because prosecutors have a sample of the marijuana and other evidence.  </P></p>

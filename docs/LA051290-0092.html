A palace communique said the seven-member commission will draft a  constitution with recommendations "to strengthen constitutional monarchy and  multi-party democracy." The panel was a major goal of Prime Minister Krishna  Prasad Bhattarai, whose Nepali Congress Party had vowed to return to an  opposition force if the king did not share his power.  </P></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Saddam back to centre stage: Iraq's leader is the focus of world attention. But he may have made a serious misjudgement For more than a decade President Saddam Hussein has developed and practised his own personal formula for political survival. Its twin pillars are the ruthless suppression of domestic opposition and the effective manipulation of self-created external threats. As the Iraqi leader has stumbled from one calamitous misjudgement to the next, those two policy elements have become ever more critical to his survival. And both have been, and still are being exercised without regard to world opinion or changing international circumstances. Mr Saddam's renewed military threat to Kuwait fits neatly into the pattern that has evolved since Iraq embarked on its eight-year war with Iran in 1980. After modest initial successes, the war with Iran turned into a disaster, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and almost bankrupting a once relatively prosperous economy. But the national struggle for survival against the radical Islamic threat from Iran helped to deflect blame being attached to Mr Saddam. And far from being subdued by the tough economic consequences created by the war with Iran, Mr Saddam sought to recoup by invading Kuwait. Again he massively misjudged, with yet more serious consequences for the people of Iraq. But the western allies stood by as he snuffed out a rebellion in the south and only belatedly prevented similar action being taken against the Kurds in the north. Those twin threats to the national authority of Baghdad helped rally support for Mr Saddam from his main constituency in the central part of Iraq and part-icularly around his home town of Takrit. However the Iraqi leader has been unable to escape from the impact of UN sanctions, imposed in 1990. Mr Saddam's immediate clique may still be living well, but his grudging compliance with UN Security Council resolutions dealing with the destruction and monitoring of weapons of mass destruction underlines just how anxious he is to see sanctions lifted. Recent statements from senior US officials, largely supported by Britain, show equally just how far Mr Saddam has still to go before they will support any such moves on sanctions. The US administration believes that Iraq is still hiding Scud missiles and facilities for producing biological weapons, and cites its unwillingness to recognise Kuwait's UN-designated international border as further evidence of the regime's undiminished regional ambitions. In short, sanctions on Iraq will remain for the foreseeable future. Mr Saddam is thus left with the one option he is most practised at exercising: the threat of military force. But it is a threat that is in every sense much less potent than it was four years ago. Militarily Iraq has been greatly weakened, if not in manpower then certainly in terms of equipment, spares and ammunition. The international alliance created to launch Operation Desert Storm in January 1991 is still broadly in place and militarily will benefit from pre-positioned equipment in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Mr Saddam might have had some excuse for failing to gauge international reaction correctly in 1990. The Soviet Union had crumbled, but the whole-hearted Russian support for the allied action in defence of Kuwait was not entirely predictable. In 1990, the Arab-Israeli conflict did not look susceptible to resolution, and there were other Middle Eastern regimes and their populations attracted by the possibility of indirectly attacking US and Israeli interests in the region. Just how much this situation has changed can be seen from the stances of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and of Jordan. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, gave initial support for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and King Hussein was the most vigorous proponent of a negotiated settlement with the Iraqi regime. Today both men are locked into a peace process with Israel and both are welcome guests in the White House. Neither will easily sacrifice that, and initial reports suggest that they are under no domestic pressure to do so. Elsewhere in the Middle East, the realities of US diplomatic and military dominance, coupled with the possibility of a durable peace with Israel, have encouraged similar policy shifts. Tunisia and Morocco, where support for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was evident among sections of the public, are on the road to establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel. The six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) have begun to dismantle the Arab boycott. Yemen, which was also sympathetic to Mr Saddam, has been further weakened by civil war, while Sudan is an irritant limited to marginal involvement in Islamic extremism. Meanwhile the stance of those Arab countries which supported the western-led alliance in 1990 appears to be largely unchanged, and perhaps even more solidly supportive. Syria, under president Hafez al-Assad, says that it has made a strategic commitment to seek peace with Israel and has not softened its long-standing hostility to the Iraqi regime. Egypt's consistency remains unwavering, while the GCC states are predictably united in their determination to do whatever is necessary to beat off any fresh threat from Iraq. There may even be benefits for the region's main oil producers from Mr Saddam's latest threat of military action. The possibility of Iraq being allowed to resume exports was one of the main causes of the weakness in the oil price, especially earlier this year. With Saudi Arabia and Kuwait both running substantial budget deficits and committed to ambitious spending plans, a sustained weakness in the price of oil indicated difficult political decisions in the years ahead. The maintenance of UN sanctions against Iraq will not remove the need for those structural adjustments, but a firmer oil price should help to ease immediate budget pressures. This, in turn, will help to ensure that Saudi Arabia in particular can finance its substantial military and civil airliner procurement programmes. Against that must be set the costs of a new military build-up in the Gulf. The US is likely to require a contribution from its regional allies whose ability to pay has been sharply reduced by the 1990-91 conflict. Saudi Arabia estimated that the Gulf war cost it some Dollars 60bn, or virtually its entire available reserves, which it has had no opportunity to replenish. Whether any of these considerations impinge on Mr Saddam's decision-making process is virtually impossible to know. By moving troops close to the border with Kuwait, the Iraqi leader has already cut the ground from under the feet of governments which would have liked to soften the hardline US policy towards the containment of the Iraqi regime. France and Russia in particular had seen merit in offering the prospect of easing sanctions as a result of Iraqi compliance with the monitoring of weapons production. Indications that Mr Saddam may be pulling back from the brink emerged last night when Mr Hamed Youssef Hummadi, the Iraqi minister of information, claimed that 'not one unit' had been moved and suggested that talk of a build-up of troops was a 'total fabrication by the US'. Mr Saddam has several times in the past purged incipient rebellions with his officer corps, but even his iron political control of the army might be tested by a decision to order troops into a certain repeat of the Desert Storm experience. The Iraqi leader's next move will depend largely on how fragile he believes his domestic position to be. He may calculate that he has lost nothing by provoking an international crisis, because sanctions were not going to be lifted anyway. At the same time, Mr Saddam is back at the centre of world attention where he most wishes to be. That might be enough for the time being. But President Clinton and his allies are wise to prepare for the possibility of military action. Mr Saddam was a dangerous political animal when at least some of the chips were stacked in his favour. He is unlikely to be less dangerous now that he feels he has little more to lose.</p>

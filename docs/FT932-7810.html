			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / ScottishPower beats forecast for full-year result SCOTTISHPOWER launched the electricity results season yesterday with better than expected profits, but a dividend that fell slightly below forecasts. The Glasgow-based company, which engages in electricity generation as well as distribution, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 297m in the year ending March 31, an increase of 14 per cent. Analysts had been expecting a figure around Pounds 290m. The shares gained 5p to 315p. The result included a Pounds 23m reorganisation provision offset by a Pounds 9.7m credit for a reassessment of energy losses in the system. There was also a net interest charge of Pounds 9m and a Pounds 10.4m net premium charge on redemptions of government debt. The board is recommending a final dividend of 7.43p, bringing the total for the year to 11.15p, an increase of 10.1 per cent. The board said this was in line with a policy of providing sustained real dividend growth, but dividend cover was maintained at 2.5 times. Mr Murray Stuart, the chairman, described the past year as 'extremely active and successful'. The main source of revenue was the company's home market where sales reached Pounds 1.2bn, up 5.7 per cent. The rise came both from a price increase and higher volumes due to the poor weather. Exports to England rose 3.1 per cent to Pounds 73m. These are expected to show further increases as the capacity of the cross-border interconnector is raised. Turnover in the appliance retailing business rose 37 per cent to Pounds 90m, producing a profit of Pounds 4.5m, up from Pounds 1.8m the year before. ScottishPower's profits were boosted by further reductions in costs, particularly manpower. Staff numbers have fallen by more than 1,400 to 8,038 in the two years since privatisation, contributing to a 49 per cent increase in operating profit per employee to Pounds 41,000 over the period. Strong cash flow permitted repayment of Pounds 142m of high- interest government debt which should provide significant savings until the year 2005, though new accounting rules obliged a write-off of the Pounds 10.4m premium paid. This reduced gearing from 17.7 per cent to 12.2 per cent. Lex, Page 22</p>

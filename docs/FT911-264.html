			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Off-Met opera, New York The New York conservatories provide some of the city's happiest operatic adventures. At the Mannes School, we have had Gluck's Paride ed Elena in an enchanting performance. Paride was the third, and is the most beautiful, of the three reform operas that Gluck and Calzabigi wrote for Vienna. And unlike Orfeo and Alceste it was not revised and commercialised for Paris. In these pages 28 years ago, I wrote with rapture of a Royal Manchester College production with Ryland Davies and Anne Howells among the student performers. If Paride has not captured the world's smaller stages, it may be because its cast is five sopranos (Davies sang Paris an octave down), or because its five acts trace but a single action, Helen's surrender to Paris's wooing. But they trace it with such psychological subtleties  - the letters in Ovid's Heroides are the source of the libretto - and with such musical beauty that listeners remain spellbound. Paris lands in Sparta as a playboy, but falls deeply and truly in love. Like Orfeo, Paride is at once an opera about and a demonstration of music's power to touch the heart. The long, harp-accompanied aria that Paris sings in Act 3, hypnotically beautiful, begins the conquest of Helen's scruples; by Act 5, although Pallas Athene warns the lovers that dreadful, destructive war attends the surrender of reason and decency to emotion, and although they understand the warning, erotic force proves irresistible. The opera, despite its bright C-major ending, is a tragedy, both stirring and profound. The score was given uncut (for the first time since 1770?). The performance, in the salon of the Mannes School - once a convent refectory - was unstaged (no decor, no dancers) but was enacted. It had been prepared and was conducted by Will Crutchfield, who had worked long with his student singers, inspiring them with a feeling for words, tone, sense, and style that made the performance moving and memorable. The Gluckian miracle of poise and formality united with keen, direct emotional expression was achieved. Natalie Arduino was Paris, Laura Danehower was Helen, and Elizabeth Wiley was Cupid. The opera was sung in Italian. The Juilliard Opera Center gave us a Verdi Falstaff, conducted by Julius Rudel, that was not intolerable but had nothing special to offer. The Juilliard drama students put on a happy Happy End that was exciting from start to finish. The Salvation Army libretto - lyrics by Brecht, 'book' by Elisabeth Hauptmann, English adaptation by Michael Feingold - may be ramshackle, but Weill's songs are stunning and stirring. And the drama students, produced by Moni Yakim, put the piece across with irresistible verse and adresse. It was an athletic, very 'physical' production. I hope the Falstaff cast - singing dummies, most of them - saw it, and resolved to 'register' for the instruction in 'body communication' and in getting words across. Deborah Lapidus conducted. At the Fashion Institute of Technology, Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods was revived. The FIT institutional auditorium is a drear place. Into the Woods has its points, but it is a feeble score, and at FIT patchy, murky, word-killing amplification of the singers, and coarse balance between the orchestra and the stage, obscured the wit of the words and dulled the zest of the young performers. Amplification, like surtitling, is evidently here to stay, but let it be technically competent. Let two other productions, not student, round off the picture of off-Met New York opera. L'Opera Francais de New York offered a delectable double bill in Florence Gould Hall - an elegant little theatre tucked deep beneath a commercial building on Madison Avenue. They were Gretry's Les Deux Avares and Bizet's Le Docteur Miracle. The Gretry is OK; the Bizet - London first saw it in the theatre of Londonderry House, now demolished, with an unforgettable performance by Johanna Peters - is a miniature masterpiece. Yves Abel conducted it as such, and Sharon Azraeli was a winning heroine. These were concert performances, but a staged Iphigenie en Tauride is promised next. Amato Opera plays in a down-town garage converted into a cosy little gem of a tiny opera house where everything tells. Here many singers now famous - Mignon Dunn, George Shirley, Neil Shicoff  - made early appearances. And here Verdi's I due Foscari has been playing - for eight performances, each of them with a different cast. Anthony Amato, the conductor and producer of the enterprise, is an instinctual genius, a born interpreter of 19th-century Italian opera. He gets the tempi, the rubato and the accommodations to the strengths and the failings of the particular singers exactly right. He should surely be conducting at the Met. And in Richard Cerullo he has a designer who works wonders on a shoestring and clothes 19th-century operas in apt, attractive scenery. The Due Foscari I heard was not well sung; I doubt whether any of its performers will go on to achieve Met fame. But it was sung with a communicativeness that brought the opera to life. (Whereas in grander, more pretentious performances in huge houses operas often die.) A skeleton representation of Verdi's orchestra - piano filling in what was missing - played the score. But the clarinet was eloquent, and the music came across and told, keenly.</p>

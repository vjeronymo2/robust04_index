He has allowed himself six months before taking  action, and between 18 and 24 months to straighten out the  enterprise. Jean-Marie Decarpentries, a raider in the view of  those employees who have met him, has won over clients and  collaborators, impressed by his charisma, almost despite  themselves. "He is the president who perhaps can save Bull,"  says Jean-Pierre Muller, president of the Cube, the club of Bull  users.    Jean-Marie Descarpentries's has set out decisively on the  road toward his goal, which is: To recover operational  equilibrium by the end of 1994 instead of in 1995 as had been  planned by his predecessor, Bernard Pache. To this end, he has  organized two think-tank committees, one of them dedicated to  persons and jobs, and the other to the profitability of  activities. "The sectors that are unprofitable, I shall  liquidate," he has warned. Bull's new CEO has chosen his model:  Hewlett-Packard, which has one of the industry's best  productivity-per-employee ratios, and is one of the sector's  only manufacturers to be making money. A plan of action is  expected to be submitted to the group's executive committee by  the end of the month. The committee could revise the plan at  that session. The plan will call for a strengthening of ties  with the company's shareholder NEC. Jean-Marie Descarpentries  visited Japan this week. The object of the maneuver: Augment the  synergy between the two manufacturers, share the production of  components, and increase the compatibility of the operating  softwares of big mainframe systems. Cooperation may also be  under consideration in the field of portables, inasmuch as NEC,  as a supplier of screens and microcomputers, is seeking to  emerge from its domestic market. For the moment, Bull will  settle its debts, which are to reduced from 9.4 billion francs  [Fr] to Fr2.4 billion, through a compression of its capital.  This operation will be ratified by a general meeting of its  stockholders, scheduled for mid-December. The credit for this  operation goes to Bernard Pache, who planned it... Jean-Marie  Descarpentries, who has been given the task of imparting new  sheen to Bull's tarnished image, stands to gain from the  heritage left to him by his predecessor. After rendering an  elaborate homage to Bernard Pache, Descarpentries asserted that  he has no intention of changing his decisions.</p>

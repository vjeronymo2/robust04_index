			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] FRY President Lilic held a news conference for  foreign journalists in the International Press Center in  Belgrade at noon today. Without Yugoslavia's stabilization  there is no stabilization in the Balkans and beyond, he said. He  resolutely denied any link between the Air Force of the Yugoslav  Army and yesterday's incident in Bosnian skies. Here is a  report by Slobodan Jankovic:    [Begin recording] [Jankovic] Before about 100 foreign  correspondents, President Lilic first presented a basic layout  of the FRY policy regarding the crisis in the Balkans.  Afterwards, he answered a dozen questions.    Speaking about the most important pillars of our policy,  Zoran Lilic said the following:    [Lilic] The consistent policy of the FRY has, all the time,  and is still based on two key aims. The first is a political  aim and it consists of the maximum effort for the FRY to make  its full contribution to establish peace. These are the  activities that we have been carrying out continuously since the  breakout of the crisis on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. The second aim is the economic one: Regardless of  the drastic situation in the region, our country is going to  stabilize its economy through (?real) deep structural changes in  the monetary sphere, managing capital, mobilizing (?idle)  capacities through the share-holding system, and, certainly, the  functioning of the market of capital, and the reform of the  taxation system. The economic program that began to be  implemented on 24 January has as its aim realization of these  very changes and it is evident that it has yielded good initial  results. You know very well that inflation, or to put it better,  hyperinflation was over 300 million percent, only to be reduced  to about 1 percent during February and this is that right road  that we are going to go along toward the (?stabilization) of our  economy. Finally, it is logical to expect that everything that  the FRY has done on the plane of stabilizing the situation in  these regions, complying to everything that was demanded from it  through the UN Security Council resolutions, as well as all the  measures undertaken at the moment in the economic sphere, should  now make the international community change its attitude toward  us, whereby a recovery of the FRY and a peaceful future for the  generations that have been unjustly put in the situation of  living in isolation and under pressure would be made possible.  I am convinced that only an economically recovered Yugoslavia  can be of use to Europe and the world in general, because,  without a stable Yugoslavia, I am deeply convinced there can be  no stability in the Balkans or in the broader territories around  us.    [Jankovic] In reply to the question by a correspondent of  the Chinese agency about yesterday's incident in the Bosnian  skies, President Lilic said the following:    [Lilic] I am convinced that you know of the announcement  that was issued by the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army. I,  as a supreme commander of the Yugoslav Army, can only confirm  that, for a full two years, that is, since the constitution of  the FRY, not a single aircraft has taken off from the territory  of the FRY and flown to the region of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    What I would like to say is that I personally condemn any  gesture that leads to an escalation of the conflict and any use  of force by any side. This is only one more argument that  negotiations need be accelerated and that we need peace and not  war. It is obvious that there are people who want to provoke a  continuation of war and new clashes on the territory of the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina. I can say with certainty that there  have not been, and will not be, any such provocations. Our only  task and aim is to continue the policy we have been leading.    [Jankovic] Correspondents of foreign media in Belgrade have  asked the FRY president about Belgrade's assessments of the war  in Bosnia, unification with the Serbian Republic and the  Republic of Serbian Krajina, as well as about relations with the  former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].

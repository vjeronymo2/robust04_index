			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ramus announces capital subscription Ramus Holdings, the manufacturer of ceramic tiles, kitchens and bedroom furniture, announced yesterday that an overseas investor had agreed to subscribe Pounds 3.25m cash for new shares in Ramus. The talks were originally mentioned on September 16 when the shares were suspended at 51p at the company's request, pending clarification of its financial position. Ramus warned then that results for the year to end-June would give rise to a substantial loss. Yesterday's agreement is subject to the relevant exchange control consent.</p>

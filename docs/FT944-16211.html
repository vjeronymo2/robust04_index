			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Positive tradition perverted by corruption Sir, Michael Holman's incisive piece on global corruption and the work of Transparency International (Survey of World Economy and Finance, September 30) is wholly commendable. So, too, is Peter Norman's comment ('IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Lesson in north-south row', October 5) that industrialised countries must respond to the growing economic importance of developing countries as these become increasingly integrated in the world economy; that 'ideological differences' that used to divide north and south have largely disappeared. There is one particular 'ideological difference' that needs a much better appreciation - the myth in the north that a traditional culture of appreciation and hospitality fosters corrupt practices. I can speak only for Africa. But what holds true in my own continent may apply in other parts of the developing world. I shudder at how an integral part of my continent's culture can be taken as a basis for rationalising otherwise despicable behaviour. In the African concept of appreciation and hospitality, a gift is a token; it is not demanded; the value is in the spirit of the giving, not the material worth. The gift is made in the open for all to see, never in secret. Where a gift is excessive it becomes an embarrassment, and is returned. If anything, corruption - as practised by exporters from the north as well as by officials in the south - has perverted positive aspects of this age-old tradition. It is suggested, too, that African society corrupts the public office holder by placing excessive demands and expectations on 'the big chief'; that he is expected to have infinite resources to dish out freely to all and sundry. Again, such an argument bears little relationship to reality and is merely the escape route of the corrupt public officer. Finally, it is said that corruption is the product of poverty. Poverty may play a part, but it can hardly be the root cause. Witness the sharp practices that have characterised the banking industry in Nigeria in recent years. Most bank officials were more than well paid, yet their fraudulent and corrupt practices have been outrageous. Contrast these with other officials, much less well paid, who have maintained their integrity and incorruptibility throughout. Let us all strip away excuses and explanations. In no society - north, south or east - is it acceptable to the people for their leaders to feather their own nests at public expense. Once this simple truth is widely accepted, more meaningful social and economic development will follow.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan can attain the  government's economic growth target of 2.4 percent for the  current fiscal year, a senior Finance Ministry official said  Thursday [21 April], brushing aside a weak International  Monetary Fund (IMF) projection.    Vice Finance Minister Juro Saito, speaking at a regular news  conference, also indicated that Japan is not considering fresh  economic measures ahead of a meeting slated for Sunday in  Washington of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group  of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations.    The IMF said Wednesday in a twice-yearly report that Japan's  growth in real gross domestic product will be 0.7 percent for  calendar 1994, the lowest among the G-7 nations, and called for  further fiscal and monetary measures.    The world economic report serves as a key material for the  G-7 talks and the twice-yearly gatherings of the IMF and the  World Bank.    Referring to the IMF outlook, Saito said, "There are various  ways to assess the economy... but we think the 2.4 percent  target is possible by steadily implementing the ongoing stimulus  measures."    "The economy has become brighter and is unlikely to fall  further," Saito said, analyzing reports by the ministry's  regional financial bureau chiefs.    Summing up reports by 11 regional chiefs who gathered in  Tokyo for a quarterly two-day meeting, the ministry said  earlier, "the time is ripening for an economic recovery," with a  full-fledged recovery expected in the current fiscal year on the  heels of February's 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package and the  fiscal 1994 budget.    On the fiscal side, Saito said that he interpreted the IMF  report as calling for "continued measures and not additional  ones." The report said, "For the upswing to gain sufficient  momentum, continued fiscal support and a further easing of  monetary conditions may well be required."    Considering monetary measures, Saito declined to comment,  saying Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno clearly indicated  his stance in his latest remarks to the press. Speaking to  foreign correspondents in Tokyo Tuesday, Mieno said, "I'm not  thinking of changing the discount rate at the moment."</p>

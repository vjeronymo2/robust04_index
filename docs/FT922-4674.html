			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Danish vote rocks currencies THE D-MARK made significant gains against several European currencies yesterday after Denmark's decision not to ratify the Maastricht treaty threw foreign exchange markets into confusion, writes James Blitz. The prospect that European monetary convergence has been delayed, or possibly abandoned, forced investors to unwind positions in sterling, the Italian lira and the French franc, and pledge themselves to what they see as the anchor currency of Europe - the D-Mark. After very active trading in London, sterling ended the day two pfennings down from Tuesday's close, to DM2.9150. It also closed second from bottom of the European Monetary System grid, above the Danish krone, and nearly a cent down against the US dollar at Dollars 1.8165. The Italian lira also took a  1/2 per cent loss against the D-Mark. The D-Mark ended the day at Lira 756.10 from a previous close of Lira 752.30. The French Franc also suffered, moving to FFr3.3680 against the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.3560. However, the French currency appeared to shrug off potential losses after President Francois Mitterrand announced that France would also be having a referendum on EMU later this year. The Bank of Portugal was forced to intervene in the markets after Denmark's currency threatened to fall below its permitted limits in the European Monetary System. The Bank of Portugal bought D-Marks for escudos at 83.01, 83.05 and 83.06 escudos to dampen the Portuguese currency after it approached a 6.10 per cent differential against the Danish krone. The Danish authorities compounded this with a rise of 0.65 percentage points in money market rates, slowing the krone's descent. Denmark's currency ended the day at around DKr3.8650 against the D-Mark, from DKr3.840 on Tuesday. Analysts are unsure about the immediate outlook for currency rates in the EMS. 'The major part of the upward movement of the D-Mark has probably happened, and the situation should stabilise,' said Mr Christian Dunis, a Treasury analyst at Chemical Bank in London. 'But the markets are getting the impression that European union is an a la carte thing where countries can pick what they want, and this view will cost Emu a lot of credibility.' Others believe that the possibility of an EMS realignment is greater. 'ERM realignment expectations can only be encouraged by overnight developments,' said one London analyst. 'One questions whether the commitment to current parities will be as durable without the external discipline provided by the convergence criteria.' The Italian lira is often cited as a prime candidate for a devaluation.</p>

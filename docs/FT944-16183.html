			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Partners sought to take Bull by horns: The French computer group faces a tough task When Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries was appointed chairman of Groupe Bull last October, he was presented with a life or death battle. The French computer manufacturer which had racked up losses of more than FFr15bn (Pounds 1.8bn) over the past three years, a feat rivalled only by Air France and Credit Lyonnais - the two other black holes of the French public sector. Since his arrival, he has launched a restructuring plan aimed at stemming losses, redressing Bull's battered reputation and finding a path to the private sector. A vital condition for his mission has been what he describes as a 'one-time, last-time' capital injection to eliminate the group's debt burden. Thus, Wednesday's decision by the European Commission to approve capital increases totalling FFr11.1bn represents a significant step in Mr Descarpentries' recovery plan. It is testimony to the task confronting Bull, however, that the capital increase is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of survival. Despite the award of the capital increase, Bull still faces a tough task in proving it can get back on course, and that it can entice industry partners necessary for long-term security. There is much at stake. Bull is one of Europe's few remaining computer manufacturers and a symbol of France's determination to maintain a presence in the increasingly competitive sector. For Mr Descarpentries, failure is now firmly off the agenda. He predicts that after a net loss of FFr5.07bn in 1993, the group will break even at the operating level by the end of this year, and at the net level in 1995. Such ambitious objectives are based on the chairman's battle plan. He has implemented a series of cost-cutting measures, reducing Bull's Paris sites from 25 to five, disposing of non-core assets, and accelerating a plan to cut 6,500 jobs in 1993 and 1994. Equally important, however, has been the reorganisation of the management structure. Mr Descarpentries has broken Bull into profit centres, with seven product/service divisions and four geographic networks. The new organisation, aimed at tightening notoriously lax reporting procedures, is controlled by a 10-member management board, selected by the new chairman. In so doing, Mr Descarpentries has sought to remedy the structural weaknesses of the group which, along with the fierce price competition in the computer industry, prompted Bull's decline. As Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said at the time of Mr Descarpentries' appointment: 'Since its nationalisation in 1982, Bull has been too dependent on the state and too inflexible. This has undermined its ability to respond to the upheavals in its markets.' Mr Longuet now takes a more optimistic line. 'Bull is on the road to recovery,' he claims. His view is endorsed by the European Commission, which says Mr Descarpentries' achievements help justify the approval of the capital increase. These encouraging sentiments are buttressed by signs of improvement at the bottom line. Losses in the first half of this year were more than halved to FFr843m, compared with FFr1.98bn in the comparable period in 1993. Zenith Data Systems, the personal computer division which has been one of Bull's principal sources of losses since its acquisition in 1989, is also on the mend. But despite Bull's progress, important questions remain about the group's strategy and its ability to forge the alliances necessary to secure its position in the international industry. As one computer industry analyst puts it: 'Cost-cutting takes you only so far. Bull does not have the international scale to feel secure in the industry. That is important because the shake-out in the industry is far from over.' This sentiment was echoed by an independent audit ordered by the Commission. The report argued that that privatisation and the formation of industrial alliances is essential for Bull's future. 'This operation must start as soon as possible . . . an agreement with new shareholders must be found, if not finalised, between now and June 1995,' claims the report. It argues that the status quo is not an option. The message is not lost on Mr Descarpentries, who has concluded a series of strategic alliances to strengthen Bull's operations. Since the beginning of last month, the French group announced separate alliances with Tandem, Motorola and Wang of the US. The problem, however, is that Bull is in pressing need of partners to replace the French state on the shareholder register. Officials at the industry ministry and at the company say that negotiations are proceeding well with potential investors, while the government expects to launch a tender offer within the next few weeks. The aim is to reduce the government's 76 per cent holding to a minority before next spring's presidential elections. Bull's improving results render the company a more attractive proposition, but investors will take some persuading. IBM, which holds 2.1 per cent of Bull's shares, appears unwilling to be wooed. The US group has said it will continue to co-operate with Bull in areas such as reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessor technology. But it declined to participate in last year's capital increase. More probable is that NEC of Japan, which holds 4.4 per cent of Bull, and which co-develops mainframe computers with the French company, will raise its holding. Not surprisingly, the Bull chairman and his state shareholders argue that it is speed rather than nationality which is the priority. This represents a contrast from the situation in 1991, when Mrs Edith Cresson, then Socialist premier, opposed NEC's investment in Bull. The change in stance partly reflects a more liberal attitude by the centre-right government. But the principal difference is the urgency of Bull's need.</p>

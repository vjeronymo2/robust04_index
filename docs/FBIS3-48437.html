Discussed at the meeting was the task of the Central  Committee of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon for  making this year a year of great national unity.    Paek In-chun, chairman of the North side headquarters,  recalled in his report that the great leader President Kim  Il-song in his New Year address set before all the compatriots  in the North, the South and overseas the task to unite under the  banner of great unity of the whole nation and accelerate the  cause of national reunification through a nationwide struggle.    He stated that the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon,  side by side with the Pomminnyon organisations in South Korea  and overseas, will wage a vigorous struggle for the achievement  of great national unity, highly assessing the proposal of the  overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon to set this year as a year  of great national unity for national reunification and launch a  powerful movement for this unity as an entirely just and timely  initiative.    The present situation urgently demands Pomminnyon smash the  separatists' acts of confrontation against reunification and  create a favorable climate for reunification in the 1990s, the  reporter said, proposing measures to that end.    He called for vigorously waging the movement for great  national unity in hearty response to "10-point programme of the  great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  country," a great political charter of national unity, so as to  pave the way for national reunification this year.    The report was followed by speeches.    A resolution was adopted at the meeting.</p>

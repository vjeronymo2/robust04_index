			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Afghanistan takes stock after 13 years of civil war: David Housego drives across a devastated country still divided between its victorious rival factions AT THE Spinza hotel in Jalalabad, the manager looked blank-faced and shook his head. Over the last 13 years of civil war he had been forced to take in Russian officers or officials of the former Afghan communist regime. But we were the first western visitors seeking a room - and prepared to pay for it - he had seen for several years. For until Mr Sibghatullah Mojaddedi took power in Afghanistan this week at the head of an interim Islamic administration, the road from Kabul that winds down through Jelalabad to the Khyber Pass and Peshawar across the Pakistani border had been closed to foreigners. But the manager said he could do nothing. The hotel - a stylish mansion set in an orchard but now like everything in Jalalabad heavy with the dust and scars of war - been taken over by the local mujahideen council. He had no power to allocate rooms. Our party of five journalists had hired an open pick-up truck to make the journey from Kabul to Pakistan because there are still no passenger flights out of the Afghan capital. The journey started ominously. Tanks and artillery were shelling Kabul airport and Martyr's Ridge which overlooks the city. We passed under the barrels of tank guns firing on the ridge. The checkpoints through the Kabul gorges - which the previous week had been jointly manned by soldiers, paramilitary forces and Islamic guerrillas - were largely abandoned. At Sarobi, a small town halfway to Jalalabad, came a blunt reminder that the conflict that has erupted between rival mujahideen factions - and thus between rival ethnic groups - could be a long one. The pictures of President Mojaddedi that we had seen earlier abruptly gave way to pictures of Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islam. Sarobi was packed with heavily armed Hezb supporters, demonstrating his continuing strength among the Pushtouns of the south-west and their determination to resist domination by non-Pushtouns backing Mr Mojaddedi. Further down the road, we passed a dozen lorries full of Hezb guerrillas with automatic weapons and rocket launchers heading for Kabul. They were just ahead of the first convoy of trucks loaded with wheat that Pakistan is sending to the Afghan capital. Between Sarobi and Jalalabad, we saw the devastation that the war has caused. Villages beside the road lay abandoned after being flattened during the war by Russian and Afghan forces denying cover to the guerrillas. At the sides of the road were the remains of hundreds of Soviet tanks, armoured personnel carriers and trucks that had been hit by the mujahideen - a symbolic graveyard of Soviet power. On the outskirts of Jalalabad, we passed a checkpoint too quickly and an angry Hezb commander fired into the air to call us back. He then questioned us aggressively before letting us pass. We entered Jalalabad as night was falling and as lightning illuminated the Khyber range of hills beyond. The town was the scene of a large-scale but abortive mujahideen offensive in 1988. Scarcely a window now remains. Turned away from the Spinza hotel, we spent the night at the Korshid, a doss-house in the bazaar. We left Jelalabad at 4am. Much of the area from there to the border has been under the control of extremist Arab guerrillas, devotees of a local Afghan saint. But most checkpoints were deserted. Instead, on either side of the road, were huge fields of opium poppies that heve helped finance several guerrilla groups. At the Afghan frontier post, a new board had been put up to mark the change of government. It announced that we were leaving the 'Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'. But it was characteristic of the anarchy now prevailing in the country that there were no immigration or customs officials to check us out.</p>

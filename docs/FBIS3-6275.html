			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Clarification" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F> Kampuchea spokesman on 14 March; place not given]    [Text] I. The Vietnamese communist puppets and the  two-headed government, along with the alliance's propaganda  apparatus, have been performing a new trick lately. They have  been taking turns lying about their invading forces putting off  military operations in the Pailin region in compliance with King  Norodom Sihanouk's appeal.    II. What is the reality on the ground? The reality is that  the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and  two-headed government have earnestly pursued military operations  in the Pailin region and western Cambodia without interruption.    While their propaganda machine broadcast lies on 10 March  about their invading forces postponing military operations, the  invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and  two-headed government were ordered to conduct a two-pronged  offensive on the battlefield. The first prong was launched from  Treng along National Route 10, and the second prong was launched  from the Komping Puoy Dam. Military operations were also  launched on the south Sisophon, Samlot, and Malai battlefields.  The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]  resistance joined hands to resist, attack, and disperse the  invading forces. They inflicted heavy losses.    III. What is the purpose of the deceitful propaganda  disseminated by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese lackey  puppets, the alliance, and the two-headed government? It has  two main objectives:    1. To fool the national and international public into  believing that they have respected and implemented King Norodom  Sihanouk's appeal. Actually, they oppose the king's five  points, national reconciliation, and peace. They continue to  talk about sending thousands or even tens of thousands of  troops, tanks, and heavy guns to launch military operations in  various areas, including the Pailin region. The same deceitful  maneuver was employed by the Vietnamese communists -- the master  of the one-eyed Jack [Hun Sen] and his cronies -- to fool the  United States between 1960 and 1973, especially during the Tet  season. This is why his majesty the king says he cannot call a  meeting or organize talks on his five points; because the two  premiers disagree.    2. They are acting in this manner because they can  increasingly smell the smoke of their defeat. As a matter of  fact, on 28 February -- when they launched their first major  military offensive in the Pailin region -- they were routed  after four hours of fighting. On 4 March their second attempt  was also severely defeated. On 8 and 10 March, they were again  severely routed by the people and Democratic Kampuchea.    IV. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the NADK,  along with the entire Cambodian nation and people, yearn for  peace and the end of the bloody war triggered by the Vietnamese  war of aggression. The PDK fully and unreservedly supports his  majesty the king's five points. Nevertheless, in the face of  the invasion by the forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets  and the two-headed government -- carried out in accordance with  the policies and strategies of the Vietnamese communists and the  alliance aimed at destroying the NADK and thereby allowing the  Vietnamese communists to do away with the Cambodian nation and  race -- the people and the NADK resistance have no alternative  but to continue their struggle to implement the king's  five-point policy in order to achieve national reconciliation,  restore national unity and peace in Cambodia, and finally end  the war.    [Dated] 14 March 1994    [Signed] The NADK spokesman</p>

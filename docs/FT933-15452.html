			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash squeeze chokes Chinese copper trade - A problem caused by efforts to cool the overheated economy OVERT ATTEMPTS by the Chinese government to cool its overheating economy have come at a bad time for some of the country's big raw materials suppliers, who are unable to sell more than 50,000 tonnes of copper now clogging the eastern port of Shanghai. Traders and brokers in Beijing and Hong Kong say the copper could be sitting on ships until the end of the year or even longer because Chinese buyers have no cash to pay for it. Until recently, China was the world's biggest purchaser of copper, last year importing more than 500,000 tonnes of the 700,000 tonnes it needed - and maintaining inflated prices. Copper began the year as high as USDollars 2,400 a tonne but China's about-turn from buyer to seller saw the price plunge in early April to its lowest point in five years, Dollars 1,756 a tonne. On the London Metals Exchange the three months delivery price is hovering around Dollars 1,950 a tonne and brokers say it is unlikely to break the Dollars 2,000 mark for months to come as the market has come to terms with the fact that supply now outstrips demand, stocks are high and China can no longer buy. Now China's severe cash-flow problems, compounded by the volatility of the yuan currency and uneasiness about macroeconomic policy direction as the government has finally recognised the need to slow growth, are keeping the country's metals trade 'desperately quiet', analysts say. 'Sellers in China are generally cash sellers and if they can't see the colour of your money, they won't give credit,' says a broker based in Beijing with an international company. He notes that the copper stuck in Shanghai has been purchased by large state and regional corporations that can 'afford to ride out the storm' even though they may not be able to redeem their outlay before the end of this year or possibly early in 1994. The head of a Hong Kong trading company says all available cash for imports has been spent on steel in the first half. A hundred ships carrying steel for China's booming construction industry were unloaded in Shanghai's Huangpu Port in May and June, he says, 'consuming all the available US dollars'. Beijing announced last weekend a 16-point plan to control inflation, now running close to 20 per cent in the cities, which includes curbing bank lending and delaying some infrastructure projects. The hit-list was revealed soon after Vice Premier Zhu Rongji took on the extra job of governor of the central bank, the Bank of China, replacing Mr Li Guixian. Whether or not Mr Zhu's plan for economic stability can break China's almost traditional boom-bust-boom cycle remains to be seen. Previous attempts, such as in 1988 when runaway inflation led to panic buying and, eventually, to the anti-government demonstrations that were quelled by the army on June 4 the following year, saw imports all but halted. This time China is expected to keep its markets open, but with credit drying up, it is difficult to see how the government can bring the economy in for the 'soft landing' it is now promising. Provincial importers have had to deal with a more than 25 per cent devaluation of the yuan since the government removed the ceiling on exchange rates on June 1. The yuan has only stabilised in recent days on the semi-official swap markets, which handle about a third of all trade-related currency exchanges. On Monday the rate against the US dollar strengthened for the first time since the deregulation, closing at 9.8583. It had fallen to as low as 11. The official exchange rate remains 5.7 yuan to the dollar. Domestic copper prices have only recently fallen to match the LME price, a sign analysts agreed pointed to a broad and welcome tightening that could see construction and capital works slow and soaring property prices soften. 'When prices are unrealistically high, it's like a house of cards that needs to fall down,' says the Beijing broker. 'I don't think the economy will go into a meltdown, but it needs to come down across the board and the current tightening is healthy.'</p>

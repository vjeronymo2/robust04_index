			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: Asahi agrees to US glass deal ASAHI GLASS, Japan's largest glass maker, has agreed to a gradual buy-out of AFG Industries, one of the largest makers of flat glass in the US glass. The purchase is being made through Asahi's Dutch subsidiary Glass International for an estimated Dollars 60m. The acquisition will help to progress Asahi's goal of further diversifying its operations geographically. In addition to the acquisition price, Asahi has agreed to underwrite up to Dollars 150m in bonds for AFG. The Asahi takeover follows from a management buy-out of AFG in 1988, during which time Asahi acquired a 19.7 per cent stake in AFG, and later transferred this to Glass International, which is a 50-50 joint venture holding company half owned by Glaverbel, the Belgian glass company majority owned by Asahi. The balance of AFG shares are held by the company's management and by institutional investors, who have agreed to the gradual buy-out, subject to approval by the US Federal Trade Commission, which is examining the deal. AFG had sales last year of Dollars 516m. Asahi's sales in all of North America last year came to about Y70bn (Dollars 550m) out of gross consolidated sales of Y1,248bn. AFG has six float glass plants in the US and one in Canada, and claims 15 per cent of the US market. Asahi said it would leave the US management of AFG in place for the time being.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Monday [21 February] Japan will press North Korea  to open its undeclared nuclear plants to international  inspection.    Hosokawa, speaking to a House of Representatives Budget  Committee session, said North Korea's agreement last week with  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is not enough to  diffuse suspicions about the country's nuclear weapons program.    "The acceptance of (the IAEA's) inspections at only seven  (declared nuclear facilities) cannot solve the problems,"  Hosokawa said.    In coordinated steps with the United States, South Korea and  China, Japan will continue to urge the north to abandon its  threat last March to withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT), the premier said.    He said Pyongyang must allow IAEA scientists to inspect two  undeclared nuclear plants at Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north  of the capital. Some Western nations suspect the sites are  being used to produce weapons-grade plutonium.    Hosokawa also urged the north to join South Korea in  declaring the Korean peninsula a nonnuclear zone.    He said his government does not believe the north has  already  developed nuclear weapons but he voiced concern about the  nuclear issue. "We have heard various reports."    On the Japan-U.S. trade dispute, Hosokawa said both nations  "should move ahead toward the direction of revising the trade  imbalance" out of a fear that worsening relations would have an  adverse effects on the global economy.    Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton met earlier this month  in  Washington but failed to strike a deal on a new framework to  slash Japan's trade surplus of more 50 billion dollars.    The collapse of the talks stemmed from a disagreement over a  U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the openness of  Japanese markets. Japan rejected the demand which it said would  lead to managed trade.</p>

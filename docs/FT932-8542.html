			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Plateau repeats its support for Dixon Motor THE HOSTILE bid for Plateau Mining by Kingstream, a small Australian exploration company, closes on Thursday and both sides have sent communications to Plateau shareholders. Kingstream says the rival proposal for Dixon Motor Holdings to reverse into Plateau would result in Plateau shareholders having '10 per cent of a motor dealership in the north of England which in 1992 had a turnover of Pounds 46m producing a net profit of only Pounds 250,000'. Its own offer however would give shareholders 22 per cent of a steel-making venture 'ideally placed to serve the booming south-east Asian market and with a projected turnover in excess of Pounds 400m'. Plateau's board continues to recommend the Dixon deal and suggests that 'the few selective statements that Kingstream make about the Dixon Group give a misleading impression. 'Dixon has a proven UK-based business, is consistently profitable and has always been in a position to pay divi-dends. 'On the basis of its published accounts, Kingstream has had no profits, has no net cash and has not paid dividends.' Plateau says the Dixon proposals coupled with a disposal to Delta Gold, the Australian mining group, are worth in the region of 7.6p a share, compared with Kingstream's all-paper offer worth, at best, 4.8p.</p>

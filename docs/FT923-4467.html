			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Patten steps up GCSE attack MR JOHN PATTEN, educ-ation secretary, yesterday stepped up the pressure on the schools examinations boards by hinting that he would change the GCSE exam system if they failed to. The furore last week about a critical report by the schools inspectorate led Mr Patten to ask the boards to decide this month on changes to be made to the marking and grading for next year's GCSEs. The report expressed only 'limited confidence' that standards were being maintained, following GCSE results showing more than half of all pupils achieving the top three grades. 'The general public would explode in anger if at the end of the month they came back and said there was nothing wrong at all and that nothing needs to be changed,' Mr Patten said on LBC radio. While making clear that he did not control the boards themselves, Mr Patten highlighted his own 'quite severe' powers to intervene in the system if he was not satisfied with whatever the boards proposed. Mr Patten's comments are part of a deliberately tough attitude towards the boards. 'We tried the 'softly, softly' approach last year, when Mr Tim Eggar (then education minister) just made a speech urging the boards to pull their socks up,' an official at Mr Patten's department said. 'But the result was less than nothing because the results seem to have been worse this year.' Managers want A-levels replaced with a broader exam covering academic and vocational subjects, according to a survey published today by the British Institute of Management, John Willman writes. A survey of members of the 80,000-strong institute carried out last year reveals widespread dissatisfaction with the A-level, the principal examination for school-leavers entering higher education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Only 15 per cent wanted to retain the present A-level system with 46 per cent calling for a new integrated programme of academic and vocational qualifications. The institute says A-levels waste talent by catering for fewer than 20 per cent of young people. It calls the exams a barrier to raising overall skill levels and a wasteful allocation of government spending.</p>

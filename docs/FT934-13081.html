			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Nissan reviews labour conditions THE latest clear signal that Japan's system of labour relations is under review came yesterday as Nissan, the country's second largest car maker, said it would introduce a salary system for some of its managers that would lay greater emphasis on achievement than on length of service. Beginning in July next year, Nissan plans to abolish the basic pay portion which is determined by length of employment and increase the proportion of achievement-based pay in salaries paid to some managers. The move, which reflects growing disenchantment among Japanese companies with the traditional seniority-based pay system, is expected to introduce significant differences in individual pay levels and will affect about 2,900 managers. Nissan's salary system already comes in two parts - a basic pay portion, which changes according to the number of years an employee has been with the company, and an achievement-based pay portion. But in reality the salary of employees is determined largely by seniority, which in turn is generally based on length of employment. Under the new system, however, greater weight will be laid on factors such as the results of work done and the attainment of goals in determining individual pay levels.</p>

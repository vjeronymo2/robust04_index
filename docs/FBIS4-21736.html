			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian  newspapers published through 17 March.    On 9 March, Huacho police presented the members of a Shining  Path support group who were planning to launch bomb attacks  against an Army unit, police posts in Barranca and Huacho,  public institutions, and houses of authorities from Barranca,  Paramonga, Pativilca, and Huacho. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish  10 Mar 94 p A9)    National Counterterrorism Directorate, Dincote, agents  arrested an alleged Shining Path, SL, ``terrorist'' as he walked  suspiciously near the PRC Embassy in the San Isidro District.  They seized a map of the embassy and the diplomatic residence in  his possession. His arrest led police to find out the SL was  planning a number of attacks in Lima. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish  13 Mar 94 p A18)    Cajamarca police presented four SL ``terrorists'' who  operated in Cajabamba Province. They were arrested during a  police operation in the past few days. (Lima EL COMERCIO in  Spanish 13 Mar 94 p A16)    On 10 March, Dincote presented 13 members of the new SL  faction known as the New Network, la Nueva Red, who apparently  tried to organize a faction similar to People's Aid. The new  gang is made up of three groups: the militants who belonged to  People's Aid, a committee of relatives of arrested individuals,  and a secretariat of workers and neighborhood. They were  arrested during operations conducted from 24 February to 7  March. Their main task was to reorganize the ``Committees of  Struggle'' in Lima's many shantytowns. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish  11 Mar 94 p A15)    Army forces arrested 18 SL ``terrorists'' during a clash in  the township of Quisini, Melgar Province, 157 km northwest of  Puno Department. They were involved in many murders and attacks  in Lampa, Azangaro, and Melgar Provinces. (Lima EL COMERCIO in  Spanish 16 Mar 94 p A11)    An official communique released by the Puno-based  political-military command reported that Luis Mamani Alvarez,  aka Comrade Cleto, was captured along with other 17 subversives  in an operation conducted near the city of Puno. Mamani is one  of the main SL leaders who operated in Puno. (Lima EL PERUANO in  Spanish 17 Mar 94 p a3) bs/</p>

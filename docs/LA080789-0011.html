			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NISSAN WON THIS ROUND, BUT NOW MUST DELIVER ON POWER-SHARING  </P> <P> Six years ago, Nissan introduced worker participation into its management  concept at Smyrna, Tenn. It took a risk that paid off in the election July 27  when Nissan workers voted 1,622 to 711 against joining the United Auto Workers  union.  </P> <P> Somehow the image of American auto workers in cowboy boots and jeans, waving  Old Glory while wearing red-and-white T-shirts with "Nissan" boldly printed on  the front, carrying anti-union signs seems paradoxical.  </P> <P> Less than seven years ago, Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American engineer, was  brutally beaten to death with a baseball bat by a frustrated, out-of-work  Chrysler supervisor and his stepson in Detroit. They blamed Chin's supposed  Japanese countrymen for unemployment in the American auto industry.  </P> <P> Contrary to anti-union management consultants who would herald the vote as  proof that the labor movement is already down for the count, the union election  should serve as a signal to American industry  </P> <P> and organized labor that the U.S. worker will evaluate his options and choose  the path that seems most likely to serve his self-interest.  </P> <P> In Smyrna, Nissan wages and benefits were perceived as comparable to the union  package. The union however, focused unsuccessfully on job-related injury  problems and speed-ups to gather its campaign momentum.  </P> <P> Pro-union forces would argue that six years is plenty of time for Nissan to  brainwash and intimidate workers with little union experience and who live in a  right-to-work state. However, unions have been unable to win representation  elections in any contested Japanese-owned auto plant in the United States.  </P> <P> The task for the union is to re-examine the concerns and desires of the U.S.  workers in the '90s.  </P> <P> Can American unions win union certification elections by trumpeting the same  old call that the company is the enemy and the union the friend of the working  class?  </P> <P> Can U.S. industry compete with foreign corporations while maintaining the same  old adversarial relationship with their employees and their unions?  </P> <P> The challenge for Nissan is to sustain the loyalty of their employees within  the parameters of the team concept, and to address the concern about on-the-job  injuries and speed-ups that more than one-third of their employees were looking  to the union to resolve.  </P> <P> Can Nissan at Smyrna continue to hold the support of its workers in the future  without being expected to steer a course even further in the direction of  power-sharing?  </P> <P> The UAW received more than one-third of the votes, and sent a strong message to  the company that a sizable group of workers are looking for help. The union  will most assuredly be regrouping to seize the moment when they sense that  disenchantment with the system is beginning to take root.  </P> <P> The team concept is a double-edged sword. Although some workers and their  unions have been willing to offer the company more needed flexibility to  operate its plant, what they demand in return is more power-sharing regarding  operations and management.  </P> <P> This domestic perestroika can lead to a much-improved level of quality and  productivity, job satisfaction and security, and a better labor-management  relationship. But the course must be pursued with skill, sincerity and genuine  power-sharing. Disillusionment, bitterness and a return to adversarial  relationships is inevitable if one side sees it as simply the most advanced  form of weaponry in the age-old power struggle between labor and management.  </P> <P> Nissan can expect more tests of its team concept. Once you begin to dance with  the bear, you dare not stop the music.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] In an exclusive interview to Ostankino, [Israeli  Prime Minister] Yitzhaq Rabin expressed his satisfaction that  the main purpose of Russian policy in the Middle East is to  ensure peace, security, and stability. The Israeli prime  minister believes that by making its actions in the  international arena more active last month, our country is  entering a new period of foreign and domestic policy. As far as  the Middle East settlement is concerned, Yitzhaq Rabin highly  estimated the role of Russia and the United States as mediators  in the progress of the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. However,  he believes the solution of the problem depends, above all, on  the sides involved in the conflict. The prime minister  expressed Israel's interest in extending bilateral contacts with  Russia and said in future they will spread to the military  sphere. Yitzhaq Rabin believes the forthcoming visit by Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev to Tel Aviv will be the first step in the  development of Israeli-Russian cooperation in this field.</p>

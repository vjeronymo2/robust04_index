The resolution was  adopted after a six-hour meeting of southern African heads of  state and government. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos  was represented by Prime Minister Marcolino Jose Carlos Moco at  the OAU meeting. [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Moco was accompanied by Deputy Defense  Minister Pedro Sebastiao and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister  Jorge Chikoti. The summit discussed the war in Angola and the  current stage of the Lusaka peace talks. The fact that the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  appears to agree to one thing today, only to disagree the next  day, made the OAU adopt yet another resolution.    [Begin Chikoti recording] The meeting found that the  situation in Angola is extremely serious. In the words of the  OAU secretary general, this summit could not have wound up  without a communique conveying some serious concerns. First of  all, UNITA must participate in the democratic process by  unambiguously accepting the offer made by the government.  Furthermore, it was noted that the Angolan Government has made  extremely important concessions and that the international  community must now consider Resolutions 864 and 903, because  what is happening now is dangerous and a firmer approach to the  problem must be adopted.    His Excellency Prime Minister Marcolino Moco asked for His  Excellency OAU Chairman Husni Mubarak's personal support and  direct commitment to the Angolan peace process, urging the  United Nations and the United States to view the Angolan issue  in a very serious light.    Thus, the resolution on Angola carries another important  implication: We can now use it as a working tool because of the  OAU ad hoc Committee's concern about the prevailing situation in  Angola at a time when peace talks are being held and the Angolan  Government has made extremely important concessions to UNITA.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Moco held a private meeting with  Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano shortly after being  welcomed at the airport in Harare on 18 March by Zimbabwean  Foreign Affairs Minister Nathan Shamuyarira. Though the press  has learned nothing about the meeting with the Mozambican head  of state, it is thought that the Angolan and Mozambican peace  processes were discussed. Prime Minister Moco also met Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak yesterday morning. The Angolan official  briefed him on the Lusaka peace talks and on Angola's political,  military, economic, and social situation.    Prime Minister Moco asked the Egyptian head of state to have  the OAU take concrete steps to ensure that UNITA abandons the  path of war and signs a peace accord. The OAU chairman promised  he would work to find greater support for the Angolan peace  process from the international community. [passage omitted]</p>

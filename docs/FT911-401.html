			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Granada fears realised Weeks of uncertainty surrounding the top management and immediate policy of leisure group Granada, were ended yesterday when the company unveiled a package involving a series of cash raising exercises, management changes and exceptionally bad trading figures. The market gave the package a very rough ride and Granada shares, under pressure for some considerable time, dropped 27 to 184p after 13m shares changed hands. At their worst, the shares were quoted at 183 1/2 p, with the majority of the turnover of 13m, generated at that level. The group confirmed persistent market stories that Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive, was leaving and it launched a one-for-three rights issue at a deeply discounted 140p a share to raise Pounds 163m . Additionally, it said interim profits were sharply lower and chopped the interim dividend from 4.4p to 2.5p. The sale of its bingo business to Bass, the brewing giant, will raise an additional Pounds 147m. Mr Roy Owens at Smith New Court said he saw no reason, after this news, why Granada shares should sell at a premium to the leisure sector. He has pencilled in a current year forecast of Pounds 88m, down from Pounds 120.6m and expects a figure of Pounds 118m for 1992. Bass rose 12 to 973p on 1.4m, and said it has appointed J. Henry Schroder Wagg to advise on the sale of its bookmaking subsidiary Corals. Rank Organisation was immediately put forward as a possible bidder for Corals while a management buy-out at Corals was also spoken of. Rank lost 9 to 713p. Gloomy meetings Warnings of lower profits and slower trading from four leading groups across a range of industries which held their annual meetings yesterday depressed the London market. Bowater posted a 23 fall to 600p as Mr Norman Ireland, chairman, said the recession, which began in the third quarter of last year, would lead to lower profits in the first six months of this year. Hawker Siddeley eased 7 to 579p after saying January and February had been 'very poor, while P&amp;O dropped 14 at 585p after reporting slower trading. Pearson eased 9 to 759p. A reversal of the strong run by Trafalgar House followed the P&amp;O warning. The stock was now overvalued, according to a broking house, which advised clients to sell in special ex-dividend form. It ended 14 down at 257p. Oil shares drifted easier with turnover contracting markedly. British Gas opened a shade firmer at 246p after some optimistic press treatment of recent unlikely stories that Hanson may be lining up a bid. The shares quickly retreated however, with traders taking profits and selling the stock down to a closing level of 239 1/2 p, a net decline of 4 1/2 . Turnover was 5.5m shares. BP edged up to 348p but subsided to 341p prior to closing 2 off on balance at 344p as marketmakers resurrected the oft-repeated tale that the Kuwait Investment Office may well be considering the sale of its 9.9 per cent stake in the UK oil group. Several London-based analysts thought such a move unlikely but it was also pointed out that there would be a considerable US and Japanese appetite for such a large amount of top quality stock; 'Unlikely but certainly feasible,' said one specialist. Shell, scheduled to announce first quarter figures next week, fell 3 to 523p, on 2m. Enterprise ran into a flurry of selling pressure, as fund managers continued to assess the effect of the joint venture deal with Elf to acquire Occidental's North Sea interests. Heavy support from one broking house involved in the deal failed to sustain Enterprise shares which settled a net 7 off at 543p. Ranger Oil ran up strongly to close 19 higher at 425p ahead of a company presentation on May 22. The strong possibility of Ford UK reporting a loss next week re-directed attention to the problems of automotive component manufacturers. Smith New Court is ultra-negative on the sector, believing it will probably be 1993-1994 before the market for cars and trucks recovers to 1989 levels. Salomon Brothers International also downgraded many UK car component stocks yesterday because of the decline in automotive markets. Lucas Industries, which showed determined resilience on Thursday, wilted on a rush of selling to close 5 lower at 157p. SNC has changed stance on the stock from hold to sell but admits good civil aerospace exposure gives it a long-term order book. The stock was one of the most heavily traded, with a volume of 5.6m shares. SNC accords a similar rating to three of the remaining four leading component stocks. Following Thursday's warning about interim profits, GKN slipped back 8 more to 341p while Laird Group eased 2 further to 227p. BBA Group, noticeably weaker the previous day on the cash call for Pounds 79.1m. steadied at 128p. London International Group, the consumer products and services company, advanced strongly amid talk that Genting of Malaysia was keen to boost its stake. The shares settled 13 1/2 higher at 268 1/2 p after turnover of 2.8m. United Biscuits fell 8 to 370p as another broker was said to have cut its current year forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 208m, making it the lowest of the estimates so far. Lower sales volumes and consumers buying cheaper brands have contributed to the estimates of lower profits. Hillsdown was off 6 at 246p on suggestions that a line of stock had been on offer. Unilever eased 6 to 733p on continuing nervousness ahead of its first quarter results on Friday. Analysts expect about Pounds 355m against Pounds 369m last time. Sainsbury added 2 to 392p before final results on Wednesday. Profits of Pounds 500-520m are expected against Pounds 420m last time. Sainsbury's habit of delivering just above analysts' forecasts is unlikely to be broken this time around. Share placings featured prominently in the engineering sector. William Cook issued 1.67m new shares, representing some 7.7 per cent of the enlarged equity capital, and these were placed at 252p per share to raise the funds required for a Pounds 4.2m acquisition. William Cook shares closed 4 off at 269p. Rotork, which is hoping to benefit from the reconstruction of the Gulf oilfields, remained at 228p as 860,000 shares were placed at that level with a range of UK institutional investors. The placement represents 3 per cent of the company's ordinary share capital. An approach which might lead to a bid for Quotient, the computer software and services company, pushed the shares 28 higher to 118p. Last month ACT Group, a fellow computer and software house, raised its shareholding from less than 1 per cent to over 13 per cent. ACT ended 2 off yesterday at 106p. Rosehaugh fell 2 to 62p as 1.5m shares were placed at 63p late in the previous session. Utilities continued to outperform the wider market with institutions looking to increase weightings ahead of the flotation of the Scottish generators, which is thought to be going well. There was more heavy turnover in National Power (8.1m) and PowerGen (7m), the latter edging ahead to 142 1/2 p and the former to 137 1/2 p. The Electricity Package rose 33 to Pounds 2158, boosted by individual performances such as Midland Electricity, up 6 at 208p and South West 4 up at 252p. The Water Package retreated a further 30 to Pounds 3053 on talk of more unravelling. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (157). BRITISH FUNDS (8) Treas. 10 1/2 pc Cv.

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Smith &amp; Nephew Smith &amp; Nephew has promised much over the past two years but somehow failed to deliver. A string of acquisitions in high-growth healthcare leaves it poised for earnings recovery: but this has been the story since 1990. Yesterday's interim figures are respectable, but real earnings growth is as elusive as ever. There are plenty of reasons to remain cautious, even assuming a cyclical revival in demand for premium sun-cream and moisture lotion improves the dire performance of the consumer products side. With 40 per cent of sales now in the US, the weakness of the dollar will hit earnings in the second half and possibly beyond. The tax charge rose to 29 per cent this year. It will climb higher in 1993 without a remarkable increase in UK profits against which to offset ACT. In areas of high sales growth, such as artificial joints and key-hole surgery, there is short-term pressure on margins as S&amp;N breaks into new markets such as Germany and Japan. A broader question is whether margins can be protected across the healthcare business. Sales growth ran at 11 per cent in the first half and may reach 15 per cent by the middle of the decade. If S&amp;N can keep control of pricing, shareholders could be rewarded for their patience after all. Yet mainstream pharmaceuticals companies have already suffered the budgetary constraints imposed on their public sector customers. There is no reason to believe S&amp;N will be immune. On a prospective p/e of 15, the shares look fully valued.</p>

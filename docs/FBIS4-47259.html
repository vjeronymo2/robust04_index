Zelinskiy, Moscow;  UDC530.145:32]    [Abstract] Conjugation in allyl and vinyl compounds of  heavy elements has been analyzed by quantum chemical methods for  a rather broad range of hetero-atoms, particularly compounds of  Groups IV and VII elements. The present work focuses on  analogous derivatives of Group V elements using semi-empirical  quantum chemical MNDO methods for computations with parameters  for nitrogen and phosphorus. Long wave electron transition and  oscillator energies were calculated for various allyl- and  vinylamine and allyl- and vinylphosphine conformers. The  electron structures of these molecules were examined in detail  and both the spectral and conformational manifestations of  n,- and ,-conjugation were analyzed. Several  hypotheses  are advanced on possible manifestations of conjugation in allyl  compounds of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Figures 2;  references 14: 5 Russian, 9 Western.</p>

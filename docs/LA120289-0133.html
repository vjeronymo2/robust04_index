			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY IS TOLD TO STOP WORK ON PLANE CONGRESS WANTS  </P> <P> Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood, in a move certain to reignite  passions on Capitol Hill, ordered the Marine Corps Friday to discontinue  spending on production of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, senior defense  officials said.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable Pentagon officials said the decision was made after Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney ruled out the possibility of seeking new production funds  for the futuristic aircraft in the 1991 defense budget, in spite of Congress'  insistence that the program proceed on course.  </P> <P> In a memorandum to the Navy, which oversees the purchase of weapons and  equipment for the Marine Corps, Atwood said that it would be wasteful and  premature to continue the "advance procurement" of parts for the aircraft when  no decision had been made to proceed with the program.  </P> <P> Cheney earlier this year proposed to cancel the program, arguing that it is too  expensive and that commercial interests could develop and build the aircraft  instead of the Pentagon.  </P> <P> Cheney's decision caused a furor on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers, concerned  over the loss of jobs, joined with traditional Marine Corps patrons to fight  the termination of the program.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps had called the Osprey one of its highest aviation priorities  and touted the aircraft as a central component of its new strategy to ferry  Leathernecks from ships lying far offshore to hot spots over the horizon.  </P> <P> The V-22 contractors, Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Co., would receive  cancellation fees under existing contracts if the project is in fact killed.  </P> <P> The V-22 aircraft is designed to lift off from a ship's deck like a helicopter  and flies forward like a conventional plane.  </P> <P> After a long-running debate over the aircraft, Congress approved $255 million  in research and development funds to keep the program alive, and it deferred  until next year any decision on whether production should proceed.  </P> <P> A senior Pentagon official tried to defuse the political controversy Atwood's  decision is expected to stir.  </P> <P> "There shouldn't have been anything too surprising in this to anyone," the  official said. "If the Congress had fully intended to go along with production,  then presumably they would have made it known in the form of production money.  But they didn't."  </P></p>

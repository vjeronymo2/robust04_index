			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong debut for TeleWest Cable television operator TeleWest made a storming stock market debut, closing 3 1/2 ahead of the 182p flotation price in levels of activity that came close to heart stopping for an offering of just 216m shares. Turnover of 59m was nearly six times the level of volume in BTR, the most actively traded Footsie stock. Kleinwort Benson Securities, joint broker to the issue, was said to be responsible for around half of yesterday's trade. The driving force behind the bumper trading was thought to be interaction between the London and New York tranches of the issue, plus a certain amount of switching with BT, which fell 9 to 379p.</p>

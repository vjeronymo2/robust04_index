			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: NFC downgrades 'best view' forecast to Pounds 90m NFC, the transport and distribution company, said yesterday it enjoyed slight increases in turnover and profits during its fiscal third quarter, helped by improvements in the US market. As a result, pre-tax profits for the 40 weeks to July 11 increased from Pounds 63.9m to Pounds 64.1m, while turnover rose 3.3 per cent to Pounds 1.28bn. However, continued recession in the UK prompted the company to revise its 'best view' forecast for full year profits to the bottom of its earlier range at Pounds 90m. The shares fell 11p to 218p following the announcement. Mr James Watson, chairman, said earlier hopes of UK recovery had not materialised. 'Given the overall economy, the results are satisfactory. Opportunities are arising overseas, although it is going to remain tough in the UK,' he said. The logistic division, which provides transporting and warehousing for manufacturing customers, increased operating profits 18 per cent to Pounds 33.6m, helped by volume growth and acquisitions in the US. July's purchase of Trammell Crow Distribution marked the end of the division's US expansion. The acquisitions lifted gearing from 24 per cent to 40 per cent, and Mr Watson said total borrowings at the period-end were 'up slightly' to about Pounds 150m. Interest costs increased Pounds 1m to Pounds 5.8m. The company is still negotiating the sale of Pickfords and Mr Watson was hopeful the transaction would be finalised this year. Earnings fell slightly to 9.2p (9.3p). A third interim dividend of 1.55p is declared, taking dividends so far this year to 4.25p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Khartoum, 23 May (SUNA) -- Director of the  political department at the Foreign Ministry Dr. Anwar al-Hadi  has categorically refuted the Egyptian allegations on seizure of  a number of establishments affiliated to the Egyptian  authorities.    Dr. al-Hadi explained in a press statement to SUNA that  ownership of all the said establishments went to Sudan  Government when the country became independent from the  condominium rule. He underlined that some houses had been  rented to Egyptians in accordance with lease contracts which had  nothing to do with any other agreement, adding that terms of  these contracts expired, therefore the owner of these houses and  buildings -- state of Khartoum -- noticed the tenants to  evacuate them in compliance with the legal procedure.    Dr. al-Hadi said it is sorrowful that the Egyptian  authorities escalated the issue of evacuating the rented  establishments to the standard of affecting the bilateral  relations between Sudan and Egypt. [passage omitted]    He also said that failure of the Egyptian minister to fulfil  his promise of visiting Sudan on the dates he fixed proved lack  of the Egyptian Government's credibility toward purification of  climate. He pointed out that contrary to their pretentions, the  Egyptian authorities proved to be not serious for the unity of  the Sudanese territories when they continued allowing the  outlaws movement to operate from Cairo and providing it with  moral support. [passage omitted]    Dr. al-Hadi added that the spirit of the Egyptian  authorities  in dealing with Sudan was reflecting its internal crisis.</p>

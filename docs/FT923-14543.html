			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Recession blamed for policy cash-ins INSURANCE companies, stung by criticism from the regulators, yesterday said that the recession had been the biggest single factor in early surrender of long-term life policies. But Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce, director of Prudential and chairman of the group of nine companies which commissioned research, admitted that the life insurance industry 'must do better'. The companies outlined measures to ensure that fewer policies are sold to those for whom they are inappropriate and to ensure that consumers understand the risks of long-term policies. Figures published by the companies found that more than a third of customers said they were not told about the financial implications of allowing a policy to lapse. In the first five years of a 25-year policy, often used to back a mortgage, the surrender value will usually be significantly less than the total premiums. A survey by the Securities and Investments Board at the end of last year found that during 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked life policies and 23 per cent of with-profits policies were terminated within two years of being started. Mr Bedell-Pearce said: 'There was a very clear message that the rate of persistency had deteriorated, and that they were unacceptable. It was also clear that no hard reasons yet existed.' The companies intended to change the selling techniques in order to ensure that customers understood that they could lose money by surrendering their policies. They would also follow their report's recommendation that product design should be altered to allow policyholders more flexibility when affected by events such as redundancy or divorce. The survey found that 68 per cent of customers gave up their policies because of a 'change in personal circumstances'. The main reasons within these were inability to continue paying premiums (15 per cent), redundancy (10 per cent) and a need for extra cash (7 per cent). However, 14 per cent of surrenders came as a direct result of problems with advisers or with service direct from the life office, while 17 per cent were caused by complaints about value for money. The insurance companies whose customers were interviewed were: Commercial Union, Eagle Star, General Accident Life, Guardian Royal Exchange, Legal &amp; General, Norwich Union, Prudential, Royal Life, and Sun Alliance. The research was carried out by Survey Research Associates, and 7,569 people were interviewed.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (5): Barriers fall across Europe - Progress towards a single insurance market SLOWLY but surely a single European market in insurance is emerging. Over the past two years several important planks in the European Community's legislative programme have been put in place, establishing the basis for genuine cross- border trading. And European insurance companies are adapting their strategies to take into account the new opportunities as the barriers between a series of distinctive national markets fall. The approval in 1988 of the so-called 'second directive' for non-life insurance opened the way by liberalising the market for commercial risks insurance, allowing all companies above medium size (with balance sheets of more than Ecu17m, net turnover of Ecu33m and more than 500 employees) to buy their policies from insurers established in any member state. Most countries have now implemented the national legislation needed to bring the directive into effect and already there has been something of an opening up. Traditionally fierce competition for the custom of medium-sized industrial companies in the French, British and German markets has intensified, for example, and in areas such as credit risk insurance Dutch and German companies have taken advantage of the new opportunities to attack the UK market. Shortly before Christmas last year European Community ministers approved another significant plank of legislation: the third non-life directive which extends this more open regime to the domestic market. Householders and motorists across the Community will eventually be free to buy their insurance from companies licensed by any one member state. Most member states have until 1994 or 1995 to implement the new rules although the weaker industries of Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Greece have been given longer to adapt and will not need to implement the new rules until later in the 1990s. Progress in the life insurance market, where differences in regulatory and tax regimes makes harmonisation more difficult, has been slower. Here too it is intended that the ideas of a single licence - that companies registered in any one member state should be free to sell their products across the community - should pave the way for a continental market. At present, under the terms of the second life directive individuals can buy life policies from companies registered in other member states but must do so 'on their own initiative'. Some UK companies, whose endowment plans are attractive in comparison with many of their European counterparts, have made modest inroads into the German market for example. In the short term the Commission believes its planned directives should benefit companies from countries with less burdensome regulation, such as the UK. Over the longer term, increased competition is expected to lead to harmonisation of regulatory frameworks across the Community. Although differences in national tax treatment mean imperfections will remain, a further directive - on insurance company accounts - will at least make the differences more transparent when introduced. Accounting practices in continental Europe emphasise prudential considerations, allowing companies to offer the most cautious and conservative interpretation of their performance than is common in the more open markets of the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands. As the market emerges the continent's leading companies are increasingly accepting the fact that Europe as a whole will eventually represent their home market. Two quite separate strategies have emerged. On the one hand the continent's stronger companies have begun to acquire subsidiaries in those member states where it has as yet no presence. Other companies have opted to form alliances - sacrificing a degree of control in order to use capital more efficiently. Alliances have become popular both because of the increasing cost of outright acquisition and as a means of defence by some weaker players. Allianz of Germany epitomises the first trend. Its drive to acquire subsidiaries in most European markets was signalled by its unsuccessful bid for Eagle Star of the UK in 1984. Subsequently, though, Allianz bought the Cornhill (the UK's 10th largest insurer) in 1986, bought RAS, Italy's number two, in 1986, and purchased France's Rhin et Moselle in 1989. French companies have also followed the acquisition route. Groupe des Assurances Nationales, Assurances Generales de France and the Union des Assurances de Paris, have all been helped by the encouragement of their major shareholder - the French government - which has stressed the strategic importance of expansion. GAN has made two acquisitions in the UK for example, UAP has built stakes in the UK's Sun Life and Belgium's Royal Belge. AGF recently acquired a stake in Spain's Union y El Fenix. Victoire, the privately-owned company, in which the French government has an interest via a minority stake held by UAP, paid some DM3.85bn to take over Colonia, Germany's second biggest insurer in 1989. Victoire/Colonia is at the heart of an impressive network, which also includes Baltica, in Denmark, Nordstern in Germany and Nieuw Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Partially in response to aggressive foreign interest, some companies have combined forces. The merger of Nationale Nederlande and NMB Postbank in 1991 was mainly motivated by the defensive considerations of two companies that have a substantial share of their own restricted domestic markets. Similar considerations influenced Belgium's AG to merge with Amev of the Netherlands last year. Last year three medium-sized insurers - Wasa of Sweden, Centraal Beheer of the Netherlands and Topdanmark of Denmark - agreed to build up a jointly-owned European holding company into which they would pool all their subsidiaries outside their home markets. Friends Provident, the UK life insurer, has subsequently joined the alliance, entitled Eureko. But perhaps the most important recent development has been the decision by three leading European companies - Royal Insurance of the UK, Aachener &amp; Muenchener of Germany and Fondiaria of Italy - to follow the Eureko example. Royal has been hit by losses and its weakened balance sheet makes it a prime target for takeover. AMB, Germany's third biggest insurer, faces huge losses as a result of its acquisition of a loss making bank in 1987 and has been stalked by the French company AGF. Fondiaria has fewer short-term problems but has virtually no presence outside its own domestic market.</p>

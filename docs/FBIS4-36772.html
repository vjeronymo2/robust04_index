			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, June 12 (AFP) -- Jordan's tourism association  on Sunday denied an Israeli newspaper report that five  Jordanians were to attend a conference in Tel Aviv.    "No member of the association, which represents the whole of  the private sector, is going to take part" in the tourism  conference opening on Monday, its director Yusuf Muwaswas told  AFP.    Tourism Minister Muhammad 'Adwan also denied the report,  saying his ministry had not been informed of any such  participation.    The Israeli daily HA'ARETZ reported earlier that five  Jordanians were to attend the conference for travel agents.    Israel and Jordan resumed peace negotiations last week and  signed agendas for treaty talks covering water, energy,  environment, security and territorial issues.</p>

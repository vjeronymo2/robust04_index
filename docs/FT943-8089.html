			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: Sticky problem for hard pressed Cardenas A cartoon this week in the Mexico City newspaper Reforma depicts the three main candidates in Sunday's presidential election thinking of a date. Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the centre-right National Action Party are, as you might expect, both entirely focused on election day. But the date that occupies the bubble over the head of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leading candidate of the left, is August 22, one day later. Then Mr Cardenas, the presidential contender of the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), must decide on how to react to the election result, and whether to bring his supporters out onto the streets to protest fraud. With his aides declaring that the ruling party's grip on the electoral machinery means that neither Mexican nor foreign observers will be able to provide any guarantee against widespread or systematic fraud, Mr Cardenas closed his campaign late on Wednesday by invoking the armed forces as guarantors of a fair election. Speaking to thousands of supporters at his closing campaign rally in the coastal town of Tapachula, a few miles from the Guatemalan boarder, he said: 'I trust that the armed forces will be attentive and vigilant to ensure that the law will not be violated .. (and) to ensure that constitutional order will prevail. I'm sure that members of the army, the navy and the air force will know how to fulfil their responsibilities.' Mr Cardenas also called for supporters to rally at midday on Monday in town squares across the country to celebrate 'the triumph of democracy.' He coupled these statements - apparent warnings to the ruling party of the risks involved in election fraud and a suggestion that the period following the election may be tense - with a call to initiate an immediate broad political dialogue 'to guarantee peace in Chiapas and in the country.' Closing the campaign in Tapachula in the state of Chiapas has a double symbolism, according to PRD officials. Chiapas, the poorest state in Mexico, was the scene of the Zapatista peasant uprising at the start of this year which stunned the Mexican political system. And Tapachula was the town where Mr Cardenas ended his unsuccesful 1988 campaign for the presidency, which he maintains he was deprived of by fraud. It was his second and last speech in a day which underlined his unusual approach to campaigning in the age of television. The day's itinerary made it almost impossible to get television pictures rapidly back to Mexico City. Mr Aldopho Aguilar, a spokesman, said that the knowledge that electoral coverage by the national media would be biased had encouraged Mr Cardenas to campaign as he preferred: meeting people face to face. His timetable gave no appearance of being influenced by either the convenience of the media or by election strategy. His first speech - made in the pouring rain in the small mountain town of Motozintia, more than five hours by air and road away from Mexico City and more than 2,000 metres above sea level - was to a few hundred people. The region is sparsely populated and dominated historically and often violently by the PRI, which probably dented the enthusiasm for the speeches. Mr Cardenas stood by as his party's senate candidate in this state - the voluble film actress Ms Irma Serrano, know as the Tigress - shouted 'Long Live sub-commander Marcos,' in support of the leader of the Zapatistas in Chiapas, but the response was muted. The Cardenas campaign has been heavily outspent by the PRI. Aides say the PRD election campaign has cost about Dollars 11m so far, with the presidential race taking around Dollars 3.8m. They claim the PRI's entire presidential and congressional campaign runs into of hundreds of millions of dollars and that government money is helping the ruling party. Whatever the numbers, Mr Cardenas travels in significantly less style than the PRI candidate, Mr Zedillo. While Mr Zedillo flies in a private jet, Mr Cardenas travels on scheduled flights economy class. Although they have been running far behind in the opinion polls PRD officials say that the actual result, were the election to be fair, would be close, with any one of the three main parties able to win. They say fear of the PRI means people lie to pollsters, making polls unreliable, but they have difficulty explaining why Mr Cardenas is lagging far behind his opinion poll showing in the 1988 election. In 1988, he called people out into the streets to protest at fraud and they responded in their hundreds of thousands, but he backed down before the protests degenerated into conflict with the govern-ment. This year Mr Cardenas's decision about whether to cry fraud will be complicated by the opinions of the many election observers and the independent electoral commission not present in 1988. Whether he wins or loses, the eyes of many Mexicans will be on Mr Cardenas on Monday.</p>

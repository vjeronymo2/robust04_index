			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Starting in April, China will institute a new  system of supplying grain to troops -- this was decided by the  Eighth National Meeting on Troops' Grain Work, which just ended.  Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, pointed out at the  meeting: The supply of grain to the troops is a serious  political task, and ensuring this supply has great significance  for maintaining stability, promoting economic construction, and  ensuring national security. Bai Meiqing, vice minister of  internal trade and director of the State Grain Storage Bureau,  explained details of the troops' grain supply system reform. The  main changes are: Grain for the troops will be purchased on a  negotiated-price basis instead of being purchased at contract  prices set by the state, and grain will be supplied to troops at  set prices; differences in the prices of grain, oil, and  soybeans for this winter will be made up for by central and  provincial financial departments; financial matters concerning  the purchase of grain for the troops are to be managed  separately and [words indistinct]; and all these financial  matters are to be referred to a provincial-level financial  department. After the reform is instituted, the supply of grain  and oil for this winter will continue to be managed by grain  departments, and supplies must be ensured.</p>

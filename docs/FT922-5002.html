			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash markets ended slightly softer yesterday after the Bank of England took what appeared to be an accommodating position in its money market operations. Most of the period rates remained unchanged, with everything from 4-month to 9-month Libor once again ending at 10 per cent, and 1-year Libor at 9 15/16 per cent. But 3-month Libor, a key indicator of where interest rates are moving, ended at 10 1/32 per cent, down  1/16 per cent on Friday's close. Short term clearing bank certificates of deposit were also slightly softer, with 1-month CDs ending at 9 29/32 per cent from a previous close of 10 1/32 per cent, and 3-month CDs ending at 9 7/8 per cent from 9 31/32 per cent. The softening of rates was partly due to the small size of the shortage forecast by the Bank of England. At Pounds 750m, this was far smaller than those of last week, which amounted to Pounds 7.6bn over four days. Dealers said that the Bank of England had also taken an accommodating stance, inviting offers of bills in the early round. However, the market was extremely slow to remove the shortage, with several dealers putting the blame on a shortage of bills. As one dealer put it, the market is currently being squeezed between two phenomena. On the one hand, there is the usual slowing down of the economy over the summer, which means that few bills are being offered to the Bank of England. But there are also large shortages to be taken out, mostly due to the large number of gilt issues being offered by the Bank. As a result, the Bank purchased only Pounds 86m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent in its early operations yesterday. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of around Pounds 900m before taking account of the early operations. The Bank then purchased Pounds 75m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 10m for resale to the market on 22 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 20m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 345m. The cost of overnight funding jumped to 11-10 1/2 per cent at one stage and closed at 9 3/4 per cent.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rothmans hit Worries over the prospects for tobacco groups in particular and the value of branded goods in general spilled over into Rothmans International, the 'B' shares dropping 27 to 615p. Rothmans does not sell cigarettes in the US and would not be hit by the recent announcement from Philip Morris of a price war. However, analysts said Philip Morris's decision to drop the price of its Marlboro brand had prompted the market to look at companies with any cigarette exposure and also group's with highly valued brands. Rothmans markets luxury goods under the Dunhill and Cartier labels. BAT Industries, whose shares were savaged by the Philip Morris move last week, declined 6 to 874p.</p>

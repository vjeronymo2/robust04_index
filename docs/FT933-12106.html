			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Posco surge ahead POHANG Iron &amp; Steel (Posco), the world's second largest steel company, reported that net earnings rose by 40.7 per cent to Won133.9bn (Dollars 166m) during the first half of 1993. Sales rose by 14.4 per cent to Won3,440bn. The results, which were better than expected, reflected a recovery in domestic demand and strong exports to China. Demand from big steel-consuming industries, including the motor vehicle and shipbuilding sectors, has risen recently as the depreciation of the Korean won against the Japanese yen improves sales abroad. Posco accounts for 75 per cent of steel production in Korea. China has emerged as the leading overseas market for Korean steel products with shipments tripling so far this year. This has offset sluggish exports to industrialised countries caused by the economic slowdown and anti-dumping duties imposed by the US. Posco's tense relations with the government of President Kim Young-sam appears to have had little affect on its earnings performance. Posco fell into disfavour because its founder, Mr Park Tae-joon, opposed the election of Mr Kim last year.</p>

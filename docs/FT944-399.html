			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): All aboard the nature tour - Australia is waking up to ecotourism, but so are the unscrupulous operators, finds Nikki Tait The promotional brochure is seductive. There are pictures of stark rocky hillsides rising from translucent waters, bathed in a purplish light. Inside, on grain-flecked paper, the Tasmanian holiday operator promises 'a place which remains pure, unpolluted and free from man's heavy hand'. Only the price - ADollars 895 (Pounds 445) for a four-day walking tour, with three nights accommodation - seems a little steep. But, then again, it is not every day that one can stay in a 'minimal impact' lodge, which depends on solar-electric energy, composting toilet technology and stores its rain water. Ecotourism - that is, nature-based holiday activity that aims to leave the environment intact - has become something of a buzzword within the leisure industry. A little belatedly, Australia is scrambling on board. Its federal government launched a national ecotourism strategy this year and backed up the fine words with ADollars 10m. There are two main reasons for the official enthusiasm. First, the concept appears tailor-made for the country. With a population of 18m spread around a land mass the size of the US, Australia has always sold heavily on its raw and impressive natural features. Official figures suggest that 90 per cent of international visitors come for non-business reasons, and that perhaps 80 per cent already spend part of their time on extended outdoor activities - even if it is only jumping the surf at Sydney's Bondi beach, or viewing the fairy penguins on Victoria's Phillip Island. Second, the nation has big ambitions for its tourism industry. Yet it has seen enough unattractive development on its own shores and among Asian neighbours' to be aware of the dangers of unfettered expansion. The skyscraper condominium buildings that line Queensland's Gold Coast and shade the beaches serve as a warning. The Tourism Forecasting Council recently predicted that the country could attract 6.2m visitors by 2000, double the number arriving in 1993. But while the concept seems admirable in theory, Australia is finding that marketing ecotourism is not without problems. For a start, definitions of ecotourism are fuzzy, and it is relatively easy for less scrupulous operators to jump on the 'ecotour' bandwagon. As the Wilderness Society pointed out recently: 'Four-wheel driving and horse riding do not belong in more remote areas of the bush . . . and could scarcely be called ecotourism. Currently, however, there is nothing to stop such ventures painting a big ecotour operator sign on the side of their vehicle.' Even the most scrupulous customer can be misled. One consumer advocate group points to the numerous companies offering adventure or nature cruises around Queensland's Barrier Reef. While these sound harmless and the promotional material is thick with pictures of clear water and marine life, many dump sewage at sea. In an effort to address these problems, the government has proposed a formal system of accreditation for ecotour operators, and asked for comment. In general, environmentalists think the notion is fine in principle. Already there is debate over who should supervise the scheme, how big industry's input should be, and where the standards should be set. Ideology may be running ahead of the market. Sydney, the starting-point for many international visitors, does boast one travel agency specialising in ecotours, but many of the conventional travel consultants blink at the concept. 'It is not something people request, although they are usually pleased to hear about environmental features,' says the Australian Travel &amp; Information Centre. 'I think it will come - but in the main, people really don't care when they're travelling,' says Jack Dart, head of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents. Australian Consumers Association, which was involved in publishing an ecotourism guide last year, reports an uninspiring response to the book, the first of its kind in Australia. A report form at the back asked readers to comment on the 300-plus holiday operators listed. Just one non-industry response came in. Related to this is the question of the commercial viability of ecotourism projects. The more genuine environmental efforts - such as the Tasmanian example - usually entail an extra cost for their operators. While this can be passed on to dedicated environmentalists, the scope for a rival operator to undercut and lure away less committed consumers is considerable. 'If you're saving the last blade of grass, the resort has to generate the funds to justify it . . . and if the resort goes under and is vacant, that's the worst kind of ecological damage,' notes Dart. Phil Young, managing director of P&amp;O Holidays Australasia, which is probably the country's largest ecotourism operator and runs environmentally-friendly lodges in Tasmania and Queensland, is more optimistic. He points out that much depends on the resort's position. A careful ecotourism operator, he says, will always aim for an element of 'scarcity'. For example, P&amp;O runs a resort on Heron Island which, unlike most resort islands in the area, is part of the Barrier Reef. The only other occupants are a marine research station and a ranger base for the National Park. All waste is recycled or barged back to the mainland, and by agreement P&amp;O is responsible for the supply of services to the whole island. 'You get benefits in other ways,' he adds. 'There tends to be higher occupancy, you don't have to discount, and advertising costs less. Moreover, with a number of medium-sized eco-resorts, you start to get economies of scale in management. But a very small operation would be difficult to make work.'</p>

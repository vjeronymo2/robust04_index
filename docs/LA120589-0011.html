			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: HE'S TOO OLD TO GET THE PICTURE FOR CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am 22 years old and the oldest of five children; the  others are 19, 17, 12 and 4. I graduated from college last May and was  commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in June. I have been  living at home for the last six months, working while waiting for my military  assignment.  </P> <P> Yesterday my mother came to me and said she wanted to take a picture of "the  children" to send out on Christmas cards. I tried nicely to tell her that I  would be humiliated to have Christmas cards sent with my picture on them. I  said I would be much more comfortable sending a family picture, if we had to  send a picture. She could not understand my embarrassment about sending a  children's picture.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Secretly, Miss Manners has misgivings about  look-how-they've-grown cards. If circulation were limited to people who know  the children, especially to those who don't often see them and would value an  annual picture, these would be fine.  </P> <P> In your case, however, we are dealing with the feelings of the sender -- your  mother. So Miss Manners entreats you to be a sport while you're still at home  during the picture-taking session.  </P> <P> Your idea about a full family picture is an excellent one.  </P> <P> She has another suggestion: In the group portrait, take the 4-year-old on your  lap. Rather than wondering what you are doing in a children's picture at your  age, people will murmur, "I didn't realize Lee was already old enough to have a  child."  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS: I've found a way to avoid giving out my telephone number. A  few years ago, I wanted an unlisted number, but did not want to pay the  additional fee, so I put the account in the name of my bird, Ferd Nurd.  </P> <P> That name was listed in the phone book, and led to very amusing phone calls,  usually around 11:30 on a Saturday night, from strangers, with loud music in  the background. They always wanted to talk to Ferd. Also, Ferd received a  credit card from the phone company. I hung it in his cage.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners is always happy to hear of methods to achieve  privacy from that intrusive instrument, the telephone. She congratulates you  and commiserates with your bird on its rowdy friends.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband and I have discovered a restaurant that has live  piano music during Sunday brunch. Since I would like to encourage the pianists,  I have applauded whenever they played something I particularly liked. I have  noticed that only a few other people applaud, and usually only after I do. Am I  committing a breach of etiquette? Should I confine my encouragement to a few  remarks when I am leaving the restaurant?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Could you open those confines to include a small contribution  as well? Tipping is one of the differences between the etiquette of music  appreciation at a restaurant and that appropriate to a concert.  </P> <P> By applauding, you encourage concert manners, and suggest to sensitive fellow  diners that they really shouldn't be talking during brunch (which is one of the  things they came there to do). Therefore, it is customary for an especially  appreciative patron to catch the eye of the performer after a selection, smile  and move the hands in silent applause.  </P></p>

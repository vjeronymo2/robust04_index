			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the  National Assembly of the People's Government, arrived at the  Jose Marti Airport a few minutes ago and made the following  remarks to this station.    [Begin recording] Well, the most significant, the most  important point of the visit was the attitude that exists in  Europe toward Cuba, an attitude of interest in Cuba, and a very  respectful interest. Many people are following the development  of the Cuban situation, its problems, and the way we are facing  them. There is interest and concern. I would also say that there  is a great respect for, a great understanding of what we are  doing. This has been conveyed from an official point of view.    We received very cordial treatment from government officials  in Belgium, Germany, and France. This same attitude was conveyed  by all political sectors of those countries we visited. I think  this process will lead to the imminent signing of that framework  agreement, that overall cooperation agreement between our  country and the European Union, that is, the set of countries  that comprise the European Economic Community.    As you know, we have relations with each of those members  bilaterally. We also talked, and there is great mutual interest,  especially with Germany, about working on a specific agreement  for the promotion and protection of investments between our two  countries, similar to the agreement signed with Italy.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Pertaining to Section 22.21. Permits for Scientific or Exhibition Purposes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments were received on the proposed revision of Section 22.21. One recommendation was that &sect;22.21, Permits for Scientific or Exhibition Purposes, limiting possession of bald or golden eagles to museums, public scientific societies and zoological parks, should be amended to allow eagles to be placed in private institutions. The commenter noted that there has been an increased number of birds that are for various reasons non-releasable and hard to place into public institutions. The Service does not anticipate changing the current regulations to allow for the placement of eagles with private institutions. The Service has been successful in placing non-releasable birds in public institutions in the past and expects the availability of these types of placements to continue. Public institutions have been the placement of preference for such birds because they usually provide a greater opportunity for the citizens of the United States to enjoy the rare beauty of these birds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Pertaining to Section 22.22. Permits for Indian Religious Purposes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that the Service include language within the regulations that would make it easier for tribal members to obtain eagle feathers. The Service has striven to make its current procedures as fair and equitable as possible in light of the limited supply and the increasing demand for eagle feathers. The Service is working with the tribal entities to make substantive changes in its policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another recommendation was that Service procedures be revised to allow American Indians who find dead eagles to have the same eagle they found returned, because of what was termed, the found eagle's ``spiritual and cultural'' significance to individual American Indians. The Service recognizes and has carefully considered the concern raised. The Service is presently reviewing its policies and procedures to provide for this special need and allow American Indians to pick up and keep eagles found dead on tribal lands. The Service is also making administrative changes to allocate more resources to the National Eagle Repository and to simplify the entire eagle permit process for the religious use of American Indians. The Service will continue to work with tribal entities to develop recommendations to enhance these initial efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another recommendation was to revise the applicant certification requirement and permit issuance criteria set out in &sect;22.22. The Service has traditionally followed, as a matter of policy, guidelines established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) in reviewing such matters. These same guidelines are used by the Bureau to determine the status of an individual seeking federal assistance. The Bureau's certification simply indicates that an applicant is a member of a federally-recognized tribe in good standing. The establishment of an additional set of guidelines for the sole purpose of the allocation of eagles feathers would be redundant and inconsistent with the equitable standards set out by the Bureau. The Service, therefore, will continue to defer to the Bureau's criteria and anticipates no changes in the current certification requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A recommendation was also made to include language allowing tribal members who lack proper paperwork to prove that they have permission from the Service to possess eagle feathers. Under current regulations, bald eagle parts, nests, or eggs lawfully acquired prior to June 8, 1940, and golden eagles parts, nests or eggs lawfully acquired prior to October 24, 1962, may be possessed, or transported within the United States without a Federal permit. Except for the above stated exceptions, a valid permit for American Indian religious purposes is required. No change in these provisions are anticipated at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Pertaining to Section 22.23. Permits to Take Depredating Eagles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another recommendation relating to part 22 was the suggestion that the Service should include within the current issuance criteria required for Permits to take depredating eagles, in &sect;22.23(a), an additional permit criteria requiring the applicant to provide documentation of other methods that were attempted to reduce depredations. The Service anticipates no changes in the permit criteria for permits to take depredating eagles at this time. The Service considers the factual inquiry already required under existing application criteria to be sufficient to assure the continued protection of wild eagle populations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were also received on the subject of the use of eagles in falconry. Specific comments were that the Service should relax and simplify the requirements necessary for obtaining permits for golden eagles used in falconry for falconers who want to fly eagles. The Service considers current permit requirements as generally necessary and proper in order to assure the safety and welfare of both the eagle and the falconer. In the Service's considered view, any relaxation of these standards to allow other than master class falconers to possess golden eagles for falconry could be detrimental to the bird and the handler. Therefore, no changes to this effect are anticipated within the regulation at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter recommended that eagles taken under permits, pursuant to &sect;22.23(b)(3), Permits to take depredating eagles, should be made available for scientific purposes, including deposition in a museum. In the Service's experience, the demand for eagles and eagle parts by American Indians is greater than the supply. The Service, therefore, has an obligation to fulfill the religious needs of the American Indian before alternative depositions are considered. Therefore, the Service does not anticipate making any changes at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Need for Proposed Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to amend the regulations restricting the issuance of eagle permits, in order to respond to the particular needs of American Indians and public institutions. In order to assist the legitimate needs of American Indians and public institutions for bald or golden eagle feathers and other parts, the Service currently provides for the issuance of permits to American Indians and public institutions to possess bald and golden eagle feathers or parts. Under the permit system the possession and transportation within the United States of eagle feathers and parts is legal, but they may not be imported, exported, purchased, sold, traded, bartered or offered for purchase, sale, trade or barter. The Service has established an eagle repository for eagle parts at the Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon, where American Indians through the permit process may lawfully obtain feathers and other parts, nests or eggs of eagles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Indians and representatives of public institutions in the past have sought the Service's permission to travel internationally with their lawfully possessed bald or golden eagle feathers, parts, eggs, nests or other articles which may contain eagle parts. A change in the permit requirements was necessitated because the regulations, as they currently exist, do not authorize the transportation into or out of the United States of religiously significant bald or golden eagle parts or articles containing such parts, nests or eggs by American Indians, or the transportation into or out of the United States or bald or golden eagle parts or articles containing such parts, nests or eggs for scientific or exhibition purposes. The Service, therefore, proposes to make accommodations for the religious needs of the American Indian community and for public institutions by making changes in the eagle permit regulations that generally prohibit all imports and exports of eagle parts, nests or eggs and do not differentiate between transportation within and transportation outside the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

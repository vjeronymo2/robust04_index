			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Gas boost for Cairn Energy THE CONTINUING recovery in the US gas price, together with the strength of the dollar against sterling, helped Cairn Energy establish its recovery in the first half of 1993. The independent oil and gas company reported pre-tax profit of Pounds 641,000, against a Pounds 161,000 loss previously, and profits of Pounds 818,000 for 1992. Teredo Petroleum, acquired in May, contributed to the profits and also to the increased sales figure of Pounds 8.2m, against Pounds 5.7m. Cairn said the main cause of the sales advance was the US gas price in the period which, for the group's share of production, averaged Dollars 2.09 per thousand standard cu ft, compared with an average of Dollars 1.59 previously. Earnings per share came through at 1.21p (losses 0.66p). Teredo properties, which are mainly onshore UK and Spain, had produced good cash flow and a strong contribution from this source was expected in the second half. In addition cost savings were expected to be achieved by the closure of Teredo's London office. Gearing had been reduced significantly by the Pounds 5.2m placing and open offer in May and the issue and sale of shares in CEUSA, the US subsidiary, in July. The company said that in the half year exploration costs previously incurred on North Sea licences had been carried at Pounds 6.5m. Changes in the Petroleum Revenue Tax regime and the reduced exploration drilling in the North Sea might effect the carrying value of these licences.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL OKS BILL ON RIGHT TO ABORTION  </P> <P> A House subcommittee approved a bill Thursday that would put into federal law a  woman's right to an abortion, as ruled in the Supreme Court's Roe vs.  </P> <P> Wade decision.  </P> <P> "The language of the bill is drawn directly from Roe," said Rep. Don Edwards  (D-San Jose), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and  constitutional rights. He said that the Freedom of Choice Act is needed to  preserve the reproductive options women have had since the Supreme Court  decision was issued in 1973.  </P> <P> Five Democrats voted for the bill and three Republicans voted against it. The  action came after two days of hearings.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): The eggcellant way to a healthy heart The risk of developing heart disease can be lowered by eating eggs from hens fed on a special diet, according to Australian scientists. The 'HeartSmart' egg tastes like an ordinary egg but is rich in Omega 3, a group of fatty acids believed to help cut heart disease. It does not, however, cut the level of cholesterol in the egg, which many scientists believe is implicated in heart disease. The eggs are being marketed in Australia by University Partnerships. The Omega 3 fatty acids, which are found mainly in fish, are thought to be important in the development of babies, according to David Farrell of the University of Queensland, who conducted the study. He found that breast-feeding mothers could raise the Omega 3 content of their milk by eating the HeartSmart eggs. University of Queensland: Australia, tel 61 7 365 2573.</p>

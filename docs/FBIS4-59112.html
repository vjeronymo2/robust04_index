			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  stated that Egypt will spare no effort to achieve a  comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on the basis of  Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of  land for peace.    This came in the foreign minister's speech addressed to the  Refugees Working Group of the multilateral peace talks, which  began its meetings today. The speech was read out on his behalf  by Ambassador Ahmad 'Utham, the head of Egypt's delegation to  the meetings.    The foreign minister said Egypt is convinced of the chances  for pursuing the long road to peace and overcoming its  difficulties and challenges.    Musa reiterated Egypt's stance on the refugee issue. He said  that without a fair solution to this problem, there will be no  peace or stability in the region, especially after the  Palestinians felt that they were left alone to suffer, deprived  of their legitimate and acknowledged rights, after their  brothers in Namibia and South Africa were liberated.    He also stressed the importance of the repatriation of the  diaspora refugees and reunion of the displaced families, noting  that the Egyptian delegation can see no reason to delay the  realization of such a humane goal.    Representatives from 45 countries, including Israel, in  addition to UN and World Bank representatives, are participating  in the three days of meetings.    The delegates will discuss several issues, including  reuniting Palestinian families, improving the health conditions  of the refugees, especially those of the children and women, and  improving the economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. The delegates will also discuss a report from the  committee that visited refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon last  month.</p>

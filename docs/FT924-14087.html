			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Letter: Design for own destiny Sir, I write as a very cost/benefit conscious New Zealander living in England to comment on Mrs Dalmahoy's letter (October 7) as follows: (i) I have an English husband who is paranoid that I buy British made goods in preference to foreign ones provided that their performance is at least equivalent to that of the latter. I have had very little difficulty in complying with this. (ii) It appears many English people feel that foreign products give them enhanced status despite there being at least equivalent UK products. (iii) Life in a distant colony has encouraged a widespread attitude of self-sufficiency. An increase in this attribute in the UK could have the following results: buyers (individual and corporate) should proactively seek to buy British products; industrialists should actively seek to develop more products with the object of displacing imports (retailers would be well advised to assist in this process) and more internationally tradeable goods and services (preferably ones which sell primarily on characteristics other than price). By adopting these attitudes we have the power to influence the country's economic future irrespective of the government's action or inaction. Rebecca Breese, 39 Langton Street, London SW10 0JL</p>

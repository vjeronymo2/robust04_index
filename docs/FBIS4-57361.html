			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Quintero De Leon and Nubia Aparicio S.] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, the new president of the  Republic, yesterday explained that his campaign slogan "the  people to power" could have been misinterpreted by his followers  and the rest of the country. The issue came up as a result of  criticism of Perez Balladares' offer to men like Guillermo  Chapman and Ricardo Alberto Arias, considered members of the  oligarchy, to hold positions in his government.    "It is a problem of conceptual definition," Perez said. He  added that "the people to power" does not necessarily mean that  all the ministers or directors of the autonomous institutions  must be very poor people. This means, the president-elect said,  that the government's policy must, above all, protect the  interests of the people but this must also be done with  everyone's participation.    "People does not mean only the poor; people means all of  Panama and there are not only whites and blacks in Panama; there  is a little of every one and that is the way I plan to compose  my government, with everyone," Perez Balladares said.    According to the president-elect, he cannot please everyone  and he is convinced that his commitment is to the Panamanian  people. Perez Balladares admitted that he is a realist and that  he only received one-third of the votes. Perez Balladares added  that the other two-thirds are not his enemies, but they did not  vote for him. Perez Balladares views what happened as a people's  mandate to attain national consensus and this is precisely what  he is trying to do.    According to the president-elect, there are two things he  cannot do. He cannot disregard the issue of a national consensus  because he believes this is what the country needs; nor can he  disregard his party, the one with the most votes in the country.  These are the two factors he is attempting to bring together.    In this regard, Perez Balladares said that his party will  have a majority participation in his government, but there must  also be participation of the independent forces. He has also  invited Panamanians who are members of other parties to  participate in his government.  <H5>  More Appointments to the New Cabinet Announced </H5>   Meanwhile, the Democratic Revolutionary Party's [PRD] press  office has announced new appointments of ministers and directors  of autonomous institutions that will make up the new Perez  Balladares government. Among those on the list of future  ministers are: Housing Minister Dr. Francisco Sanchez Cardenas,  Labor and Social Welfare Minister Mitchel Doens, and Public  Works Minister Luis Blanco. Two women will head the Commerce and  Industry and the Government and Justice ministries; however,  their names were not disclosed. Dr. Hugo Torrijos Richa has been  appointed to head the National Port Authority.    Prior to these appointments it was announced that Gabriel  Lewis Galindo would be the new foreign minister; Raul Arango,  the new minister of the presidency; and Olmedo Miranda Jr., the  new finance minister.    A PRD source, who requested to remain anonymous said that  many within the party are not pleased because "almost all the  ministers appointed are of the oligarchy," thus ignoring the  slogan "the people to power" that Perez Balladares used during  the campaign.    The source also said that there is a "rivalry between the  Public Force [FP] officials and the former Defense Forces  offices. The FP officials have expressed their strongest  opposition to the appointment of a single member of the former  Defense Forces to the Public Force. These former Defense Forces  officers thought that once Perez Balladares won the election  they would return to power, the source said.    According to the source, as far as the FP officials are  concerned, "it is impossible to incorporate those officers into  the FP because they are accustomed to repressing civilians and  violating human rights. How can they be part of an organization  created to defend democracy and the rights of citizens?"    The source also said that Balbina Herrera is the PRD member  who is the most upset with Perez Balladares' conduct.</p>

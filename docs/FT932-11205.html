			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: BCE first-term profits fall by a third to CDollars 221m DECLINING telecommunications profits, a lower contribution from Northern Telecom and special charges depressed BCE's results in the first quarter. BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group and the holding company controlling Bell Canada, Northern Telecom and many other communications interests, reported net profit of CDollars 221m (USDollars 175.3m), or 65 cents per share, down one-third from CDollars 298m, or 88 cents, a year earlier. Total revenues were CDollars 5bn, up 3 per cent from CDollars 4.86bn, including CDollars 4.7bn from telecommunications, against CDollars 4.5bn. Mr Lynton Wilson, chairman, told the annual meeting BCE's performance reflected relatively flat revenues from 100 per cent-owned Bell Canada and CDollars 86m of Bell special restructuring expense. 'Bell Canada's results for the rest of 1993 should improve, although they will be affected by a telephone rate application,' he said. Most of Bell Canada's activities are regulated by the federal government. Bell Canada's contribution equalled 48 cents per BCE share, against 71 cents a year earlier. The utility's local business gained slightly with an improving economy, but rising competition from Unitel and resellers reduced long-distance volume. Bell Canada is countering with new services and options that generate higher revenues. International telecom business was up, reflecting higher volume and last year's acquisition of 20 per cent of Mercury Communications. Northern Telecom's results in the first quarter were hit by slower margins and higher research and market development costs. It contributed 15 cents per BCE share, against 20 cents. Corporate activities showed a CDollars 2m loss, against a CDollars 7m deficit a year earlier. This included the financial services unit. The first quarter also included a special gain of 10 cents a BCE share from the sale of TransCanada Pipelines stock. Mr Wilson said BCE's telecommunications business cannot compete effectively if federal regulation continued to be stifling and unpredictable. 'Market forces must play a larger role in setting prices or Bell Canada will have to be reorganised to improve financial returns,' he said. Mercury would benefit from BCE's research, equipment manufacturing and network development and the link with Cable &amp; Wireless will give BCE greater international reach. BCE planned other alliances and investments and would spend CDollars 2bn on international expansion, he said, while Northern Telecom would focus its expansion on Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America.</p>

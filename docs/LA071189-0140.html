			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DAVIS WILL GET BONUS FOR ALL-STAR GAME  </P> <P> Outfielder Eric Davis will receive a $55,000 bonus for appearing in tonight's  All-Star game, Reds General Manager Murray Cook said.  </P> <P> There had been some doubt about the bonus because Davis' contract calls for the  bonus if he was elected by fans. Davis was not elected but selected by the  National League to play.  </P> <P> "Our position is that if a player is on the All-Star team, he receives the  bonus," Cook said. "It doesn't matter if he is elected or selected to the  team."  </P></p>

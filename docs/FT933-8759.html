			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: F&amp;C raises net assets but warns on US growth FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Investment Trust warned yesterday that 'Wall Street may begin to falter', as it lifted its interim dividend by 2.7 per cent to 1.15p. The UK's largest investment trust reported an 8.6 per cent increase in net assets from 225.5p to 244.9p per share over the six months to June 30; the year-on-year rise on June 1992's figure of 181.4p was 35 per cent. The trust said: 'Unless President Clinton can demonstrate soon that he can revive the economy, Wall Street may begin to falter.' However, Mr Michael Hart, joint manager, was reasonably hopeful about other markets, including the UK, where he has a target for the FT-SE 100 index of 3150-3200 by the year end. The recent enthusiasm for enhanced scrip dividends has proved a problem for the trust. Such dividends give investors extra shares instead of cash; if they subsequently sell the additional shares, the cash proceeds would be higher than if they had taken the cash dividend alone. Investment trusts, however, cannot distribute capital gains. The fear is that if F&amp;C paid out cash received from the sale of enhanced scrip dividends to shareholders, it might lose its investment trust status. The Association of Investment Trust Companies is negotiating with the Inland Revenue on this point. In the interim, F&amp;C has stopped taking enhanced scrip dividends and will not distribute the proceeds from those scrip dividends it has received until the point is clarified. The trust said that it continued to attract new investors through its savings plan, with the total number of shareholders up 14 per cent in the first six months of the year to 64,861. However, the costs of operating the plan led to a 21 per cent increase in expenses. Total net assets were Pounds 1.29bn. Earnings per share were 2.26p (2.31p). A final dividend of 2.3p is forecast to make a total of 3.45p (3.35p). COMMENT F&amp;C's investment management skills seem undiminished. The 8.6 per cent increase in net asset value per share compared with a 5.5 per cent rise in the All-Share Index over the same period; the trust's move back into Japan has worked out well. That said, its success has been so well recognised that the shares, unchanged at 255p yesterday, are virtually trading at asset value. Add in the fact that many world stock markets are at an all-time high and new investors face the risk of a 'double whammy' - falling assets and a widening discount - if they choose this moment to buy. So there may be scope for short term weakness in the share price; however, those who invest for the long term or via the savings scheme, can probably rely on F&amp;C to steer through the market ups and downs better than most.</p>

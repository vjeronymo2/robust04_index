			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Coalition horse rides into town: Japan's new leaders have a rare opportunity to reform the character of domestic politics With a deep and graceful bow, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa paid tribute to the heavens for having chosen him as prime minister, completing a remarkable transformation of Japanese politics. His seven-party coalition had secured the rise of a new postwar generation of leaders, installed the first woman speaker of parliament, and condemned the powerful Liberal Democratic party (LDP) to the opposition benches. These are evocative symbols of upheaval, but do they mark the beginning or the end of political change? An indecisive and disruptive coalition reign would invite the return of a strengthened LDP, now in opposition for the first time in four decades. Mr Hosokawa and his partners stand on the fringe of uncharted political territory. They can secure the passage of electoral reforms and, as they put it, 'reform political thinking', or be distracted by the differences inherent in a conservative coalition that includes a Socialist party and the political arm of a Buddhist movement, Soka Gakkai. Political reform is the priority, but the hotchpotch of parties needs to respond coherently to a slowing economy and trade friction with the US. The coalition members disagree on the future of value added taxation and energy policy, and have been haggling over cabinet positions and bickering with the LDP over parliamentary procedure. The omens are not promising, but the coalition still has the benefit of the doubt at home and abroad. Financial markets, for example, have taken the coming of coalition government calmly. Conversations and television programmes have been animated by the prospect of the LDP in opposition, and not by a perception that the country is on the brink of crisis. Other governments appear more curious than concerned, sensing that foreign and trade policies will hardly deviate from their present course. If the coalition partners do keep their promises, there is potential for great deviation, not so much in the detail of present policies, but in the longer-term conduct of politics. Swapping multi-seat constituencies for single seats and proportional representation, and controlling political donations, will alter the electoral system, but the 'revolutionary' changes pledged by the parties will come from increased transparency, deregulation and accountability. Pro-reform parties in the coalition argue that, without these changes, Japan will be unable to develop an international profile appropriate to its economic influence. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP power broker now in the backroom at the Japan Renewal party (JRP), a coalition partner, suggests that 'Japanese-style democracy' has outlived its usefulness and the country must 'reform our politics, our economy, our society, our consciousness'. The reputation of reform and of reformers in Japan rests with Mr Hosokawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, who brought down the government by defecting from the LDP and is now the JRP leader. Echoing Mr Ozawa's lofty sentiments, Mr Hata talks of making parliament 'a genuine forum for political debate' and turning politicians into 'true representatives of modern Japan'. Mr Hata is in a position to prove that his statements are more than the puffery of an ambitious politician courting votes. He is likely to be either foreign or finance minister in the new government. At finance, he would preside over bureaucrats whose arbitrary use of 'administrative guidance' gives them intimidating power over financial institutions and the interest rates on a Japanese worker's bank account. For example, a reform committee of Japanese and foreign banks and brokers recently complained of unnecessary intervention by the finance ministry. It pointed out that no new financial products could be introduced in Japan unless they were specifically permitted; in most other markets, they could be introduced unless specifically forbidden. The lack of transparency in government also enables politicians to influence the budget process in a way that benefits, for instance, the construction industry more than the average taxpayer. As still-emerging corruption scandals indicate, construction companies are encouraged to donate generously to politicians in return for a contract to build a bridge or to lay concrete on a river bed. But corruption will not end suddenly with the rise of a pro-reform government. When in opposition, socialist MPs were able to influence public works contracts, directly or through the offices of well-connected LDP officials such as Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather now on trial for evading taxes on monies received from construction companies. Mr Hosokawa, Mr Hata and their coalition colleagues can impose a tougher discipline. If politicians' powers of influence over contracts are reduced, the flow of contract-related funds will slow. The coalition wants to ban corporate donations to politicians, but a legislative amendment alone will encourage companies to find more creative ways of disguising illicit funding. The depth of political change will also depend on the maturing of the coalition members. Theirs is a friendship destined not to last; but three parties, the Social Democratic party, Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party and the JRP, have the potential to combine into a powerful single party, competing with the LDP, which is still far bigger than its opponents. On the other hand, each could remain a bit player in a fragmented system that would take another election or more to sort out. If the SDP, formerly the Japan Socialist party, is forced by coalition membership to reverse the more extreme policies that have kept it in opposition, it could emerge with a stronger identity than its conservative counterparts. If not, the SDP will be in danger of splitting, with more moderate members tempted to join the JNP or JRP and the more Marxist MPs retreating into isolation. The JNP and JRP have an identity problem. Their ideas outnumber their policy details and they have yet to distinguish themselves clearly from the LDP. Ms Yuriko Koike, a successful JNP candidate, suggested during the election campaign the 'people don't want detail, they want change', but, come the next election, repeated citing of the word 'reform' may not be enough to attract voters again. Having seen the tradition of one-party rule rejected, the LDP is beginning to play a useful, defining role as a powerful, belligerent opposition party, which is unusual in Japan. The selection of the relatively young Mr Yohei Kono, 56, as party president was a response to upheaval; he has a reputation as a reformer dating back to the mid-1970s, when he left the party in protest during another spate of corruption scandals. The LDP cited Mr Kono's appointment as evidence of 'generational change' and 'reform', but other executive posts were distributed among the party's leading factions, suggesting that the old hierarchy remains influential and time-serving politicians are still awaiting a turn as prime minister. Mr Kono is attempting to pre-empt these challenges. After his selection, instead of retiring to an exclusive bar for the customary whiskies and back-slapping with factional colleagues, Mr Kono did the rounds of leading television stations, launching his leadership and the campaign for the next general election. That election could come at any time. The coalition has promised to introduce political reform within a year, and then call an election. But the seven parties have yet to agree on the details of reform. Ironically, a dispute over where to draw the new electoral lines could provoke a split and the fall of the government. Japanese parties have an uncanny ability to tolerate incompatibility. The SDP often joins with the LDP and other parties to support consensus candidates in provincial gubernatorial elections. That past co-operation is the basis for the present awkward coalition government and could mean that the partnership has an unexpectedly long shelf life. In the meantime, the coalition leaders have a chance to reform the character of Japanese politics. If they fail, a political structure battered by the events of the past few months could begin to return to a familiar shape, with a dominant LDP surrounded by a band of directionless opposition parties.</p>

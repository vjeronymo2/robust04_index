			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Shock waves hit the Latin markets - The Emerging Investor What is the definition of an emerging market? A market that you cannot emerge from in an emergency. The euphoria that greeted the new year in emerging stock markets has been punctured. The flows of foreign money that had sustained record share prices have slowed considerably or gone into reverse since the rise in US interest rates a month ago The hardest hit markets in Latin America have been those where foreign participation has been highest. Mexico, Chile and Argentina - where foreign participation is estimated at between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the market - have fallen between 7 per cent and 13 per cent in a month. Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging market research at Bear Stearns in New York, believes the Latin markets are suffering shock waves from the corrections in the US stock and bond markets. Once sentiment turns in favour of the US markets, the smaller markets will see foreign buyers return. The emerging markets fall harder than most mature markets for a variety of reasons. Trading volume there has increased from Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m a day, but most of that is concentrated in a few stocks. When the market is falling, many investors find it difficult to sell fast. The limited role of marketmakers and a lack of flexible trading rules has hindered liquidity in the market. In Mexico, a difference of foreign and domestic opinion over prospects for the market also meant that foreigners selling shares in the past month found few Mexican buyers to take on the stock. According to Mr Pablo Riveroll, head of research of the brokerage, Bursamex, Mexicans had already sold most of their holdings. 'Foreigners have been looking at Mexico longer term than the Mexicans,' he says. 'They say if you invest over three to five years you will do well. Mexicans are looking at the troubles in store this year.' The main source of these troubles became evident on New Year's Day, when several thousand armed rebels seized half a dozen towns in the southern state of Chiapas. This exposed the weaknesses in Mexico's political institutions and deep social divisions in the country. It also heightened concerns over next August's presidential election, which most investors had previously assumed would be a shoo-in for the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio. Mexicans have been especially worried that Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in Chiapas, would declare him-self as independent candidate for the presidency, says Mr Arturo Acevedo, head of research at the brokerage, Vector. Some investors believe his candidacy would promote democracy and long-term stability, but the majority view him as a threat to continuity of economic policy represented by Mr Colosio, the man picked by President Carlos Salinas. These concerns have begun to permeate the consciousness of investors outside the country. 'Two months ago no foreigners were talking about political risk,' says Mr Acevedo. 'Today there is much more consciousness of the electoral process and political complications that could arise.' 'A lot of people were saying that Mexico had emerged,' says another leading stockbroker, 'but they were forgetting political risk. You need stability in the transfer of power to emerge.' The outlook was further clouded by the disclosure last month that Mexican growth last year was a meagre 0.4 per cent, the lowest rate for seven years. On top of that, there has been increased volatility in the Mexican peso, prompting some worries about whether the current exchange rate band is sustainable through the election year. Despite all this, some foreign analysts dismiss arguments that the market weakness is due to local factors: 'I don't believe it has anything to do with politics, and I don't buy the story that it has anything to do with the economy,' says Mr Dennis. When buyers return, they believe Mexico will be well placed. 'A lot of markets were overbought, and will not be able to sustain valuations that were driven solely by the flood of money into the markets,' says Mr Larry Brainard of Goldman Sachs in New York. 'When this happens, you have to look at the underlying economic fundamentals. In Latin America, the fundamentals are good in Mexico and Argentina right now.' With the North American Free Trade Agreement in place, Mexico, along with Chile, is regarded as the Latin country that has done most to streamline its economy. Although the pay-off so far in growth has been modest - the restructuring of Mexican industry has been more profound than many thought likely beforehand  -many analysts see medium-term growth prospects as good. On top of that, price-to-earnings ratios in Mexico are low compared with other Latin American markets. Mexico's average prospective p/e is lower than any Latin American country save Brazil. Bear Stearns calculates Mexico's at just below 14, compared with 17.3 for Argentina and 18.2 in Chile. Brazil stands at 13.5, Venezuela at 15.5, and Peru at 19. But while foreigners may be content to look at earnings multiples, Mexicans are likely to remain unconvinced. The last three presidencies have ended in financial crisis, which suggests they probably will not return to the market in strength until the election year is out.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Friday  Week on week    change Stock                    Country        close       Dollars         %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cukurova Elektrik        Turkey        0.8011        0.1067     15.36 Goldstar                 S Korea      30.2429        2.4360      8.76 Light Servicos de   Electricade            Brazil        0.2803        0.0214      8.27 Cho Heung Bank           S Korea      10.8329        0.7606      7.55 Evergreen Marine         Taiwan        2.0057        0.1367      7.31 Hanil Bank               S Korea      11.0436        0.6747      6.51 Central Puerto           Argentina     7.0014        0.4027      6.10 Controladora Comercial   Mexico        1.9383        0.1099      6.01 Formosa Plastics         Taiwan        1.9111        0.0987      5.45 Corcemar                 Argentina     7.1514        0.3528      5.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

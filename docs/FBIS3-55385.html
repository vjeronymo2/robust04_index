He has just  returned here from Washington, where he discussed the program  for the visit with Strobe Talbott, coordinator of U.S. policy  toward Russia and the CIS countries.    In Georgiy Mamedov's view, the Moscow forum will devote its  main attention to problems of economic interaction between the  countries, and examination of a set of questions linked with the  implementation of the policy of reform in Russian society. On  the international level, the sides will consider the  strengthening of security and the settlement of regional  conflicts, particularly in Bosnia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and also  problems of nuclear nonproliferation and cooperation in arms  control.</p>

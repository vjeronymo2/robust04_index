			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CHILDREN NO. 1 TO JACLYN SMITH  </P> <P> Jaclyn Smith says her children come first. The former "Charlie's Angel" star is  in Toronto shooting an NBC movie and took her children, Gaston, 8, and  Spencer-Margaret, 4, on location.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't work if I didn't have them," Smith said.  </P> <P> "Nothing would come together. If I decided to leave them back at home, they  wouldn't like it, I wouldn't like it and we'd all be miserable." Smith says she  would consider another television series because it would allow her to be home  in Los Angeles during the school year. She would also like to try the New York  stage again, but it would complicate her family life too much.  </P> <P> "It's just not in the cards for me right now because I'd have to uproot my  children and take them to New York or travel on the road with them," she said.  Another thing Smith doesn't expect to be doing soon is a "Charlie's Angels"  reunion with Farrah Fawcett and Kate Jackson. "They (producers) have talked  about it, but, you know, it's not going to be," she said. "I think we've all  moved on."  </P></p>

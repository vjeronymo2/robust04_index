			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Continental chambers are not so all-providing Sir, As someone involved in the discussions about one-stop shops, I read Gisela Davis's letter (November 16) about the chambers of commerce and the Department of Trade and Industry proposals for one-stop shops with interest. However, she has fallen into the trap of thinking everything in continental Europe is well organised and everything in the UK is not. There are strong chambers of commerce in Germany, France and the Netherlands which manage activities such as apprenticeship training and company registration. But they are not market-driven and many do not provide the small firms advice service. Indeed, there is a growing number of small firms initiatives all over the continent which are being set up to compensate for the institutional nature of the chambers. Furthermore, many of them are using UK experience of enterprise agencies. However, I acknowledge we have a lot to do in the UK and it is my hope that the one-stop shop discussion will result in a rationalisation between the 250-plus public service enterprise agencies and 100-plus voluntary membership chambers. But we do not want to lose the market-driven, bottom-up approach to customer service. The reasons for supporting small firms is to encourage growth and job creation. This means that the agencies which are going to work with them have to be in tune with their needs: we have a chance to do that in the UK which I believe some other European countries will, in time, wish to emulate.

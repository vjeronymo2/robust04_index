			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: Synge's 'Well of the Saints' - Edinburgh Festival / Alastair Macaulay is reminded of other Irish playwrights, Friel and Beckett Blind person recovers sight, cannot cope with the world, prefers to return to sightlessness. How strange to see, within 15 days, two plays, each by an important playwright, tackling this particular theme: one a world premiere (Molly Sweeney) by Brian Friel, the other a rarely performed play from 1905, The Well of the Saints, by JM Synge. And both playwrights intensely Irish. These plays share a paradise-lost view of the world - a view that to taste of the tree of knowledge is to shatter all contentment - and they suggest that that view is profoundly Irish. The Well of the Saints actually deals with a blind couple, a middle-aged man and wife both miraculously cured by holy water. Unlike Molly Sweeney, this is what most people would call a real play: ie the characters talk to each other, there is a specific locale, and things happen in the present tense. And it is morally complex. These two blind people, Martin and Mary Doul, were never saints and acquire no jot of saintliness. Full of complaints in the first place, and deeply distrustful of those who have sight, they had both been convinced that each other was a physical beauty, and, on recovery of sight, they both become obsessed by the importance of good looks. The notion that ignorance was bliss is a condition they only gradually and painfully attain. Nor does experience teach them compassion. They are, at the end, much the same grumbling duo as they had been at the start. The bare and ruined place where the action (or inaction) occurs, and the bleak spiritual outlook of the play, also prefigure the work of another Irish playwright - Beckett. But The Well of the Saints is, above all, recognisably by the author of The Playboy of the Western World. It has the same richly poetic use of Irish speech patterns, the same irony and tragi-comic quality, and the same romantic sense of how ordinary poor people are torn between sensual passion and respect for social order. 'Put down your can now, and come along with myself, for I'm seeing you this day, seeing you, maybe, the way no man has seen you in the world,' says the seeing Martin Doul to another woman, Molly Byrne, in Act Two. 'Let you come on now, I'm saying, to the lands of Iveragh and the Reeks of Cork, where you won't set down the width of your two feet and not be crushing fine flowers.' He is no beauty and no saint, and yet Molly, 'a fine-looking girl', is for a while mesmerised by his words. There are better, lovelier, kinder folk who have no such poetry in them. In such moments, the play has as strong a sense of the miraculous as when it shows the power of holy water. And this production, directed by Patrick Mason for Dublin's Abbey Theatre, underlines them, with changes (lighting designed by Trevor Dawson) from ordinary daylight to a peculiar light that half-silhouettes the characters. Sometimes Mason shows less feeling for the Beckettian inaction of the play. As played currently at Edinburgh's King's Theatre, parts of Act Two, in particular, drag. And I doubt whether Martin's near-seduction of Molly would have half its effect without the fancy lighting. The Abbey actors, led by Derry Power as Martin and Pat Leavy as Mary, are all very fair, but the words have an inner life that could be more ravishing and disturbing than they always make them. 'I'm thinking it's a good right ourselves have to be sitting blind, hearing a soft wind turning round the little leaves of the spring and feeling the sun, and we not tormenting our souls with the sight of the gray days, and the holy men, and the dirty feet is trampling the world,' says Martin after losing his sight again: which makes an impact on us but could/should be yet more insidious. These are, however, cavils merely about the degree of the production's success. Meanwhile 1994 is producing an unusually large number of stagings of Synge's best-known play, The Playboy of the Western World. On the Edinburgh Fringe, the Scottish company Communicado is currently giving a thoroughly Irish production of it, directed by Gerry Mulgrew. At times the language is played more for sensuous charm than for disturbing force; and only Cara Kelly, in the central role of Pegeen, goes for a thoroughly three-dimensional realisation of a role. But the Communicado house style, with its strikingly imaginative ensemble effects of wordless physical theatre, makes some fine contributions here and there. And in the relatively small space of the Traverse's main auditorium, the play's potent poetry, abundant comedy, and intimate scale all work remarkably well. The Well of the Saints is at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, until 28 August. The Playboy of the Western World continues at the Traverse until September 3.</p>

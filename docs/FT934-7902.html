			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Mount Banking owners appeal THE OWNERS of Mount Banking, the Asian-controlled bank in administration, have appealed in the High Court against a ruling that vindicated the Bank of England's regulatory action against them, Andrew Jack writes. Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah are appealing the verdict of the Banking Appeal Tribunal on a point of law that the facts on which its decision was made did not justify its conclusions. Mount Banking was placed in administration last year after a petition for provisional liquidation to a High Court judge by the Bank which said that the Shahs were not 'fit and proper' to be hold their positions as directors. The Bank acted on suspicions of money-laundering of the proceeds of a fraud, and other matters against Standard Chartered and the Indian Stock Exchange. The tribunal found that the Bank had not found the evidence to back up many concerns, but that it was justified to act based on these suspicions. The Shahs maintain their innocence.</p>

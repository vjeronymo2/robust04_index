			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Austrian pledge on private TV Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky pledged yesterday to bring in, after general elections on October 9, a law allowing private television channels to operate in the country. The Social Democrats and their junior partner in the governing coalition, the conservative People's party, are expected to win the elections, handing Mr Vranitzky a third term as chancellor. Austria is one of the few countries in east or western Europe not to permit private television stations to operate on its territory, although cable television is allowed; its two state television channels, ORF1 and ORF2, are often criticised for being staid. Mr Vranitzky did not say how many commercial stations would be permitted or whether foreign-owned companies would be allowed to bid for licences.</p>

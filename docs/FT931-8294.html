			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BETTER than expected aver-age earnings figures, together with the favourable response by the US markets to the State of the Union speech by President Clinton, brought good trading activity in the derivatives area, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,825, up 10 from its previous close, but suffered a slight dip to 2,823 in the first 10 minutes of business. It later rose on buying from independent traders and securities houses. The release of favourable average earnings figures boosted the contract further, maintaining momentum into the afternoon, and it reached the day's high of 2,854 just before Wall Street opened. March subsequently came off the top, but it maintained the high levels due to early firmness on Wall Street. Profit-taking later in the session caused the contract to gently drift back and it ended at 2,835, up 20 from Wednesday's close but at a 7-point discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover was 10,031 lots. The traded options market was active and turnover expanded to 34,174 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 14,033 lots while the Euro FT-SE option had 1,920 contracts dealt. Among the stock options, Amstrad was the busiest with 7,300 lots transacted and most of the day's total done in the June 25 calls. It was followed by BTR with 2,726 contracts and Glaxo with 1,489.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Esselte despite weak markets Esselte, the Swedish office products group, swung to a SKr301m (Dollars 38.1m) pre-tax profit in 1993 from a SKr11m loss a year earlier, in spite of weak conditions in many important markets. The dividend is SKr2.75 per share, up from SKr2.50. The turnround was flattered by the exclusion of SKr270m in one-off costs which hit the final quarter of 1992. But improved market conditions in the final quarter of 1993, particularly in the Nordic countries and the UK, also helped. The company expects a further improvement this year. The weaker krona was positive for the company, helping to lift sales to SKr11.8bn from SKr9.9bn. However, the impact was mitigated by sizeable production operations in hard currency countries such as Denmark, France, Belgium and Germany. Based on comparable exchange rates and units, sales were 3 per cent lower last year, reflecting weak markets in southern and western Europe and Japan.</p>

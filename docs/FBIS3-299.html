			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin  arrived in Bamako early this afternoon on a 48-hour visit. He  was welcomed upon his descent from the plane by Mrs. Sy Kadiatou  Sow, the minister of foreign affairs, Malians abroad and African  integration and Jean-Didier Roisin, the French ambassador to  Mali. The French cooperation minister spoke, among other  things, on the backup measures taken by France in the wake of  the devaluation. [passage omitted] Concerning an eventual  second devaluation, an issue raised at the recent African  finance ministers meeting in Libreville, this is what Mr.  Roussin had to say:    [Begin Roussin recording] I was not in Libreville. However,  I had the pleasure of holding a telephone conversation with  President Bongo. I also read the report from that meeting, and  I did not glean anywhere the possibility of a second  devaluation. The wisdom of the African heads of state is such  that this information seems to me erroneous. [end recording]</p>

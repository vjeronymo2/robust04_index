			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The State Duma today  passed a resolution in connection with the killing of Deputy  Andrey Daynisovich Ayzderdzis.    "The State Duma deputy's murder, one of thousands of serious  crimes that have swamped the towns and villages of Russia,  should justify the adoption of decisive steps in the fight  against crime," says the statement, an account of which has been  released by the State Duma's press service.    The statement establishes that, in a situation where the  crime world is openly on the offensive, the government and the  law enforcement agencies are not taking effective action to stop  criminal encroachments upon citizens and are thereby risking not  only the lives of individuals, but the very existence of the  Russian state system.    The document goes on to say: "Realistically assessing the  situation which has arisen today, the extent of the approaching  danger, the threshold which has been crossed by the criminal  milieu and the potential tragic consequences for the country's  multimillion population, we most decisively demand that the  President of the Russian Federation [RF], as the guarantor of  human and civil rights and liberties to the maximal degree, uses  his constitutional powers to bring order, without delay or  compromise, to this most important area of our everyday life."    The State Duma considered it necessary to demand that the  country's president dismiss the minister of internal affairs of  the RF immediately. As for themselves, the deputies voiced  their readiness to examine and adopt as a priority "urgent  legislative acts in the fight against crime."</p>

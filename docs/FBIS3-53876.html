The  bases have been used for over a year as centers for social and  medical services.    A spokesman for the PFLP-GC has made the following  statement:  At exactly 1415 today, a formation of Zionist warplanes raided  al-Na'imah region targeting a dispensary that belongs to the  PFLP-GC and firing several missiles. Two workers in the  dispensary sustained various injuries. Also, the dispensary  building, in addition to several cars and surrounding buildings,  sustained material damage. One of the two workers was died from  his injury.    Until the early hours of the evening, the Zionist enemy  planes conducted reconnaissance missions over the region. Boat  lights were also spotted off the al-Damur and al-Na'imah coasts.    The spokesman added that the PFLP-GC, which was targeted by  Zionist shelling for the second time in two weeks, declares that  these strikes will only increase its resolve and strengthen its  refusal to make peace with or recognize the Zionist enemy. It  will continue to support the popular intifadah in Palestine  until the defeat of the treasonous Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The PFLP-GC reasserts that it will continue to adhere to  armed struggle and jihad, in addition to national and Islamic  resistance in southern Lebanon and Palestine, until the  liberation of Palestine and all of the occupied Arab territories.    It is a revolution until the liberation of man and land.</p>

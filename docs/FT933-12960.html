			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Worries from the US hit blue chips A UK stock market already discouraged by the lukewarm investment reception for the BT3 issue on the previous day took a turn for the worse yesterday afternoon after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, characterised this year's US inflation trends as 'disappointing'. Early gains in London were sharply reversed and the FT-SE 100 Index was down by 24.3 before losses were trimmed after a rally on Wall Street. The final reading of 2,823.9 on the Footsie left a fall on the day of 19 points. The setback was led by a sharp fall in stock index futures. Downward pressure on equities was said to be moderate, however, with trading in the BT issues still making up about 10 per cent of overall turnover. The market was helped at first by a firmer tone in pharmaceutical shares. However, the initial gain of 6.1 on the Footsie began to melt away after a hesitant start by the September future contract on the index. Lacking any further excitement from the BT stocks, the equity market hung fire until a sell-off in stock index futures sounded the alarm ahead of Mr Greenspan's prepared address to the US Senate Banking Committee. Disappointment with the news of 3.3 per cent annualised growth in UK M4 money supply eased after comments on the outlook for domestic inflation from UK economists, but broader confidence was damaged by Mr Greenspan's discouraging views on inflation across the Atlantic. Firmness in sterling reduced the chances of a cut in domestic base rates, thus undermining one of the few remaining props beneath near-term confidence in equities. As the close of trading drew nigh, optimism was fast disappearing and there was a ready audience for suggestions that a big UK bank might announce a large rights issue this morning. However, many traders scouted such rumours. The gloom over the market was also shown in another modest decline by second line issues, bringing a dip of 6.3 to 3,205.0 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. But trading in the second liners was down to about 58 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 604.7m shares. On Monday, when business was boosted by the BT3 issue, Seaq reported 760.4m shares dealt, for a retail worth of Pounds 1.51bn. Consumer sectors paid little heed to the latest report from the Confederation of British Industry, which indicated that June brought the sixth consecutive monthly rise in UK retail sales. The CBI report also said that the sales recovery was patchy, lending support to the stock market's doubts about the economic recovery in the UK. The slide in the market was the more disturbing for market strategists because the drugs sector, which has been a significantly bearish drag on UK equities, was firmer yesterday. Doubts were expressed as to the likely duration of the rally in pharmaceutical stocks and traders looked keenly yesterday for signs that the international fund managers were prepared to return to a sector which has cost so many of them dear in the setback. With valuations of the UK stock market still under question, and the domestic poli-tical outlook now in jeopardy, equity analysts sounded unwilling to be drawn on the short term prospects for share prices.</p>

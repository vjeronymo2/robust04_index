			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed O. Al. and E.S.: "Belgian Navy Will Be </F> Commanded by a Netherlander"]    [Text] Efficiency: That is the objective of the "close  cooperation" agreement between the Belgian Naval Force and the  Netherlands Royal Navy which Belgian Defense Minister Leo  Delcroix is due to sign on 30 June with Ter Beek, his  Netherlands counterpart. This project is likely to produce some  irritation in Belgium. Indeed, although the two Naval Forces  should prove more efficient by the implementation of this  agreement, some people will not fail to regret the organization  of this binational force.    Contrary to the methods used in the Eurocorps for instance,  (a rotating command among the countries involved), the  Netherlands, according to the Naval Force internal memorandum  which LE SOIR has been able to procure, will permanently hold  the operational command. The Benelux admiral will see his  responsibilities extended in peacetime to operations outside  Belgian-Netherlands territorial waters. The Belgian rear  admiral would always be the deputy and the replacement for his  Netherlands colleague. Indeed, this is an extension of a 1951  agreement which makes provision for giving command to the  Netherlands in time of war.    However, the Belgian ships could, under Belgian operational  command, participate in national missions, or even international  missions.    The agreement should also make it more difficult to carry  out  another drastic reduction in Belgian and Netherlands naval  staffing levels, which have been subjected to stringent  reduction plans in recent years.    The memorandum also takes up some points which will be  consolidated. For instance, there will be no question of one of  the two partners in the Belgian-Netherlands force specializing  in one sector or another. Each of the forces will as far as  possible maintain a "general" role. The ships will also  continue to be based at the same home port. Thus, although the  joint headquarters will be based in Den Helder, in the  Netherlands, the ships currently based at Zeebrugge or in  another Belgian port will remain there.    In the logistical sphere, the "close cooperation" will  relate  to the maintenance of ships and equipment, and a joint purchase  and acquisitions policy. And, finally, there will be a  harmonization of new construction programs. In this sphere,  Belgian-Netherlands cooperation has just met with a failure:  The Netherlanders have refused to participate in the program to  develop new Belgian minesweepers.    The Belgian Naval Force will also be able to maintain its  relations with other navies, as it is currently doing with the  French National Navy, which maintains the weapon systems on  Belgian frigates.    Finally, the agreement makes provision for the bilingualism  of the Belgian Naval Force to be maintained. It therefore  remains for the Netherlands admiral to prove that he knows more  French than the motto of the Netherlands royal family: "I will  uphold."</p>

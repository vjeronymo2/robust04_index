			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: CHILD CARE A BIG NEED THAT U.S. CAN'T MEET ON THE  CHEAP  </P> <P> Look at almost any statistic showing the dramatically changing role of women in  the workplace and you'll understand why members of the 100th Congress proposed  nearly 150 bills dealing with just one effect of that change: the need for  child care.  </P> <P> But the idea-laden Congress has done precious little about that or any other  family-oriented issue. Such issues were generally called "labor issues;"  somehow using the word "labor" made the problems politically easier for the  relatively affluent congressmen to ignore.  </P> <P> Now most Republicans and Democrats claim they realize that this country must  face up to the increased political potency of the emotionally charged family  problems created by the United States' enormous demographic shifts.  </P> <P> Here's one fact that helped raise the consciousness level of both politicians  and the corporate executives clever enough to think about the implications that  the data has for their own work forces: In 1950, only 12% of women with  children younger than 6 had jobs outside their homes, compared to 60% today.  </P> <P> Another provocative fact: More than half of all children under 6 have mothers  who work outside their homes.  </P> <P> President-elect George Bush has declared that the problem of providing help for  working parents with young children "is the single most important issue arising  from changes in our work force."  </P> <P> Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a crusader for meaningful child-care  legislation, rightly bemoans the fact that the United States is one of only two  industrialized nations without such a law. The other is South Africa, hardly a  country sensitive to labor -- or to the family problems of most of its  inhabitants.  </P> <P> Congress almost passed an inadequate bill last year, but it died as the members  squabbled over widely differing proposals.  </P> <P> A growing number of corporations say they are really thinking hard about  offering child care as a basic fringe benefit. Some employers even call it the  fringe benefit of the 1990s.  </P> <P> But with all that heavy corporate thinking, only about 3,300 of the country's 6  million companies have actually done much about it.  </P> <P> Unions are making a concentrated attempt to win contracts to help single-parent  families or those with two working parents, but with very limited success.  </P> <P> Not much has actually been done in Congress yet, in part because the members  could not agree on the government's role in helping parents keep both jobs and  children. Surprisingly, however, there are no serious differences over money  these days.  </P> <P> In the early 1970s, Congress tried with little success to do something about  child care in a substantive way.  </P> <P> Democrats realized then that it would take a considerable amount of money to do  any good at all. They proposed a child-care bill that would have provided $7  billion by 1975 -- enough to get a running start toward easing the growing  problem faced by working parents.  </P> <P> That sum, adjusted for inflation, would have amounted to about $15.5 billion in  1988 dollars, according to Nancy Saltford of the Employee Benefit Research  Institute, whose valuable study of the issue was released last month.  </P> <P> The latest proposal of those "free-spend ing" Democrats, however, would have  cost only $2.5 billion for child care, compared to the inflation-adjusted $15.5  billion they were ready to spend in the early 1970s. They have regressed  considerably.  </P> <P> And what about Republicans?  </P> <P> President Richard M. Nixon vetoed the Democratic measure in 197l, backing  instead a Republican plan priced at a measly $250 million. That difference over  money killed the bill altogether, and there wasn't much steam behind child-care  proposals until the 100th Congress convened two years ago.  </P> <P> Now the Republicans say the $2.5 billion proposed by the Democrats is about  what they themselves are willing to spend. In other words, the GOP moved  forward on the money question while the Democrats moved backward.  </P> <P> But they are far apart on the way they want to spend the money. Even worse,  none of the plans are nearly adequate to meet the need.  </P> <P> Bush has a plan that would cost about $2.2 billion -- about half as much spent  annually on the stealth bomber, a project of, at best, uncertain value.  </P> <P> He has proposed a tax credit of up to $1,000 for each child under 4, but he  wants it offered whether or not both parents work outside the home, and that  makes sense.  </P> <P> However, does Bush think that once children reach age 4 they are pretty much  ready to go it alone, or that four years after the baby comes, the parents will  be rich enough to do without the $1,000 child-care tax subsidy?  </P> <P> An improved Bush plan should be combined with proposals most Democrats want:  government help to expand child-care services and fix minimum standards for  providers of the care. They also want to provide small subsidies for low-income  families in which both parents work at outside jobs.  </P> <P> The Conference Board, a business research organization, figures that child-care  services range from $1,500 to $10,000 a year, and most parents pay $3,000, or  about what it takes to go to some public colleges.  </P> <P> We cannot provide adequate child care on the cheap. But if we really believe in  the value of family life -- and that both women and men are wanted and needed  as workers outside the home -- it will be well worth the investment.  </P></p>

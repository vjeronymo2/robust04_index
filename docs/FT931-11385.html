			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Philips boosts Blackburn plant PHILIPS, the large Dutch electronics group, yesterday said that it had decided to concentrate all production of television-tube cathodes at its Blackburn plant in Lancashire. The company produces about 60 per cent of its cathodes in Blackburn. The rest are made in the Netherlands. Philips said the decision had been taken as part of a drive to cut production costs. He said the production facilities in Blackburn could be developed to produce cathodes more efficiently. The move is evidence of the 'clear and tough' measures the company promised in November to improve performance in consumer electronics and components. About 200 people are employed in Blackburn in cathode production. The company would not say whether the decision would lead to either further investment or more jobs at the plant. He also said he did not know the salary differential between workers in the Netherlands and Blackburn but salary costs had not been part of the decision. About 168 workers are involved in cathode production at the Netherlands plant at Sittard and the company said that forced redundancies could not be ruled out. Philips has been hard hit by a sharp downturn in consumer electronics which pushed the group into a loss of more than Fl 150m (Pounds 57m) in its third quarter. The knock-on effects have been felt strongly by the components division.</p>

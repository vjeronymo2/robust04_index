			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Magna posts 46% rise in third quarter MAGNA International, the biggest independent Canadian car parts producer, recorded a 46 per cent jump in third-quarter profit. The group added that it would be debt-free by July 31. Net profit was CDollars 44.4m (USDollars 34.9m), or CDollars 1 a share, against CDollars 30.5m, or 89 cents, a year earlier. Revenues advanced 13 per cent to CDollars 742m. Profits for the nine-month period rose 51 per cent to CDollars 101m, or CDollars 2.34, from CDollars 66.7m, or CDollars 2.13, a year earlier. Revenues rose 13 per cent to CDollars 2bn. Magna, with plants in Canada, the US and Europe, is benefiting from stronger North American vehicle production. Its gross margin was 19.5 per cent in the third quarter, up from 18.1 per cent in the second, but the group warned that customer pricing pressures were increasing. The fourth quarter, normally the weakest, should be buoyed by the North American recovery and the big assemblers' shift to outsourcing of parts.</p>

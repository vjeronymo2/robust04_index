			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT and a second home I RESIDE in Glasgow but I have a second house in England. At some time I shall sell the house to reduce the liability to Capital Gains Tax. I would like to transfer a half share in the second house to my wife. I shall be obliged if you will answer the following questions: Would it be necessary to employ a solicitor to prepare a conveyance of the half share to my wife? Would the transaction be subject to stamp duty? The solicitor will be able to guide you in deciding whether to hold the house as joint tenants (survivor takes all) or as tenants in common (each half share can be disposed of by will to a third party). The solicitor will also be able to guide you on the important question of joint main-residence notices, under what is now section 222 (6) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which could significantly reduce the potential CGT bill on the English house (without producing an unacceptable CGT bill on any eventual sale of the Scottish house). We take it that your existing main-residence notice (under section 101(5) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 or section 29(7) of the Finance Act 1965, as the case may be) nominates the Scottish house as your main residence, from some date in the past. Assuming there is no outstanding mortgage there should be no stamp duty. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns.  All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

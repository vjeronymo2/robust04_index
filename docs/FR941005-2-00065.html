OEJ was established in 1992 to help these communities to identify and assess pollution sources, to implement environmental awareness and training programs for affected residents, and to work with community stakeholders to devise strategies for environmental improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In June of 1993, OEJ was delegated granting authority to solicit projects, select suitable projects from among those proposed, supervise such projects, evaluate the results of projects, and disseminate information on the effectiveness of the projects, and feasibility of the practices, methods, techniques, and processes in environmental justice areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 is the second year of the EJ Small Grants Program. Seventy-one (71) grants totaling $507,000 were awarded in FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. How Does EPA Define Environmental Justice Under the Environmental Justice Small Grants Program?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental justice is the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no racial, ethnic or socioeconomic group should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from the operation of industrial, municipal, and commercial enterprises and from the execution of federal, state and local, and tribal programs and policies. Environmental justice seeks to ensure that the communities, private industry, local governments, states, tribes, federal government, grassroots organizations, and individuals act responsibly and ensure environmental protection to all communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

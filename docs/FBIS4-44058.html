			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Part of the Turkish unit that will serve in the  UN peace force in Bosnia-Herzegovina flew to Split from Ankara's  Esenboga Airport this morning. A ceremony was held at the  airport, and President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller were  among those attending.    Staff Colonel Mehmet Ali Erdogan, commander of the unit,  said  in a speech at the ceremony that the Turkish peace force was  trained to serve and survive in Bosnia-Herzegovina  independently. He pointed out that the unit is going to  Bosnia-Herzegovina with 261 different types of vehicles, close  to 1,300 tonnes of equipment, and, as a precautionary measure,  additional supplies for 60 days. [passage omitted]    National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said that guided by  Ataturk's principle of "Peace at home, peace in the world,"  Turkey has always believed in the need to protect peace. He  pointed out that during the Ottoman era, the Turkish nation made  peace reign in the Balkans and the Middle East -- current  sources of ethnic tension -- for hundreds of years. Golhan said  Turkish troops carried out their duties successfully in Korea 44  years ago and in Somalia a short while ago.    [Begin Golhan recording] It is a fact that the Turkish  nation has close historical and cultural ties with the Muslims  living in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Our heroic soldiers are going  there now, however, to help put out the fire and prevent the  massacres, without discriminating between ethnic origins or  religious differences. None of the regional countries and no  person should have any doubts about that. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Galya Nikolova: "Discontented DPS Members Form </F> New Party]    [Text] Former deputies of the Movement for Rights and  Freedoms [DPS] who left the parliamentary factions of the DPS  and approximately 150 supporters established the Party of  Democratic Changes over the weekend of 28-29 May. Mehmed Hodja  was elected chairman, and National Assembly member Ismail Ismail  and Sabri Hyusein, lawyer from Plovdiv, were elected deputy  chairmen.    Statements made at the meeting voiced dissatisfaction with  the DPS and its leaders. The new formation will seek an  alliance with all non-communist forces and will reject any  cooperation with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. The new  party categorically dissociates itself from the manifestations  of nationalism and separatism, reads the program that was  adopted. The charter stresses that any member disseminating  nationalist ideas will be ousted from the party. The new party  will struggle against the practice according to which minority  members only become members of parties formed on an ethnic  foundation. The party considers itself to be on the right side  of the political spectrum and supports the mixed election  system. The first national forum will take place by the end of  the year. Informed sources think that several local DPS  branches will participate.    [DPS spokesman] Yunal Lyutfi described the new party as a  new  attempt to split the DPS and predicted that it will have the  same fate as Adem Kenan's organization.</p>

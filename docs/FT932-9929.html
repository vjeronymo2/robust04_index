			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Poland to restart bank debt payments POLAND is to resume limited interest payments on its Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 7.8bn) debt to western commercial banks on May 20, Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, its chief debt negotiator, said in Warsaw yesterday. The resumption of monthly payments of Dollars 5m, or 10 per cent of the interest due, follows a round of talks with the banks in London last week. The annual interest payment of Dollars 60m is equivalent to the payments Poland made on a Dollars 1.1bn revolving credit dating from 1983 which it stopped servicing in January. Poland, which ended interest payments on the bulk of its commercial debt in the autumn of 1989, is seeking a 50 per cent reduction of its debt burden in a deal comparable to its 1991 Paris Club agreement with western governments, under which it will have to resume full interest payments in 1995 of around Dollars 1.3bn a year on its reduced debt of Dollars 27bn. Mr Krowacki said Poland is seeking a London Club agreement allowing it to buy back a third of the debt and issue 30-year par and discount bonds for the remainder.</p>

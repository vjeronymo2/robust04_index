			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Gyorgy </F> Jozsef Farkas in Bratislava; date not given: "We Need  Predictable Relations"]    [Text] Five days after the establishment of the Moravcik  government, the defense minister will be the first minister to  travel abroad: Pavol Kanis is making a one-day visit to  Budapest on 21 March, where he will meet his Hungarian  counterpart, Lajos Fur. Kanis gave an interview to  NEPSZABADSAG's Bratislava correspondent on his views on the  talks.    [Farkas] Why is Budapest your first destination in your  capacity as minister?    [Kanis] When I began my office, I decided that I would first  visit the Visegrad countries, and Hungary first, if for no other  reason than that Visegrad is here.    [Farkas] According to the preliminary statement on your  visit issued on 18 March, you will discuss the Partnership for  Peace, among other things. How should we understand this?    [Kanis] This is a very important element of my talks with  all of our neighbors. I would like to learn about their views  on the NATO Partnership for Peace program and the way they  interpret the possibilities of cooperation within this.  Naturally, I will also inform my colleagues--Defense Minister  Fur first--of our ideas. In my view, the Partnership for Peace  itself provides a serious opportunity for the Central European  countries to get closer to the West European security systems.  However, a more stable inner security in our region--namely, in  Central Europe--can significantly contribute to this. It is  definitely worth exchanging our views on this issue.    [Farkas] Cooperation between the Hungarian and Slovak armies  has been fairly good. It can certainly be assessed as better  than our interstate relations.    [Kanis] I am convinced that our states need reliable and  predictable relations, including the notion of security, and  this in turn affects relations between the two Armies.    Naturally, in today's Europe, the armed forces and the  issues  of security policy are strongly related and are organically  connected to the solution of our region's concrete problems or  to establishing the conditions for the solutions.    [Farkas] In addition to being a minister, your negotiating  partner is chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the  leading Hungarian Government party, while you are the first  deputy chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left. Can this  obvious contrast cause any difficulties in the military  cooperation that you describe as good?    [Kanis] In my view, this kind of meeting has primarily to be  determined by professional issues and the discussion of security  policy. I would add that the quality of our relations should  not be influenced by what kind of government our countries have  at a given moment. This can also be applied to the political  affiliation of the given defense ministers. In this case, we  cannot think of anything but the fact that we have to do  everything we can to improve bilateral relations, and this task  is irrespective of party affiliations. It is known that a broad  coalition consisting of a number of parties is now in government  in Slovakia, and we clarify and decide very many issues through  debates. As for our foreign relations, in my view it is  favorable that the parties in our government maintain good  relations with the political forces close to them in several  neighboring countries.</p>

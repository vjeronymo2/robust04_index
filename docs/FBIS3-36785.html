			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys left for Copenhagen  today. The Latvian and Estonian foreign ministers are expected  to arrive there too. A meeting with Danish Foreign Minister  Niels Helveg Petersen will be held to discuss the links of the  Baltic states with NATO.    The three foreign ministers were invited to Copenhagen to  discuss the Partnership for Peace agreement, because Denmark  feels it has a special responsibility for the Baltic states.  The agreement is not yet a proposal to become a member of NATO;  however, it provides the possibility of taking part in joint  military exercises and receiving consultations from NATO if a  threat arises against these states.    It has been proposed to determine the date of the expiry of  the agreement and the conditions of future membership. Apart  from this, the costs with regard to the partnership and  practical means of cooperation wdill be discussed at the meeting.    The relations of the Baltic countries with the European  Union  will be one of the issues under discussion.</p>

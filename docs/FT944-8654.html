			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: MIM prices Asarco offer at USDollars 28 a share MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group, said its 24.5 per cent stake in Asarco, the US mining company, would be sold via a public offering at a price of USDollars 28 a share, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. This is slightly in excess of book value, and will raise about Dollars 290m. The offering is underwritten by CS First Boston and S. G. Warburg. MIM, which has been steadily disposing of its non-core assets and investments, first announced plans to sell the Asarco stake in mid-October.</p>

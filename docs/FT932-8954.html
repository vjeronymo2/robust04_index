			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Arts Council to patronise the underdogs - Off the Wall THAT BAND of unregenerate old hippies, the members of the Arts Council, gathered at Woodstock this week, to overthrow the national arts scene as we know it. OK, it was Woodstock Oxford rather than Woodstock NY, but their conclusions would have received a cool 'right on' from any survivors of the 1960's. Cultural diversity; more money for education and 'outreach'; support for new creative works; along with finally biting the bullet and funding fewer arts organisations better, were the buzz words to emerge from the two day conflab. In addition to these familiar good intentions there were some actual specifics - contemporary dance and the visual arts are going to receive more subsidy at the expense, it seems, of the theatre, in particular the regional theatre. So the two most unpopular art forms win out over the most popular. Contemporary dance has been shedding its always tiny audience quite dramatically in recent years and the visual arts, by which the Arts Council means contemporary art, is the most elitist and universally disparaged arts activity in the land. Fortunately the Arts Council has also chosen the two most insignificant art forms to patronise. It gives less than Pounds 2m of its 1993-94 budget of Pounds 225m to contemporary dance, and only around Pounds 5m to the visual arts. They can hardly absorb more than an extra Pounds 3m between them, so, in theory, few local theatres, or orchestras, or popular classical ballet companies need disappear through this prejudice. An even bigger constraint on a wide scale slaughter is government funding. The government is pledged to reduce its subsidy to the Arts Council by Pounds 5m in 1994-95. History suggests that a planned budget has never actually taken effect - last minute lobbying has always secured more cash - but this year the government could actually take its axe to the arts. The Heritage Minister, Peter Brooke, is weak and the Pounds 50b national overdraft is awesome. The Council's secretary general, Anthony Everitt, said yesterday: 'I am very glum'. So the nation's arts companies can expect to hear in December that they will have their grants cut, and the Council will probably take advantage of the universal misery to start its commitment to withdraw cash from some clients and give more to others. The howls of anguish will be very loud but the government will take most of the flak. A year ago the Arts Council seemed to be on the way out. Now it is taking the initiative. It has made clear it expects the Regional Arts Boards to fall in line with its policy and it is looking forward to getting its hands on the Lottery money devoted to the arts. But with a government commissioned report into its operations by Price Waterhouse landing on the Heritage Ministers desk any day now its ebullience may be short lived. When not chairing the Arts Council, Lord Palumbo is a property tycoon. All the more galling for him then that the Council must pay out Pounds 500,000 a year in rent on a property it has not occupied for years. The Council moved out of its grand premises at 105, Piccadilly to a more modest home in Westminster in 1991, but it still carries the lease on a building at the rear of 105, which was acquired to accommodate a staff over-flow. It has been frantically seeking a new tenant, but with no luck. With almost five years of the lease still left to run the Council needs a quick pick up in the property market to release this sizeable sum of money which could be the life blood for many hard pressed arts companies. Another blow for Lord Palumbo is that his brain child, the Arts Foundation, the organisation set up to foster the avant-garde in the arts, ended its first year with a deficit of over Pounds 50,000. In addition to the investment income it received on its Pounds 1m endowment from the mysterious benefactor, Mr Hoch, it attracted only Pounds 1,000 in additional revenue. So income of Pounds 140,000 was far exceeded by expenditure, which included just Pounds 49,000 in grants. With the Foundation currently awaiting its new director its future looks bleak. The arts sponsorship industry was in a self-congratulatory mood when it gathered at the Tate this week to celebrate the winners of the Goodman and Garrett Awards. Lord Sainsbury was Pounds 10,000 richer after receiving a cheque from Lord Goodman in appreciation of his voluntary encouragement of business support for the arts, while Ruth McKenzie of the Nottingham Playhouse took the professionals award from Lord Garrett for boosting the sponsorship take at the Playhouse from Pounds 2,000 in 1990 to Pounds 117,800 today. Of course the winners pass on the cash, Lord Sainsbury giving his money to the Benesh Institute of Choreology, which records the dance steps of ballets, and Ruth McKenzie to the Playhouse educational programme. The awards were, in their turn, sponsored by Reed Elsevier. For once the speeches were fierce, Lord Sainsbury taking a swipe at the Arts Council (which had eliminated the Benesh's annual grant) and Lord Goodman comparing today's Arts Ministers unfavourably with Ministers of the past, especially Jennie Lee. The current incumbent, Peter Brooke, diplomatically left before Lord Goodman spoke, but there is a growing groundswell in the arts world that he must fight his corner more fiercely with the Treasury ministers - or go. The one topic not mentioned was the current disaster affecting the hosts of the evening, the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts. A routine audit in March suggested that the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, which ABSA administers on behalf of the Government, had given Pounds 150,000 in top up grants to imaginary arts companies claiming to have received sponsorship money from equally mythical companies, or their subsidiaries. The British Sponsorship Incentive Scheme administrator Nicholas Wood is currently on police bail. ABSA hopes to retrieve a good slice of the money. A few years ago a short lived West End play was based on the idea of an obscure northern theatre, which put on bingo and striptease, asking for, and receiving, an Arts Council grant. The boundaries between the arts and reality have always been murky.</p>

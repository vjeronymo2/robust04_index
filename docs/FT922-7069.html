			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Acquisitions steady in first quarter but total value falls ACQUISITIONS in the UK remained steady in the first quarter of this year but the value of transactions fell. There were 124 transactions with an estimated total value of Pounds 2.2bn in the first quarter of 1992, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. The total value of initial payments on acquisitions of UK industrial and commercial companies was down Pounds 2.1bn on the last quarter of 1991, when there were 130 transactions, and down Pounds 11.1bn from the 1989 peak. Independent companies were involved in 72 of the sales, and subsidiaries in 52. There were no mergers. Thirty transactions were valued at more than Pounds 10m and 49 at less than Pounds 1m. The largest were the acquisition of Steetley by Redland, valued at Pounds 624m, the sale of IEP (Automotive) to Inchcape Overseas for Pounds 363m, and Bowater's purchase of DRG for Pounds 201m. Cash expenditure accounted for 58 per cent of the total, ordinary shares for 41 per cent, and fixed-interest securities for the remaining 1 per cent. Cash has comprised more than half of expenditure in every quarter since the stock market crash of October 1987. The figures omit cross-border acquisitions. Shareholders of quoted companies in the east Midlands have fared better over the past year than the companies themselves, according to an analysis published yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. The analysis covered the published results of 74 companies, and showed that while, on average, pre-tax profits fell 5.1 per cent and earnings attributable to shareholders fell 19 per cent, shareholders received a 17 per cent increase in dividends. KPMG says 11,500 people have lost their jobs in the region in the past year. Turnover of the companies in the survey totalled more than Pounds 19bn, and was 2 per cent higher than in 1990-91.

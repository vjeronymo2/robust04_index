			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Management: Fiat's boss in waiting - Gabriele Galateri di Genola is tipped to head Italy's biggest private-sector group / Euromanagers to watch A publicity-shy scion of aristocrats who made their name fighting for the former kings of Italy may not be the most obvious future boss of Fiat, one of Europe's biggest industrial companies. The choice seems even less appropriate for someone whose entire career has been in finance and whose sharp looks are more those of the international investment banker than the hard-nosed industrial manager typical of the Turin-based cars' group. Yet in spite of his reluctance to be interviewed, let alone quoted, Gabriele Galateri di Genola, managing director of the Fiat-dominated Ifil investment company, is tipped to head Italy's biggest private-sector company before long. Any change at the top of Fiat will be part of the gradual change already under way within the group, which has seen the controlling Agnelli family progressively withdraw from everyday involvement and a new cadre of top-line managers increasingly take over the reins. 'I'd take him on tomorrow if I thought he'd move,' is how one of Fiat's leading rivals sums up his view of Galateri. However, the chances are remote that the man who was promoted this month to managing director of Ifi, the quoted investment company which controls Ifil, will break ranks with the quasi-regal Agnellis who control the Fiat empire. His loyalties are pegged to the family, notably Umberto Agnelli, Ifil's chairman and the younger of the two Agnelli brothers who dominate its far-flung business interests. Together, Galateri and Umberto Agnelli have built up Ifil from a captive Fiat company, whose main asset was Fiat shares, into an internationally diversified holding group with activities ranging from retailing to resorts, food to fancy goods. The strategy has worked: consolidated net profits soared 260 per cent from L54bn (Pounds 21.8m) in 1987, just after Galateri joined, to L193bn last year. Galateri's loyalty to his employers may be in the blood. His Piedmontese antecedents were among the closest supporters of the House of Savoy - Italy's former royal family - and its Turin court. Yet Galateri abhors the Italian tendency of identifying companies with their controlling shareholders or managing directors. 'The star system in Italy is something I don't personally like very much,' he says. His management style is exactly the opposite. Press shy to the extreme, his face hardly ever appears in the papers. Interviews are rare, while he refuses, unlike many prominent colleagues, to be quoted on popular issues of the day. Discretion may be the better part of valour. Still only 46, Galateri has swiftly and successfully climbed the Agnelli corporate ladder. After studying law at Rome, he took an MBA at Columbia and entered the international division of Banco di Roma. He then moved to St Gobain, where he became finance director of the Italian subsidiary at 27 and assistant to the group finance chief in Paris soon after. In 1977 came the decisive move to Fiat, first as an executive in the finance department responsible for the Americas. Six years later, he was promoted to finance director. In 1986, he transferred to Ifil with the mandate to rejuvenate what was largely a shell used for internal group transactions, such as the complex mid-1980s' assets swap when cash-rich Ifil bought a large block of Fiat shares formerly held by the Libyan government. His goals were to diversify and internationalise. Investments had to be made in non-cyclical businesses to complement the volatile cars side. And the heavy dependence on Italy had to be reduced to smooth Ifil's earnings stream. Foods, tourism and, most recently, retailing were identified as ideal investment candidates, promising reliable, if undramatic, profits growth and the potential for capital gains. Product diversification went hand in hand with strategic partnerships with foreign specialists in Ifil's chosen sectors, notably in France, to broaden its geographic scope. Those partnerships have been underscored by equity stakes, funded invariably through Ifil's cash flow or rights issues rather than debt. Saint-Louis, the French industrial group with substantial food industry interests, has become one key partner. Ifil now holds more than 15 per cent and has an agreement to rise to more than 30 per cent, putting it on a par with the controlling Worms family. Galateri's choice in tourism has also taken Ifil across the Alps. Ifil has an agreement with France's big Accor hotels group to create a new hotel chain in Italy. But the most lucrative partnership so far involves BSN, the big French foods group, in which Ifil has almost 6 per cent. Ifil has made big capital gains by selling its domestic food operations to its bigger French partner, eager to break into the tightly controlled Italian market, while the two companies also have an ambitious joint venture in Asia. The strategies have worked well. Ifil's dependence on Italy has fallen from 100 per cent in January 1987 to 51 per cent now. Over the same period, its exposure to Fiat has fallen to 34 per cent from 67 per cent. This month brought two further advances for Galateri: his appointment alongside Umberto Agnelli as joint managing directorship of Ifi, confirming his place as one of the Agnellis' most trusted lieutenants; and the conclusion of Ifil's controversial bid to take control of La Rinascente, the Fiat-controlled retailer. He denies criticism that Rinascente was foisted on Ifil by Fiat's bankers to bolster Fiat finances during a heavy investment phase. With Italian retailing going through a belated revolution as small city-centre shops give way to hypermarkets, Rinascente is well placed to benefit, he believes. And considerable scope exists for synergies between Ifil's interests in producing food and Rinascente's expertise in selling it. For a manager in a country where business has largely steered clear of big international alliances, it is a considerable record. But the close association with the Agnellis also means a commitment to Turin, the home of Fiat. 'I feel just as comfortable here as in London, Paris or New York,' he says. 'The style of work doesn't differ in any way.' 'A manager's lifestyle here can be different. I have a very quiet working environment and there's much less stress. Bigger cities may be more exciting, but which is better on balance?'</p>

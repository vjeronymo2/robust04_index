			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to recordkeeping, the State has adopted those items recommended in the EPA's guidance and specifies that sources subject to Stage II must make these documents available upon request: (1) A copy of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order for the specific Stage II vapor recovery system installed at the facility, (2) results of verification tests, (3) equipment maintenance and compliance file logs indicating compliance with manufacturer's specifications and requirements, (4) training certification files, and (5) inspection and compliance records. In addition, the State has committed in their SIP supplement to maintain a general compliance file, including information such as facility name, address, phone number, owner/operator names, a State assigned reference number, date of initial compliance with the regulations, number of pumps and monthly gasoline throughput. The State has also established an inspection function consistent with that described in the EPA's guidance. The State commits to conducting inspections of facilities including a visual inspection of the Stage II equipment and of the required records and a functional test of the Stage II equipment. According to the Supplement, the State shall inspect each facility at least one time per year with follow-up inspections at noncomplying facilities. Finally, the State has established procedures for enforcing violations of the Stage II requirements, and has committed to establish a penalty schedule in the SIP. A detailed draft penalty schedule has already been developed by the State. Administrative penalties may be assessed of up to $10,000 per day per violation and civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day per violation. The EPA finds the State's program for implementation and enforcement of the Stage II program to be consistent with the EPA guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the EPA finds that the State has adopted a Stage II SIP in accordance with section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, as interpreted in EPA's guidance, the EPA is proposing to approve the submittal as meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. section 600 et. seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S.E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions from the requirements of section three of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years (54 FR 2222). The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air pollution control; Hydrocarbons; Environmental protection; Incorporation by reference; Intergovernmental relations; Ozone; Reporting and recordkeeping requirements; Volatile organic compounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR Part 81 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air, pollution, control. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 24, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> W.B.

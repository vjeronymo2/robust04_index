			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Prisons hit by striking officers MORE than 100 of France's 150 prisons were yesterday hit by a prison officers' strike called in protest against the murder of one of their colleagues by a prisoner at Rouen jail. The prison authorities began negotiations with the officers' union to end the strike which started in Rouen on Tuesday and has since spread to other jails across France. The talks over the officers' demands for tighter control of violent inmates lasted two and a half hours before being suspended. There were outbreaks of violence at several jails yesterday. Police were called to two detention centres at Lyon, a centre for young offenders at Fleury-Merogis and to jails at Baumettes near Marseille and Gradignan near Bordeaux.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS JOIN TO PUT PRESSURE ON IRAQ;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST: BAKER AND SHEVARDNADZE CALL FOR A WORLDWIDE EMBARGO ON ARMS SALES  TO BAGHDAD.  </P> <P> In an unprecedented show of superpower cooperation, the Soviet Union and the  United States today demanded that all countries cut off arms supplies to Iraq  because of its invasion of Kuwait, and the Soviet foreign minister predicted  that Iraq would soon withdraw from Kuwait.  </P> <P> The minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and Secretary of State James A. Baker III  read a joint statement demanding the arms cutoff to reporters after a hastily  scheduled, one-hour meeting at a Moscow airport.  </P> <P> The U.S.-Soviet statement noted that the Soviet Union had cut off arms supplies  to Iraq on Thursday and that the United States had frozen Iraqi assets. The two  superpowers also demanded in the statement that Iraq withdraw its troops from  Kuwait.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze also told reporters, "We have been assured that very soon the  Iraqis will pull out their troops." He said the Soviets, until this week Iraq's  largest arms supplier, learned this through contacts in Baghdad.  </P> <P> After Iraq overran Kuwait on Thursday, ostensibly because of a dispute over oil  and a border region, it said its forces could withdraw within a week or two.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said the Soviet leadership had sent a message to Iraqi leader  Saddam Hussein on Thursday, but he did not reveal the contents.  </P> <P> The U.S.-Soviet statement demanded that other countries stop sending arms to  Iraq, but it did not mention by name the Middle East nation's other major  weapons suppliers.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze opened the news conference by saying the Kremlin's decision to cut  off its arms supplies to Iraq was difficult. "It wasn't so easy for us to make  the kind of statement we made yesterday" because Soviet relations with Iraq had  been good for decades, he said.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said the invasion "contradicts the principles of new political  thinking and the principles of civilized relations between nations."  </P> <P> A report on Soviet TV news said, "The statement contains an appeal to the  international public to come out together in condemnation of the act of  aggression." Washington and Moscow have condemned the invasion on their own.  </P> <P> Baker's plane arrived in Moscow from Mongolia today more than an hour late  because a tire blew when it landed for refueling in the Siberian city of  Irkutsk. Baker cut short his state visit to Mongolia for the Moscow talks and  to return to Washington.  </P> <P> Before leaving the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, Baker told reporters: "I  just hope that the United States and Soviet Union could join in a joint  statement regarding this matter. The fact, I think, of our doing that would be  quite unique and rather significant."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAYING ITS BILLS ON TIME IS NOT THE PENTAGON'S STRONG SUIT  </P> <P> When defense experts debate critical issues of national security, the  Pentagon's inability to pay small aerospace contractors on time seldom comes up  -- even though some of them have been driven into virtual insolvency.  </P> <P> At the start of this year, 12,000 Defense Department payments to small  businesses in the West were late because of computer foul-ups, rapid employee  turnover and the Pentagon's complex bureaucratic rules, among other reasons.  </P> <P> The computer software that the Defense Department uses to process contracts in  a Los Angeles office, for example, is more than 20 years old. About 35% of the  employees who use the computers leave government service every year. And  contract regulations are so complex that many small firms hire consultants at  government expense just to fill out government forms.  </P> <P> The situation, which has driven some companies out of defense contracting, has  prompted an uncharacteristically angry response by the defense industry. Two  trade groups, representing larger contractors who have also had problems, have  been formed to protest payment delays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Verge of Breakdown'  </P> <P> The problem has raised troubling questions of whether the entire structure of  defense procurement -- writing contracts, handling paper work and issuing  payments -- is in crisis. While the military services are pushing the limits of  technology in weaponry, relatively simple matters -- like getting a check in  the mail -- seem to be a problem.  </P> <P> The payment snafus appear to reflect a larger Defense Department problem of  attempting to do too much on a shrinking budget. The mismatch between the  Pentagon's agenda and what it can realistically afford has led to such policies  as forcing contractors to develop new weapons at a loss; program schedules  being stretched out; and drastic reductions in quantities of weapons on order,  which in turn drives up prices.  </P> <P> "I worry that the whole procurement system is on the verge of a nervous  breakdown," Rep. Les Aspin (D -- Wis.), who chairs the House Armed Services  Committee, said in a recent interview. "If morale is low and people are  unhappy, it is going to affect the quality of the products. Morale is terrible  right now. Everybody is unhappy with the system."  </P> <P> The longstanding problems in the Pentagon's business functions are finally  getting some attention. The House Armed Services Committee last week launched  an investigation into late payment problems at the Defense Contract  Administration Service, the Pentagon agency that disburses $51 billion annually  to contractors in the Western United States.  </P> <P> Brig. Gen. John Serur, commander of the regional DCAS office, said in a recent  interview that the worst of the immediate problems have been solved. Of the  12,000 delinquent bills at the beginning of this year, he said, 3,330 remained  at the end of March.  </P> <P> "I know there is light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "Please don't  misunderstand. We still have backlogs (of unpaid bills.) As long as we have  those backlogs, we have contractors with complaints."  </P> <P> Indeed, some contractors say they have detected little improvement in bill  payments, and even when longstanding delinquent accounts are paid off, they  add, they are left with bitter feelings about the experience.  </P> <P> Sunrise Electronics of Glendora, for example, was unable to meet the payroll  for its 10 employees last month when it failed to receive a check from DCAS for  an invoice submitted in January.  </P> <P> "You go down to the bank to borrow money and they don't understand," said Vice  President Alan Carey about Sunrise's efforts to get bank credit. "It is beyond  their comprehension."  </P> <P> As a result of the experience, Sunrise is refusing to accept any new contracts  in which DCAS is the designated payment authority. The company recently struck  an agreement with the Navy under which the service will pay it directly for a  contract that would ordinarily be handled by DCAS.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Behind in Know-How  </P> <P> "It is a sad situation over there at DCAS," Carey said. "The attitude of the  people is dismal. If it weren't for a few caring civil servants, nothing would  get done."  </P> <P> Some defense experts, however, worry that persistent budget cutting, low  federal pay and additional regulations will override even the best intentions  of the "servants" in the government system.  </P> <P> "We want to buy all these really fancy weapons and spend billions on new  systems, but we don't have the money to make the system work from an  administrative standpoint," said Michael Beltramo, a defense industry  consultant. "We are making it so difficult to do business with the government  that you have to ask yourself whether it is even worth the bother any more. The  system is too awful to comprehend."  </P> <P> Essentially, Beltramo and others are asking whether the Pentagon is capable of  dealing with high technology such as the Star Wars missile defense shield when  its business system is not up to 1960s levels of administrative know-how.  </P> <P> "There is too much focus on the big picture and not enough on the things that  make the system work," said Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne), a member of the  House Small Business Committee and one of a handful of Congress members who  have been involved in helping small firms get paid by DCAS.  </P> <P> "I have received a flow of letters from contractors," Dreier said. "These  letters are going to be a major issue that we raise. This should not be  happening."  </P> <P> Although contractors have long complained about late payments by the DCAS  office in Los Angeles, a series of problems late last year resulted in a new  surge of delinquent payments. DCAS, in a letter to contractors in February,  admitted to a "deterioration of operations."  </P> <P> A sprinkler system had malfunctioned late last year and partially flooded a  computer room in the agency's Los Angeles area office in El Segundo, Serur  said. Also, a weather balloon had landed in a nearby power grid and caused an  interruption of electricity to computers; that problem could have been avoided  by a backup power supply system that had been forgone as an economy measure.  Then there was new computer software that would not operate properly and caused  a three-day shutdown, the general said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reluctance to Complain  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some contractors, such as Richard Puga, owner of Puga Engineering  near Watts, were told that "the check is in the mail." But, all too often, the  check was not in the mail and tempers continued to rise.  </P> <P> Major prime contractors are just as angry but are more reluctant to make their  feelings public. A vice president at one major Los Angeles defense firm said  75% of its payments from DCAS are more than 30 days late and that the average  invoice is still unpaid after 180 days.  </P> <P> "We had some that were a year old," he said.  </P> <P> Under federal law, DCAS must pay interest to a contractor if it fails to pay a  bill within 45 days. So far this fiscal year, the DCAS regional office has paid  out $790,000 in interest, up from $417,000 during all of fiscal 1988, Serur  said. The interest total would be even higher, but DCAS does not pay when it  loses invoices or on certain types of disbursements known as progress payments.  </P> <P> Even the military services are getting angry at DCAS. Both the Navy and the  Army have complained that the agency is paying contractors out of the incorrect  accounts.  </P> <P> For example, the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command notified DCAS last month  that it had paid bills to FMC Corp. in San Jose with funds belonging to the  nation of Portugal in connection with foreign military sales, according to  internal DCAS documents obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> A DCAS public affairs officer said, "People do make errors. It seems to happen  because we have turnover of staff and we have borrowed staff. It has been  happening, but not to a real large extent."  </P> <P> While problems with computers can be fixed and accounting errors can be  remedied, inadequate federal pay and the inability to retain workers is a  longer-range problem. Many of the workers who process the millions of pages of  defense paper work earn $12,000 to $14,000 a year, about half of what they  would get in private industry and just at the poverty line for a family of  four.  </P> <P> Serur said DCAS has been forced to hire recent high school graduates to conduct  voucher examinations, in which contractor billings must be verified against the  terms of contracts. It is hardly work for inexperienced young people,  especially because defense regulations have grown so complex in recent years,  observed Beltramo, the consultant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bad Situation Inherited  </P> <P> William Jenkins, a recently retired DCAS official responsible for personnel,  said he is happy to be out of the agency.  </P> <P> "It didn't have the reputation I like," he said. "We couldn't hire good people.  The people we trained would go to industry."  </P> <P> Jenkins said Serur, who became head of DCAS' regional office in 1984, inherited  a bad situation that had festered for years. "Of all the generals we have had  there, he was the most approachable," Jenkins said. DCAS' workload has  increased dramatically in recent years owing to Pentagon budget growth and to  the increasing complexity of defense regulations.  </P> <P> At the same time, the DCAS work force has grown more and more inexperienced.  Serur said that 60% of his employees have less than two years' experience.  </P> <P> In part because the government can no longer afford to pay its employees enough  to live in Los Angeles, the Pentagon announced two months ago that it has  decided to consolidate its nine regional DCAS payment offices around the  country in Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> The hope is that the government will be able to attract a more stable work  force in Columbus that will be able to live adequately on government salaries.  The Defense Logistics Agency, DCAS' parent organization, is setting up its new  finance center in a former Air Force-owned industrial plant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move Could Worsen Things  </P> <P> But the prospect of a monolithic federal bureaucracy handling $51 billion in  payments annually has worried defense industry executives even more than the  problems at DCAS' regional office. While Pentagon officials insist that the  Columbus operation will provide a solution, congressional officials are not  sure.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that when they start the move from Los Angeles to Columbus this  summer, things could get much worse," an investigator from the House Armed  Services Committee said last week. "That's what we are hearing from some  contractors."  </P> <P> Some bankers are also worried that the selection of Columbus was  ill-considered. When a contractor in Los Angeles receives a large payment,  which can be in the tens of millions of dollars, a courier typically will pick  up the check at DCAS' office in El Segundo and take it to the Federal Reserve  Bank branch in downtown Los Angeles. Such handling reduces the time the  contracting firm must wait to actually get the money credited to its account.  </P> <P> There is no Federal Reserve Bank branch in Columbus, however, and contractors  will have to have couriers take the checks to Cleveland to clear them.  Otherwise, the checks will be mailed to the contractors, a prospect that could  add several days to the payment cycle. On a $25-million payment, for example,  that can cost more than $20,000 in additional interest on a three-day postal  excursion. Such a loss of interest is not reimbursable under federal  regulations.  </P> <P> The Pentagon is attempting to create the capability to transfer funds  electronically, something private banks and major corporations have done for  years. The capability is scheduled to be available this summer, William  Cassell, comptroller of the Defense Logistics Agency, said in an interview.  </P> <P> But one aerospace company vice president is skeptical. "Just knowing what it  takes us to train our own people internally raises concerns that they will not  be able to do it," he said.  </P> <P> James Southerland, president of Contract Advisory Services, a Torrance firm  that helps small contractors with their paper work, said the government often  compounds its late payment problems by taking discounts for prompt payment even  when the payments are late. If contractors mischarged the government in such a  fashion, Beltramo said, it is likely that they would be indicted for fraud.  </P> <P> Aspin, the House Armed Services Committee chairman, has grown increasingly  concerned about horror stories in the business functions of the procurement  system.  </P> <P> "You have a system that could freeze up on you," he said. "In the procurement  area, one problem is the continual set of reforms that have gone into effect  before the previous set has been digested.  </P> <P> "These changes are coming too fast for the system. You have problems with  people working under the old regulations and they don't even know about the new  regulations."  </P></p>

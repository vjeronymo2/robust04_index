Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the world. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity, or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806, January 5, (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board previously has approved acting as a futures commission merchant in executing and clearing the proposed commodity contracts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bank of Montreal, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1049 (1993);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P. Morgan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The Board also previously has approved providing a combination of advisory services regarding nonfinancial commodity derivatives and acting as a futures commission merchant in the execution and clearance of these derivatives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P. Morgan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant proposes to conduct the proposed activities in a manner that differs slightly from what previously has been approved by the Board. Specifically, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P. Morgan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Board conditioned approval of the application on J.P. Morgan's commitment that it would not perform execution, clearance or investment advisory services for commodity funds (or commodity pools) owned, sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, J.P. Morgan. In contrast, Applicant proposes that Company's customers would include a managed commodity fund formed outside of the United States, sponsored by an affiliate of Applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than May 23, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jennifer J.

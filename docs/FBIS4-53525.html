			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From ASAHI SHIMBUN 19 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] DRPK (North Korean) President Kim Il-song recently  gave an interview to Korean-American journalist Mun Myong-cha,  in which he said that the United States and the ROK are "trying  to corner" North Korea on the nuclear issue, and strongly  criticized moves to get the UN Security Council to impose  economic sanctions. Kim expressed a desire to resume high-level  negotiations between the United States and North Korea. He also  indicated a willingness to reopen negotiations with Japan on the  normalization of relations, saying: "No matter who the prime  minister is, the door is always open."    The interview was conducted at the presidential palace in  Pyongyang on 21 April. Moon revealed the contents of the  interview to an ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo before he  actually publishes the story in U.S. ASIA NEWS, for which he  works as chief editor.    Kim said during the interview that if North Korea has the  capability to manufacture nuclear arms, it would not bother to  hold a dialogue with the United States. He thus reiterated his  denial of allegations about the DPRK's development of nuclear  weapons.    Kim also disclosed that during high-level U.S.-DPRK talks  last year, the United States pledged to provide assistance,  including financial aid, to help the DPRK shift to light-water  reactors which produce very little plutonium. This is believed  to be an indication of the DRPK's bargaining position as it  tries to eliminate suspicions about its development of nuclear  arms and seeks economic reconstruction through negotiations with  the United States.    Normalization talks between Japan and the DPRK have been  suspended since the eighth round held in 1992. Kim reportedly  stressed that "whatever happens to the Japanese political  situation, our position remains unchanged." Both sides consider  the joint communique on early establishment of diplomatic  relations (in 1990) between the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  and Social Democratic of Japan, and the Korean Workers' Party to  be practically null and void once the non-LDP coalition  government came to power.    Kim's remarks at the interview are seen as an attempt to  prevent the DPRK's isolation over the nuclear issue, and to  undercut cooperation between Japan, the United States, and the  ROK. However, recently, there have also been behind-the-scenes  moves on the part of North Korea to urge Japan to resume  normalization talks. The Japanese Government will now have to  seek ways to resolve this situation while also taking  developments in the U.S.-DPRK dialogue into consideration.</p>

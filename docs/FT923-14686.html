			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Fines on fur co-operative reduced - European Law Fines imposed by the European Commission on the Danish fur breeders' co-operative for breach of EC competition rules were reduced by 40 per cent by the Court of First Instance last week. The fines originally fixed by the Commission at Ecu500,000 were cut on appeal to Ecu300,000 (Pounds 200,000). Danish fur breeders were appealing against a 1988 Commission decision condemning certain aspects of the statutes and agreements of the co-operative on the ground that they restricted competition in the sale of furs in Denmark. The Commission's investigation had been prompted by a complaint by Hudson Bay, the UK fur trader. The CFI partially annulled the Commission's decision after a detailed review of the evidence and legal analysis relied on by the Commission. The Court said the Commission had failed to refer to any evidence for its finding that the co-operative was involved in concerted practices in connection with a non-competition clause in the statutes giving exclusive sales rights to the co-operative's auctions. And the reasoning relied on for the Commission's finding that the agreements with animal skinners amounted to exclusive supply obligations was defective. However the CFI rejected arguments that special allowances should be made for co-operatives under the EC competition rules. It also ruled that the special rules on competition in agriculture could not be extended to products such as furs which were not listed as agricultural products under the Treaty of Rome. The Danish fur breeders were supported in these arguments by the Danish and Belgian governments which failed in their attempt to extend the protection from the full force of the competition rules enjoyed by agricultural co-operatives to the fur breeders. Case T-61/89, Dansk Pelsdyravlerforening v Commission, CFI 2 CH, 2 July 1992. Judicial review of Commission state aid suspension decisions In two important state aid cases last week the European Court of Justice (ECJ) clarified the admissibility of appeals by member countries against Commission decisions to initiate proceedings for infringement of EC state aid rules. Giving its decision on a preliminary issue raised by the Commission, the ECJ ruled that applications by Italy and Spain, for judicial review of Commission decisions to start proceedings against state aid granted by them, were admissible. The Court said that as a result of the procedures deliberately chosen by the Commission, the decisions to start infringement proceedings against Spain and Italy had the legal effect of suspending aid which had already been granted. In the first case Spain had notified the Commission, at the Commission's instigation, of certain planned aid to a group of private electrical equipment manufacturers. However, the Commission did not initiate any proceedings within two months of the notification. In accordance with previous ECJ decisions, this meant the Spanish aid was no longer subject to the normal rules on automatic suspension applicable to 'new' aid, but fell to be dealt with as an 'existing' aid. As a result, when the Commission decided to initiate proceedings against Spain and ordered the aid to be suspended, the ECJ ruled that the Commission had deliberately chosen to adopt a suspension measure which would only apply automatically if the new aid procedure applied. The effect of the Commission's decision therefore was that aid already granted had to be suspended. Moreover any ultimate decision by the Commission that the aid was in fact compatible with the common market could not retrospectively legitimise any breach of the suspension decision. In the second case, the Commission authorised a general aid scheme for the Mezzogiorno notified by Italy in 1986 under a decision adopted in 1988. In 1990, the Italian authorities in the Mezzogiorno made an individual grant of aid under the general scheme to Italgrani, a Neapolitan cereal processing company. In 1991, a competitor, Casillo Grani, complained to the Commission. The Commission took the preliminary view that the Italgrani aid was incompatible with the common market and fell outside the scope of the authorised general scheme either because of the amount involved or because conditions governing aid to the agricultural sector had been infringed. In a letter notifying Italy of the initiation of proceedings for infringement of the EC state aid rules, the Commission referred to Italy's obligation to suspend the aid under the rules applicable to new aids. The ECJ again held that the Commission had deliberately chosen to adopt a procedure normally applicable to new aids in a situation where it could have applied the procedure applicable to existing aids which does not involve suspension. In reaching its decisions in these cases, the Court confirmed the different procedural powers enjoyed by the Commission under the EC state aid rules which vary depending on whether aids are categorised as 'existing' or 'new' aids. One relevant difference is that it is the 'new' aids procedure alone which automatically involves suspension of aid on initiation of infringement proceedings by the Commission. The Court will decide if the Commission has incorrectly categorised the aids in these cases at a later stage. Case C-312/90, Spain v Commission and Case C-47/91, Italy v Commission, ECJ FC, 30 June 1992. Shipping competition case settled Last Friday, Sealink Stena withdrew its appeal against the Commission's interim measures decision relating to sailing schedules between Ireland and England. Following a settlement in which Sealink agreed to modify its timetable in a manner acceptable to B &amp; I, B &amp; I withdrew its complaint and the Commission agreed to discontinue its investigation. Peas processing regime aids In a technical agricultural case, the ECJ interpreted rules on payment of processing aids in connection with special measures designed to encourage pea cultivation for use in animal and human foodstuffs. Under this system, aid is paid to the first purchaser of the products provided the producer receives a minimum price from the purchaser which is fixed each month. The ECJ interpreted the rules, however, to allow the first purchaser to receive the aid when the purchaser has paid in advance a sum equivalent to the minimum price even though the minimum price itself was not paid to the producer.

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 26  February publishes on page 5 a 1,300 word article on President  Kim Yong-sam's remarks made during a news conference on 25  February on the summit talks with North Korea and states that  they are causing considerable confusion, particularly within the  government departments in charge of North Korean relations. The  article points out that the president's remarks will inevitably  result in the adjustment of the repeated three conditions in  resolving the nuclear issue: First, the retreat from the  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty; Second,  acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency inspections;  and Third, agreement on mutual inspections between the South and  the North.    The article goes on to say that the related government  departments are embarrassed by the president's remarks deeming  them as "spontaneous" rather than well studied and planned in  advance.    The author of the article points out that although Chong  Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for security affairs,  tried to extensively explain that this does not run counter to  the government's past North Korean policy, his effort only  highlights the difference between the president's past and  present remarks regarding the nuclear issue and summit talks.    Recalling President Kim's remarks made at the 100-day news  conference on 3 June, 1993 when he said "We cannot shake hands  with someone who possesses nuclear arms" and in his inauguration  speech on 25 February, 1993 when he said "I could meet with Kim  Il-song anytime, anywhere" the reporter notes that it could be  said that there have been temporary changes in policy but that  the president's philosophy of the national issue remains  unchanged. However, he adds, what embarrassed officials in  charge of North Korean affairs was that the remarks were made at  a sensitive time when the North Korea-U.S. contacts in New York  were ongoing. The article asserts that the president's remarks  caused suspicion over the consistency of the government policy  on North Korea and may affect North Korea's strategy on contacts  with the United States.    The article notes that the concern over the consistency of  the president's North Korean policy is also based on the  president's contradicting remarks made on two occasions at the  Asia Pacific Economic Council on 24 February and during the 26  June interview with the BBC. The article says that in the  former, Kim Yong-sam said "the North Korean issue should be  resolved in the view of partnership for the prosperity of Asia  Pacific," and in the latter, he said "the ROK is fully prepared  for the potential of military conflict."    The author of the article explains that some believe that  President Kim's frequent change of position is for "domestic  use" but it will be difficult for the working-level officials to  establish consistent policy if the supreme leader is shaken.    Finally, the article states that as far as the North Korean  policy is concerned, the president should have a firm philosophy  regardless of the public opinion and have frequent conversations  with the senior presidential secretary for foreign and security  affairs and reunification-related ministers so that they can  properly assist the president.</p>

The government  resolution is due to both the contract expiry date and  Ostankino's debt to Telecom. Government press representative Ain  Saarna has said that Ostankino's debt to Estonian Telecom  amounts to 185,000 German marks. Making allowances to viewers'  requests, Telecom will continue to relay the Mexican television  serial Simply Maria.</p>

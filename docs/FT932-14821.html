			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Midland chief sold shares MR BRIAN Pearse, the chief executive of HSBC's Midland Bank subsidiary, sold most of his Midland Bank shares last year for an estimated Pounds 1.3m, rather than accept the offer of new HSBC securities, it emerged yesterday, writes Robert Peston. Midland was acquired last year by HSBC. The annual report of HSBC, which also owns Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Marine Midland in the US, discloses that in August 1992, Mr Pearse exercised options granted in 1991 to acquire 300,000 Midland Bank ordinary shares. Of these, he sold 290,000 shares and transferred the balance to a member of his family, who accepted the HSBC takeover offer. The annual report also discloses that Sir William Purves, HSBC's chairman, was paid HKDollars 10.6m (Pounds 883,000) last year, up 14 per cent on the previous year.</p>

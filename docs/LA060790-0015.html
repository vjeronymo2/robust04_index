			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Dead Barred From Maryland: A concert pavilion in Columbia, Md., is the latest  to ban concerts by the Grateful Dead because of its fans. The 14,000-seat  Merriweather Post Pavilion granted a police request to end scheduling of  concerts by the veteran rock 'n' roll band and the Jerry Garcia Band, headed by  the Grateful Dead's lead guitarist, said Jean Parker, general manager of the  14,000-seat amphitheater. Several other venues, including Stanford University  and the University of California at Berkeley, had banned the group in April  because of recurring drug-related arrests at concerts.

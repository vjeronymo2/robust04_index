			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CYCLISTS ANGRY OVER PLAN FOR FREEWAY PATH  </P> <P> San Diego bicyclists, angry over what they call a broken promise by local  officials to build an isolated bicycle path along California 52, plan to ask  decision-makers this morning to quash a proposal allowing bicyclists to ride on  the shoulder of the freeway.  </P> <P> The San Diego Assn. of Governments today most likely will grant just $110,000  of the $335 million allocated for the 1991 freeway project for a bikeway,  enough to designate a cycling path on the freeway's shoulder.  </P> <P> But members of the countywide Bicycle Coalition say the proposal, presented by  a Sandag executive committee and officials from Caltrans, does not adequately  protect bicyclists or encourage biking over driving, a key goal of city and  county officials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parallel Route  </P> <P> The enthusiasts are requesting an estimated $6-million, 3- to 4-mile isolated  bike path running parallel to the southern edge of the proposed California 52  extension, from Santo Road to Mission Gorge Road near Santee.  </P> <P> "I can't think of any place that allows you to ride on shoulders of freeways in  urban areas like this," said Ed Reilly, spokesman for the coalition. "What  Sandag is really doing is not giving us any biking facility there at all."  </P> <P> And if that's not agreeable, coalition members say, they'll compromise: $3  million for the initial grading and preparation for a bike path, and a design  of the highway extension that would allow two future bicycling bridges to be  connected to traffic bridges across Oak and Spring canyons.  </P> <P> Some City of San Diego officials have informally endorsed that idea, arguing  that such preliminary development would cost much more if undertaken later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warned of Dangers  </P> <P> "Only the most experienced cyclists would feel comfortable riding on the  shoulders," said Michael Jackson, bicycle coordinator for the City of San  Diego, who warned of the dangers involved in Sandag's proposal and possible  reluctance of bicyclists to use it. "If we don't have a right-of-way and the  grading done now, it's going to be a lot more expensive than $3 million to do  it at a later date."  </P> <P> Getting bikeways around the existing Route 52 west of Santo Road isn't as  pressing, coalition members say. The city plans to build bikeways there in the  future, and bicyclists have access to side streets in the area.  </P> <P> Sandag representatives say the problem is simple: lack of money. "It's a tough  question. It isn't that we don't have sympathy for what they're saying. But we  have to balance the needs of the whole community," said Lois Ewen, vice mayor  of Coronado and chairwoman of Sandag. "With everything else going on, we just  can't afford $3 million for their bottom-line position."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plea Made  </P> <P> Sandag has urged Caltrans, which will orchestrate the construction of the Route  52 extension, to leave room in its design for an isolated bike path in the  future, Ewen said.  </P> <P> But coalition members argue that the issue involves more than budget decisions.  Bicyclists say they have been entitled to a Route 52 path since 1987, when  Sandag garnered support from them for Proposition A, a measure that boosted  local and state taxes, by promising part of its revenues to alternative  transportation programs -- including the building of the path.  </P> <P> "They came to us for support, and we told them what we wanted -- the path along  52," said Reilly. "That's not what we're getting. No bicyclist in his right  mind would have requested to ride on the shoulder of 52."  </P> <P> The conflict stems from differing interpretations of the wording of Proposition  A, which states only that all new highway projects funded with proposition  revenue are required to "include provisions for bicycle use."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Routes  </P> <P> Such a provision can be bicycle routes marked on a roadway by colored signs,  bicycle lanes painted along the side or paths completely independent from the  road, said Jackson.  </P> <P> Sandag officials on Thursday acknowledged the proposal to allow bicyclists to  ride on the shoulder of the road is both the cheapest and least desirable. But  they argued that the commitment promised in Proposition A has been met.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody (involved) was guaranteed their dream project," said  Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who represents the county in Sandag. "From my point  of view, an isolated bicycle way is obviously preferred. But I think it's just  one of those issues that everybody is faced with: You don't always get  everything you want."  </P></p>

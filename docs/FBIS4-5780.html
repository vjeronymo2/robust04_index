			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to  raise from now on the question of North Koreans' human rights at  international organizations, a senior government official said  on Thursday.    The policy comes on heels of the recent government decision  to handle the question of North Korean loggers in Russia from  the approach of humanitarianism, that is, to explore ways to  help them.    "The government is studying ways to grasp the comprehensive  picture of North Koreans' human rights conditions including  those of North Korean loggers in Russia," the official said.    Based on a finding, he said, the government will raise the  issue at relevant United Nations agencies and world human rights  organizations like the Amnesty International.    The official said the government may also in due course take  steps to seek the repatriation of those South Korean fishermen  and airplane crew persons being held in North Korea following  their seizure by the North Koreans.    He further said he understands that a protest rally is being  prepared in Osaka, Japan in connection with the recent missing  of two Japanese women who, along with their Korean husbands, had  moved to North Korea.</p>

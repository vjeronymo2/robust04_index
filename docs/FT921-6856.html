			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wide agenda at first meeting - Northern Ireland MR ALBERT REYNOLDS has his first meeting as Irish prime minister with Mr John Major today amid only faintly optimistic signs that Northern Ireland's political leaders are edging towards restarting 'round-table' negotiations. Prospects for political progress will be high on Downing Street's agenda. Both prime ministers are anxious to promote a dialogue between the two governments to avoid creating a lull in political activity which could encourage terrorists. However, little substantive progress appears to have been made towards resuming the political talks which collapsed last July - a task Mr Major set the province's four main political leaders when he met them two weeks ago. Difficulties remain over how to bridge a possible change of British government. The four leaders are expected to meet at Westminster tomorrow to discuss political progress. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, expressed hope earlier this week that talks could resume before the general election, but the likely choice of April 9 for the contest makes a resumption of formal talks beforehand extremely unlikely. So far only informal political discussions have been held between Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two unionist leaders, Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the cross-community Alliance party. The four are expected to meet Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, in Belfast on Monday to discuss the province's economy as part of government efforts to keep some form of dialogue going. Downing Street said today's topics were 'across the board', and would include the European Community as well as Northern Ireland. In December Mr Major agreed to meet every six months with Mr Charles Haughey, the then Irish prime minister.</p>

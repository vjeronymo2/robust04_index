			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Mexican glass group declines VITRO, the leading Mexican glass company, reported net profits of 197m new pesos (Dollars 65m) in the first quarter, 5.2 per cent less in real terms than the same period last year, writes Damian Fraser. Vitro was mainly affected by higher interest rates on its peso debt, with the cost of financing more than doubling over the year from 64m to 130m new pesos. Operating income reached 343m pesos, 7.2 per cent more in real terms more than the first quarter of 1992, while sales were up 6.6 per cent to 2.57bn pesos. Mr Ernesto Martens, chief executive, said the state of the US glass container market affected the results of Anchor Glass, Vitro's US subsidiary while the glassware operations in Mexico were hit by imports from Asia and Europe.</p>

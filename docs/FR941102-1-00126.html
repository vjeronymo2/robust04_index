			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also is proposing to require broker-dealers who receive payment for routing orders to include information on the confirmation. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(B) would require, for any monetary payment for order flow received, confirmation disclosure of the range of payments received on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(iii)(C) would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, an estimate by the broker-dealer of the range in value of non-monetary compensation on a per share basis. Because it may not be possible to identify immediately after execution which orders are subject to payment for order flow arrangements or the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> value of a specific order, the Commission is proposing to require disclosure of an estimate of the range in value of compensation that may have been received, stated on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(iii) (B) and (C) also would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, a statement that the nature and source of such compensation will be furnished upon written request of the customer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In crafting the proposed amendments, the Commission is mindful of the concern that requiring quantification of monetary but not non-monetary payment for order flow could result in broker-dealers moving toward potentially undisclosed compensatory practices, such as non-monetary payment for order flow. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Thus, it has sought to require disclosure of non-monetary payment for order flow similar to the disclosure requirements established for monetary payment for order flow. This is intended to provide customers with equivalent information to evaluate a broker-dealer's order routing arrangements, and to remove any regulatory disparity between monetary and non-monetary payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters argue that treating monetary and non-monetary payment for order flow differently creates an incentive for dealers to restructure cash payment arrangements into payments in kind.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission invites commenters to address whether the proposed amendments would accomplish these goals, and whether there are other ways to accomplish these goals. The Commission specifically requests comment on the ability of broker-dealers to determine whether a non-monetary payment is in return for order flow, and their ability to estimate the value of the various forms of non-monetary payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Internalized/Affiliate Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3, as adopted, requires broker-dealers who receive payment for order flow to disclose their policies for determining where to route orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers. That Rule would not expressly require broker-dealers to provide information about their order routing policies if instead of receiving payment for order flow in return for routing orders, they simply executed the orders for their own account. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In recent years, multi-service broker-dealers, clearing firms, and others have acquired interests in specialist units, particularly on regional exchanges, although several specialists on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') are affiliated with upstairs firms. These firms then route small customer orders for execution to their affiliated specialist.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (Jan. 1994) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ''), Study II at 9 and Exhibit 29.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recently discussed the potential implications of internalization for the structure of the national market system in the context of proposals by two national securities exchanges to establish or extend marketplace programs that might facilitate internalization practices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34078 (May 18, 1994), 59 FR 27082 (May 25, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;12); 34493 (August 5, 1994), 59 FR 41531 (August 12, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;CSE&hyph;94&hyph;06).

Clegg, Sr., Vice President, Wheat First Securities, Inc., dated November 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex stated that internalization impedes price discovery and makes best execution less likely, and because internalized order flow provides the executing market maker with a dealer spread on every internalized trade, there is little incentive for the dealer to narrow the quoted spread.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amex letter.

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Shimuzu expects Y20bn costs for rationalisation SHIMUZU, the leading Japanese construction group yesterday disclosed its withdrawal from Australian and European markets this year would cost it more than Y20bn (Dollars 160.8m). Earlier this autumn Shimuzu announced it was rationalising its overseas operations which it invested in during the late 1980s, including closing its UK operations. Shimuzu's sudden withdrawal, a rare retreat from overseas markets for a Japanese company, shocked many other Japanese construction companies which are seeking to cut costs in the face of a sustained downturn in the country's economy. Shimuzu said its after-tax profits would for the year to next March would be cut by 55 per cent to Y20bn to cover the costs of liquidating subsidiaries in Europe and Australia. The company reported a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y50bn for the first half to September, on a 1.7 per cent increase in sales to Y921bn. The company blamed a large share of the profits fall on lower interest rates reducing its return on investments. It also recorded a substantial appraisal loss on its securities holdings. Shimuzu's order intake fell by 19 per cent to Y1,115bn. It investment programme will be cut by over 20 per cent from its original plans to about Y20bn. Executives said the government's public works programme, expanded to stimulate the flagging economy, was creating strong demand for civil engineering projects. However, this was more than offset by a sharp fall in orders from the private sector. Kajima, the construction group, reported a sharp increase in bad debts and a cut in interest income was the main reason for a 9.8 per cent cut in first-half pre-tax profits to Y38bn. The company recorded a Y2.3bn deficit on its balance of financial items, after recording a Y5.1bn surplus in financial income in the same period last year. Kajima's sales in the six months to end-September rose by 25 per cent to Y907bn. But its new order intake dropped by 21 per cent to Y1,006bn. The company warned that in the second half profits would be pulled down by a swelling deficit on financial items and low profit margins on large projects. Taisei, the Tokyo-based general contractor, reported an 18.4 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to Y46bn, on a 21 per cent increase in sales to Y886bn. However, new order intake fell by 21 per cent to Y903bn. Obayashi, reported a 26 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to Y16bn, mainly a reflection of its relatively low profits during the same period the year before. Public sector demand was the main reason for a 4.5 per cent increase in sales to Y662bn.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Move from recession in sight, say economists PRIVATE-SECTOR economists yesterday gave tentative support to the government's assertion that the economy will start to move out of recession in the second half of the year. Oxford Economic Forecasting, the research consultancy, and Mr David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank, agreed that a modest recovery would start in the third quarter. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in Washington on Monday that an end to the recession was 'round the corner'. When urged to be more precise, he said it would occur around the end of the second quarter. The Oxford-based economists predicted that gross domestic product over 1991 would fall by 1.8 per cent and manufacturing output by 4.9 per cent. They expected un-employment to reach 2.5m by the end of the year. They also predicted that interest rates would then be down to 10.5 per cent, but added that record levels of corporate indebtedness made prospects for investment 'very bleak'. 'Only housebuilding shows modest signs of recovery in the second half of 1991 as the housing market begins to recover,' the economists said. They added that any upturn would have to come from the personal sector or from overseas. Mr Kern predicted in NatWest's Economic and Financial Outlook that unemployment - now at 2.1m - would rise by a further 700,000 by mid-1992, the deadline for calling an election. The Bank of England's final money-supply data for March were little changed from its provisional data. M0 (mainly notes and coin) rose at an annual 2.7 per cent, and M4 (sterling bank and building society lending) by 9.9 per cent. UK Economic Prospects.

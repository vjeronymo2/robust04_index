			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Row likely over compromise on airline slots THE government is expected to reach a compromise agreement today with other EC countries on regulations to allocate scarce take-off and landing times or 'slots' at congested European airports. The proposals are expected to tighten the rules that provide for an airline to lose a slot if it does not use it. An earlier plan to confiscate slots from dominant carriers at congested airports has been dropped. The compromise is expected to provoke angry reactions from smaller independent carriers such as Virgin Atlantic Airways which want additional slots at London Heathrow, Europe's biggest and most congested airport, to expand their operations. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, said the slot proposals expected to be approved by EC transport ministers were 'perhaps the most anti-competitive piece of legislation ever suggested for an industry which is still rife with anti-competitive practices'. UK officials argued that the new proposals would give smaller airlines and new entrants in the market greater opportunities to secure slots at busy airports, but acknowledged that the UK had been the only EC country to press for new slot regulations as part of the liberalisation of the European air transport market next year. Without a compromise, there would have been little chance of securing an agreement with the other EC countries, the officials indicated. Mr Branson said the tighter 'lose-it-or-use-it' rules would have little effect because large flag carriers were likely to operate slots unprofitably if necessary to keep new competitors out of the market. He has complained to Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, about the declaration that airlines will be entitled to hold on to the slots they operated the previous year. That, Mr Branson said, would legalise the controversial system whereby airlines have automatic rights to slots they have historically held at an airport. It would become even harder for smaller independents such as Virgin to gain slots at busy airports to compete against the big flag carriers. In turn, it would undermine competition and keep fares high, he argued. UK officials insisted that the proposals would not give airlines ownership rights to slots but only entitle them to operate those slots for the duration of the agreement.</p>

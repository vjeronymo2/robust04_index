			<p>BFN     [Text] On 15 June, the government quickly obtained and has  already begun examining a draft of the UN Security Council  resolution for imposing sanctions against the North, which the  U.S. Government has worked out. Kim Chin-sok has this report:    [Begin Kim Chin-sok recording] A draft of the UN Security  Council resolution for imposing sanctions, which the U.S.  Government has worked out, was obtained today by our government.    One high-ranking government official disclosed: We obtained  a draft of the resolution for imposing sanctions against the  North-- which has been approved by U.S. President  Clinton--through the ROK Embassy in the United States this  afternoon and have begun examining it.    According to the official, the content of the draft follows:    First, there will be a one-month grace period before the  imposition of sanctions. This means sanctions will be imposed  unless there is a report that relations between North Korea and  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] have been  completely restored within a month.    Next, sanctions will be imposed in such a way to ban exports  of all kinds of weapons to North Korea, in addition to halting  UN economic, technological, and cultural aid.    This draft is more intense than has been reported by foreign  news reports.    In addition, Russia's proposal to hold an international  conference will be followed if the IAEA reports to the UN  Security Council that North Korea has agreed to completely  cooperate with the IAEA. This means that the proposal is not a  precondition to the imposition of sanctions.    Copies of this draft were also distributed today to China,  Russia, Britain, and France--permanent members of the UN  Security Council--as well as to our government.    The government official explained that since the draft was  worked out, the United States has already had close  consultations with our government, and sent a copy of this draft  to us on a top priority basis.    Of course, there is the possibility that the content of this  draft will be revised to a considerable extent, depending upon  consultations between the United States and the countries  concerned, particularly China and Russia.    The government's policy is to make all diplomatic efforts to  ensure our position is fully reflected in this process. [end  recording]</p>

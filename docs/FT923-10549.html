			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Technology: Betting the farm to construct a network: British Entrepreneurs - Louise Kehoe continues a series profiling risk takers whose 'can do' attitude is yielding dividends Robert Madge freely admits that he knew nothing about computer networking when he formed Madge Networks in 1986. 'But I recognised the business potential of the technology,' he recalled, in the course of an interview at the 200-year-old Buckinghamshire farm that houses Madge Networks' engineering offices. He attributes the success of Madge Networks, which is expected to more than double its 1991 revenues to surpass Dollars 70m this year, to a mix of 'common sense, business sense and good luck'. Focusing on IBM-compatible Token Ring network systems, Madge has developed a range of adapter cards, routing bridges, and cabling hubs ' the critical 'plumbing' elements of computer networks ' as well as software programs that optimise the performance of networks. Madge set about creating his own business after the computer games company that he was working for went into bankruptcy; a setback that only served to harden his determination to be his own boss. It was literally a case of 'betting the farm'. Madge mortgaged his property to fund the new venture , taking on 'considerable personal financial risk' to hire four former colleagues and to develop from scratch products that would compete with International Business Machines' own networking systems. 'Others were concerned about competing with IBM, but we had nothing to lose,' Madge recalls. 'We didn't know how wide our market niche could be, but it was clear that Token Ring technology would be a success.' IBM's endorsement of Token Ring networking, which works on the principle of passing blocks of information or message 'tokens' between computers, all but ensured a large scale market. From the outset, Madge wanted to build an international business. In 1987, slightly more than a year after the UK company was founded, Madge established its US subsidiary, based in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. The decision proved critical to Madge Network's success. 'The US pioneers the use of new technology. Our products were very quickly accepted there and sales went up like a rocket ship. Last year, 40 per cent of Madge sales were in the US.' Madge Networks does not hide its British origins; at trade shows, US guests are given fish and chips and bowler hats. Many customers, however, think of Madge as an American company, he acknowledges. 'That is an advantage.' In international markets, there is a broad perception that US high technology companies are more likely to develop quality products, Madge says. 'US culture has permeated high technology markets in all countries.' It is, he suggests, more difficult for a UK high technology company to sell in France, for example, than it is for a US high technology company. 'The barriers between different countries in Europe are much harder to overcome than those between the US and Europe.' Madge is, however, 'highly sceptical' of European government funded efforts to boost high technology research and development. 'Centralised funding creates overblown bureaucratic organisations,' he complains. 'There is an old boys' network, so most of the funding goes to established companies with large R&amp;D groups, which have very low productivity.' Although EC programs may have been created to stimulate R&amp;D, they 'distract people from being market oriented. There has got to be a market pull for new technology; it cannot be pushed by committees.' Having built businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, Madge is in no doubt that it is 'very considerably harder' to form new ventures in the UK. The small home market is a significant disadvantage for British entrepreneurs, Madge says. Ready access to venture capital also makes life easier for US entrepreneurs, especially those who already have a track record in the industry, Madge suggests. 'In the US, there is usually very little personal risk attached to starting a new company. All that the founders are risking is the loss of their own salary.' However, Madge himself has eschewed venture capital. 'In 1988 we tried to raise venture capital. We got one offer from a British venture capital group, but the valuation that they put on the company was terrible.' Instead, Madge turned to a US technology partner, 3COM, with which it had formed a development alliance. 3COM took a ten per cent stake in Madge Networks, paying 20 times as much for its shares as the venture capitalists were willing to offer. Although the 3COM alliance, which also involved Microsoft, did not live up to expectations, partnerships are now an important part of Madge's business strategy. What's next for Madge? With almost 200 employees world wide, Madge is hiring at a rate of two or three people per month. The company is developing products for faster networks based on fiber distributed data interface technology, as well as broadening its base in PC networking to include UNIX workstations. 'Our goal is to provide the best networking products for large corporations to perform enterprise critical applications. 'We intend to become one of the largest specialised networking equipment companies in the world', Madge insists. The series will continue next week.</p>

Security Life, a wholly owned subsidiary of North American Life Assurance Company, is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979. Security Life is the depositor of the Variable Account. The Variable Account is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust and was established, under Delaware law, to offer certain variable annuity contracts, including the variable contracts described in the application (the ``Contracts''). The Variable Account is divided into sub-accounts which invest in corresponding portfolios of NASL Series Trust (the ``Trust''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. NASL Financial, a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Life, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts. NASL Financial also serves as investment adviser to the Trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Wood Logan, a Connecticut corporation registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act, serves as the exclusive promotional agent for the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Contracts are flexible purchase payment individual deferred variable annuity contracts which will provide for the accumulation of values on a variable basis and the payment of benefits on a fixed or variable basis. The Contracts are designed for use in connection with retirement plans that may or may not qualify for special income tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The minimum initial purchase payment for the Contracts will be $25,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Security Life reserves the right to charge an annual administration fee if the contract value of a Contract drops below $10,000 as the result of a partial withdrawal. In such event, Security Life may, on the last day of each contract year, deduct from the contract value of such Contract an annual administration fee of $30. This annual administration fee may also be deducted under such a Contract if the Contract is surrendered on any date other than a contract anniversary. In addition, Security Life will deduct from the sub-accounts each valuation period an administration charge equal to .25% of the sub-account assets on an annualized basis. These fees are intended to compensate Security Life for the cost of providing administrative services attributable to the Contracts and the operations of the Variable Account and the Company in connection with the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants represent that the fees are based upon Security Life's estimates of the administrative costs for such services over the lifetime of the Contracts, are guaranteed never to be increased, and are not designed or expected to generate a profit. Applicants rely on Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the Act to assess such fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

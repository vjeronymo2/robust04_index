			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ensign takeover results in restructure IVORY &amp; SIME and the Merchant Navy Officer's Pension Fund have entered into a complex restructuring deal, following the takeover of Ensign Trust. MNOPF has bought out the minority shareholding in Ensign, an investment trust managed by Ivory &amp; Sime. The management contract for Ivory &amp; Sime had three years to run. The quoted element of Ensign's portfolio is being transferred to other managers but the unquoted element of about Pounds 61m will continue to be managed by Ivory &amp; Sime. MNOPF is buying out the old management contract at a cost of Pounds 2m, and Ivory &amp; Sime will henceforth manage the unquoted funds for Pounds 400,000 per year. In addition, Ivory &amp; Sime will manage a smaller companies fund on behalf of MNOPF. The initial capital of this fund will be Pounds 12m, but it is expected to rise to Pounds 40m. Meanwhile, Ivory &amp; Sime will buy in 7.2 per cent of its shares, currently owned by Ensign. This will be done at a cost of Pounds 2.4m - effectively using up the proceeds of the contract pay-off - and will enhance earnings per share. Ensign's stake in Ivory &amp; Sime will fall to 18.5 per cent.</p>

Some 756 registered contenders are vying for seats in the  parliament, six to a seat. Three hundred and sixty-one of them  were self-nominated, public associations named 331, and 64 were  nominated by the president.    The most widely represented among the candiates are the  "Popular Unity of Kazakhstan" coalition, the Socialist and  Republican Parties, as well as the Trade Union Federation, the  "Popular Congress of Kazakhstan", and the Peasants Union.    Voting is going on in more than 10,000 polling stations, 6.5  thousand of which are located in rural areas and in shepherds'  winter camps.    According to the public opinion poll conducted by the Giller  Institute ahead of the elections, 62.9 per cent of the voters  and 50.3 per cent of candidates said they favoured private  landownership. 74.8 per cent of the voters and 41.7 per cent of  the candidates said Russian should be given the state language  status in the Republic.    President Nursultan Nazarbayev said at the polling station,  to which he came together with Prime Minister Sergey  Tereshchenko to cast their ballots in the elections, that there  was nothing more important for the Republic at present than "to  adopt laws which could help democratise our young sovereign  state, and encourage economic reforms and the restructuring of  the legal system".    "I hope that the new parliament will be more active than the  previous," the Kazakh presdient said.    There is no uniformity of opinion among the voters.  According to the Giller poll only 25 per cent of them were  planning to vote for the candidates who prioritise the  development of private property and free enterprise, while 66  per cent favoured a tougher state regulation of the economy.</p>

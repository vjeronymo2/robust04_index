			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / ICI emissions were cut by 3.7% last year IMPERIAL Chemical Indus-tries, the international chemicals group, published its worldwide emission figures for the first time yesterday. The move is part of its efforts to be more open about its environmental performance. It said emissions to land, air and water fell 3.7 per cent from 8.6m tonnes in 1990 to 8.3m last year. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said that although there were some problems which would not be speedily resolved, the group had made a good start towards its environmental goals. These include reducing emissions by 50 per cent between 1990 and 1995. Sir Denys said he regretted that the group had been prosecuted 26 times last year for environmental offences, compared with 36 occasions in 1990. The number of prosecutions decreased in every country ICI operates in except the UK. Sir Denys said ICI recognised that it needed to do better. Production of hazardous waste fell 30 per cent from 677.9 tonnes in 1990 to 475.9 tonnes last year. ICI said it aimed to eliminate all off-site disposal of environmentally harmful waste. The amount of hazardous waste disposed of at off-site landfills fell from 160 tonnes in 1990 to 151 tonnes last year. Production of non-hazardous waste fell 1.5 per cent from 7.949bn tonnes in 1990 to 7.834bn tonnes last year. However, the amount of non-hazardous waste disposed of through landfill increased from 3,509 tonnes in 1990 to 3,565. ICI also increased the amount of waste dumped in the North Sea from 150 tonnes to 170 tonnes. Its licence to dump in the North Sea ends early next year. The company said it was committed to reducing its energy consumption, which had fallen by 15 per cent since the early 1970s. Carbon dioxide emissions had also fallen by 15 per cent over the same period. Between 1990 and last year group energy consumption fell by 6 per cent - helped by the group's disposal of 20 businesses last year and a 4 per cent fall in sales. Capital and current expenditure on environmental measures had increased by 10 per cent to 15 per cent since 1987, said the company. The group spent more than Pounds 100m on environmentally-related capital expenditure and more than Pounds 200m on current expenditure last year. ICI said it had asked its most significant manufacturing sites to provide more detailed information about their environmental performance to employees and local communities. According to ICI's annual report, published yesterday, Sir Denys Henderson's salary increased by 11.4 per cent last year from Pounds 448,000 in 1990 to Pounds 499,000. He was not awarded a profit-related bonus in either year. BRITISH AIRWAYS and Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian manufacturing group, are to conduct annual environmental audits to assess the ecological impact of their business activities, Andrew Jack writes. Norsk Hydro's plans involve adding an environmental statement to the annual accounts of its UK subsidiary. The developments follow a detailed report on the parent company's environmental impact published in Norway three years ago. The document is now cited as an example of best practice in 'green' reporting. BA is drafting the first of what it hopes will be an annual environmental report to accompany its annual accounts. It will contain a numerical assessment of the business under six headings: noise, emissions, congestion, waste, tourism and staff involvement in the community.

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: French banks' profits flat THE SLUGGISH state of the French banking sector was yesterday highlighted by flat first-half profits from two banks, Credit du Nord and Banque Francaise de Commerce Exterieur, writes Alice Rawsthorn. Credit du Nord, the retail banking arm of the Paribas financial group, broke even in the first six months of 1992 with a fall in net profits to FFr1.8m (Dollars 330,000) from FFr103.3m in the same period of the previous year. Net banking income rose by 10.7 per cent to FFr3bn and gross profits increased by 14.5 per cent to FFr1bn. However, an increase in provisions from FFr590m to FFr804m ensured that net profits fell. Credit du Nord said it was on course for an increase in profits for the full financial year unless the economic environment deteriorated. Nord-Est, an industrial holding company also owned by Paribas, returned to the black in the first half with a net profit of FFr568m, compared with a loss of FFr25m in the first six months of 1991. Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur held net profits at FFr103m during the first half and said that it anticipated an increase in profits for the full financial year.</p>

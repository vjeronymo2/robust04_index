			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Checking and Frustrating South Korean Puppets' Moves To </F> Develop Nuclear Weapons Called For" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Presidium member Chong  Tu-hwan of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the  Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] released a press  statement Wednesday in connection with the fact that the South  Korean puppets' moves for the development of nuclear weapons  have reached a dangerous stage. He branded the Kim Yong-sam  group's moves for the development of nuclear weapons as a gross  violation of the joint declaration on denuclearisation between  the North and South, a perfidy and treachery to the nation and a  heinous challenge to the DPRK's efforts for denuclearisation and  peace.    Recalling the fact that the Wolsong heavy water reactor  alone  has produced as much spent nuclear fuel containing plutonium as  is capable of manufacturing some 370 nuclear shells, he  continues:    "The Kim Yong-sam group is putting spurs to the development  of nuclear weapons of late. It proves that they have neither  the idea to take hands with the fellow countrymen, nor the will  to solve the reunification question of the country in a peaceful  way. The Kim Yong-sam clique is undisguisedly scheming to  nullify the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation,  openly talking about the `right to possess nuclear weapons.'  This is motivated by their sinister scheme to justify and  legalize their development of nuclear weapons. If their moves  to develop nuclear weapons are not held in check, the whole  nation cannot escape a nuclear holocaust to be entailed  therefrom. All people who are concerned about the future  destiny of the country and the nation, if only a little, must  turn out in the struggle to check and frustrate the puppets'  moves to develop nuclear weapons and overthrow the Kim Yong-sam  group, irrespective of party affiliation, political view and ism  and ideology. "The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately stop  developing nuclear weapons to destroy the nation and at once  step down as unanimously demanded by the South Korean people."</p>

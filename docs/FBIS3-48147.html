Senase] </F>   [Excerpt] Cotabato City -- Suspected communist rebels  torched a passenger bus in Maasim, Sarangani, on Monday after  the bus firm refused to pay "revolutionary tax," police said  yesterday.    Senior Superintendent Jovito Sales, police director for  Central Mindanao, said the bus of the Yellow Bus Line (YBL) was  travelling from Kiamba, Sarangani, to General Santos City when  it was blocked by about a dozen suspected New People's Army  (NPA) guerrillas. Thirty of their comrades served as lookouts  near the highway, police said.    The armed men ordered all passengers to alight and bring  with  them their belongings, witnesses told police.    They then poured gasoline all over the vehicle before  setting  it on fire.    No one was hurt or molested, police said.    Yellow Bus Line plies routes in South Cotabato, Sultan  Kudarat, North Cotabato, Bukidnon and Davao.    Sales said the YBL management, prior to the incident, had  received notes and letters demanding that the company pay  "revolutionary tax" to the communist rebels.

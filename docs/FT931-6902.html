			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: More confident mood helps shares THE LONDON stock market was broadly satisfied with the ICI statement confirming plans for its demerger, and relieved to hear that the planned Pounds 1.3bn rights issue call from Zeneca, the proposed new corporate holder of the pharmaceutical and bio-technology interests, will not arrive until June. Encouraged by a recovery of around 6.6 per cent in ICI shares, the equity market turned firmer, although investors were still restrained by the prospect of further rights issues and profits statements from leading companies. Outside ICI, which made up almost 2 per cent of market activity yesterday, there were few salient features. Trading results from Shell and from British Gas contained no surprises for the stock market and neither share moved far from overnight levels. The heavy job losses foreshadowed by both ICI and British Gas did nothing to lift the shadow cast by the recession in the UK economy, but merely tended to confirm the view that economic recovery is still some way ahead. Equity trading was influenced from the market opening by the looming statement from the ICI boardroom. Shares in the blue chip chemical group had been bought heavily by US investors after London closed on the previous evening, and this development had left UK marketmakers dangerously short of stock; ICI, and the market, rose sharply in the first half hour of official trading, help along by activity in ICI traded options. The early gain of 12 points on the Footsie scale was soon reversed to a fall of 7.6, however, as traders grappled with the heavy flow of corporate statements. The market then recovered steadily, encouraged as the time for Wall Street's opening drew near, by traders' awareness that renewed US demand for ICI shares was in the offing. At the close, the FT-SE Index was just below the day's best at 2,828.7, a net gain of 11.7 points, with ICI effectively responsible for about 3.19 of them. Traders expressed some disappointment with the Footsie's apparent reluctance to move away from the lower end of a trading range which seems to have narrowed to 2,810 - 2,850 this week. Second line stocks drifted off as market attention focused on the day's list of announcements from the blue chip list. At 3,029.5, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 0.4. In terms of market volume, non-Footsie stocks made up about 61 per cent of the day's total of 620.5m shares traded through the Seaq system. On Wednesday, a Seaq total of 592.7m shares returned retail worth of Pounds 1.18bn, maintaining the satisfactory levels of retail business which have now prevailed for the past five months. There were signs that investors were willing to turn away from the defensive sectors which have returned to fashion as rights issue fears have unsettled confidence for the near-term outlook for equities. Utility stocks gave back some of their recent gains. However, financial stocks looked steadier as the market absorbed this week's disclosure of higher debt provisions at National Westminster. Store issues, weakened recently by realisation that further interest rate cuts may have to await the Budget speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer, moved higher. Selected buying of store shares from the US, a somewhat rare occurrence, was reported.</p>

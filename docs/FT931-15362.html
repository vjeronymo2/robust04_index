			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Life after Rio 'DID WE really save the earth at Rio?' asks environmentalist Stanley Johnson in the introduction to The Earth Summit*, the first full compilation of the documents from last year's green jamboree in Brazil. Too soon to say, is the short answer. Rio was certainly not a triumph because it fell short on all its chief aims. On the other hand, it was not a disaster either because it attracted more than 100 heads of government and produced two international treaties. Johnson, who attended the summit and edited this book, argues that it is wrong to blame Rio for failing to achieve the much hoped for 'global bargain' on saving the environment for the simple reason that this bargain was never even on the table. The positions of the various interest groups - the industrial countries, the Third World, the US and the EC - were too far apart to permit agreement. The rich countries could have helped Rio by offering larger financial inducements for poorer countries to co-operate on a global clean-up. On the other hand, nothing could induce the US to lower its opposition to a firm timetable to reduce greenhouse gases, or to the treaty on bio-diversity. The positive result of Rio, Johnson believes, lies in defining terms of the global environment debate, and in initiating a negotiating process. That process will continue and should eventually produce more concrete results, particularly with the arrival of the greener US president. Not that Rio's results were thin, judging, at least, by the contents of this book. Its 500 densely packed pages contain all the major documents from Rio, including the whole of Agenda 21 with its global clean-up plan, providing an essential reference for anyone with an environmental interest. *The Earth Summit.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 22 April, a Foreign Ministry source indicated  that Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen are expected to hold Japanese-U.S. finance  ministerial talks in Washington prior to a meeting of finance  ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven  (G-7) major industrialized nations which is to be held there.  Although a concrete schedule for the Fujii-Bentsen meeting has  not yet been decided on, on 23 April both sides were  coordinating the schedule.    During the meeting with Bentsen, Fujii is expected to  indicate the government's intention to maintain in the future  its basic position on Japan's policies toward foreign countries  and its domestic economic measures, as well on following a  policy accord reached by the ruling coalition parties.  Meanwhile, Bentsen is expected to call for additional economic  pump-priming measures by Japan, claiming that "Japan should make  voluntary efforts to achieve an economic recovery led by the  expansion of domestic demand to lead a world economic recovery."</p>

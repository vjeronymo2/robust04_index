The mass-circulation newspapers Bild and  Hamburg Abendblatt reported that Reinhard Fichte, 47, the director of the  company founded in 1710, had remained in the West after attending a Frankfurt  trade fair. Fichte was also a close adviser to Guenter Mittag, an economist and  member of the East German Communist Party's Politburo, the Hamburg paper  reported. Security officials confirmed that Fichte had decided to remain in the  West, but refused to give further details. Fichte was reportedly one of a few  East German executives allowed to travel freely outside the East Bloc.  </P></p>

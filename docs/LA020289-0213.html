			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL SLURS REMOVED AT LINCOLN HOME SITE  </P> <P> Racial slurs and obscenities spray-painted earlier this week on two buildings  and a fence at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site have been removed,  officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Pink and blue fluorescent paint was sprayed on the carriage house behind  Lincoln's home, an adjacent shed and a white wooden fence behind the shed.  Meters and an air conditioner also were damaged.  </P> <P> Because the damage occurred on federal property, the FBI was investigating,  acting site Supt. Larry Blake said. No arrests have been made.  </P> <P> The Lincoln home, the only house the nation's 16th President ever owned, was  reopened last year after a multimillion-dollar renovation.  </P></p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Party keen to make sure all candidates look like leaders: Runners in the Labour leadership race start to declare The gun has fired for the start of Labour's leadership campaign, but the rules under which the contest will be fought are still not clear. Labour's procedure committee, chaired by Mr David Blunkett, the party chairman, will not set out final guidelines until after nominations close on Thursday. As a result, there is uncertainty about the extent to which the candidates will be able to draw on Labour's publicity machine. Party managers believe that Labour's lead in the opinion polls and its strong performance in Thursday's by-elections reflects, in part, the unofficial campaign waged since John Smith's death. They are keen to make sure that all the candidates look like leaders - especially on television. But the procedure committee has yet to decide how far Labour's highly effective communications department should be involved in leadership events. The most likely approach is that the party's publicity machine will be told to restrict itself to the technical role of assisting candidates to set up meetings and interviews. The issue is complicated by the department's continuing responsibility to help publicise the candidates' shadow-cabinet responsibilities. This means, for example, that it will continue to brief the media on Home Office affairs for Mr Tony Blair, and on employment matters for Mr John Prescott. It is not clear how the department will distinguish between the party role and the leadership aspirations of Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting party leader. The three main candidates are expected to give a series of high-profile interviews over the weekend, , and all are expected to address the annual conference of the GMB general union in Blackpool on Monday night, and the TGWU general union in London on Thursday. Mr Denzil Davies, former shadow defence secretary, could be a fourth surprise candidate, although his ability to attract the 34 nominations he needs remains in doubt. Mr Robin Cook, who had seemed a strong candidate, said yesterday that he would not stand. Without indicating who he would support in the contest, the shadow trade and industry secretary said: 'I believe it is vital for the health of the party that there should be a contest, and it is now clear that there will be a contest. In those circumstances I do not intend to stand myself.'</p>

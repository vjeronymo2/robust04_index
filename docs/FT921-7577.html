			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: OECD chief warns on tied-aid restrictions TOUGH new curbs against abuse of export aid to buy market share in developing countries should not be allowed to reduce the amount of help for deserving cases, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary-general, said the changes, which came into effect on February 15, would have the effect of limiting the use of tied-aid credits for projects normally able to raise commercial finance. The aim was to channel aid to projects useful to development but genuinely unable to raise money elsewhere, to ensure aid money was additional to, rather than competing against, funding on market terms, officials said. 'I urge commercial lenders and export credit insurance agencies to accept this challenge by expanding credits and coverage for commercially attractive projects in developing countries so that total flows of resources to these countries will expand,' Mr Paye said. This reflects OECD fears that banks will not rush in to fill the gap likely to be left now that tied aid is no longer allowed for commercial projects, officials added. The rules also ban use of any tied aid - assistance linked to the purchase of the donor's exports - to better-off developing countries, broadly defined as those with per capita GNP of over Dollars 2,465 in 1990. This includes economies such as Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The ban on aid to commercially-viable projects applies to poorer countries. For the first time, OECD members are allowed to vet each others' aid projects in advance to ensure fair play. The transition has been controversial, as shown by a row between the US and Spain over an attempt by Madrid to rush through two large credit lines for Mexico and Venezuela, before the rules came into effect. Both recipients are theoretically ineligible for aid under the new scheme. Attempts to settle the row have made no clear progress, say officials. Meanwhile, the US Export-Import Bank has rushed through a Dollars 60m (Pounds 34.2m) tied-aid agreement for AT&amp;T switching equipment for Indonesia, which would not qualify for help of this kind under the new rules. This was to show the US was ready to go ahead with such deals if other countries did the same, a bank official said.</p>

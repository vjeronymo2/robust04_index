			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: Moby Dick - Piccadilly Theatre Moby Dick, or Save the Whale as it should be sub-titled, is so extraordinary that you should go and see it at once just in case it fails to catch on. Even if you don't like it, you will hardly regret the experience. Quite the best thing about it is the staging, which has moments of sheer brilliance and uninhibited fun. The Piccadilly is a largish theatre. The stage for Moby Dick has been extended to include what must have been the boxes in the royal and upper circles. Thus the production springs at you from an enveloping semi-circle and does so at three levels: basic stage and the two upper tiers. The fun starts even before the show proper begins. Paper darts are casually launched at the audience from the top reaches of Paul Farnsworth's set. That is nothing, however, compared with the start of Act 2, by which time the audience has been issued with those glasses that used to go with 3D movies in the 1950s. There is then a spectacular show of small fairies, paper darts and other less identifiable objects winging their way towards you, beyond and back again. It may be no more than a brief theatrical device, but it works like magic. There are devices galore throughout, including a growing element of suspense. Is the white whale, which so obsesses Captain Ahab, ever going to appear, and how? It does, but I shall not tell you in what form, save to say that it is a most wonderful coup, mounted even better than the storm that has wracked the stage, and indeed much of the theatre, shortly before. You may have guessed that this is not quite the Moby Dick of the novel. It starts in the girls' academy of St Godley's, which is unashamedly drawn from Ronald Searle's St Trinian's. The school is anarchic to say the least, and going bust. It decides to put on a show in order to raise funds, a musical of Herman Melville's book, which gives free ride to the girls' animal spirits, but also produces the spirit of a team. On first hearing, I had some doubts about the merits of the music by Hereward Kaye and Robert Longden. It does not hang together in the sustained way of the best of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Not all the words of the lyrics are audible. Yet the style becomes catching as the show goes on: the second half is much better than the first and 'Save the Whale' at the end had the first night audience stomping. The undoubted star in a team performance is Tony Monopoly as the headmistress of St Godley's and as Captain Ahab. I'm not sure that all the lines are good enough for him, though 'Obsession isn't just a perfume' certainly is. Watch him singing, wearing large earrings, bouffant hair, a dinner jacket, a long pantalon skirt and a huge cricket pad on his right leg in place of the peg. There is a zest in the production that makes up for any deficiencies in the script. The flair for detail continues even after the show is over. A fleet of red London double-decker buses is waiting outside the theatre to take the girls back to St Godley's. Cameron Mackintosh, producer and impresario, deserves credit for picking the show up. It was performed, in a different version, at the Camden Jazz Festival in 1983. It has been a long haul to get it right: it is not quite right yet; but nearly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "Bluem Rejects Reproach Concerning </F> Dismantling of Social System"]    [Text] Bonn -- Against the votes of the opposition, the  coalition, which holds a majority in the Bundestag, has adopted  the 1994 Employment Promotion Act. It is part of the action  program for increased growth and employment.    The opposition claimed that the law does not deserve this  name because it does not create any new jobs, in spite of 4  million unemployed. It accused the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party of  Germany of dismantling the social system and of neglecting the  interests of the unemployed and of the employees. Labor  Minister Norbert Bluem (CDU) rejected the attacks, stressing  that the Federal Government has built the social system in the  past 10 years because it contributed to the creation of 3  million new jobs. Whereas the Federal Employment Office spent  9.1 billion German marks [DM] for active labor market policy in  1982, this sum has increased to DM54 billion today.    The law provides for the following measures:     -  Basically,  the Federal Employment Office promotes the transition from  unemployment to self-employment during a period of 26 months in  the form of a transitional allowance.    -  The assessment basis for  employment within the job creation scheme is limited to 80  percent of the payment for unpromoted work to make it possible  to include more jobless in the scheme.    -  Private employment  agencies will be permitted throughout Germany. The permission  for private agencies will be granted by the Federal Employment  Office. The permission cannot be denied if reliability, the  required qualification, an orderly financial situation, and  suitable premises are given. The fees must be paid by the  employers.    -  The Employment Promotion Act, which also allows  limited contracts, will be extended until 31 December 2000.    -  The  conversion of payments instead of wages into wage cost subsidies  according to Section 249-H of the Employment Promotion Act,  which have so far only been applicable in eastern Germany, will  be extended to west German regions that are particularly hard  hit by structural crises.    -  Persons who switch from full-time jobs  to part-time jobs will receive payments for full employment for  three years if they lose their jobs.    -  Recipients of unemployment  assistance can be forced for a maximum period of three months to  work as seasonal workers in agriculture and forestry as well as  in the processing of fruits and vegetables. If they work at  least six hours per day, they will receive a seasonal worker  subsidy of DM25 daily in additional to their  wages.    -  Entrepreneurs who employ illegal workers will be excluded  from public orders for a limited period.    -  Workers in training  schemes will receive payment for short-time work in the event of  a loss of working hours.</p>

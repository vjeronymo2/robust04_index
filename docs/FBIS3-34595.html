I wonder if it is the result of catching  one of the mysterious diseases unleashed by the Gulf War, or if  it is a manifestation of early senility.    A few days ago, he came up with what is said to be a  carefully drafted report he will submit to Congress. In this  report, he claims Iraq has continued to produce nuclear weapons.  In his fits of imagination, however, Clinton fails to  substantiate his charges by identifying the place where these  weapons are produced, or mentioning the components of these  weapons allegedly produced by Iraq.    The senility charge against Clinton is substantiated by the  fact that he has begun to see things nobody else sees. He is  urging others to believe claims he himself, before others, knows  to be baseless things, the products of his own imagination.  Otherwise, how could Iraq produce weapons, traces of the  components of which are not found on its territory, as  international experts have acknowledged? There are  international monitoring cameras installed at its plants.  Moreover, there are UN helicopters monitoring banned activities.    Clinton's task is currently confined to anti-Iraq  instigation. This seems to be his personal obsession. Still,  overindulgence in imagination will eventually make him unstable.  He will eventually become a hostage to a chronic disease, to  depression and to allergy to Iraq's recovery, that will be  promoted day in and day out. The end result is that Clinton  will continue to grow weak and shrivel, regardless of the lies  he promotes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon in Barbados, Cuban President Fidel  Castro stated that nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] have  become a powerful force in international politics. Fidel is  participating in the First International Small Island Nations  Conference on Sustainable Development, and met in Bridgetown  with NGO representatives from the Caribbean and Mediterranean  Seas, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. At the beginning of  the colloquy, (Jean Preanch), spokeswoman for the Caribbean  organizations, stressed the support to Cuba that was  demonstrated in the recently concluded NGO summit, which  rejected the U.S. blockade against Cuba.    Fidel applauded the manifestations of support and solidarity  and received tremendous applause from the crowd when he stated:  We feel among you that we are among friends, brothers. This is  why I leave Barbados and this conference very happy.    In his closing statements, Castro stressed the importance of  the Barbados summit for organizing an action strategy to defend  the islands from serious, looming problems such as pollution,  radioactive wastes, and climate changes.    This afternoon, Fidel met behind close doors with the other  15 heads of state in attendance to ratify the final version of  the Barbados Resolution and the action plan that will close the  meeting.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: The Mother Tongue IN THE geography of London theatre, there is an outer triangle of Richmond, Islington and Greenwich, visits to any of which seldom let you down completely. In a decentralised London, these are the places where the best theatre would lie, and sometimes does. But we are not quite there yet, as the new production at Greenwich shows. The Mother Tongue is written by Alan Franks, a journalist on The Times who already has several plays beneath his belt and whose rating is high enough to have secured Prunella Scales for the main part. For about an hour one was inclined to give the piece the benefit of the doubt, and not only because of the slightly scatty and utterly characteristic performance by Ms Scales. Franks has a good theme: the relationship between a mother who thinks she knows best and a daughter who thinks that she knows better, yet can never get her mother out of her hair. There are other family skeletons in the cupboard, and the bedroom. The play starts as comedy. Here is that affectation of modern youth - never speaking properly if it is possible to avoid it. Ms Scales, as mother and grandmother, speaks immaculately, as she always does: 'tea, scones' and what sounds like 'sex', but turns out be 'secs' for second helpings. Of the trend to let it all hang out, she observes: 'Once it has all come out, it can be so very, very difficult to put it back again.' The first half of The Mother Tongue is rather a witty play about the changing use of language. The second half is darker and full of recriminations. The family has a history of steaming open each other's letters. There has been infidelity and kinkiness all round. As a child, daughter Harriet looked through the keyhole at her mother's performance in the bedroom. The widowed mother may have burned her own house in Kensington to collect the insurance money, only to find that the policy had not been renewed. In the end, there is no reconciliation between mother and daughter. It is a pity that such a promising start should degenerate into such melodrama. The play contains lots of good lines and social observation, but becomes stuck between stage comedy and television soap. Gwen Taylor begins as an excellent Harriet, yet is hardly allowed to develop as a character. The rest of the cast, through no fault of their own, are pretty well stooges. There is a very detailed set, designed by Simon Higlett, of the house where Harriet lives, but its function is more to fill up the stage than to add to the play. In short, this is not quite the tops, but it is useful to have Greenwich to try it out and to draw such a cast. It is worth seeing, but not crossing London for. Direction is by Richard Cottrell.

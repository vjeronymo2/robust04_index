			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: How to do Edinburgh - The Edinburgh Festival IT IS 20 years this weekend since first I came to the Edinburgh Festival. If anybody told me now how to 'do' the Festival, I would probably ignore them; but I might well have listened then. So here are some rules of conduct for a young festival-goer to disregard or consider as she/he chooses. Don't specialise. Follow as many different art forms as possible, even if you are already going to be an actor or a musician or a movie critic, even if your interest in one art is your reason for coming to the festival. Who knows one art who only one art knows? Keep up an average of three shows per day: a civilised quantity. You have the rest of the year in which you will go to all too few (and in which to recover). But, if you keep up five per day or more (there are those who do ten), be aware that you do so at the cost of such other important festival pleasures as conversation, friendship, meals, sex and sleep. It is better to eat and sleep between, rather than during, shows. Go to both Official Festival and Fringe events. Yes, some Fringe events are perfectly terrible. So are some Official ones. There are some famous artists on both Fringe and Official sides; some will disappoint. Both Official and Fringe will feature a number of artists you never heard of before; some will thrill, and one or two could change your life. Follow your instinct, and do no more preparatory homework in your choice of shows than you need. There is nothing so eye-opening as taking in a wonderful new (or old) piece where you have no notion what will happen next, or how you are meant to react. 'All knowledge is a fall from the paradise of undifferentiated sensation.' (RP Blackmur). Make a schedule for all you plan to see (allowing time to get from place to place and time to get programmes etc.), and then feel free to improvise around it or revise it. Shape your schedule around your digestion. Yes, of course you can go to 10 events a day if you want - but a rumbling stomach does not go down well during a viola revital at the Queen's Hall, and stomach cramps are not the best condition in which to admire plays about incest. Take time to fit in the non-festival features of Edinburgh - unless you visit the city regularly. It would be silly, for example, to catch all the festival exhibitions but to bypass the permanent collection at the National Gallery of Scotland (which has, as they say, 'one of everything'). Go to several events that you are not sure you will enjoy. (This is easy in Edinburgh.) It is great to find that a show you were looking forward to fulfilled your expectations, but greater to be overwhelmed by a show of which you had no expectations. Even if you have a Fringe mentality, try a few orthodox events. (This is not too easy in '93. Sexual unorthodoxy is particularly to the fore: with incest, prostitutes, gay love, promiscuity and child abuse all receiving their dues. Also transvestism. The only show I have seen about a married couple made a a big deal out of them going to a drag show.) But there are Holbein, and Verdi, and Shakespeare. Don't subordinate your own taste to those of the published critics. Some of them are ninnies, some of them are smart but wrong, some of them are right but dull. The ones to pay attention to are those who, whether or not you agree with them, are in some way or other illuminating. It is useful to read that Wednesday morning's performance of the Schubert E flat major trio was not very good. But if you were hearing that trio for the first time, you had a different experience from the critic, who may have narrowly prescriptive notions on how that trio ought to go. If she/he really tells you how that trio ought to go, fine. If she/he really reveals to you how that trio actually went on Wednesday, even better. But the best thing is simply to listen to the trio. If there is life after Edinburgh, apply the above to that too, where and when possible. If not, not.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Chilly reception for EuroDollar Retail investors have given EuroDollar, the UK's second largest car hire group, which is coming to market through a placing and public offer at 220p, a chilly initial reception. Only 1.41m valid applications were received for the 5.68m shares available under the public offer and employee priority offer by the deadline on Friday. These applications will be satisfied in full. EuroDollar was the subject of a management buy-out from TSB last year. It had earlier been forced to delay issuing its prospectus because of difficult market conditions, and the shares were eventually priced somewhat below earlier estimates. The issue values the group at Pounds 107.9m and is sponsored and fully underwritten by Schroders. It comprises 22.7m shares of which 18.3m are being issued by the company with the remainder sold by existing shareholders. Dealings are set to begin on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA;  </P> <P> THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER;  </P> <P> BEIJING'S NEW TARGET: THE FAX MACHINE  </P> <P> China's apparatus of political repression took aim Sunday at one of the  principal tools of the pro-democracy movement: the fax machine.  </P> <P> Chinese government radio broadcasts monitored by Hong Kong Chinese here  asserted that police and security officials are now sitting by and keeping  watch on all the fax machines inside China. The implication was that any  resident of China who shows up to receive material faxed from Hong Kong or  anywhere else outside China could get into serious political trouble.  </P> <P> For good measure, Chinese radio broadcasts also ordered all citizens to turn in  to authorities all the Hong Kong newspapers they have in their possession. Hong  Kong newspapers should not be found lying around the homes or apartments of  people inside China, the government broadcasts warned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effort to Limit Information  </P> <P> The broadcasts represent the strongest effort yet to limit the information that  the Chinese people receive from outside the country. They also illustrate the  way China's security apparatus is now scrambling to cope with modern technology  as it carries out an old-fashioned political crackdown.  </P> <P> Throughout the past few weeks, many fax machines inside China have been running  virtually non-stop. Residents of Hong Kong, in particular, have been sending in  messages of support, as well as news and copies of foreign press coverage of  the events inside China.  </P> <P> "Fax Saves Lives," says one sticker plastered onto virtually every lamppost in  this politically charged city.  </P> <P> Fax machines at Hong Kong University here are said to have been used to provide  important logistical and organizational support for the pro-democracy movement  inside China when it was at its peak.  </P> <P> From a political standpoint, the advantage of the fax machine is that it is  relatively secure. It is much harder to intercept fax messages than it is to  eavesdrop on telephone calls or to monitor conversations inside a room through  electronic bugs.  </P> <P> Even if Chinese security officials intercept the signal from one fax machine to  another, diplomats say, they would not be able to decipher it unless they are  actually present to take the paper as it comes out of the machine.  </P> <P> That is what the Chinese radio broadcasts suggested that the police are trying  to do.  </P> <P> No one seems to know how many fax machines there are inside China. During the  past few years, many of them have been brought in by private companies,  universities, research institutes and state enterprises.  </P> <P> "The fact that the police say they are monitoring every fax machine in China is  ridiculous," one Western diplomat said here Sunday. "They couldn't possibly  keep track of every fax machine in China every day."  </P> <P> Among the materials most frequently transmitted by facsimile from Hong Kong  into China have been copies of news articles in the Hong Kong press. According  to Sunday's radio broadcasts, these are now considered off-limits to ordinary  Chinese, either in their facsimile form or in their original newsprint  versions.  </P> <P> During the past few weeks, even those Hong Kong newspapers supposedly  controlled by the Chinese government have turned against the regime and  published scathingly critical stories about the events in Beijing.  </P> <P> Since the June 4 massacre in Beijing, the Wen Hui Bao -- which was for decades  one of the leading pro-Communist newspapers in Hong Kong -- has switched the  color of its masthead from red to black. In a June 5 editorial, the newspaper  said that the hard-line faction of the Chinese Communist Party led by Premier  Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun were "thieves" who had completely turned  against the Chinese people.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the newspaper published two front-page pictures of Chinese troops  beating young people.  </P> <P> In the past, the Wen Hui Bao and two other Hong Kong newspapers affiliated with  the Chinese Communist Party were distributed liberally in China. Now, according  to Sunday's radio broadcasts, residents of China are being told not to read  them.  </P> <P> It is not clear what will happen to the newspapers, which are believed to get  financing from the Chinese government.  </P></p>

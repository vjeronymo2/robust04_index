			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Prodi's return to Iri underlines sell-off plans THE APPOINTMENT at the weekend of Professor Romano Prodi as chairman of Iri is being viewed as a strong signal of the Italian government's intention to push ahead with privatisation of the state holding company. The appointment followed the arrest of Iri's chairman, Mr Franco Nobili, on Wednesday on charges of corruption. Mr Luigi Abete, the head of Confindustria, the industrialists' association, welcomed the appointment of Prof Prodi, who resumes the post he left little more than three years go. Mr Abete said it represented clear evidence of a desire to 'accelerate the process of privatisation'. Iri's 1992 losses are believed to be more than L4,200bn (Pounds 1.8bn) and group debts are a staggering L70,000bn. Mr Nobili is still being held in Milan's San Vittore jail as magistrates investigate allegations that he was involved in arranging kick-backs on contracts for two power stations both while he was heading Iri and in his previous role as chief executive of Cogefar, the private construction group. The quick substitution of Mr Nobili bore the stamp of the decisiveness of prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy, who last month was called in under crisis conditions to head the government. Prof Prodi had been a strong front-runner as an independent candidate to head the new government. He was even called to Rome from his native Bologna under the impression he was the next premier. But the Socialist party objected at the last minute to his candidature. Prof Prodi, who is close to the Christian Democrats, headed Iri from 1982 to 1989. Another economist, Prof Franco Reviglio, was brought in to run Eni, the state oil concern and the other large public sector group. Mr Giulio Andreotti, then prime minister, had him replaced by Mr Nobili, marking a return to more politicised management at Iri. A firm believer in slimming down Iri, which accounts for more than 5 per cent of GDP, Prof Prodi was frequently frustrated by political interference. He tried unsuccessfully to privatise SME, the foodstuffs and distribution group, and pushing this sell-off will now be one of his first tasks. Iri desperately needs to raise cash through divestiture to meet pressing financial commitments. Apart from SME, Prof Prodi is expected to turn his immediate attention to the delays in proposals for Iri to move out of banking through the sale of its stake in the commercial banks Credito Italiano and Banca di Roma. The advent of Prof Prodi raises questions about the future role of Mr Michele Tedeschi, the chief executive.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures dip sharply STERLING futures dipped sharply in afternoon trading as the pound tested new lows against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. By the late evening, dealers were again becoming bearish about the currency's predicament, wondering whether it will force a rise in UK base rates in the immediate future. The September short sterling contract was traded 3 basis points down from its previous close, at 89.66, in the morning. But sterling dropped momentarily below DM2.8100 in the afternoon and the contract declined another 3 basis points in heavy trading to close at 89.63. The December contract ended 8 basis points off from its previous close at 89.70. Trade in Euro-Deutschmark futures was also volatile, due to fears of a possible rise in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate. Once again, dealers fear that the German central bank's council, which meets tomorrow, could spring a surprise and lift the emergency rate, especially if call money rises above the Lombard rate level. There is anxiety about the July figure for M3 money supply in Germany, due out tomorrow, which is certain to show the rate of money growth falling outside the Bundesbank's target zone. The September contract in Euro-Deutschmark futures fell 5 basis points on these fears, bottoming out at 90.13 and closing at 90.14. The December contract finished the day down 6 basis points at 90.27. The UK's higher than expected public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 0.6bn had little effect on the market, as the poor state of the government's finances has already been discounted. Instead, trade in the sterling cash market was thin. The Bank of England forecast a small shortage of only Pounds 350m, and dealers said they were content to go on dealing in small sums in the short dates. One-month money closed  1/32 softer on the offered side at 9 31/32 per cent and three-month money was also easier, at 10 7/32 per cent offered from a previous finish of 10 1/4 per cent. The Bank of England did not intervene in the discount market in the morning. In the afternoon, the shortage was revised to Pounds 400m and the Bank bought Pounds 35m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. There was late assistance of Pounds 220m.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15  June.    The government has announced that the Aeropostal airline  will  be put on public bid once again within 90 days. If during this  time it is not privatized, the company will be closed down,  because currently it is producing a loss of about 20 million  bolivars daily. (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT  7 Jun 94)    Gustavo Roosen, presidential commissioner for financial  reform, has reported that of the 750 billion bolivars granted as  financial aid by FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking  Protection Fund], only 30 percent will be recovered, because it  would be unwise to sell the assets of the banks FOGADE is  supporting. If the assets were to be sold, the market would be  flooded with property, thereby hurting the construction sector.  (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 9 Jun 94)    Venezuelan Petroleum Inc. (PDVSA) has reported that the  production of crude is growing at an annual rate of about 7  percent in 1994. PDVSA also indicated that between 1992 and 1994  annual investments of $3.5 billion have been made in this sector  and that 1993 closed without a deficit. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in  Spanish 9 Jun 94 p E-3)    Acting Finance Minister Luis Xavier Grisanti has reported  that fiscal revenues for the 1994 budget have been reestimated  at 1.55 trillion bolivars, representing a 322 billion increase  from last year. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p E-3)    The Finance Ministry has reported that 17.6 billion bolivars  were collected as part of the new Bank Debit Tax debits in the  first month of its application. The ministry also reported that  the financial crisis unleashed by the Banco Latino intervention  has caused uncertainly among the public, which has been  reflected in the exchange rate and caused a demand for dollars  that exceeds the needs of the nation's normal economic  transactions. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 8)    Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce  and Services, has said merchants remain very concerned about the  devaluation of the bolivar and increasing interest rates. Both  factors are prompting higher prices, inflation, a decline in  sales, and a loss of purchasing power, thereby forcing many  merchants to close their shops. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish  10 Jun 94 p 10)    According to estimates diclosed Saturday, the recovery of  petroleum prices in recent weeks will provide for additional  revenues of $242 million for Venezuela. In addition, revenues in  May increased by approximately $120 million. (Paris AFP in  Spanish 1636 GMT 11 Jun 94)    According to Inter-American Development Bank sources,  Venezuela has been granted 50 loans for a total of $3.501  billion, registering disbursements of $1.694 billion to be paid  out in 10 years. Part of this loan will used to construct a  power station with an installed capacity of 2.160 megawatts, and  in which environmental aspects have been taken into account.  (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 2)    An official report today indicated that between 2,500 and  3,000 small and medium-sized industries that have debts of more  than $1 billion risk going bankrupt. The debts of the industries  that provide jobs for approximately 100,000 people is unpayable  by the debtors under the current conditions, according to a  Development Ministry document. The report indicates that massive  bankruptcies could be unleashed, which in turn would increase  the current registered unemployment rate of 22 percent.

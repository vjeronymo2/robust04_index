			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Observer: Business as usual It was the reforms of the new South Africa which allowed the Springboks and the All Blacks to renew their rugby rivalry over the weekend after a gap of 11 years. The day itself, however, was very much an old South Africa affair. The overwhelmingly white crowd of 70,000 took the opportunity to deliver a large raspberry to politically correct sporting administrators who had tried to prevent playing of the national anthem - Die Stem van Suid Afrika (The voice of South Africa) - and displays of the national flag, two symbols with a strong apartheid flavour. Johannesburg's Ellis Park stadium was completely awash with South African flags and twice rose to deliver spontaneous renditions of Die Stem, sung with a gusto the sombre tune seldom enjoys. The second occasion coincided with what was supposed to be a minute of silence for victims of recent political violence in the country. Not surprisingly, an angry ANC is threatening to review its support for Saturday's match against the Wallabies.</p>

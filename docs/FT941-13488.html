			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals analysts very sceptical Analysts at a seminar in London yesterday were very sceptical about the attempts being made to cut aluminium output and their potential impact on the market. 'Unless consumers are given a very clear indication of what is actually going to happen in the way of cuts and they are given specific details about who is going to cut where and when, market sentiment will not change,' said Mr Ted Arnold of Merrill Lynch. Mr Neil Buxton of Metal Bulletin Research suggested annual cuts of 1.5m tonnes were 'totally beyond the industry's reach.' He added: 'I would be very surprised if there can be agreement on cuts of that size.' Mr Simon Hunt of Brook Hunt Associates told the 1994 metals market forecasts seminar, organised by Metal Bulletin and the FutureSource consultancy, that an agreement might be reached but it would not last long. 'We think an agreement will be cobbled together but it will not have teeth and in three months time people will perceive it has no teeth. Meanwhile, the investment funds will drive up prices and producers will say: Why do we have to cut?' There were a number of factors working against an aluminium agreement, he said. European producers were under less pressure because they had been reducing costs and were now probably breaking even at Dollars 1,100 to Dollars 1,150 a tonne compared with last night's unchanged three-month price of Dollars 1,189.50. Also, it was unlikely that Moscow could control the actions of smelters in remote Siberia. And 'not all the world's aluminium producers believe this is the best way to deal with the problem of oversupply.' However, if there was a 10 per cent reduction in world production (excluding Alcoa and Alcan which had already made deep cuts) stocks would fall by 700,000 tonnes this year and by 1.5m tonnes in 1995, Mr Hunt suggested. Without cuts, total industry stocks would rise by 1m tonnes to 6.1m this year and to 6.3m in 1995, compared with annual western demand of about 16m tonnes.</p>

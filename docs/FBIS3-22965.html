			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Feb (MENA)--An Interior Ministry official  source has stated that an initial inspection of the area where  shots were fired at a minibus belonging to the Asyut Cement  Plant in Asyut shows that six bullets were fired at the vehicle  from the front and right sides, and that all of them were  directed at the lower half of the bus. This meant that the  persons who opened fire at the vehicle did not intend to harm  any of the passengers, especially as the passengers were walking  toward the bus and were about 20 meters from it, and no one  attempted to intercept them.    The source explained that some workers had been dismissed  from the plant, and it is possible that they may have carried  out some actions in order to inflict damage on the plant.    The security source said that the Western media have  hastened  in an unprecedented manner to exaggerate the incident and guess  at the identity of the perpetrators. These media did not find  in the minibus anything to satisfy their desire to distort the  state of security and stability in Egypt, so they reported that  it was a tourist bus.    The source called on the Western media to be accurate in  reports that could harm the country's interests. The source  affirmed that the Interior Ministry issues accurate statements  about any incident.</p>

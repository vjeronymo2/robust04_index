			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Severe weather struck more than one region of the country. Snow squalls whipped  by icy winds off Lake Ontario dumped up to 20 inches of snow on parts of  northern New York, producing whiteouts and drifts that brought traffic to a  standstill along a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 81, a major route to Canada.  An unusual storm hit the South, icing over highways and bridges from  Mississippi into the western mountains of North Carolina. That storm followed a  warm spell in which temperatures were up to 20 degrees above the normal 45- to  50-degree range since mid-December along Mississippi's Gulf Coast. A storm from  the Pacific brought snow, freezing rain and strong winds to the West. Winds  gusted to 103 m.p.h. at Boulder, Colo., 79 m.p.h. at Ft. Collins, Colo., and 58  m.p.h. at Casper, Wyo.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, Feb 16 (AFP)--AFP has rejected an Egyptian  Interior Ministry accusation of bias in its coverage of attacks  by Islamic militants.    The ministry had threatened AFP with legal action for not  publishing the government's version of two incidents on  Monday--an attack on a bus carrying Romanian engineers in south  Egypt, and an explosion in a northern town.    The ministry summoned bureau chief David Daure on Tuesday  who  rejected accusations that AFP was giving a lopsided version of  events in its coverage of the Muslim fundamentalist campaign  against the government.    Officials accepted his comments and said they considered the  matter closed.    The bus attack, which caused no injuries, was claimed by the  underground al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah in a statement sent to AFP.    The ministry, in comments carried by AFP, said the attack  was  aimed at the bus company because it had recently laid off staff  and thus had nothing to do with the campaign against foreigners.    In the explosion in the town of Tanta, which wounded seven  people, police originally said it was caused by a bomb, but the  ministry later said it was a leftover wartime shell, which AFP  also reported.    Relations between the government and foreign press have been  strained since fundamentalists launched a campaign two years ago  which has killed 301 people.    The much-publicised campaign has frightened away foreign  tourists, costing the government billions of dollars in lost  revenue.</p>

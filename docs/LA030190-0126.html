			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOMESTIC ISSUES  </P> <P> Today I was watching Congress on TV. (When) Robert Dornan spoke . . . he said  he was disappointed in the previous speakers because they addressed only  domestic issues.  </P> <P> Dornan proceeded to say that this was one of the greatest days in U.S. history  because a democratic government was elected in Nicaragua. He then told Congress  that since the age of 16 he has been a fighter against communism.  </P> <P> I am fortunate to have Ron Packard as my representative. He is also against  communism, but spends most of his time in Congress on domestic issues that he  feels will help this country be better.  </P> <P> LEO FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

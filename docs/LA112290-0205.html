			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ANTI-WAR: As President Bush arrived in the Middle East on Wednesday, student  protests (above) against his gulf actions were under way in South Orange County  (B1). . . . Among the Capistrano Valley High School students on hand was  homecoming queen Lisa Merritt, who worries that war is imminent. "I don't want  to put down the (soldiers) who are in Saudi Arabia because they are just doing  their jobs," said Merritt, 17. "I just don't think our government is doing all  it possibly can to avoid war." Carla Rivera and Anne Michaud  </P></p>

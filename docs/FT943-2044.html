			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 0.4m at Sentry Farming Losses at USM-quoted Sentry Farming Group increased from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 406,000 in the first half of 1994, on a higher turnover of Pounds 2.41m, against Pounds 2.29m. The company pointed out however, that its seasonal business meant that losses would normally be incurred in the build up towards harvest. Mr Nigel Brown, chairman, said weather over the harvest period had been relatively co-operative. 'We are not in for a year of bumper yields but they should be close to those anticipated.' No account was again taken in the interim figures of income due under the Arable Aid Payments Scheme, for which claims had been presented but would not be recoverable until later in 1994. Losses per share were 6.54p (7.65p).</p>
